      "title": "Trim excess material.",
      "content": "Trim excess material. Get rid of any extra leaves, branches, or other foliage growing from the stem with your fingers or a pair of scissors. If desired, clip the stem to a shorter length if it is longer than six inches, but leave at least a half-foot of length. Place the flower(s) well away from direct sunlight once you do so that they do not lose their color. [1] X Research source This method works well for any flower that is partially dry and not prone to wilting. [2] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source It also works particularly well for bouquets."

      "title": "Tie your flowers.",
      "content": "Tie your flowers. If you are bunching several flowers together into one bouquet, use a zip-tie, rubber band, string, or twine to tie the stems together. [3] X Research source Be careful not to bunch too many flowers into one bouquet, since this may crush some or all of them. Tie your knot at the base of the stems so the flowers aren’t crowded together at the top. The bigger the flower’s head, the better it is to dry them individually.

      "title": "Hang them up.",
      "content": "Hang them up. Tie one end of a length of string, twine, or even dental floss to the base of the stem(s). Tie the other end to a hanger. With your flowers hanging upside-down, place the hangers in a room with little or no sunlight or moisture. [5] X Research source Make sure that their placement receives plenty of air circulation to reduce the chance of mold or mildew growing on your flowers. [6] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Individual flowers be hung or laid on top of a drying rack or window-screen. [7] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source In lieu of a hanger, you can also knot the string to form a loop to hang your flowers from a door or cabinet knob."

    {
      "title": "Wait for them to dry.",
      "content": "Wait for them to dry. Give your flowers anywhere from one to three weeks to dry thoroughly. Expect thicker stems and flowers to need the most time. [8] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Check the petals and the base of the stem for signs of moisture. Once they are dry, cut the string or twine from the hanger and mist them with unscented hairspray to preserve their shape."

      "title": "Designate a container for this purpose.",
      "content": "Designate a container for this purpose. Either purchase a covered, microwave-safe container exclusively for this specific purpose, or use one that you do not plan on using for food ever again. Make sure that it is large enough to hold your flower(s). [9] X Research source Trim your stems if necessary so that they fit in the container. This method is better suited for drying flowers individually. It also preserves color and shape very well, so if you would like to keep your rose, tulip, or chrysanthemum looking more or less as is, this method is perfect."

      "title": "Preserve the flower’s form.",
      "content": "Preserve the flower’s form. Coat the bottom of the container with silica beads. Pour enough beads to create a bed that is an inch or two thick. For larger flower heads, pour more silica beads as needed. Set the flower in the beads with the blossoms facing up. Don’t use too many silica beads at once, since this may damage the petals. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Nuke your flower.",
      "content": "Nuke your flower. Leaving the container uncovered, set your flower in the microwave. Run your microwave for two to five minutes at a low heat level. Open the door and check how moist the flower is. Continue to cook the flower at short intervals and inspect the flower in between until it has dried. [11] X Research source The type of microwave and the type of flower will affect how long this will take. For each new type of flower you attempt to dry in the microwave, set aside one as a crash-test dummy to experiment with time and heat levels before nuking the rest. If you are nervous about over-drying your flower at first, set a small bowl or cup of water in the microwave while cooking the flower to slow down the rate of drying.

      "title": "Choose a drying agent.",
      "content": "Choose a drying agent. Go the cheapest route and use fine, dry sand that has been washed and sifted to remove salt, soil, and other coarse material. Or speed up sand’s slow-acting properties by mixing it with borax. Or make the drying process that much faster by eliminating the sand and using a borax/cornmeal mixture. [15] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Sand/borax mixture: 1 part sand to 2 parts borax, with 1 tablespoon of salt added to every quart. Borax/cornmeal mixture: 1 part borax to 1 part cornmeal for fastest results, or 1 part borax to 3 parts cornmeal to reduce the risk of the borax burning your petals."

Set the flower on top of the mixture with the blossoms facing up. If you are drying more than one, allow plenty of room in between each flower so they do not touch.

Be careful not to pour the drying agent directly on top of the flower, since the weight might crush it. Spread the drying agent until the flower is completely covered. If you are drying multiple flowers at once, and if your container is deep enough, you can repeat the whole process and lay more flowers on top of this layer.

    {
      "title": "Wait for the flower to dry.",
      "content": "Wait for the flower to dry. Seal the container once you have buried the flower. Depending on how thick your flower it is, allow anywhere from four days to two weeks for it to dry. Unseal the container every four or five days. Use a fine paint brush to wipe away the drying agent and uncover the flower. Feel the petals and the base of the stems for signs of moisture. Rebury the flower and reseal the container if you find any. [19] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source If you don’t feel any moisture, remove the flower by its stem and gently shake the remaining sand or borax from its petals, using your brush as needed if some crystals are too stubborn to shake loose. If the weight of the drying agent has crushed your petals, use steam to refresh and reshape them."

      "title": "Choose a large, thick book.",
      "content": "Choose a large, thick book. Pick one that is long and wide enough to cover your flower’s head. The more pages it has (and thus weight), the better. However, if all you have are fairly slim books, don’t worry. Just pull several off the shelf, or find a heavy object that can rest on top of the book without sliding off. This method works best for delicate flowers that may lose their petals using other methods."

      "title": "Create a folder for your flower.",
      "content": "Create a folder for your flower. Use a sheet or two of paper towels or some other material that absorbs moisture. Fold it in half. Make sure that each half will cover the flower’s head. This step isn’t strictly necessary, but it will protect your book from moisture damage and staining, as well as reduce the risk of ink bleeding off the page and staining your flower."

      "title": "Place your flower inside.",
      "content": "Place your flower inside. First, set your flower on one half of the folder that you have made. Fold the other half over so that it lightly covers your flower. Open your book at least halfway through, preferably closer to the end. Place your folder on the open page and close the book over it."
