      "content": "Delay the test for as long as possible. Depending on the substance and how much flexibility you have with your testing day, you might be able to wait to test until the drug is out of your system. Check to see what the typical window of detection is for the substance and wait as long as you are able. Some common detection windows include: [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Alcohol: 2 to 96 hours Amphetamines: 3 to 7 days Cocaine: 24 to 96 hours Marijuana: 2 to 84 days Heroin: 48 to 96 hours Opiates: 3 to 7 days PCP: 3 to 14 days"

      "content": "Drink lots of water in the days and weeks leading up to your test. Water helps to flush the substances from your system, but it still takes time. Plan to drink at least eight 8 fl oz (240 mL) glasses of water daily in the weeks leading up to your test to help your body naturally detoxify. [3] X Research source Try carrying a water bottle with you during the day and refill it as needed. Drink extra water on hot days and when you are physically active."

      "title": "Stop using the substance as soon as you know about the test.",
      "content": "Stop using the substance as soon as you know about the test. If you have at least a few days warning, stopping right away may give your body enough time to clear the drugs from your system. Don’t continue to use in the days and weeks leading up to your test. [4] X Research source If you are concerned about withdrawal symptoms, go to a hospital or call your doctor. You may require a supervised medical detox if you cannot go without the substance."

      "content": "Urinate at home on the morning of the test. Your first morning urine will contain the highest concentration of a substance since it has had a chance to build up overnight. Do not go to the testing facility without urinating first! Urinate before you leave the house.

      "content": "Drink at least 24 fl oz (710 mL) of water in the 2 hours before your test. Drinking lots of fluid before a urine test is also known as “washing” and it’s one of the most common techniques for passing a urine test when you don’t have much time to prepare yourself. Start drinking water the morning of your test or at least 2 hours before your test to increase your fluid output and dilute the substances in your urine. [6] X Research source For example, if your drug test is scheduled for 11:00 am, wake up by start drinking water by 9:00 am."

      "content": "Take a B-complex vitamin to color your urine. When you start drinking extra water, your urine will become pale, and this can be a giveaway to the drug testers that you have been drinking an excessive amount of water to dilute your urine. To disguise this fact, take a B-complex vitamin when you start drinking water. This will make your urine look darker and reduce the chances that you’ll be suspected of “washing.” [7] X Research source For example, if you start drinking water at 9:00 am, take a B-complex vitamin at the same time. You can purchase a bottle of B-complex vitamins at a grocery or drug store."

Taking an over-the-counter diuretic a couple of hours before your test might help to dilute your urine by increasing your fluid output. Diuretic pills are available in most drug and grocery stores. [8] X Research source Don’t exceed the recommended dosage! Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for use. Coffee, tea, and cranberry juice also have mild diuretic effects if you don’t want to go out and buy diuretic pills."

Although it’s not foolproof, one study showed that adding a few drops of Visine to urine helped to lower its THC concentration. If you are able to produce your sample in a private room, then you could add a few drops of Visine to the urine after you produce your sample.

Eat a meal or a snack, drink a few cups of water, and swish with mouthwash or more water if you don’t have mouthwash on hand. This will help to get the THC out of your saliva so it won’t show up on a mouth swab test. [11] X Research source"

The 10-panel test checks for everything on the 5-panel test plus benzodiazepines, oxycodone, methadone, barbiturates, and MDMA (aka ecstasy). If the drug you're using is not on the test, then you might be safe.
