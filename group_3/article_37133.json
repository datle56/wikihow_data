Violation of some rules and policies can result in eBay suspending the user's account or even blocking the user's IP address.

If the listing itself is fraudulent and is still active on the site, you can click the link at the bottom of the page that reads \"Report this listing.\" In some cases, the listing may already be closed, or the activity may not be related directly to the listing or the item sold. For example, one common fraud scheme involves contacting a losing bidder on an item and offering them a second chance to buy the same item at a reduced price. The scammer then has his victim send money through a wire service or money transfer company and doesn't follow through with delivery of the item. [2] X Research source If you are a seller on eBay, you also may be the target of fraud on the part of a buyer. A scammer may contact you to purchase an item, offering to send you a check or money order for an amount greater than the sales price. They tell you that you can deposit the payment and send them a check or money order for the difference. Of course the check or money order you deposit is counterfeit, and the scammer has run off with the money and also potentially the item you intended to sell. [3] X Research source"

Since police only investigate complaints that violate state law, studying the elements of criminal fraud in your state can help you figure out what information you need to file a complete report. [7] X Research source Although the specific requirements and wording vary among states, criminal fraud typically includes the same basic elements. Generally, the person must misrepresent an important fact knowing that what they're saying is false, with the intent to deceive you into giving them money or property. [8] X Research source Also keep in mind that you must have suffered some actual loss to be a victim of fraud. If you see a listing and recognize it as fraudulent, you can still report it – but the person typically can't be found guilty of fraud unless someone has actually fallen for their scam.
