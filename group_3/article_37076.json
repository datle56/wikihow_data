      "content": "Shine a bright flashlight into the well head. Here you will make some first conclusions on how to replace your pump. The first thing to notice is how the connection is to the house. It would either be a pitless adapter or a union. The other thing to check is if you have PVC or flex pipe for a water main pipe. The water connection might make it hard to see past it but a hint is white PVC is reflective, black flex pipe is not reflective and dull. My well has a pitless adapter and black flex pipe."

      "content": "Now that we know how to approach this removal, we can gather the tools we need. You will need to make a 5' long \"T\" tool that is 1\" sch 40 pipe 5' long, threaded on both ends, with a T on one end and 2 6\" nipples, and when assembled makes a T. You will also need a 2lb hammer and at least 1 other person to assist you. 2 would be better since the flex pipe could be 200' long and can get hard to handle."

Once the pitless adapter has been removed from the pipe, the person holding the lock cable can then grab the pitless adapter. Then you can remove the \"T\" tool from the pitless adapter. The 3/4\" HP pump that was currently in the hole weights about a total of 60 lbs when it is in water, meaning still deep inside the well tube. [3] X Research source"

You will need 100' area if you have a 100' deep well. If you have a 3rd person, they can assist the first person with pulling out the well pump as it can get tiring for some people. NOTE, the flex pipe will get slippery when you reach water level. The use of rubber grip gloves can be very helpful here, but is not necessary."

      "content": "Once the well pump is out, you can start removing the old pump. You will need to match its specifications for the new pump. There are 2 different models, one with a control box, one without. Other than that, you must match Line Voltage (115 or 230 volt), Hz (50 or 60), Power in HP (horsepower) and Flow in GPM (Gallons Per Minute) or LPM (Liters Per Minute). When purchasing a new submersible pump, please remember how difficult and troublesome the job is and purchase the most reliable, well reviewed pump you can. Losing water because of a cheaper pump could cost you more in the long run."

      "content": "When connecting a new pump, make sure that you have someone electrically knowledgeable or an electrical contractor make the connections. For example, a 230 volt pump with two black wires (two \"hots\") and 1 green wire (\"ground\"). When ready to make the electrical connections, make sure to put the heat shrink plastic onto each wire before making the crimp connections. Getting better crimp connectors than those supplied with your pump would be a good idea. Remember, you don't want to have to remove the pump once it is down in the pipe just because of a bad connection. Once crimped and securely in place, you need to place the heat shrink tubing over the crimp connectors. When in place, you need to add a good amount of heat to the tubing to make it shrink, a match or lighter will not be enough heat. I used a small propane torch. Once heat shrunk, tape the wires to the pipe to keep them from moving freely in the pipe. Add a 1/8\" stainless steel cable to the pump to make removal next time easier. To do this, you will need the amount of water pipe (100' in this example) plus an extra 10' to allow for loops and connection to a lift next time. You will also need 6 stainless steel cable clamps, use 3 at each end. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Before installing the cap, it is best to check to see if you have water. Connect a hose to the hose connection at the bladder tank, turn on, and shut off the water going to the house. Turn the breaker on to the pump. Your water should gurgle, this sound is what happens when air is being pushed around. If you do not have water after 5 minutes; shut off the breaker to the pump. This is not a problem, what you need to do is wait 5 minutes and allow the water that is being pumped up to settle into the pipe and force the air bubbles up. Then after 5 minutes or so, turn the breaker on and you should have good flowing water."
