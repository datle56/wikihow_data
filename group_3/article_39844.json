      "title": "You’ll get better sleep after being out in the sun.",
      "content": "You’ll get better sleep after being out in the sun. When it’s dark, your body makes more melatonin, which helps you fall asleep. To feel more alert during the day, go outside to walk, exercise, or just relax while the sun’s out. Since you spent time outside, you’ll produce more melatonin at night and sleep better once you go to bed.

      "content": "You’ll need to sleep later in the morning to get a full night’s rest. If you follow a consistent sleep schedule, try pushing the time you normally go to bed a little later. Since your body is used to getting a certain number of hours of sleep, it will adjust and be easier to sleep in. [2] X Research source Your body adapts better if you make changes to your sleep schedule gradually. If you change it by more than 2 hours a night, it could be harder to get used to."
