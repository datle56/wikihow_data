      "title": "Lower the gain on your amp, audio interface, or mic.",
      "content": "Lower the gain on your amp, audio interface, or mic. In the vast majority of cases, the gain setting is to blame for static noise. Find the “gain” or “input” knob on your amplifier, interface, or mic. Turn it down 1-2 dB (decibels) and talk into the mic again to see if it helps. Keep adjusting the sound until you find a level where the static noise is completely gone. [1] X Research source Gain is basically how sensitive your microphone is. The higher the gain, the louder the output volume of the microphone will be. If the gain is too high, the microphone will pick up background noise and amplify it into static. There is no “correct” or universal setting when it comes to gain. It all depends on the power of the microphone, the microphone’s diaphragm, and the settings on your amplifier or interface. An audio interface refers to any device that converts audio to a digital signal. If you record music at home, the audio interface is that box that your mic’s XLR cable plugs into."

      "title": "Push your headphones and mic cables in all the way to secure them.",
      "content": "Push your headphones and mic cables in all the way to secure them. Static is often caused by a jack or cable not sitting correctly in its port. Give the cables connecting your mic, headphones, computer, amp, or interface a quick push to make sure they’re plugged in all the way. If one of the cables is jiggling a little, it may need to be replaced to remove the static. Check to make sure the connector isn't bent or damaged. If the static is in your headphones but it’s not present when you speak into the mic or record audio, the headphone jack is faulty. Just get new headphones and the static will go away. If you continually get static or a buzz when using a particular audio cable, the cable itself may be faulty. Try replacing the audio cable."

      "title": "Position the microphone at least 10 ft (3.0 m) away from speakers, amps, or devices.",
      "content": "Position the microphone at least 10 ft (3.0 m) away from speakers, amps, or devices. If you’re speaking into a mic and sending the audio out of an amplifier or speaker at the same time, changing where you stand will remove the feedback. Occasionally, the low- or high-frequency sounds from other electronics can trigger audio static. If there is a phone, TV, or other audio equipment near the microphone, move it. [2] X Research source Feedback is a result of the ambient noise being projected into the air and cycling back through the microphone. This happens over and over again until the resulting sound is the high-pitched feedback that sounds like fingernails on the blackboard. Find out the right distance away from the microphone to record.

      "title": "Hold the mic 1–3 inches (2.5–7.6 cm) from your mouth when you talk.",
      "content": "Hold the mic 1–3 inches (2.5–7.6 cm) from your mouth when you talk. The more space between your mic and your mouth, the more likely the mic is to pick up distorted sound in the air. Move the microphone closer to your lips to see if the static dissipates. [4] X Research source if the audio is too loud when you move the mic closer to your mouth, turn the gain down."

      "title": "Isolate your audio equipment from electrical equipment.",
      "content": "Isolate your audio equipment from electrical equipment. Electrical equipment can cause interference in your audio equipment. Keep all electronic devices away from your microphone and audio cables. This includes computers, power amps, power strips, and electrical wires. You may also want to try plugging your PA or power speakers into another outlet. If you are using a computer, try plugging your mic into a different USB port. Just to clarify, if connecting to a different electrical outlet or USB port works, it's not because your wall outlets or USB ports are bad. It just means the electrical current clashed with something in your microphone or audio device."

      "title": "Add a noise gate to your mic.",
      "content": "Add a noise gate to your mic. You can purchase a stand-alone noise gate for your microphone. Connect your microphone to the noise gate and then connect the noise gate to your PA or power speaker. The noise gate will cut off all audio that drops below a certain volume. Adjust the threshold on your noise gate to adjust the level at which the sound cuts off. Set it so that it is just above the background noise. If you are using a computer, you can add a noise gate effect or plug-in to your DAW . Most DAWs come with a noise gate effect built-in."

      "title": "Purchase a higher-quality microphone.",
      "content": "Purchase a higher-quality microphone. If you are using an inexpensive microphone, you may not get the best sound from it. Try purchasing a higher-quality microphone with sound-cancelling capabilities. If you are using a multi-directional mic, you may want to consider purchasing a parabolic mic that only picks up sound from one direction."

      "title": "Soundproof your room",
      "content": "Soundproof your room if you record audio indoors. If you’re running into static and you record at home, soundproof the room. Either put soundproofing foam all over the walls or insulate the walls and floor with tapestries and carpets. You can also use soundproofing boards or hang curtains along the walls to reduce the sound in the room. [5] X Research source This will reduce the overall ambient sound in the room, which may cut down on the static you’re experiencing. Usually, when you are recording vocals or something like that, you want to minimize reverberations and reflections. So you can record in a closet with a bunch of clothes that can dampen the sound or record with a pop filter. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Turn off any fans or AC units while recording to cut out excess noise.",
      "content": "Turn off any fans or AC units while recording to cut out excess noise. Fans, air conditioning units, and heating vents pump air around your home, and this movement of air may trigger static sounds. The sound they make may also be picked up by the mic. Just shut your air conditioning, heat, or fans off when you’re recording. Don’t run your washer, dryer, or dishwasher, while you record. Keep noises in other rooms to a minimum. A sensitive microphone may pick up small sounds from other rooms, even if you don’t notice them yourself."

      "title": "Put a pop filter on your microphone to remove static from your voice.",
      "content": "Put a pop filter on your microphone to remove static from your voice. A pop filter refers to a small screen that covers your microphone to remove popping and hissing noises from p-, h-, and t-sounds. Buy a pop filter and attach it to the mic stand just below your microphone. Then, adjust the flexible part to place the fabric or metal filter in between your mouth and the mic. [7] X Research source Pop filters will remove any static triggered by the words you say into the mic. If you record outdoors, get a windscreen. This is basically a big sock that goes over the microphone to filter out the sound caused by moving air."

      "title": "Use a DAW to edit your audio and remove static manually.",
      "content": "Use a DAW to edit your audio and remove static manually. DAW is short for digital audio workspace. It refers to any program that edits and records audio. You can use the digital effects that come with most DAWs to edit the static out of your audio—either as you record or after you’ve finished recording. Download a DAW to edit your recorded audio. [8] X Research source Some popular DAWs include FL Studio, Sonus, Ableton, Reaper, and Cubase. There are a handful of solid free options. WaveForm, Cakewalk, Adobe Audition 3, and Audacity are all free. If you have a Mac, GarageBand is a free DAW that comes with your computer."

      "title": "Put a noise gate on the audio to cut any quiet soundwaves triggering static.",
      "content": "Put a noise gate on the audio to cut any quiet soundwaves triggering static. A noise gate is an effect that controls and regulates the volume in a recording. Open the “effects” tab in your DAW and select “gate.” Play the audio and adjust the “threshold” dial until the static disappears. You can achieve a similar effect by turning the “attack” down and increasing the “time” dial. [9] X Research source Some effect panels have a preset called “noise suppression.” If your noise gate has this preset, use that instead. The gate basically looks at an audio clip and trims any sound that’s below your threshold setting. Since static is normally very subtle, it rarely has a loud soundwave. The gate will automatically cut anything below the volume you set the threshold at."

      "title": "Place a hard limiter on the audio if the static is caused by clipping.",
      "content": "Place a hard limiter on the audio if the static is caused by clipping. A hard limiter is an effect that puts a cap on audio volume. If the static is caused by loud sounds, select “hard limiter” in your “effects” tab. Set the threshold to -1 dB or more while playing your audio. This will lower the volume of loud sounds to reduce any crackling noises triggered by high volumes. [10] X Research source This will lower the volume of the recording. You can compensate for the difference by turning up the overall volume of the master recording. A hard limiter is basically the opposite of a gate. It looks at the peaks of each soundwave and checks to see if passes a certain threshold. If the static is caused by loud sounds, the hard limiter will greatly reduce the sound of the static."
