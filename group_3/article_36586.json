      "content": "Measure the watch band to figure out how many links to remove. You want a little breathing room on your wrist, so measure the exact size of your wrist then leave at least 1 extra link in. [1] X Research source To measure : Position the watch on your wrist exactly the way you intend to wear it. [2] X Research source When you are satisfied with the way it is positioned, turn your wrist over so that the watch band clasp side is facing up. Gather the slack in the band and hold the links together to simulate them being removed. Stop gathering the links up when the watch band fits your wrist just the way you like. The number of loose links tells you how many links to take out."

      "content": "Separate the bracelet from the strap if it comes apart. With some metal watch straps, it is necessary to separate the bracelet before you can remove any links. [5] X Research source To do this: Remove the spring bar from the watch strap clasp. To identify which spring bar it is, hold the clasp in your left hand, and it will be the one on the left side. Use the spring bar removal tool or pin pusher to compress the spring bar and lever it out of the clasp. Be careful that it doesn't spring across the room, because this is the only one you have! Note: Cotter pins are the thin rods that run through links to connect them. The vast majority of watches use a cotter pin system as outlined here."

Use the pin pusher or spring bar removal tool to push the pin that secures that particular link, following the direction of the printed arrows on the underside of the metal link. [6] X Research source You should be able to push the pin 2 or 3 mm and then pull it out from the other side using your pair of pliers or by hand. Place the pin in your parts tray, you will need it to put the bracelet back together again."
