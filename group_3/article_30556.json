[4] X Research source Non-pregnant women whose waist circumference is >35 inches (89 cm), and men whose waist circumference is >40 inches (102 cm), are at increased risk of developing obesity-related conditions such as hypertension and adult-onset diabetes. If you are not expecting to be pregnant nor gaining weight, and your waist circumference is growing, contact your doctor. You may be pregnant or experiencing a medical issue."

Your BMI is a ratio of your body height and weight, your “mass.” Your body is made of fat, bones, blood, muscle, and many other tissues that contribute to your weight, and your BMI. Your BMI rating does not directly correlate to your percentage of body fat, but is a way to monitor your size. [8] X Research source Below are listed ranges for medical weight classes for adults. A BMI value of <18.5 is underweight. 18.5 – 24.9 is in the \"normal\" range. 25 – 29.9 is overweight. >30 is considered obese. [9] X Research source A number of extremely muscular, not fat, individuals fall in the overweight category because their muscle weighs so much. Talk to your doctor about what your BMI means for you. If you are not exercising and growing muscle mass but are gaining weight, it is likely that weight is fat. If you are exercising and eating healthily, while gaining weight, it is possible that weight is muscle and only partially fat. If you are losing weight, you are probably losing both muscle and fat."
