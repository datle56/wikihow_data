Many of the directions in the elaborate method will make more sense if you have tried them out with the simple Eiffel Tower."

[2] X Research source In other words, slide your pinkies into the loop from underneath, and then make them straight again.

After the third string is looped, pull your thumbs back out to their normal position, pulling the figure taut while you do.

Grab the string with your teeth and pull it over your thumbs, making sure to go around the string that will stay on your thumbs. Then release your teeth, and pull taut again. If you experienced with making string figures, you can also do this by rotating your thumbs in a circle down toward your palms. As you do this, you will make sure that you are still hooked onto the upper loops while the upper loops are released. Make sure to keep your string figure pretty taut while completing this step. It's important that you don't let loops other than the top ones on your thumbs come off your fingers."
