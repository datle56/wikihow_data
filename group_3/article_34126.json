      "title": "Keep turning the body.",
      "content": "Keep turning the body. When you are taking care of a bedridden individual, make sure you move the body every two hours. You don't have to move him to another room or piece of furniture, but the position should be different enough that the same area of the body is not under pressure. For example, turn the patient from the right side to the left. You can also use a pillow to prop him up. If you are stuck in bed yourself, you can invest in a trapeze bar and reposition yourself. This only works if you are physically strong enough to use such a device. If the patient has certain kinds of injuries, such as those to the spinal cord, make sure he is moved in such a way as to not cause more injury.

      "title": "Cut down on shear.",
      "content": "Cut down on shear. One way that bed sores develop is through pressure on the skin due to sliding. The patient may lose traction when she is elevated, which causes the bedding and the skin to move in opposite directions. For example, the skin of the tailbone may stay in place while the body slides down the bed. The pressure on the skin can cause bed sores over time. When lying down, make sure the bed is not elevated more than 30 degrees as to avoid sliding and friction. If the patient can sit all the way up, this will more than likely not occur.

      "content": "Buy a special mattress. There are special mattresses on the market that can reduce the amount of pressure put on the body. This will help the patient avoid having any one area as a focus of pressure. You can also buy an air-filled or water filled mattress to help reduce the pressure on the patient's body. Look for these at a medical supply store so you can purchase a medical-grade mattress for this purpose. [7] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source If you are unsure on which to buy, ask your doctor for recommendations for the particular situation. You can also use a mattress pad or cushions to help protect the bony areas of the patient. [8] X Research source Cooper, Karen. Treatment of Pressure Ulcers Critical Care Nurse. 2013, 33 (6)"

Typically, the doctor will advise tight gauze moistened with normal saline. The gauze should be removed one to two times daily. This action removes dead skin, which allows healthy tissue to form and the wound to heal. Depending on the size of the ulcer, healing will take around four to six weeks.

Bed sores lead to a decreased quality of life as well as increased mortality and morbidity. [25] X Research source White, E Foy, Chu, Flock, Petra, and Struck, Bryan. Pressure Ulcers in Long-Term Care Clinics in Geriatric Medicine. 2011, 27 (2), 241-258 They are localized injuries to the skin or underlying soft tissue, usually overlying a bony prominence. This includes the bottom, the ankles, the heels, or the hip bones. However, they can occur at the site where a patient is hooked to a ventilator and are constantly rubbed against by the equipment or tubing. They develop due to unrelenting pressure to the area, which blocks the flow of oxygen and nutrients to the affected area, causing cell death. [26] X Research source Cooper, Karen. Treatment of Pressure Ulcers Critical Care Nurse. 2013, 33 (6) This can happen despite a caregiver's best attempt at preventing them. However, some cases develop due to inattention and elder abuse.

      "content": "Recognize the stages of bed sores. The severity of bed sores ranges from stage I to stage IV. The state of the bed sore affects the health of the patient and changes the kind of treatment necessary. [28] X Research source Stage I is when the sore is an area of redness over a bony prominence, that will not turn pale when pressed with your finger. The redness will not go away or get better. [29] X Research source Stage II entails the loss of partial skin thickness to the outermost layer of skin. Often a shallow wound with a pink-red base will occur at the site with a clear fluid filled blister overlying this shallow wound. [30] X Research source Stage III consists of a wound with total loss of the thickness to the outer layer of skin, which cuts into the underlying layer of skin. The wound is not too severe, does not continue into the muscle layers and bone, and the tendons and muscles are not exposed. [31] X Research source Stage IV is when all the outer and inner layers of skin are gone, exposing the underlying muscle layers. The bones, tendons, and muscles may be exposed. If there is no underlying fat in the area, the sores, such as those on the ears or nose that occur from respiratory devices, are classified stage IV as well. [32] X Research source"
