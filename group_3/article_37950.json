      "title": "Wear jeans that are a couple sizes too big.",
      "content": "Wear jeans that are a couple sizes too big. Choose a pair of jeans that are one or two sizes too big for you in the waist. This way, the jeans will have enough extra space to sag lower on the hips but won’t be so big that they fall straight off. If you’re going to be wearing a belt with your jeans, you can buy several sizes up for a baggier fit and tighten the belt to keep the jeans where you want them. [1] X Research source If you’re sagging your jeans without a belt, keep to only an inch or two extra in the waist. Any more and you’ll have difficulty keeping them on."

      "title": "Break the jeans in so that they hang just right.",
      "content": "Break the jeans in so that they hang just right. Put the jeans on and move around in them a little if they’re new or have been washed recently. The more worn-in a pair of jeans feels, the better they will look hanging off the hips. Knead and pull at the waistband and thighs of the jeans by hand if you want, or bend, crouch, and lift your knees high while wearing them to get the jean to better conform to your body. [2] X Research source Some types of jeans like joggers make use of elastic waistbands that gather and bunch around the waist to prevent them from sagging. The scrunchy elastic will ensure that the pants hug the hips while sagging, which will keep them up, but may have a tendency to rest a little higher up. You may spend more time adjusting pants with elastic waistbands."

      "title": "Find the right place for the jeans to sit.",
      "content": "Find the right place for the jeans to sit. Depending on your body type and waist size, the best place for your jeans to rest when sagging will vary. Decide exactly how low you want your jeans to fit. Pull the jeans on and then tug them down a little at a time or let them slouch naturally until they come to rest in a natural, comfortable spot. [3] X Research source [4] X Research source For most people, a few inches below the hip bones, right around the crease of the hips, will work best, because the jeans can sit low while being held up by the contours of the butt and thighs. Remember, you’re trying to look good. Sagging any lower than about the upper thigh will expose your crotch and make you look ridiculous."

    {
      "title": "Tighten your belt.",
      "content": "Tighten your belt. Once your jeans are where you want them below the hips, tighten your belt to cinch the waistband and keep them in place. Your jeans may slide up or down slightly as you walk, but with minor adjustments your belt should hold them at just the right level. Don’t tighten your belt too much or the pants may ride up and stay in place higher than you want them. Try not to sag so low that the waistband of your jeans constricts your movement while walking. Resist the urge to pull your jeans up or down constantly, as this looks less like a cool, effortless slouch and more like you don’t know how to wear clothes that fit you."

      "title": "Show off your underwear.",
      "content": "Show off your underwear. Besides ease and comfort, most of the appeal of sagging jeans is showing off a bit of underwear. This can help project a confident, alluring, sexy look for men and women alike. Pick out some underwear that are especially flattering or eye-catching and sag your jeans low enough to reveal them. Wearing a shirt that is cut a bit short can also help you show more of your underwear—some guys even prefer to tuck their shirt tails into their underwear so they don't get in the way! Bright colors and patterns like plaid look good under sagging jeans because they provide a little visual contrast. Be careful: the dress codes enforced by certain business don’t allow pants to sag excessively, and some states even have laws in place that can hit you with a fine or jail time for wearing pants so low that they expose undergarments.

      "title": "Add another layer to your outfit.",
      "content": "Add another layer to your outfit. Lend some complexity to your look by treating sagging jeans as another layer in your outfit. You already choose your shoes, socks, jeans, shirt and jacket to match; sag enough to show off your underwear for an extra matching layer. Again, choose bold colors, patterns and designs that will match the rest of your clothes but stand out beneath them. You’d be surprised how much a stripe of color or texture can add to an outfit. [6] X Research source Start thinking of your underwear as part of your outfit, rather than beneath it. Buy designs you like that complement the types of clothing you tend to wear. You can also sag to show off the waistband of your underwear if you tend to wear prestigious designer labels. This is an especially popular look with younger male celebrities."

      "content": "Go shirtless. Lose your shirt and let your sag speak for itself when the setting allows. Whether it’s a hot day or you’re looking to inject a little more sex appeal, a shirtless-sagging combination can help you achieve the right look. This is the exact aesthetic that turned a young Mark Wahlberg into a national fashion icon in the early 90s."

      "title": "Sag your shorts or sweatpants.",
      "content": "Sag your shorts or sweatpants. You’re not just limited to sagging jeans. Give your sweatpants or shorts a little slack the next time you’re headed to the gym or playing a game of touch football, or even if you’re just lounging around. Sagging athletic gear will help you put off a playful, sporty appearance—as long as they don’t interfere with your jump shot, you’re good to go! Athletic pants like sweats typically feature elasticized waistbands that will be both an advantage and disadvantage when trying to keep them in the right place."
