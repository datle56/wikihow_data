      "content": "Select a compression level. The level you select determines how much the file will be compressed, which in turn determines the file's new size. The default option, Medium compression , is a good option for files containing images and text. The image quality may reduce a bit to make the file smaller, but the quality will still be pretty good. If you want to make the smallest PDF possible, select High compression . This option will definitely reduce the quality of the file, and images won't look too good. But if you're not concerned about image quality and you need a much smaller file, this is the option for you. Low compression compresses the file by just a small amount, preserving the quality of images and other details. The file size will reduce slightly, but not by much."
