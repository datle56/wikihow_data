      "content": "Beauty marks have various meanings, depending on the time period. While they’re considered beautiful today, beauty marks haven’t always been perceived as attractive. People have embraced them, removed them, and even worn fake beauty spots to fit into society’s standards. Regardless of their reasons, there’s no denying the significance of the beauty mark throughout history: [14] X Research source In Ancient Greece, beauty marks (also known as “olives”) could predict someone’s future. If you had one on the cheek, it indicated luck and prosperity, while one on the throat or back meant premature death. During the Ancient Roman era, people wore fake beauty marks to cover up the scars they received from being enslaved. In Imperial China, face reading (also known as Mian Xiang) was developed to provide insight into someone’s personality and destiny. During the Middle Ages, Europeans associated beauty marks with witchcraft, so many people burned or removed them to avoid persecution. In the 17th century, beauty marks became a fashion statement for the upper class: the French wore fake patches (or “mouches”) to emphasize their social status. During the 18th century, Europeans wore fake beauty marks to conceal their smallpox scars. In the early 20th century, beauty marks became a widespread symbol of attraction and allure. Stars like Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor popularized the dark spot, which has continued to represent aesthetic appeal since then."

      "content": "A beauty mark is a dark spot on the face that’s deemed beautiful by society. It’s a small cluster of pigment-producing skin cells that gives someone a unique or attractive look. While it’s technically the same thing as a mole, a beauty mark is typically considered “beautiful” when it’s dark and solid in color and complements someone’s facial features. [15] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In general, “attractive” beauty marks appear above the upper lip or the upper outer part of the cheek (think: Madonna, Cindy Crawford, and Blake Lively). A beauty mark, mole, and birthmark are all interchangeable, but a dark spot on the body isn’t considered a beauty mark. For example, a mole on your back or arm would just be labeled an ordinary mole."
