      "content": "Fill a glass jar halfway with herbs and fill the rest with 80 proof alcohol. Whether your herbs are dried, fresh, or powdered, add them to a clean glass jar about halfway. Purchase 80 proof alcohol (40% alcohol) and fill the jar up to the top with the alcohol. [1] X Expert Source Erica Docimo, L.Ac., Dipl. O.M. Licensed Acupuncturist & Herbalist Expert Interview. 5 October 2021. Vodka is the recommended choice of alcohol, since it’s colorless, odorless, and generally tasteless. [2] X Research source If you don’t want to use alcohol, try making a tincture from quality apple cider vinegar or glycerin. [3] X Research source Avoid using metallic or plastic containers because these can react with the tincture or leach dangerous chemicals over time. Items such as a Mason jar, a glass bottle with an attached stopper, etc., are ideal for steeping a tincture."

      "content": "Seal the container and store it in a cool, dark area for 1-4 weeks. A cupboard shelf works best. Store the container there for one week to a month to let the tincture macerate , or steep. [4] X Research source Be sure to label the steeping tincture so that you know what it is and the date on which it was made. Keep it out of the reach of children and pets."

      "content": "Use a sieve and a muslin cloth to strain the tincture. Once the steeping time is finished, strain the tincture by placing a muslin cloth across a sieve and putting a large bowl underneath the sieve. Gently pour the steeped tincture through the muslin-lined sieve. The muslin will capture the plant material and let the liquid pass through into the bowl underneath. [5] X Research source Press the herb material with a wooden or bamboo spoon to squeeze out some more liquid, and lastly, twist the muslin to extract any leftover liquid from the herbs. A coffee filter or cheesecloth can be used in place of the muslin cloth."

      "content": "Store your tincture in a dark place for up to 5 years. A cupboard or cellar is an ideal spot. A tincture can have a shelf life of up to 5 years owing to the fact that alcohol is a preservative. [7] X Research source Different herbs may have a shorter shelf life, so be sure you know what ingredients you’re using in your tincture prior to storing. [8] X Expert Source Erica Docimo, L.Ac., Dipl. O.M. Licensed Acupuncturist & Herbalist Expert Interview. 5 October 2021. Bear in mind that herbal treatments can be dangerous if you don't know the properties of the herb and its consequences."

      "content": "Grind 40 grams (1.4 oz) of dried herbs into a fine powder. Use a mortar and pestle, or grind your herbs in your coffee grinder (just be sure there’s no coffee residue in it). Avoid overgrinding the herb: you want it to compact and cake if you press it between your fingers, but you don’t want it to be dense. If it compacts too densely, you’ve overground it; if it’s too crumbly, it’s not ground enough. [9] X Research source The percolation method is more involved and requires specific equipment that the folk method (or maceration method) doesn’t, but it takes much less time to complete—only about 24-48 hours. If you’re using a coffee grinder to grind your herbs, pulse your grinder 2 or 3 times for a second or so each time; this will likely be enough to ensure your herbs are ground to the right consistency."

Then cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap and allow it to sit for an hour. Vodka is the recommended alcohol to use: it’s colorless and scentless and near flavorless.

While your moistened herbs are sitting, set up your 50 millilitres (1.7 fl oz) percolator and position a jar or bottle beneath the percolator’s funnel or neck. Add a clean, dry cotton ball to the percolator so that it’s sitting directly over top of the funnel. Use a small cup or a dropper to dampen the cotton ball with just a few mL of alcohol so that it will seal to the bottom of the percolator, over the funnel. [12] X Research source Use a stirrer or the handle of a long spoon to gently tamp the cotton down inside the percolator. You can buy a lab funnel to make your tincture, or you can create your own by cutting the base off of an empty wine bottle ."

Slowly add your alcohol to the percolator and watch as it drenches the herbs as well as the cotton plug. Once the alcohol has drenched the herbs, tighten the valve so that none of the alcohol drips into your bottle or jar. [14] X Research source The alcohol will take more or less time to dampen your herbs depending on what herbs you’re using and how packed they are. Be sure to leave the valve open as you pour the alcohol in. If the valve is closed, the air coming in from the top of the percolator may cause rivulets to form through the herbs as they soak; an opening in both the top and bottom ensures the herbs will be soaked evenly and form no rivulets."

Open the valve so that it drips about once every 2 or 3 seconds into your jar or bottle. Let it drip until there’s no more alcohol coming out—this may take a few hours.

Different herbs carry different natural healing properties, and a tincture is an easy and effective means of reaping all of an herb’s benefits. Tinctures are simple to make, and they’re also simple to take: they can be administered straight from the dropper, or you can add them to a cup of tea or sparkling water, if the taste of the tincture is too bitter to ingest on its own. [17] X Research source Just make sure to consult a qualified doctor before taking any herbs you’re unfamiliar with. Not every herb is safe to ingest, and the amount you’ll need of a tincture depends on the type of herb and what you’re using it for.
