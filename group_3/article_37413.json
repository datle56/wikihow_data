Before you send a text back, ask yourself, \"Will this help or make things worse?\" [10] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For instance, if your partner texts you saying you did something that upset them, don't send back a long paragraph justifying what you did. Instead, breathe deeply, then reply with something like, \"I'm really sorry that I hurt you. Is there anything I can do to make it better?\" If a friend messages you saying their partner just left them, don't immediately start badmouthing the ex.
