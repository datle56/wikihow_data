      "content": "Many people believe so, but he never wore it in the original game. Mr. Monopoly, also known as Rich Uncle Pennybags and the Monopoly man, is the mascot for the classic board game. If you ask most people who have played the original version of Monopoly if Pennybags wears a monocle, they'll say \"Yes!\" But he's never been depicted wearing a monocle in any US editions of the game. The fact that so many people believe he's always worn a monocle in all Monopoly games may be explained by a false memory phenomenon called the Mandela effect . Hasbro, the company that now licenses Monopoly, has neither confirmed nor denied that Pennybags was ever known for wearing a monocle."

      "content": "The Mandela effect is when a group of people share a false memory. It seems that hundreds or perhaps even thousands of people strongly believe that Mr. Monopoly has always worn a monocle. Because there's no artwork before 1990 showing he wore one in any version of the original game, this belief must be false. For that reason, it's been dubbed a Mandela effect . This is where a large group of people believe in the same false memory. Scientists have been trying to figure out why this psychological phenomenon happens, but they haven't found a definitive answer. [1] X Research source For example, scholars from the University of Chicago tested a theory called schema that the Mandela effect was caused by associations. According to schema theory, people might think Mr. Monopoly has a monocle because they associate monocles with rich, well-dressed men. But that explanation doesn't hold up when you apply it to another famous Mandela effect, the Fruit of the Loom cornucopia . Many people swear that the Fruit of the Loom logo used to feature a cornucopia full of fruit, even though there's no reason to associate fruit with that type of container. Other people theorize that the Mandela effect is caused by learning misleading information after an event, which changes our memories of it. Another is that we live in a multiverse, and the \"false\" memory actually happened in a parallel dimension.

      "content": "Pennybags wears a monocle on the orange banknotes from Monopoly Jr. In 1990, Hasbro released Monopoly Jr. , a simpler version of the original game that was easier for younger children to play. A specific variation of Monopoly Jr. released in Europe came with orange banknotes. Those banknotes are printed with a picture of Rich Uncle Pennybags wearing a monocle (as shown in this Reddit post in r/MandelaEffect ). While the orange banknotes prove that Mr. Monopoly has worn a monocle before, it's important to note that they're present in only one version of Monopoly Jr. More people have played Monopoly , which came out in 1935, than Monopoly Jr. Therefore, it still doesn't explain why so many people (especially in the United States) believe that the character wore a monocle in the original game."

      "content": "He also wears a monocle in an official Monopoly Facebook post from 2016. On May 18, 2016, the official Monopoly Facebook page shared a copyrighted image of Rich Uncle Pennybags holding a gold monocle up to his left eye. The photo caption reads, \"I'm not above accessorizing with my mighty monocle.\" This is more proof that Mr. Monopoly has worn a monocle in official artwork promoting the game. [2] X Research source But it still doesn't explain why thousands of people believed he's always worn a monocle since the game was first released in 1935! The orange banknotes from Monopoly Jr. (the European edition) and the Facebook post appear to be the only examples of official game artwork in which Pennybags wears a monocle."

However, that artwork hasn't been verified by the manufacturer, Hasbro, or any historians. [3] X Research source"

During the film, Carrey's character goes to a party, points out a gentleman wearing a monocle, a mustache, and a tuxedo, and calls him \"Monopoly man.\" This scene may be the reason some people think that Mr. Monopoly wears a monocle. [4] X Research source It's unlikely that everyone who thinks Pennybags wore a monocle has seen Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls , however. So, this theory alone still doesn't fully explain the false memory."

      "content": "One theory says that people are confusing Pennybags with Mr Peanut. Mr. Peanut is the official mascot of the Planters peanuts brand. He's a walking, talking peanut that wears a top hat and carries a cane, just like Pennybags. But he also wears a monocle in all his official artwork, whereas Pennybags doesn't. It's possible that because these two characters have such similar accessories, fans are confusing the two and thinking they both have a monocle!"

The first time was in a European variation of Monopoly Jr. , and the other time was in a Monopoly Facebook post from 2016. Artwork showing Mr. Monopoly wearing a monocle has popped up on social media, but the manufacturer hasn't verified that it's official. Therefore, the false collective belief that the Monopoly man wears a monocle is simply the Mandela effect."
