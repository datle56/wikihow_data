      "content": "Cut around the core. Hold a sharp knife in your dominant hand. Slightly offset the blade from the stem so that you avoid slicing through the core. Try, however, to cut as close to the core as possible. [2] X Research source Once the knife is in place, apply force to push the blade straight down to the cutting board. Slice through all the sides of the apple until only the core remains. [3] X Research source Cut the apple into thirds or quarters â€“ whichever is easiest for you. Quarters will preserve more of the edible apple around the core, but thirds may take slightly less time to cut."

      "title": "Dispose of the core.",
      "content": "Dispose of the core. Compost the core, if possible. [4] X Research source If you don't have access to a compost bin, put the core into the garbage. Feel free to nibble away any remaining apple that clings to the core. Avoid eating the seeds!"

      "content": "Slice the apple. Place the flat side of each large slice face down on the cutting board. Then, use the knife to slice or dice the apple into pieces. You can make thin slices for snacking or baking. Try dicing the apple to mix into salads and other dishes!"

      "content": "Carve the apple into four equal chunks. First, arrange the apple upright on a cutting board. Then, use a sharp knife to cut the fruit in half directly through the core. Finally, slice each of these halves in half along the stem axis. You should have four roughly-equal quarters."

      "title": "Remove the core.",
      "content": "Remove the core. Use your knife to scoop out the seeded portion of each apple slice. To preserve as much as the apple as possible, carve out only the small crescent that encases the seeds. Compost the core, or dispose of it the garbage. [5] X Research source For a slightly quicker method, simply slice off the edge of the apple quarter that includes the core. You might lose some edible apple this way, but you won't need to be so precise. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Slice the quarters into wedges. Place the apple quarter skin-up on the cutting board. Then, slice or dice each apple quarter into pieces of your desired size and shape. For a snack-ready portion, try slicing each quarter into three wedges. [7] X Research source Feel free to eat the apple quarters as they are. You have removed the core and the seeds, so the apple is perfectly edible in this form."
