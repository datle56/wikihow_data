      "title": "Push on your car door.",
      "content": "Push on your car door. Apply pressure by leaning on your frozen door. Push as hard as you can against the door. The pressure could break the ice around the door's seal, enabling you to open the door. This section assumes you can unlock your car, but not open it. If the lock itself is frozen, skip to the section below ."

      "title": "Chip away the ice.",
      "content": "Chip away the ice. If the ice has formed a thick crust, break it off the seal of the door on all sides, and off the handle if necessary. If you don't have an ice scraper, use any stiff plastic object, such as a spatula or credit card. Metal objects may scratch the glass or paint."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour lukewarm water over the rubber seals.",
      "content": "Pour lukewarm water over the rubber seals. Fill a cup, bucket or another container with lukewarm water. Pour the water around the seal of the door to thaw the ice. You may need to repeat this several times if the ice is thick. Once the door is open, dry off the inside of the seal with a towel to prevent re-freezing. Never use hot water, or the temperature difference could shatter your window glass. Even cold water from the hose can do the trick, since it is warmer than the ice. [1] X Research source Car doors most often freeze where the rubber seal is worn or damaged, allowing water to seep in and freeze. If you notice any damage, focus on that area while pouring."

      "title": "Spray on commercial de-icer.",
      "content": "Spray on commercial de-icer. You can find de-icer products at auto shops and hardware stores. These both dissolve the ice, and leave lubricant behind to help prevent further moisture from collecting. In a pinch, you can substitute a homemade mixture: Rubbing alcohol can dissolve ice, but repeated use may damage your rubber gasket. Some varieties of windshield wiper fluid are mostly alcohol, and can serve the same purpose. Diluted white vinegar is a last resort, as it leaves a lingering smell and — according to some — may leave pock marks on the window glass. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Start the car remotely. If you have a remote car starter, use it and let the heat thaw the car door from the inside. This could take up to 10 minutes."

      "title": "Heat the frozen seal with a blow dryer.",
      "content": "Heat the frozen seal with a blow dryer. If you have a battery-operated model or an extension cord long enough to reach your car, this is another DIY way to melt the ice — but potentially a hazardous one. Move the blow dryer constantly back and forth across the door seal. Too much heat in one spot could break the glass, especially if there are existing cracks or chips. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Spray lubricant on the key or lock.",
      "content": "Spray lubricant on the key or lock. This works best if you spray the key, or place a straw against the lock and spray through the straw. You may use any of the following: [4] X Research source Commercial deicer Rubbing alcohol PTFE powder lubricant (best for prevention) Warning: avoid WD40, grease lubricant, and silicone lubricant, which can gum up the lock. Graphite is safe in small quantities. Do not combine multiple lubricants. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Blow warm air into the lock.",
      "content": "Blow warm air into the lock. Place a cardboard toilet paper roll or another cylindrical object over the lock to direct the air. Heat the lock by blowing into the roll with your breath or a blow dryer. [6] X Research source This may take some time."

    {
      "title": "Heat the key.",
      "content": "Heat the key. Only try this if the key is 100% metal and does not contain an electronic chip. Hold the key with thick gloves or tongs, and heat it above a match or lighter. Insert the key into the lock and wait for the ice to thaw."

      "title": "Cover your car.",
      "content": "Cover your car. After parking outside, cover the car with a tarp to keep ice off the doors, locks, and windshield. [7] X Research source Cover the hood as well in extreme weather conditions to prevent more serious malfunction."

      "content": "Wipe a protective product over the rubber seals. It's best to use a special rubber conditioner from an auto shop. [8] X Research source Silicone spray is usually fine, but may damage silicone rubber, so consider checking with the car manufacturer first. Petroleum products and cooking spray are common DIY options, but they can wear down the rubber over time."
