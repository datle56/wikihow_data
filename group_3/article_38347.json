      "title": "Transformation",
      "content": "Transformation Spiritually, scorpions are often associated with change or other transitional periods. There are a couple reasons for this, first being that, since scorpions are often deadly, they call to mind the journey from life into death. But scorpions also molt their skin, suggesting a physical or spiritual change as a person grows into their new self."

      "content": "Fear or danger Perhaps most notably, scorpions are viewed as sources or symbols of great danger. Their signature stingers often hold deadly venom, and their fearsome claws are perfect for snipping at prey and predator alike. It’s no wonder they’re depicted as such formidable creatures in folktales, films, novels, and the like. Scorpion imagery, in dreams or elsewhere, often foretells some sort of peril or threat."

      "content": "Hidden emotions Scorpions are known to be elusive and fairly solitary creatures, hiding under rocks and in various nooks and crannies, waiting to strike.

      "title": "Protection",
      "content": "Protection We might see scorpions as dangerous threats, but from a scorpion’s point of view, they’re merely protecting themselves with the tools they have.

      "title": "Being stung or pinched by a scorpion",
      "content": "Being stung or pinched by a scorpion Scorpion stings are no joke, and suffering one in a dream might indicate that you’re feeling attacked by something in your waking life. It could be that someone is antagonizing you, or that you feel like things aren’t going your way. And if you don’t act quickly to defend or stand up for yourself, you’ll only suffer more attacks. What to do: Communicating effectively is the best way out of this bind. The next time you feel like a target, speak up, explain how and why you feel hurt, and set boundaries so that it doesn’t happen again. That might mean cutting off contact with someone, or just letting them know you won’t tolerate unkind words."

Then, spend a little time with your good friends to remind yourself that you have people who care."

You might be overburdened by responsibilities, or a tumultuous situation has gotten out of your control, and you feel helpless to change it. What to do: If work is wearing you out, talk to your boss about your workload to see if you can’t find some way to manage it better.

      "content": "Scorpion stinging itself Scorpions are immune to their own venom, which makes this dream fairly puzzling. But, like scorpions, just because it’s pointless to try to hurt ourselves doesn’t mean we don’t do it from time to time. You may have been too hard on yourself recently, or even overworking yourself. Your dream may be trying to tell you that it’s time for a much-needed break. What to do: Ask for some time off of work , or dedicate some more time to your hobbies or other interests if you can. Then, meditate to help you reorient and center yourself. Find a quiet place, close your eyes, and breathe deeply for 10-20 minutes to clear your mind."

Halfway across, though, the scorpion stings the frog, and they both drown. If you dream of scorpions in water, then it could mean that you’re sabotaging yourself somehow. Most likely, you’re dwelling on past tragedies or wrongdoings, and the weight of them is dragging you under. It’s time to let go. [6] X Research source What to do: Try to enjoy the moment by writing down 5 things you're grateful for, to bring you back into the present. Then, write down all the things you’ve accomplished in your life so far, big or small, as well as the things you want to accomplish, to remind yourself of where you’ve been and where you’re headed."
