      "content": "The Daily Sequence Octordle has you solve 8 Wordle puzzles one at a time. The standard Octordle has you guess eight 5-letter words in 13 tries and you’re able to solve them in any order. The Daily Sequence Octordle, on the other hand, only allows you to guess 1 word at a time. Once you solve the first 5-letter word, then the clues from previous guesses are revealed for the next word you have to solve. If you’re able to guess all 8 words in 15 tries, then you succeed! [1] X Research source The Daily Sequence updates every day with a new puzzle, and the words are different from the standard daily Octordle."

      "content": "Enter a 5-letter word for your first guess. Just like when you play Wordle , start by typing in any 5-letter word into the first row of empty boxes. Your guess will go into the top line of all 8 sections of the Octordle puzzle even though you’re only solving for the first word. Once you’ve decided on a word, tap \"Enter\" to submit it to the puzzle. [2] X Research source Try to use a unique word where each letter is different so you can quickly rule out possibilities. Words like HOUSE , ROAST , or MULCH are great starting words because they have a variety of common letters."

      "content": "Check the color of each letter to see if you guessed any correctly. After you hit \"Enter,\" the background colors of the letters will change depending on if they’re part of the word and in the right position. [3] X Research source Green tiles mean the letter is correct and in the right position for the current word. Yellow tiles mean the letter is in the current word, but it is not in the correct position. Gray tiles mean the letter is not in the current word. The letters of the on-screen keyboard will also change colors so you can easily track which ones you already used in your guesses."

As you use the information from your previous attempt to rule out letters, type in a different 5-letter word to make your next guess. Keep making guesses for the first word until all the tiles turn green, which means you’ve solved it correctly. When you figure the word out, the “1” above the on-screen keyboard will turn green and have a checkmark to show that you solved it. [4] X Research source Try to use no more than 8 attempts to solve the first word, or else you won’t have enough guesses to solve the rest."

Continue using the information from your previous guesses to deduce the next word and move through the puzzle. If you’re able to solve the 8th word before using all 15 attempts, then you’ve successfully solved the Daily Sequence Octordle! [6] X Research source Take a moment to think through each guess so you don’t accidentally rush and repeat letters you've already used."

      "content": "Use words with different letters for your first 2–3 guesses. Try to pick a starting word that has 5 different letters so you don’t repeat any in your guess. Even if your first guess reveals green or yellow tiles for the current word, guess 1 or 2 more words with letters different from the first. While you can’t see the clues for future words until you reach them in the sequence, guessing a variety of letters early helps rule out a lot of possibilities. [7] X Research source Your first 3 guesses could be words like ROAST , FIEND , and MULCH so you can rule out 15 common letters from the alphabet right away."

Read a new book, play word games like crosswords, or use a word-of-the-day calendar. That way, you’ll be able to recognize words in a Daily Sequence Octordle puzzle you may not have known before.
