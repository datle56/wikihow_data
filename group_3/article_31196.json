[1] X Research source For example, 6 ! {\\displaystyle 6!} is a factorial. Keep in mind that the factorial of 0 (0!) is 1 by convention. There also isn't any definition for the factorial of negative numbers—it's only possible to calculate the factorial of 0 and other positive numbers."

[2] X Research source This means that you extend the sequence of numbers until you get to 1. For example, 6 ! = 6 ( 6 − 1 ) ( 6 − 2 ) ( 6 − 3 ) ( 6 − 4 ) ( 6 − 5 ) = 6 ( 5 ) ( 4 ) ( 3 ) ( 2 ) ( 1 ) {\\displaystyle 6!=6(6-1)(6-2)(6-3)(6-4)(6-5)=6(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)}"

[3] X Research source A quick way to calculate a factorial is to use the x ! {\\displaystyle x!} key on a scientific calculator. First hit the number, then hit the x ! {\\displaystyle x!} key to see the product.
