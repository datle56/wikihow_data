      "content": "Meditate while sitting in a chair. [1] X Expert Source Soken Graf Certified Meditation Coach Expert Interview. 6 March 2020. This is perhaps the simplest meditation pose, as it doesn’t involve any bodily stretching or contortion. Find a chair with a straight back, and sit forward in the seat, with the balls of your feet resting firmly on the floor. [2] X Research source Sitting in a chair is a good method to strengthen your back muscles, which will prepare you for more difficult unsupported positions. If you find that it’s strenuous on your back to sit up straight without assistance, place a few pillows between your back and the back of the chair. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Sit with your back against a wall.",
      "content": "Sit with your back against a wall. The wall will support your back and help you maintain a steady posture. You can sit with your legs crossed beneath you or extended out in front of you. Use whichever pose is more comfortable. [4] X Research source If you don’t have a conveniently located wall, try sitting with your back against a heavy piece of furniture, such as a large bookcase. If it’s uncomfortable to sit directly on the ground, use a pillow or folded blanket."

      "title": "Sit with support under your knees.",
      "content": "Sit with support under your knees. If sitting in a chair feels too stiff, try kneeling directly on the floor, but with support propped under your knees. In this position, you’re still technically sitting (weight on your buttocks), but the knee support will make the pose easier to hold. [5] X Research source To achieve the position, kneel directly on the floor. Then tuck a folded blanket or pillow behind your knees, and then lower your body into a seated position on the folded support. Consider buying a meditation bench, This is a small wooden bench that allows you to kneel on the floor, then sit back and rest your buttocks on the padded seat of the bench. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Begin with the Burmese position.",
      "content": "Begin with the Burmese position. The Burmese position is considered to be the easiest of all unsupported, seated positions, and is great for beginners. To achieve this position, sit flat on the floor, and bend your knees so that your feet are both in front of you. Sit so that the heel of your left foot is touching the top of your right foot (or ankle), but don’t actually cross your legs. [7] X Research source The Burmese position places little strain on your legs, knees, and feet."

      "title": "Try the Quarter Lotus position.",
      "content": "Try the Quarter Lotus position. This is a relatively simple cross-legged pose. To get into the Quarter Lotus, cross your legs in front of you, by keeping your left foot on the floor below your right thigh, and cross your right foot over to rest on your left calf. [8] X Research source If you struggle to achieve this pose initially, try sitting on a small pillow. This will elevate your body and make it easier to fold your legs."

    {
      "title": "Move into the Half Lotus Position.",
      "content": "Move into the Half Lotus Position. As the name suggests, the Half Lotus is similar to the Quarter Lotus pose. Move your body into a Quarter Lotus pose, but cross your right foot so that it rests on top of your left thigh (instead of your left calf). [9] X Research source If this pose becomes difficult to hold, move back into the Quarter Lotus."

To achieve the Full Lotus, begin by sitting in the Half Lotus position so that your right foot is resting on top of your left thigh. Then bring your left foot up over your right leg, and rest your left foot on top of your right thigh. [11] X Research source The Full Lotus is the most symmetrical and stable meditation pose.

      "title": "Lay down to meditate.",
      "content": "Lay down to meditate. Although this is an uncommon position, it’s fine to recline flat on your back in order to mediate. [13] X Research source As long as you can breathe properly, you feel comfortable, and your spine is straight, feel free to practice meditation on your back. If you find it uncomfortable to lay directly on the floor, put down a blanket. Avoid becoming too comfortable while you’re meditating in a reclining pose. You don’t want to fall asleep."

      "title": "Wear comfortable clothing.",
      "content": "Wear comfortable clothing. When you’re meditating, you’ll want to wear something that lets you move and stretch. Comfortable clothing should be loose, made of a soft material, and allow you to move your body around freely without being restrained. Avoid wearing jeans. Yoga pants are a good option, especially when combined with a spandex or acrylic top. Gym shorts or athletic shorts and a cotton t-shirt are a fine option."
