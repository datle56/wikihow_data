      "content": "Fill the clogged sink with 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) of water. Balkan says, “There always has to be water in the sink because the reason a plunger works is water really doesn't compress…You just need water in the sink to create that force.” [1] X Expert Source David Balkan Professional Plumber & CEO of Balkan Sewer & Water Main Expert Interview. 23 February 2021. If the water is not already 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) above the drain, turn on the tap and fill up the sink to this level. The water can be hot or cold, but hot water may help to loosen a clog that is due to grease. If you have a strainer in place, Balkan says to “just put a pair of rubber gloves on and pull it right out” before adding water. [2] X Expert Source David Balkan Professional Plumber & CEO of Balkan Sewer & Water Main Expert Interview. 23 February 2021. Then, remove any visible debris from the drain. [3] X Research source Remove the sink stopper , too. Depending on the type of stopper, just twist and lift it out. Or, detach the stopper’s lift rod from the clevis strap (a vertical metal piece with holes in it under the sink) in order to free the stopper. If you have a dishwasher, use a ​hose pinch clamp to close off the hose going from your sink drain to the dishwasher. Place the clamp as close to the pipe as you can get it. Warning: Never pour drain chemicals into a sink with standing water. They will just sit in the water and produce fumes instead of clearing the clog, which can be dangerous. [4] X Research source Balkan advises that “you never want to put in a chemical drain cleaner and then use a plunger because that will splatter, and commercial chemical drain cleaners can burn.” [5] X Expert Source David Balkan Professional Plumber & CEO of Balkan Sewer & Water Main Expert Interview. 23 February 2021. Warning: If you’re trying to plunge a garbage disposal drain, make sure the disposal is turned off and unplugged to avoid injury."

      "content": "Stuff a wet dishcloth into the other drain or overflow hole in your sink. If you are going to plunge a 2-basin sink, block off the other drain to create enough plunging pressure. Get a rag or dishcloth, wet it, and push it into the drain. If the sink has an overflow hole, shove a wet rag or dishcloth into that hole, too. [6] X Research source You may also try holding the cloth or rag over the drain or overflow hole as you plunge. This will help to ensure that it will not pop out once you begin plunging, but it requires more coordination and can be trickier to do. If you don’t block these other drains or holes, you will just end up plunging dirty water through them without removing the clog."

      "title": "Roll a clean plunger over the affected drain.",
      "content": "Roll a clean plunger over the affected drain. If you only have a toilet plunger, wear gloves and soak it in a bucket of diluted bleach and water to sanitize it, then rinse and fold the extended flange inward to create a flat bottom. [7] X Research source Tilt the plunger and put 1 end against the edge of the drain. Then, roll the plunger around the drain to form a tight seal. Make sure the entire drain is covered. [8] X Research source If you can't see through the water, plunge up and down a few times to see if the plunger is making contact with the drain. You'll feel resistance if the plunger is positioned properly. If not, then there will be no resistance. Balkan says, “There are toilet plungers and there are sink plungers. A homeowner should really have one of each. Never confuse the two because one is going to be very unsanitary, and one not so much.” [9] X Expert Source David Balkan Professional Plumber & CEO of Balkan Sewer & Water Main Expert Interview. 23 February 2021. Sink plungers are flat on the bottom, while toilet plungers have an extended flange designed to fit into toilet bowls. Tip: Put on protective eyewear, an old t-shirt, and rubber gloves before plunging to protect yourself from dirty splashback."

      "content": "Plunge straight up and down for 20 seconds, or 10–12 full plunges. Hold the plunger handle about 6 in (15 cm) from the top with one or both hands. Press the plunger up and down over the drain vigorously for about 20 seconds. [10] X Research source Do not tilt the plunger as you do this or you may lose suction."

      "content": "Pop the plunger straight up and off the drain to create extra pressure. After 20 seconds of plunging, pull the plunger straight up and off of the drain to remove it. You may hear a “pop” as you do this, which is due to the pressure from the plunger and may help to loosen the clog. Do not roll the plunger off of the drain as you did when you put it on. Check to see if the water drains and plunge up to 5 more times if needed. If the clog is loose, the water should flow freely down the drain. If the clog is still in place, the water will remain standing or it may trickle very slowly."

      "content": "Remove and clean the P-trap. A P-trap is the curved portion of pipe under the sink. It holds water to act as a seal that blocks sewer fumes from entering your home through the drain. [11] X Research source According to Balkan, “the trap can be taken off with typical household tools and just dumped out and reattached in a matter of minutes.” [12] X Expert Source David Balkan Professional Plumber & CEO of Balkan Sewer & Water Main Expert Interview. 23 February 2021. To clean the P-trap : Place a bucket beneath the pipes and use a pipe wrench to remove the ring nuts holding it in place. The water that’s in your sink will splash into your bucket. [13] X Research source Clear any blockages from the P-trap with a long and flexible brush (or even a straightened wire hanger) before reattaching it."

      "content": "Try using a drain snake or auger to remove stubborn clogs. These long, flexible tools hook and break up clogs that are potentially deep in your pipes (like behind the wall). Carefully guide the flexible end of the auger through the drain and pipe, being careful not to use excessive force. When you hit a blockage, start turning the handle on the snake or auger to break up the clog and pull it out of the drain. [14] X Research source Check the instructions for your specific snake or auger before using it. Balkan advises contacting a professional if your clog needs a snake. “Frequently, people take a snake and they puncture a trap or they go through a drain line and they need a repair [if] they don't know how to properly handle it. It can get stuck in the drain line and not be able to be removed. And frequently, a snake is not even the proper means to clear a clog sometimes.” [15] X Expert Source David Balkan Professional Plumber & CEO of Balkan Sewer & Water Main Expert Interview. 23 February 2021."

      "content": "Try using a natural drain clearing mixture before harsh chemicals. Bail any standing water out of the sink (or use a wet/dry vac) and pout 1 cup (272 g) of baking soda directly down the drain. Pour 1 cup (237) mL of vinegar down the drain, then close or insert the stopper to direct the fizzy reaction toward the clog. Wait 15 minutes, then remove the stopper and run hot water to flush out the drain. [16] X Research source If that doesn’t work, you can try a commercial chemical clog remover. However, this should be a last resort as these cleaners are toxic, not eco-friendly, and can corrode your plumbing. In most cases, chemical decloggers won’t be necessary. Balkan says, “Frequently, there's no reason to get involved with chemical drain cleaners.” [17] X Expert Source David Balkan Professional Plumber & CEO of Balkan Sewer & Water Main Expert Interview. 23 February 2021."
