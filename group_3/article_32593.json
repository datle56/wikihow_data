      "content": "Put on a pretty set of underwear or lingerie underneath your clothes. Style expert Elle Monus says to balance your body, for example, “if you are top heavy and that is something that you want to enhance for your partner, you can toss on a pretty bra or corset that enhances your butt.” Think “sexy,” like a matching lace bra and underwear or a sheer bodysuit. Choose pieces that flatter your figure and show off your best assets. For example, if you love your back but aren’t a fan of your belly, wear a teddy that dips low in the back and provides coverage in the front over your midsection. Men might select a pair of silk boxer briefs in a slightly see-through black."

      "content": "Dress in clothes that are comfortable and easy to take off. Your outerwear is the least important part of your striptease. You want something that you feel good in and that you can remove without much trouble. Boudoir photographer Reina LeGrand encourages you to pick something that makes you feel confident and powerful, like a “big, poofy, luxurious, bougie robe.” Or, pick a slip dress or a sheer blouse with a stretchy skirt, for example. Men might wear well-fitting jeans and a sleeveless shirt, or even go for a silky robe . Stay away from anything super tight that would restrict your movement, like skinny jeans, or clothes in a scratchy fabric that could irritate your partner if you dance against them. Avoid lots of layers. You don’t want to be spending a lot of time taking off a sweater, blouse, and tank top."

      "content": "Consider wearing sky-high stilettos that elongate your legs. Heels not only add extra sex appeal to your striptease, they also make your hips sway more when you walk and slim your legs. Pick a pair that matches your lingerie or opt for classic black peep-toes. [1] X Research source Or go barefoot for a more natural and relaxed vibe. Make sure you can walk in your heels beforehand. Stilettos lose their flair if you’re stumbling around. If you buy new shoes for the striptease, break them in by wearing them around the house with thick socks. It will stretch out the shoes so they aren’t too tight on your feet. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear your hair in a tousled, bedhead style. The mussed, woke-up-like-this look is very effortless yet sensual at the same time. [3] X Research source If you’re a man, simply run some mousse through your hair. If you’re a woman, style your hair in long, loose waves or a messy bun , with a few face-framing tendrils. Spritz some texturizing spray or sea salt spray on your hair to hold tousled curls better. A bun is a fun option for a striptease because you can unpin it while you dance so your hair falls onto your shoulders."

      "content": "Play up either your eyes or lips with makeup if you want extra drama. The best bedroom makeup is a dark, smokey eye or a bold, red lip . Don’t do both though, or you’ll look overdone. Choose one, then keep the rest of your face neutral. [4] X Research source For example, if you want a dramatic eye, brush deep brown eyeshadow on your lids, line them with black eyeliner , and pile dark mascara on both your upper and lower lashes. Pair it with a nude lipstick. [5] X Research source If you want to draw attention to your pout, try a lip plumper or a plumping gloss, which will make your lips appear fuller."

      "content": "Dim the lights to create a romantic mood. Low lighting is also much more flattering than bright overhead lighting. If your switches have dimmers, use those to darken the room. Otherwise, turn on a table lamp or plug in a nightlight for less harsh light. [6] X Research source Candles can also create a soft glow that’s perfect for a sensual striptease. Just be careful they’re out of the way so you don’t accidentally toss your clothes on top of them."

      "content": "Set up a chair and any other props you might need. Choose a room where you’ll have enough space and place the chair in the center of the room so you can move around your partner. Gather things like a silk scarf, rope, handcuffs, or anything else you want for your performance so you don’t have to interrupt your show later on. Any type of chair will work, but one without arms is best so you can dance on your partner easily. A chair that has a back will be more comfortable for your partner. They'll be able to lean back to watch you."

      "content": "Turn on slow music that will match the rhythm of your dancing. Sexy R&B music is popular for stripteases because the beat is easy to move your hips to. Most of all, pick something that you feel sexy listening to and gets you in the right mindset. Jazz or even low ambient music can go a long way, too.

      "content": "Ask your partner to sit in the chair and gently tie their hands behind it. Part of what makes a striptease so fun is the “tease” aspect. Use a silk scarf or rope to loosely secure your partner’s hands behind the chair so they can’t touch you while you dance. You might even surprise your partner by leading them to the chair while they’re going about their day—a little spontaneity is sexy! [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Or use handcuffs with a soft lining that won’t hurt your partner’s wrists. Don’t tie their hands too tightly or they’ll be in pain instead of enjoying your performance. Slowly walk around the chair once they’re seated, running your hands all over them to set the mood."

      "content": "Run your hands over your body as you sway your hips in smooth circles. Keep in mind that your partner’s eyes will go wherever your hands go. Keep your hips moving the entire time, rubbing your hands up and down your sides and even across your front. Dance instructor Yolanda Thomas says to let the music take the lead, and don’t worry about making mistakes. Your partner is more focused on your body than how good your moves are! Slowly swing your hips in the shape of a figure 8, or put your foot between your partner’s legs for some really steamy moves. If you aren’t sure where to put your hands, imagine if your partner were touching you. Where would their hands be? Put yours there. Practice your dance moves in the mirror before you try them out on your partner so you feel confident and comfortable."

      "content": "Let loose to stay confident and relaxed. Thomas says the key to any good dance is “being open and showing everything of yourself.” It’s a striptease! Don’t take it too seriously, but also commit to it 100%. The more you’re having fun, the sexier you’ll look, and the more fun your partner will have, too. Remember: it’s just the two of you, so there’s no need to be nervous. Acting shy and coy can be sexy, but balance it with confidence and dominance."

      "content": "Keep a sexy facial expression, including eye contact, as you dance. Thomas says to “let go and really get into it,” and your facial expression will follow. While you dance, look into your partner’s eyes to make it much more intimate. Keep your lips slightly parted, and toss in a playful smirk every so often. After all, you know what you’re doing to them, and having that power is fun!! Bite your lip occasionally while gazing at your partner for an extra seductive touch. Every so often, drag your eyes away for a few seconds before flicking them back to your partner. You don’t need to stare directly at them the entire time."

      "content": "Remove your clothes one piece at a time, teasing with peeks of skin. The trick to a good striptease is taking off your clothes very slowly. If you’re wearing a shirt with buttons, unhook it button by button. Then slide your skirt down your legs, shimmying your hips as it falls. Take a moment to show off each new part of your body as you reveal it. [9] X Research source If you’re wearing a dress or a top with straps, slip the straps off before sensually pulling the garment over your head. You can also start to remove your top by pushing it down your shoulder, then pulling it back up for extra teasing. The longer it takes for you to undress, the more effective the striptease is at turning your partner on."

Leave your shoes off for the rest of the dance or slip them back on after taking off your stockings."

      "content": "Turn away from your partner to take off your bra. Start by undoing the clasp, one hook at a time, with your back facing them. Slip the straps down your shoulders, then remove the bra completely. Let it dangle from your fingertips before dropping it to the ground. You might extend the fun at this point by giving your partner a lap dance before you’re totally nude. [11] X Research source Push 1 strap off, then the other, instead of both at the same to draw it out if you want. Lightly toss the bra over your shoulder so it lands by their feet. Then glance back at them, biting your lip, to see just how excited they are."

Repeat on the other side, fingering the waistband, before you actually remove your panties. Gracefully kick the underwear off with your foot or reach down to grab it and toss it onto your partner’s lap. You can do this either facing your partner or with your back to them."

      "content": "A striptease is a sensual dance that involves taking off your clothes. Sometimes, it’s done as foreplay, or to spice up your time in the bedroom. [13] X Research source It doesn’t have to be about sex, though—many people do stripteases in the mirror or for an audience (like in burlesque dance) as a way to exercise, feel empowered, or just have fun. Often, stripteases are visual, and don’t involve touching the dancer, but it depends on what you and your partner want. What makes a striptease special is the performance and the “tease.” It’s not just about tearing off your clothes as quickly as you can."
