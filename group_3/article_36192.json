      "content": "Check the care label. Couches are made of many different materials, and while some can be cleaned safely with water, others require special cleaning solutions. Look for the letter code W, S, SW, or X on your upholstery tag to determine if you can clean your couch yourself or if you’ll need to have it professionally cleaned. [1] X Research source W, S, and SW mean you can clean the couch with water- or solvent-based cleaners. X means you can't clean the couch with water or solvents, so you'll have to take it to a professional to clean the blood."

      "title": "Soak up or brush away excess blood.",
      "content": "Soak up or brush away excess blood. If the stain is fresh, soak up as much blood as possible with a clean, dry towel. If the blood has dried, use a soft-bristled toothbrush or dull knife to gently scrub and scrape the area and loosen as much blood as you can from the material’s surface. This will make the stain easier to clean. After brushing, wipe the area with a dry cloth to remove flakes of dried blood. [2] X Research source Before you begin cleaning the blood stain, make sure to put on a pair of cleaning gloves. This will help protect you from any blood-borne illnesses if the blood isn’t yours. In general, fresh and dried blood stains can be removed the same way. However, it is much easier to clean blood when it’s fresh. The older the stain, the more difficult it is to remove."

      "content": "Blot the stain with cold water. Dampen a clean, white cloth or sponge with cold water, then wring out the excess. Dab the stain with the cloth or sponge to saturate the area. Only use cold water to blot the couch, as hot water can set the stain and make it more difficult, or even impossible, to remove. [3] X Research source Then, use a fresh, dry cloth to blot the area dry and remove as much excess blood as possible. Don’t rub the stain, or you may push the blood deeper into the couch and make it harder to clean. It’s important to use a white cloth, as the dyes in colored cloths may transfer to the couch. Alternatively, blot the couch with isopropyl alcohol. Water is safe to use on couches with W or SW letter codes, while alcohol is safe for couches with S or SW codes."

      "content": "Apply hydrogen peroxide to the blood. Hydrogen peroxide is a great way to remove blood stains, but it can stain some fabrics. First, test the peroxide in an inconspicuous area. Then, apply a few drops to a clean cloth and blot it onto the stain. This should cause a chemical reaction and cause the solution to foam. Keep blotting until the foam subsides.

      "content": "Use dish soap if hydrogen peroxide will discolor your couch. If you’re worried hydrogen peroxide will stain your sofa’s fabric, try dish soap and water for a gentler method. Mix 1 tbsp of dish soap with 2 cups of cold water. Dip a clean cloth or sponge into the mixture and dab it onto the stain until it disappears. Sponge the area with clean, cold water to rinse, then pat it dry. [5] X Research source Because dish soap is a gentle solution, it will likely work better on a fresh blood stain. You may need to repeat the method a few times to remove all the blood. Remember to check your sofa’s care label to make sure you can use water. If you’re cleaning removable fabric covers on your couch, laundry specialist Ayad Mirjan says, “Soak the fabric for 10 minutes in 4 cups of warm water [and] one teaspoon of liquid dishwashing detergent. Rub gently for 30 seconds to loosen the stain. Soak the fabric for another 10-15 minutes. Rinse, [and] if the stain remains, soak the fabric overnight in 6 cups of warm water and half a cup of chlorine-free oxygen-based cleaner.” [6] X Expert Source Ayad Mirjan Dry Cleaner & Laundry Specialist Expert Interview. 11 August 2021. This works for most washable fabrics, including clothing, as well."

      "content": "Rinse the area with cold water. Once you’ve blotted up as much of the blood as possible, soak another clean cloth with cold water to rinse the stain. Wipe the stain in a circular motion, but be careful not to scrub the upholstery. If the stain is still visible after rinsing, repeat the process. If it’s gone, soak up the excess moisture with a clean, dry cloth and let the couch dry. [7] X Research source If you're working with an S-code couch, skip the rinsing step to prevent damaging the couch, and just blot the area with a dry cloth. To speed up drying, aim a fan at the wet spot."

Simply pour some club soda, or seltzer, on the stain and let it fizz, then blot the area with a clean cloth. Club soda alone often isn’t enough to remove strong stains, however, so it may not remove the blood completely. Sometimes, mixing it with salt can be more effective. [11] X Research source"

Then, rinse the area with cold water and repeat if necessary. Do not apply alcohol to delicate materials like wool, silk, or rayon.
