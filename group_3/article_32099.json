      "content": "Say this prayer to ask Padre Pio for healing and health. Padre Pio is known as the patron saint of healing and suffering because he bore the stigmata—the wounds of Christ—on his hands and feet. Throughout his life, he accepted the stigmata as a blessing, and used it to motivate himself to heal others. Praying this prayer calls upon that healing power. [1] X Research source Heavenly Father, I thank you for loving me. I thank you for sending your Son, Our Lord Jesus Christ, to the world to save and to set me free. I trust in your power and grace that sustain and restore me. Loving Father, touch me now with your healing hands, for I believe that your will is for me to be well in mind, body, soul and spirit. Cover me with the most precious blood of your Son, our Lord, Jesus Christ from the top of my head to the soles of my feet. Cast anything that should not be in me. Root out any unhealthy and abnormal cells. Open any blocked arteries or veins and rebuild and replenish any damaged areas. Remove all inflammation and cleanse any infection by the power of Jesus’ precious blood. Let the fire of your healing love pass through my entire body to heal and make new any diseased areas so that my body will function the way you created it to function. Touch also my mind and my emotion, even the deepest recesses of my heart. Saturate my entire being with your presence, love, joy and peace and draw me ever closer to you every moment of my life. And Father, fill me with your Holy Spirit and empower me to do your works so that my life will bring glory and honour to your holy name. I ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen."

Stay with me, Lord, because I am weak, and I need your strength, so that I may not fall so often. Stay with me, Lord, for you are my life, and without you, I am without fervor. Stay with me, Lord, for you are my light, and without you, I am in darkness. Stay with me, Lord, to show me your will. Stay with me, Lord, so that I hear your voice and follow you. Stay with me, Lord, for I desire to love you very much, and always be in your company. Stay with me, Lord, if you wish me to be faithful to you. Stay with me, Lord, for as poor as my soul is, I want it to be a place of consolation for you, a nest of love. Amen. [2] X Research source"

O God, You gave Saint Pio of Pietrelcina, Capuchin Priest, the great privilege of participating in a unique way in the Passion of Your Son, grant me through his intercession the grace of [the person you’re praying for], which I ardently desire; and, above all, grant me the grace of living in conformity with the death of Jesus, to arrive at the glory of the resurrection. [3] X Research source Then, say 3 Glory Be’s: Glory be to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be, world without end. Amen."

With reverence and intense devotion in the celebration of Mass, he invited countless men and women to a greater union with Jesus Christ in the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist. Through the intercession of St. Pio of Pietrelcina, I confidently beseech You to grant me grace. Amen."

      "content": "Padre Pio wrote this prayer to ask God for mercy. Even with all his good works and charity, Padre Pio knew that he must stay humble and remember that everything we do relies on God’s mercy. This prayer is a way of humbling yourself in order to open yourself up to God’s gifts. O Lord, we ask for a boundless confidence and trust in Your divine mercy, and the courage to accept the crosses and sufferings which bring immense goodness to our souls and that of Your Church. Help us to love You with a pure and contrite heart, and to humble ourselves beneath Your cross, as we climb the mountain of holiness, carrying our cross that leads to heavenly glory. May we receive You with great faith and love in Holy Communion, and allow You to act in us as You desire for your greater glory. O Jesus, most adorable Heart and eternal fountain of Divine Love, may our prayer find favor before the Divine Majesty of Your heavenly Father."
