[10] X Research source The Adi mudra is unique because it connects all of your fingers and their corresponding elements: fire (thumb), air (index finger), space (middle finger), earth (ring finger), and water (little finger). The Adi mudra symbolizes unity and connection between the elements, which is why it’s thought to bring balance to your body and mind."
