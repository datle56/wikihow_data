The hands on your clock should stop moving once the crown is pulled. [1] X Research source If your watch has a second hand, wait until it's pointing at the 12 to pull out the crown to make your time more exact. If your watch doesn't display the day or date, the crown will only click once when it's pulled out."

Try to get as close to the current time as you can so your watch is accurate. [2] X Research source Only the hour and minute hands will change. The second hand will stay in the same place. If your watch has a small dial for military time, the crown will also change it. Make sure it's also pointing at the correct time of day."

As the hands cross 12 AM, the day of the week will change on your watch. Keep rotating the crown until you reach the correct day. [5] X Research source On watches without a day of the week display, this position will affect the time and date. This will also change the time your watch is currently set at. Make sure to adjust to the correct time once you're finished setting the date. Don't change the day or date between 9 PM and 4 AM since that's when the changing mechanism activates inside the watch. This could lead to the day or date being inaccurate. Some models may not even let you make adjustments during this time."

[7] X Research source If your watch has a printed calendar on it, then turning the crown clockwise will change the date and turning it counter-clockwise will change the day of the week. Don't change the date between 9 PM and 4 AM since that's when the watch normally switches over. If a month has fewer than 31 days, you need to manually adjust the date at the end of each month."
