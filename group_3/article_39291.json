    {
      "title": "Trim your hair.",
      "content": "Trim your hair. If you have very long hairs, you should trim them before shaving. This ensures that the hairs won’t get stuck in the razor, and it will give you a closer shave. Take a pair of scissors or an electric trimmer to trim a centimeter or two off of your hair. Ideally the hairs should be a centimeter or two long."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take a shower or bath.",
      "content": "Take a shower or bath. Many people shave their underarms in the bath or shower. The heat of the shower softens the hairs and moisturizes the area, helping the razor glide over the skin to remove hair easily. It’s not always necessary to shave during a bath or shower, but if you are shaving for the first time you should try to do it during or directly after bathing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Splash water on your underarms.",
      "content": "Splash water on your underarms. Even though the steam of the shower will soften your hairs, you want to make sure that the area you are shaving is dampened. If you are taking a bath, sink into the bath so that your underarm area is submerged. If you are taking a shower, stand under the water so that your underarms are under the stream, or splash water onto your underarms."
    },
    {
      "title": "Exfoliate your skin.",
      "content": "Exfoliate your skin. Exfoliating under your arms gets rid of dead skin cells and can give you a closer shave. To exfoliate, use body wash with a washcloth or a loofa. [1] X Research source If you're planning on waxing your underarms, make sure to exfoliate a couple days prior and to use proper wax techniques to ensure the skin is kept intact."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply shaving gel to your underarms.",
      "content": "Apply shaving gel to your underarms. Apply a dollop of shaving lotion about the size of a quarter to each underarm. Spread the gel so that it covers all the hairs on the underarm that you are going to shave. [2] X Research source Shaving gel is designed to moisturize and prime your hair for getting shaved, giving you a close shave while at the same time protecting your skin from getting nicked by the razor."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the right razor.",
      "content": "Use the right razor. When you are shaving your underarms, make sure to use a manual razor rather than an electric razor. Manual razors give you more control and can be used in the shower. Also try to use a razor with a pivoting head, because it can follow the contours of the underarm region. [3] X Research source Also make sure to use a sharp, new razor. This will give you the closest shave."
    },
    {
      "title": "Raise your arm.",
      "content": "Raise your arm. Raise up the arm you are shaving and touch the back of your neck with your hand. This keeps the skin of the underarm area taut so that you have a flatter surface to shave."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shave downwards to start.",
      "content": "Shave downwards to start. Use the razor to slowly shave downward. Make sure not to press too hard, as this can irritate the skin and won’t improve your shave. Start from the highest point where your hair starts and shave in a straight line down to the end of your hair."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shave across.",
      "content": "Shave across. Look down at your underarm. You should see that there are still hairs that haven’t been shaved off by your downward sweep with the razor. Because your underarm hair grows in several ways, you will need to shave in multiple different directions to target all of the hairs. Shave across the patches of hair that are still there to remove them. Make sure that the areas you are shaving are still covered in shaving gel. If they are not, redistribute the gel or add more. If you notice hair building up in your razor, give it a quick rinse to get the hair off."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shave upward.",
      "content": "Shave upward. Shaving upward goes against the grain of most of the underarm hair, and it can give you the closest shave. Shave any remaining hairs by shaving upward. If you have very sensitive skin, don’t shave upward, as this can irritate sensitive skin."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t overdo it.",
      "content": "Don’t overdo it. Shaving your underarms will take several strokes, but try not to go over the area more than five times. Doing this can irritate your skin, cause razor burn and increase the chance that you’ll nick yourself with the razor."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tweeze isolated hairs.",
      "content": "Tweeze isolated hairs. If you see a hair or two in a hard to reach place that the razor didn’t shave off, use tweezers to target it. Tweezing the hair removes the entire hair shaft, meaning that the hair will take longer to grow back. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse with cold water.",
      "content": "Rinse with cold water. After finishing shaving, rinse your underarms with cold water. Cold water closes your pores to soothe your skin and prevent infection. It also rinses away any stray hairs. After rinsing your armpits, pat them dry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Moisturize your underarms.",
      "content": "Moisturize your underarms. Especially if you are shaving for the first time, the skin of your underarms may be feeling extra sensitive. Moisturizing helps restore and soothe skin. Use a small amount of alcohol-free lotion on the area you shaved. Don’t put on deodorant directly after shaving, as this can cause irritation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse off your razor.",
      "content": "Rinse off your razor. Give your razor a quick rinse to wash away any hairs or gel that’s clinging to the blades. Don’t run the razor under the water for longer than you need, because this can dull the blades. After you have finished rinsing off the razor, allow your razor to air dry."
