      "content": "Have the person lie down flat on their stomach. Choose a firm, comfortable surface for your work area, such as a firm bed, padded floor, or massage table. Ask the person to lie flat on their stomach, turning their head to either side and positioning their arms however they are most comfortable. [1] X Research source Create a comfortable, calming environment by diffusing relaxing essential oils, like lavender , chamomile , or frankincense . Also, turn the lights down low and keep the room nice and warm. It also helps to center yourself before the massage. Take a few deep breaths to relax and clear your mind so you’re fully present and set a relaxing tone for the person you’re massaging."

      "content": "Squeeze a few drops of massage oil onto your hands (optional). Using massage oil helps reduce friction on the skin and generally makes the massage more comfortable. Some people don’t like oil during a massage, however, so ask the person if it’s okay to use some. Use oil that’s specially designed for massages or another common oil such as olive, coconut, or almond. [2] X Research source Start with a small amount of oil and use more during the massage if you need it. Morales recommends using “fresh, clean products. Maybe [try] something that’s pleasant to the [person], like lavender.” [3] X Expert Source Marty Morales Professional Massage Therapist Expert Interview. 20 Dec 2019. “Some people like to keep [the oil] warm,” Morales explains. “You can put your oil bottle in a bowl of warm water.” [4] X Expert Source Marty Morales Professional Massage Therapist Expert Interview. 20 Dec 2019."

      "content": "Apply upward pressure on either side of the spine with both hands. Place both hands flat on the person’s lower back near their hips, on either side of their spine. Press upward firmly with your entire hands, moving toward their middle back. Then, lift your hands and do it again, starting at their lower back. Do not press down directly on their spine or hip bones; apply pressure to muscles only. [5] X Research source This technique is called effleurage and is commonly used to start loosening muscles during a massage. Continue this technique for 5-10 minutes."

      "content": "Slide your thumb upward along the long muscles beside the spine. Find the long, sausage-shaped muscles that run along the person’s spine. Use your thumb to apply firm pressure to the outer sides of the muscle, sliding it up along the muscle with circular motions and stopping at the middle back. Do each side of the spine three times.

      "content": "Use your thumb to relieve pressure in tight or sore areas. Ask the person if there are specific areas that feel tight or are in need of attention. Have them point to the spot to show you exactly where the pain is. Then, use your thumbs to apply firm pressure to these areas for about five seconds each, making tiny circular movements to help loosen the muscle. [8] X Research source Be sure you are not pressing on bones when you press these tight areas. Stop immediately if the person experiences increased pain during this part of the massage."

[9] X Expert Source Marty Morales Professional Massage Therapist Expert Interview. 20 Dec 2019. Throughout the massage, check in with the person you’re massaging to make sure they feel comfortable. Tell them that if anything hurts, you will back off and apply less pressure. If they want you to apply more pressure, press harder. Ask questions like, “How does this feel? Is this enough pressure or too much?” If the person experiences severe pain during the massage, stop the massage and advise them to seek professional medical care."

      "content": "Try different massage techniques depending on your experience. There are many massage techniques for the lower back, and while many of them are safe to try at home, some should only be performed by professionals. Here are some common techniques: [10] X Research source Therapeutic massage: A therapeutic massage is any type of massage that targets an area of the body to relieve specific discomfort or pain. Anyone can perform a therapeutic massage, but it’s ideally left to a trained massage therapist. Deep tissue massage: Deep tissue massages should only be performed by an expert, as this technique massages the body with more force and reaches muscles and connective tissue on a deeper level. Swedish massage: A Swedish massage is gentler than a deep tissue massage and emphasizes long, circular movements and kneading, as well as tapping and vibration. Sports massage: A sports massage is geared toward athletes and is used to prevent injury or to help an injured athlete recover. To prevent further injury, these massages should be performed by professionals, like a massage therapist or physiotherapist. Shiatsu massage: This Japanese massage technique uses pressure all over the body in a rhythmic fashion. It is intended to stimulate the body to heal itself. Shiatsu massages are generally safe to perform, though it’s better to seek a licensed practitioner."

Lean up against a wall and place the tennis ball or foam roller designed for massage over the area of your lower back that is sore. You should feel some pressure on the tight area where the ball or roller is pressing in. Do not continue if the area is extremely painful or if the pain is coming from a bone. [11] X Research source According to Gomez, you can also use “one of those pressure balls or a lacrosse ball or a softball.” [12] X Expert Source Francisco Gomez Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 24 October 2019.

      "title": "Relieving back pain",
      "content": "Relieving back pain One of the biggest benefits of a lower back massage is that it reduces back pain. There are two types of back pain: chronic and acute. Chronic back pain lasts longer than 3 months, and acute back pain resolves within a 3-month period. Lower back massage usually offers more relief for acute pain, though it can provide short-term relief for chronic pain. [16] X Research source There are many potential causes for back pain, including falling, lifting heavy objects, and poor posture. Some of these issues may lead to health conditions that trigger back pain, including ruptured spinal discs, arthritis, or osteoporosis. Gomez explains that movement is a great way to reduce lower back pain : “A lot of people avoid movement because it hurts, but if they don’t move, they’re actually going to hurt more because their joints are getting stiffer. Walking is a must, especially lifting your legs and using your hips, not just your knees, when you walk.” [17] X Expert Source Francisco Gomez Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 24 October 2019."

      "title": "Relaxing tight muscles",
      "content": "Relaxing tight muscles Massage relaxes tight muscles by increasing blood flow to the area and using techniques that stretch and elongate muscle fibers. In turn, this helps reduce stiffness and pain and improve range of motion. [18] X Research source It also breaks down adhesions (scar tissue) that form in tight muscles to further improve mobility."

      "title": "Increasing blood flow",
      "content": "Increasing blood flow Massage generates heat and applies pressure to tissues, which helps move blood through the area. As muscles relax, the body releases nitric oxide, which helps relax the walls of blood vessels and causes them to expand, improving blood flow. [19] X Research source"

      "content": "Reducing stress Muscle tension is a common sign of stress, so as a massage relieves tightness in the muscles, it also relieves stress . It decreases the stress hormone cortisol and stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, which allows the body to return to a balanced state after a stressful event. [20] X Research source"
