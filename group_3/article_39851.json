      "content": "Perform breathing exercises. Try abdominal breathing , yogic pranayam , or a one-minute breathing exercise. Close your eyes and focus on the breath falling in and out of your body. As you do this, picture each part of your body relaxing, one at a time. Focusing on your body will keep you from thinking about anything else from the outside world.

      "content": "Visualize something relaxing and repetitive. For example, think of small, warm waves washing over your body at regular intervals to coincide with your breathing. Meditate to calm yourself and clear your head. Do not pick anything too exciting or thrilling, something that may work yourself up. Picture a calming beach, a gorgeous, lush forest or a beautiful rose garden. Imagine yourself walking through it all. Think of one of the most beautiful and calming places you have ever been to (a clear stream of running water in a field of wildflowers in the mountains, a peaceful lake, a beautiful beach with a slight breeze in the air). This should help you relax."

      "content": "Recreate boredom. This varies from person to person, but whatever that activity is, it should lull your brain, not engage it. Do whatever you think is the most boring thing possible. Listen to slow, calming music or read something that is completely uninteresting to you. Do puzzles, like Sudoku or Solitaire Listen to a very dry podcast. Try playing a game like tic-tac-toe with yourself."

      "title": "Read.",
      "content": "Read. Reading can help calm your mind and take your thoughts off of anything that might have been troubling you that day. Read something light and not too gripping, such as the local news, a paperback, or a piece of historical non-fiction. If you read a gripping thriller or an emotionally disturbing news story, that will keep you up even longer and will make you feel even more awake if you just cannot stop reading.

      "content": "Stick to the fifteen-minute rule. This rule is simple: if you have been lying in bed for more than fifteen minutes and are unable to fall asleep because you are not tired, then try something else. If you continue to lie there, your mind will continue churning, and you may even work yourself up and feel even more awake than you did when you first closed your eyes. [5] X Expert Source Jeremy Bartz, PhD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 8 January 2021. Once fifteen minutes have passed and you are no closer to catching those zzz's, do something else that is not very taxing. Read a magazine. Pace around your room. Drink some herbal tea. Hum to yourself. Sit up and stare at your hands. Do something new and you will start to drift off. Whatever you do, though, make sure to keep the lights dim - even reasonably dim if you are reading."

      "content": "Avoid intense conversations before bed. Five minutes before bedtime is not the time to get into a big fight with your significant other or to call up your best friend and complain about all of the stress you are facing at work in great detail. If you live with someone and have to talk right before bed, make sure you do not bring up anything more intense than the type of herbal tea you are going to buy at the store tomorrow. Otherwise, the conversation will make you feel even more alert and awake, and it will take you even longer to fall asleep. If you live with someone who loves intense conversations right before bed, talk to them about having these conversations two to three hours before bed instead. When they learn of the issues that you have with sleep, they will (hopefully) be happy to make that concession."

      "content": "Think about everything you did that day. Another way to calm your mind is to go through everything you did that day, up to the most boring little detail. Start with how many blackberries you placed in your morning oatmeal and end with which quadrant of your teeth you decided to brush last. Try to break it down hour by hour and see how specific you can get and how many things you can end up remembering. Unless you are a superhero or an ER doctor for a living, chances are that this alone will be boring enough to put you to sleep. If you have gone through your whole day and still feel wide awake, try going through your entire week. Surely that should be boring enough to make you drift off."

[7] X Research source Do not let yourself get too cold, however, most especially your feet; cold feet can be disruptive to sleep. It is best to put on some socks. You may wake up and remove the socks in the middle of the night, but that is better than letting cold feet keep you awake. It can take several hours for your body temperature to cool down after exercise or exposure to excessive heat, so try to ensure that your body is at normal temperature when you get ready to go to sleep."

If you prefer a completely dark room, cover all lights such as digital alarm clocks, or any other electronic device in your bedroom that has a light on it and use room blackening curtains or blinds.

Also, people find the ticking of a watch or clock soothing. If you prefer everything quiet, turn off anything that causes noise. You can also consider wearing earplugs before you go to bed. It can take some time to get used to them, but they can help block out sounds you were not even aware of that kept you from sleeping. They can also be particularly useful if you share a bed with a partner who can wake you up."

      "content": "Adjust your sleeping position. Keep your back straight, and make sure that your neck is not resting too high or too low. Avoid sleeping on your stomach, as forcing your head to one side is hard on the spine and neck. If you sleep on your side, put a narrow pillow or rolled-up towel between your knees to keep your hips in a neutral position. Even turning from your right side to your left can help you fall asleep if you are feeling wide awake in the same old position."

      "content": "Make your bed more comfortable. Swap your over or under-stuffed pillows for the ones you keep in the guest room. If your mattress is lumpy, flip it over or cover it with a foam pad or other blankets. The more conducive your bed is to your sleep, the more likely you will be ready for bed. We have all laid in a nice, cozy hammock in the sunlight and fallen asleep when we were not even feeling particularly tired, have we not? Well, a cozy bed can have the same effect. Choose silky, thin sheets if you are too hot at night. Opt for thicker, flannel sheets if you find yourself too cold at night. Also, always pick single-ply sheets over double-ply, because single-ply threads are softer and more durable.

Add a quilted mattress cover, which can both protect your mattress and make your bed feel softer.

Though a glass of wine may initially make you feel drowsy, consuming alcohol right before bed will disrupt your sleep cycle and make you fall into a less deep sleep. If you do like to have a nightcap, just have it 2 to 3 hours before bed, so it does not keep you up. As for caffeine, you should avoid caffeine after 2-3 pm, or ideally even afternoon, because it can take up to 8 hours for the caffeine to fully leave your system. This can definitely make you feel awake, even when you want to fall asleep. [15] X Research source"

Rice, rolled oats, barley are grains that are rich in melatonin. Add some veggies that boost melatonin as well like asparagus, corn, olives, cucumber, and broccoli.
