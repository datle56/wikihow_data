[1] X Research source A simplified ratio can be taken as is, but if a ratio has not yet been simplified, you should do so to make the quantities easier to compare and understand. In order to simplify a ratio, you divide both terms (both sides of the ratio) by the same number. This process is equivalent to reducing a fraction. Example: 15 : 21 {\\displaystyle 15:21} Note that neither number in this example is a prime number. Since that is the case, you'll need to factor both numbers to determine whether or not the two terms have any identical factors that can cancel each other in the simplification process."

Both terms in the ratio must share at least one factor (other than the number 1 ) or the ratio cannot be simplified. Before you can determine if the terms do share a factor, you must discover what the factors of each term are. [2] X Research source Example: The number 15 has four factors: 1 , 3 , 5 , 15 {\\displaystyle 1,3,5,15} 15 1 = 15 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {15}{1}}=15} 15 3 = 5 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {15}{3}}=5}"

If the only shared factor is 1 , then the ratio is already in its simplest form, and no further work needs to be done. If the two terms of the ratio have other shared factors, however, sort through them and identify the highest factor common to both lists. This number is the greatest common factor (GCF). [3] X Research source Example: Both 15 and 21 share two common factors: 1 and 3 The GCF for the two terms of the original ratio is 3."

The new ratio is equivalent in value to the original ratio, meaning that the terms in one ratio are in the same proportion as the terms in the other ratio. Note that the terms of the new ratio should not share any common factors between them (other than 1). If they do, the ratio is not yet in simplest form. Example: 5 : 7 {\\displaystyle 5:7} The point of all this is that the simplified ratio 5:7 is easier to work with than the original ratio 15:21."

[6] X Research source If there are exponents (powers) applied to the variable in both terms, deal with them now. If the exponents are the same in both terms, they cancel each other completely. If the exponents are not the same, subtract the smaller exponent from the larger. This completely cancels the variable with the smaller exponent and leaves the other variable with a diminished exponent. Understand that by subtracting one power from the other, you are essentially dividing the larger variable amount by the smaller one. Example: When examined separately, the ratio of variables was: x 2 : x {\\displaystyle x^{2}:x} You can factor out an x {\\displaystyle x} from both terms. The power of the first x {\\displaystyle x} is 2, and the power of the second x {\\displaystyle x} is 1. As such, one x {\\displaystyle x} can be factored out from both terms. The first term will be left with one x {\\displaystyle x} , and the second term will be left with no x {\\displaystyle x} . x ( x : 1 ) {\\displaystyle x(x:1)} x : 1 {\\displaystyle x:1}"
