      "title": "What is the student-to-faculty ratio?",
      "content": "What is the student-to-faculty ratio? The ratio of students to faculty indicates how much interaction you can expect with your professors and peers, as well as whether the school leans toward large lectures or more intimate, discussion-based courses. Ask this question to understand more about the learning environment. [2] X Research source The actual ratio may vary based on your specific major. Consider your learning style. Do you like learning individually and blending in with a crowd, or do you benefit from receiving more attention and personalized feedback?"
    },
    {
      "title": "What is the average cost of attendance?",
      "content": "What is the average cost of attendance? Finances are a major part of choosing a college. Ask about the average cost of attendance to gain insight into the amount most students actually pay. The cost of attendance is usually lower than the actual cost of tuition, housing, and other fees because of grants, scholarships, and other forms of aid. [3] X Research source “Don’t let the sticker price of a particular institution discourage you from applying,” advises Kaifesh. “Many colleges offer a ton of financial aid and scholarships, so most students end up paying a fraction of the advertised cost.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "What financial aid is available?",
      "content": "What financial aid is available? Ask the admissions officer what they can share about the college’s financial aid. [4] X Research source Every college offers unique scholarships and grants. Some are need-based, others are merit-based, and still others are intended to help students of specific majors, demographics, and career goals. Make note of any options that you might qualify for, since some scholarships require separate applications."
    },
    {
      "title": "How does this school support students’ success?",
      "content": "How does this school support students’ success? Even if you’ve excelled in school so far, at the college level, everyone can benefit from resources to support their academics, mental health, socializing, and more. Ask what resources the college offers to help students succeed at their institution, such as tutoring, resources for students with disabilities, faculty or peer mentorships, and more. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "What do students enjoy most about going here?",
      "content": "What do students enjoy most about going here? Learn what it is about the college that current students value and that alumni remember most. Maybe it’s the bustling student life, the cutting-edge research opportunities, or the transformative curriculum. Whatever the case, the college admissions team’s answer to this question will give you an idea of what makes the school special and what its students value. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "How would you describe the student body and atmosphere?",
      "content": "How would you describe the student body and atmosphere? Ask this open-ended question to learn more about the vibe and values of the college’s students. You’ll likely hear adjectives like “changemakers,” “dreamers,” “strivers,” “diverse,” or “welcoming.” Evaluate if the admissions officer’s description resonates with who you are and who you want to surround yourself with."
    },
    {
      "title": "What do students like to do around the town/city?",
      "content": "What do students like to do around the town/city? When you go to college, you don’t only spend time on campus. You explore the surrounding area, potentially live there if you’re a commuter, and may work or intern there during breaks. Find out what students like to do in the surrounding area to get an idea of what the culture is and what the location has to offer on weekends or days off. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "How does this school foster a sense of belonging and inclusivity?",
      "content": "How does this school foster a sense of belonging and inclusivity? Universities bring together people of all identities from all walks of life. Ask your college admissions representative what the school does to promote a sense of belonging and inclusivity for all its students. Learn if there are any organizations, clubs, affinity groups, or other resources that foster community. [8] X Research source You can also ask how they support first-generation or underrepresented students to ensure their success. They might be able to connect you with students from these backgrounds that can give you better insight into the support available."
    },
    {
      "title": "Are there any common misconceptions about the school?",
      "content": "Are there any common misconceptions about the school? Ask this question of your university admissions team to learn what stereotypes or myths about the campus aren’t true. You’re sure to get an interesting answer. For example, you might find out a STEM school has a robust drama department, or that a school stereotyped for being antisocial throws fun, free concerts each semester."
    },
    {
      "title": "What made you want to work for this school?",
      "content": "What made you want to work for this school? Many admissions officers have a personal connection to the institution they work for—perhaps they’re an alumni, or a parent of a current or former student. Even if they don’t have a direct connection, this question allows you to learn more about the school’s values and what makes it unique from other institutions."
    },
    {
      "title": "Can you connect me with a current student?",
      "content": "Can you connect me with a current student? Once you’ve been accepted to a school, see if you’re able to connect with a peer to learn more about the student experience there.

    },
    {
      "title": "What is the average class size?",
      "content": "What is the average class size? Ask how many students are in the average class at the college to get an idea of how much interaction you get with faculty and how many opportunities you have to meet fellow students. Note that the average class size varies by major and curriculum requirements. [10] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "What are the most popular majors?",
      "content": "What are the most popular majors? Knowing the most popular majors gives you insight into the student body at large—if most of the students are business majors, the school likely has a different vibe than another university where most people are drama majors. Similarly, asking this question gives you insight into program size and the availability of major-specific resources. [11] X Research source “College students change their major three times on average!” notes Kaifesh. “The most important factor should be whether you will be happy and challenged at a school, regardless of the major you end up with.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "What makes your school’s curriculum unique?",
      "content": "What makes your school’s curriculum unique? Most colleges and universities have a general-education or core curriculum that all students are required to complete. Ask what’s unique about this college’s curriculum. Do their requirements emphasize leadership and diversity, or well-roundedness and balance? Their answer could help you choose between similar schools . [12] X Research source Don’t be afraid to ask follow-up questions if the curriculum sounds intense or overwhelming. There are likely many resources available to help students succeed."
    },
    {
      "title": "How does the school support students’ transition to college coursework?",
      "content": "How does the school support students’ transition to college coursework? No matter which college you go to, the transition from school to university is challenging.

    {
      "title": "What resources are available to support students’ academic success?",
      "content": "What resources are available to support students’ academic success? Ask the college admissions representatives what programs or support the school has for all students, and for your specific major.

    },
    {
      "title": "What opportunities are available for undergraduate research?",
      "content": "What opportunities are available for undergraduate research? If you think you’re going to graduate school or simply want to experience research, ask about undergraduate research opportunities. Some colleges have built-in research opportunities as part of their curriculum, while others let students pursue research topics as independent studies or capstones. [15] X Research source Doing research at the undergraduate level helps you be a competitive applicant for graduate programs, internships, and job opportunities."
    },
    {
      "title": "Are classes taught mostly by professors or teaching assistants?",
      "content": "Are classes taught mostly by professors or teaching assistants? Ask admissions for an estimate of how many courses are taught by faculty members versus teaching assistants (TAs). At larger schools or when it comes to majors with many students, a portion of the teaching load may be handed off to graduate students. If you value faculty interaction and connecting with your professors, it’s something to keep in mind. [16] X Research source This question may be dependent on your major, so try to be specific when asking if you know which major(s) you’re interested in. Taking classes from teaching assistants isn’t a bad thing. TAs understand what it’s like to be a student in recent times, and can offer helpful insight into applying for graduate school and working in academia."
    },
    {
      "title": "What is the retention rate for new students?",
      "content": "What is the retention rate for new students? Retention rate refers to how many students return to the school for their second year. Ask about this metric to learn more about student satisfaction. If the university has a low retention rate, it may be a sign that they don’t support and engage new students, causing them to drop out or transfer to other schools. [17] X Research source An ideal retention rate is as close to 100% as possible. Think of it as a satisfaction rating. If the retention rate is below 80%, ask the admissions office why."
    },
    {
      "title": "What’s the participation rate for study-abroad programs?",
      "content": "What’s the participation rate for study-abroad programs? Show your interest in studying abroad and learn what exciting global learning opportunities are available. Ask what percentage of students participate in a study-abroad or exchange program. [18] X Research source Weigh this against the size of the overall student body—a small college will likely have a higher participation rate than a large one. If you’re especially interested in studying abroad, ask more specific questions. For example, what are the most popular places to study abroad? Can you apply your financial aid toward studying abroad?"
    },
    {
      "title": "What other experiential learning opportunities does this school offer?",
      "content": "What other experiential learning opportunities does this school offer? Experiential learning comes in many forms, including field trips, major-related community service projects, internship or lab opportunities, masterclasses, and guest lectures. Ask what kinds of outside-the-classroom opportunities the college offers to students of all majors and in your desired program. [19] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "What career services are available to students?",
      "content": "What career services are available to students? During your time in college and beyond, professional development is key to help you find a job after graduation. [20] X Research source Learn what the admissions team has to say about career services such as resume workshops, interview prep and practice, and connecting students with alumni or mentors in their desired fields. Feel free to ask specific questions about post-grad employment rates, university-specific internship opportunities, and how engaged the school’s alumni network is."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do many students participate in internships, and how do they find them?",
      "content": "Do many students participate in internships, and how do they find them? Another career-oriented question to ask is how many students obtain internships and how they come across these opportunities. Are they connected by the school’s career center or professors, or are they on their own? [21] X Research source If not many students do internships, it may indicate a lack of professional development resources or that the college’s coursework is too rigorous for outside employment during the school year."
    },
    {
      "title": "What do students in my major do after graduation?",
      "content": "What do students in my major do after graduation? If you’re talking to admissions officers who have familiarity with your major or program of interest, ask about specific job opportunities in your field. This question is especially relevant if you’re interested in post-graduate studies for a field like law or medicine, or if you’re unsure what’s possible with a broad major like psychology. [22] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "What on-campus housing is available and what is dorm life like?",
      "content": "What on-campus housing is available and what is dorm life like? Ask college admissions representatives about residence life, an important part of the college experience. If you’re attending college in an urban area, for example, they might not offer housing on-campus but connect students with nearby apartments. [23] X Research source Learn if you’re required to live on campus and if on-campus housing is guaranteed or available via lottery. Some colleges only guarantee housing to first- and second-year students, expecting others to find off-campus housing due to capacity limitations. A good follow-up question is how on-campus housing is assigned. Many universities divide it based on your major or school within the college, but others group students together in living and learning communities based on shared values."
    },
    {
      "title": "How are roommates assigned?",
      "content": "How are roommates assigned? Ask this question to learn more about how the school chooses who you live with. [24] X Research source Some colleges won’t let you request a roommate, even if you know someone who will be attending the same school. They might pair you randomly, or take into account your preferences using a survey. Find out how many students live in each room and suite. Some universities may require you to share a suite and a room with many people in your first year to help you socialize and make friends."
    },
    {
      "title": "What are the on-campus dining options?",
      "content": "What are the on-campus dining options? While it’s probably not a deciding factor for which school you’re going to attend, you can demonstrate interest in campus life by inquiring about the dining scene. Find out if there’s one big dining hall that everyone eats at, or if there are various popular franchises around campus. Follow up with any questions you have about meal plans, and whether most students eat on-campus or off-campus. Ask if there are any markets where students can purchase fresh produce and other ingredients to cook their own meals."
    },
    {
      "title": "What is the campus culture and community like?",
      "content": "What is the campus culture and community like? A campus’s culture is just as important as its academics. You’re most likely to thrive in a place where you feel like you belong and your values align with those of the campus community. [25] X Research source Ask this general question to get a sense of what people like to do, how the school facilitates community, and how much school spirit there is. For example, the college admissions officer may share how the students are close-knit and everyone knows everyone at a smaller school. At a big school, they might talk about how everyone turns out for big sporting events."
    },
    {
      "title": "What are the most popular student events?",
      "content": "What are the most popular student events? Ask the college admissions team what events get students excited to show up and be part of the campus community. Are they sporting events, concerts thrown by the student body, or guest lectures from celebrities? These events indicate what the interests of the campus at large are—you might learn about one that’s cool and unique to the college."
    },
    {
      "title": "What clubs or organizations are available?",
      "content": "What clubs or organizations are available? Student life goes beyond attending classes and living in dorms. Ask about the extra-curricular activities the college offers to learn about chances to get involved and meet new people. [26] X Research source To demonstrate specific interest, ask about a club or organization you were involved in during high school to see if you can continue it at the college level. See if the university holds a club fair once or twice a year to introduce students to organizations."
    },
    {
      "title": "How does the campus support student safety and security?",
      "content": "How does the campus support student safety and security? Safety might be more of a parental concern, but it’s something to keep in mind as a prospective student—especially if the campus is open to the public. Ask what security is in place, such as campus security, escorts to night classes, adequate outdoor lighting, and offices you can contact to anonymously report a crime or seek a safe haven."
    },
    {
      "title": "What are some campus traditions?",
      "content": "What are some campus traditions? Every college has traditions. Learn what unique ones are cherished by the school. Ask the admissions officers what the most popular traditions are, how they came to be, and how many students participate in them. [27] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "What sports or intramural clubs are available?",
      "content": "What sports or intramural clubs are available? Contrary to what you see in TV and movies, not every college has a football team. If you’re an aspiring student athlete, be sure to ask whether the school offers your sport or not, what division or league they’re in, and if they have intramural or club sports that anyone can join. [28] X Research source Maybe the school has an elite competitive bowling team—you won’t know until you ask. Beyond sports, you can also ask about amenities or programming the school offers to engage students. Think of things like on-campus gyms, free recreation classes, and weekly craft or movie nights."
    },
    {
      "title": "What is the campus’s Greek life like?",
      "content": "What is the campus’s Greek life like? A campus’s Greek life tells you a lot about campus culture, even if you’re not an aspiring sorority or fraternity member. A school with a Greek row (where sororities and fraternities have their own housing on campus) is likely to have a more active social scene than one that’s banned or limited Greek life. [29] X Research source If you’re interested in joining Greek life, ask follow-up questions about when rush or recruitment takes place, how many organizations are on campus, and how many students are involved in Greek life."
    },
    {
      "title": "How does the campus support students with disabilities?",
      "content": "How does the campus support students with disabilities? For prospective students and parents of those with disabilities, accessibility and accommodations are likely a priority. The ADA requires public and private colleges to provide equal access to students with disabilities, but some schools may have more robust disability services than others. [30] X Research source Ask what supports are in place to help all students navigate campus and succeed."
    },
    {
      "title": "What resources are available for commuter students?",
      "content": "What resources are available for commuter students? If you know you’ll be commuting or anticipate that you will be, it’s important to scope out the parking, socialization, and hang-out spots for commuter students. Ask how the school supports commuters, from offering designated spaces for them to congregate to holding socials to help them meet new people on campus."
    },
    {
      "title": "How do students get around campus?",
      "content": "How do students get around campus? Ask college admissions representatives what transportation is available for students on campus. Some universities offer shuttle services, while others encourage walking, biking, skating, and scootering. Available transportation, combined with how large the campus is, affects your ability to get to class on time and take classes that are far apart. [31] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "How can I demonstrate my interest in this college?",
      "content": "How can I demonstrate my interest in this college? Ask university admissions officers how you can show your interest in the school beyond what you write in your application essays. They’ll inform you of any webinars, college fairs, or other events for prospective students to ask questions and show interest."
    },
    {
      "title": "What does the school value in prospective students?",
      "content": "What does the school value in prospective students? While every school wants students who are academic achievers and well-rounded, it doesn’t hurt to ask what the school values the most. The admissions officer may highlight activities like leadership and community service. Or, they may name qualities that you can highlight in your application materials, like creative thinking. “If an institution prioritizes academic performance, then achieving a high GPA and taking rigorous courses becomes essential,” says Ruiz. “If extracurricular activities hold significant weight, students should focus on meaningful involvement—such as founding a club, taking a leadership position, or participating in nonprofit organizations,” Ruiz recommends."
    },
    {
      "title": "How can I make my application stand out?",
      "content": "How can I make my application stand out? When you’re preparing to apply to a university, ask their admissions representatives what you can do to stand out from the thousands of other applicants. Even if their answer is generic, this question allows you to demonstrate genuine interest in the school."
    },
    {
      "title": "Are there any admissions requirements unique to this school/program?",
      "content": "Are there any admissions requirements unique to this school/program? To show specific interest, ask about specific requirements the school has that others might not. Once the admissions officers tell you what these are, ask follow-up questions so you can fulfill extra requirements on time. Examples of extra admissions requirements are additional essays beyond the common application, a portfolio (for creative programs), an audition (for performing arts or music programs), or an interview."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid questions about your application or chance of admission.",
      "content": "Avoid questions about your application or chance of admission. College admissions representatives aren’t necessarily the same people reviewing your application. Even if they are, they can’t reveal admission status, promise an acceptance, or tell you your chances of getting accepted. They’re there to help you navigate the admissions process, not to decide if you get in . [32] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t ask about information that’s readily available on the website.",
      "content": "Don’t ask about information that’s readily available on the website. For example, don’t email to ask what city the college is in, or ask if they have your desired major. This shows a lack of research and genuine interest in the school. [33] X Research source Some factual questions are okay to ask, such as average class size, but it’s best to do research on the school so you can ask thoughtful and open-ended questions."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid asking about party culture, drinking, or drug use.",
      "content": "Avoid asking about party culture, drinking, or drug use. Even if a college has a reputation as a party school, it’s not polite to ask about it—especially when talking to the admissions team. Implying that you’re interested in partying, drinking, and drug use is a red flag for the school, since their goal is to recruit students who succeed with their academics and graduate on time. [34] X Research source Instead, ask about Greek life on campus, the overall campus culture, and popular campus events to get an idea of the social scene."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t ask questions that directly compare them to other colleges.",
      "content": "Don’t ask questions that directly compare them to other colleges. You might be genuinely interested in two schools, especially when it’s almost time to make a decision. Still, when you’re talking to a university’s representatives, focus your questions on their school. Don’t compare them to other schools—it could give off the message that they’re your second choice or a backup. For example, don’t say, “X school has this program. Do you offer that, too?” Or, “Are you more expensive than Y school?” Research these questions on your own time to help you make your decision."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply early decision or early action if possible.",
      "content": "Apply early decision or early action if possible. If you know an institution is your top choice and they offer early decision or early action, apply early. This shows you have a strong interest in the school and, if accepted, will attend without considering other schools. [35] X Research source Think carefully before applying through an early decision program. You’re contractually bound to attend the school if accepted and to withdraw other applications upon acceptance. Early action isn’t binding like early decision, but you receive an early response."
    },
    {
      "title": "Attend local college fairs and talk to reps.",
      "content": "Attend local college fairs and talk to reps. If you can’t visit campus, find out if the colleges you’re interested in are sending representatives to your high school or a city near you. Attend college fairs and talk to representatives to ask questions and demonstrate your interest in the school. Thank them after your conversation for answering your questions. [36] X Research source Ask if they have a card or email where you can reach them with follow-up questions during the application process."
    },
    {
      "title": "Open and read emails from the college.",
      "content": "Open and read emails from the college. Colleges can track when you open emails and click links inside them. Subscribe to emails for prospective students, open them, and read the information inside. Click any relevant links. You’ll receive information about events for prospective students, as well as reminders when application or decision deadlines are close. [37] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Participate in virtual webinars.",
      "content": "Participate in virtual webinars. Many schools offer general and program-specific webinars for prospective students. Attending these sessions lets you ask questions to the admissions team, demonstrate your interest in the school, and learn more about what the university has to offer. If demonstrated interest is a factor for the admissions department, they’ll likely note who attends the webinars."

      "title": "Go on a campus tour.",
      "content": "Go on a campus tour. If you’re able to visit the campus before applying, book a tour. They’re not just for admitted students—and they’re an opportunity to talk to admissions officers, current students, and even professors in your desired program. While it’s not always feasible to tour a campus—especially if it’s out of state—if you can, go for it! [38] X Research source"
