For example, in New York City, you can dial “311” to connect to the Building Inspection Department in your area. Smaller cities or areas may have a local number you can connect to."

      "title": "Discuss the illegal issue with the construction.",
      "content": "Discuss the illegal issue with the construction. Construction sites are considered illegal if they are built without a permit or without clear safety measures for workers and passerby. They can also be deemed illegal if they are constructed after hours or result in excess debris and materials on the streets or surrounding area. If you notice any of these issues with the construction you are reporting, note this as part of your complaint. For example, you may say, “The construction is being done after 10 pm at night and the workers are leaving debris on the sidewalks that could put people walking by in danger.”"

      "title": "Include time and date you observed the issue.",
      "content": "Include time and date you observed the issue. If possible, provide the exact date and time of day you noticed the issue. If the issue is ongoing, you may note when you started to become aware of the issue and how long it has been going on. For example, you may say, “I noticed the illegal construction on Friday, August 4th and it has continued until today, Monday, August 10th.”"

      "content": "Leave the complaint anonymously to protect your privacy, if allowed. Most Building Inspection Departments will allow you to leave a complaint, or tip, by phone anonymously, as it is not considered an official complaint. In most cases, the department will keep any information you provide confidential and not give out your personal information if or when they follow through on the complaint. If you are worried about your identity being in the public record as part of the complaint, you can ask about leaving the complaint anonymously when you call the department."

      "content": "Search for the official complaint form on your city council’s website. Most city council websites will have a complaint form that you can fill out and submit to notify them of illegal construction in the area. The form may be listed under a section marked “City-related complaints” or “Construction complaints.” [1] X Research source Some city council websites will have separate forms for each type of issue, such as falling debris, construction without a permit, or construction after business hours. Choose the form that applies to your situation. Once you find the form, fill it out online and submit it online through the website so it can be reviewed promptly."

      "content": "Include the violator’s address and a description of the issue. The description should include any details that appear illegal to you and any concerns you may have about the construction site or area. Try to leave a detailed description, as this can help local authorities get a sense of the issue with the construction. For example, you may write, “The workers on the construction site are not wearing any safety gear and there is falling debris occurring on a daily basis due to the construction site. I am worried about the safety of the workers and those who live in the area.”"

      "content": "Look for a legitimate permit to build displayed on the premises. All constructions sites should have a panel that displays the details of the construction. If you cannot see one, you can also try asking workers at the site if they have a permit to build, especially if the site looks suspicious or possibly illegal. They should be able to provide a copy of the permit or have one on hand. [2] X Research source Large commercial construction sites, such as office buildings or condominiums, should have a panel displayed with details about the build as well as a copy of a building permit from the Building Inspection Department. A residential construction site should have a copy of the permit displayed and signage noting who the contractor for the site is. If these details are not clearly shown on the site, it may be operating without a permit."

A construction site can also be deemed illegal if its workers are not wearing the proper protective equipment like hard hats, safety vests, steel toe boots, and safety harnesses, especially if they are doing scaffolding. The site should also have safety fencing around it to protect the area and people passing by. [4] X Research source You should also check that the construction site has bright orange safety signs and markers, especially if it is next to a road or sidewalk."
