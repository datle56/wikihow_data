When your eyes meet, hold his gaze longer than you would an ordinary friend. Think of it as sending a silent plea to make a move or pull you off to be in his arms. The longer the eye contact, the more sexual you feel. Reader Poll: We asked 125 wikiHow readers how they like to show love to their partner, and 50% of them said through physical affection, like hugs and kisses. [Take Poll] In addition to making eye contact, consider brushing his arm or touching his hand to help set the mood."
