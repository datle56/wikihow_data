      "content": "Use the \"Close Door\" button. When you get on the elevator, press the \"Close Door\" button. Often, this button will be two triangles pointing in towards each other. Continue holding the \"Close Door\" button as you push your floor. In some elevators, this combination will give you an express ride. This combination often works on Otis, Desert, and Dover elevators. Note that sometimes the \"Close Door\" button is just a placebo for impatient riders, so this trick may not work."

Or, they may press their floor button again. [2] X Research source The simplest method is to double press the button, which works in Mitsubishi Electric. In other brands, such as Fujitec, pressing it five times works. Another method is to hold the \"Open Door\" button while pressing the floor button twice. [3] X Research source"

Most of these have four sides to work in multiple types of elevators. [9] X Research source Buying keys is somewhat of a legal gray area. Check to see if it's legal in your state before purchasing one. [10] X Research source However, to make sure the key you buy works on your elevator, you may need to do a little research. Look at the make and model of your elevator, which is usually listed inside the elevator. Use that information to find out what kind of key it takes."
