      "title": "Prepare the garment for ironing.",
      "content": "Prepare the garment for ironing. Lay the garment on the ironing board with the sticky stain face up. Cover the stain with two layers of paper towels. The paper towels should cover the entire sticky area, so if you have a very large stain you may need a few more paper towels. This method works well for sticky substances, like the adhesive on the back of stickers, that have been put through the wash."

      "title": "Hold the iron on the sticky area.",
      "content": "Hold the iron on the sticky area. Take your iron and press down on top of the paper towel covered stain. Hold the iron on the stain for about 5 to 10 seconds. This heats the sticky goo up, making it easier to remove. Some fabrics can burn more easily than others, like polyester or acetate. The paper towels should prevent the iron from burning your fabric, but be careful and use another method if you start to burn the fabric."

      "content": "Place the fabric in a freezer. Some sticky substances, like hot glue or gum, become very brittle when they are frozen. Put the fabric in the freezer until the sticky substance is completely frozen. This method works better with gum and glue-like substances rather than stickers or sticky substances that have seeped into the fabric. [7] X Research source You can put the garment into a freezer safe plastic bag as long as the sticky substance does not touch the bag. You can freeze any type of fabric without damaging it."

Once you’ve realized that something sticky has gotten onto your shirt, sweater, or any other piece of clothing, put it on a flat surface where you can work at removing the stain. Do not wash your garment after you notice a stain. Washing the fabric sets in the stain and makes it harder to remove. If you've already washed the fabric before you noticed the sticky substance, removing the stain will take more work."

      "title": "Collect your materials.",
      "content": "Collect your materials. To remove the stain, you’ll need to choose a removal product. You will also need a soft brush to massage the product into the stain. An old toothbrush works well, or even an old cotton washcloth. Once you’ve massaged the stain out you’ll need to wash the garment, so you’ll need laundry detergent.

      "content": "Test in a small area. Before you start, you’ll want to test the removal product that you’ve chosen on a small area of the fabric. Choose an area that is inconspicuous and isn’t noticeable. This way, you’ll know if the product will stain your fabric. Some delicate fabrics, like satin or silk, are more likely to become stained than more durable fabrics, like cotton or polyester. If the removal product does happen to stain your garment, choose another removal product. Test this new product in another inconspicuous area to make sure it doesn’t stain."
