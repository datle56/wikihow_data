      "content": "Scrapyards Any scrapyard that takes metal or iron should be interested in your converter. You’re not likely to get the best price of all time for your used converter, but if it’s not functional or the recycling plants weren’t offering much for your model this is probably the fastest and easiest way to get a couple of bucks for your item. [1] X Trustworthy Source State of Indiana Official site for state-approved sources related to life in Indiana, including laws, services, and culture Go to source Call the scrapyard ahead of time before showing up. Some scrapyards don’t take converters (or won’t pay for them). Most will, but it’s better to check first instead of risking a visit for nothing. This is the best option for: people with bad converters who want to sell it as quickly as possible."

      "title": "Facebook Marketplace or eBay",
      "content": "Facebook Marketplace or eBay If your catalytic converter works and it fits on a popular make and model in your area, you may have luck selling it on Facebook Marketplace. If you want to try selling to the highest bidder, you can even list the converter on eBay to see if someone is willing to pay a premium for your particular model. [3] X Research source Just know, this is the riskiest option from a “do I have to deal with shady people” perspective. If all things are equal, you’re best off selling your converter to a licensed recycler. Does your converter actually work? If your catalytic converter is faulty or dysfunctional, do not sell it to be reused privately. This would likely qualify as fraud, but even if the buyer didn’t notice the converter didn’t work it’d result in toxic fumes leaking into the environment when they use it. This is the best option for: people with working catalytic converters who don’t mind putting in a little bit of effort to get a great price."

      "title": "Catalytic converters contain expensive and rare minerals.",
      "content": "Catalytic converters contain expensive and rare minerals. Catalytic converters contain platinum, palladium, rhodium and other rare earth minerals. These minerals are extremely pricey. Rhodium along can cost up to $10,000 an ounce! [4] X Research source Why are these expensive minerals inside converters? The minerals inside of catalytic converters literally neutralize and absorb the toxic fumes created by your car engine. Their natural recycling abilities make them perfect for modern gas vehicles! Can I extract the minerals myself to resell them? No. All of the minerals in the converter are toxic and require special tools and talents to extract safely. Besides, even if you could remove them, you’d have no buyer. Scrapyards and recyclers sell these minerals in bulk to commercial manufacturers."

      "title": "The value depends on the brand, quality, and usability.",
      "content": "The value depends on the brand, quality, and usability. Prices for catalytic converters are closely tied to the spot prices for the rare earth minerals inside. Beyond that, whether your converter needs to be disassembled for scrap or not has a huge impact on the price. Finally, how rare (or specialized) your catalytic converter is will play a role in the pricing. A converter for a 1998 Honda Civic is probably going to fetch less than a converter for a Porsche 992 with a twin-turbo engine. [5] X Research source Here are some general guidelines on price: If your catalytic converter doesn’t work: You can typically expect to get $50-200 for a scrap converter, although rarer models can fetch up to $900. You can get a general sense of scrap prices by model here . If your catalytic converter does work: If your converter is reusable, you can likely fetch $200-800 for it, although rarer converters can get you up to $1,500 or so."

      "content": "Remove the converter if you haven’t already. If you haven’t already removed the converter , set the vehicle on jacks and wait for the car to completely cool. Then, remove the oxygen sensors connected to the converter with a socket wrench. Then, remove any bolts locking the converter in place and remove it from the vehicle. [6] X Research source Alternative: If the car is being scrapped, you can just cut the converter out of the emission line using a jigsaw. Just make sure you wear a respirator in the event that you accidentally cut into the converter, which is toxic."

      "title": "Get a quote from potential buyers to get the best deal.",
      "content": "Get a quote from potential buyers to get the best deal. Before you actually sell your converter to a recycling plant or scrapyard, get a quote on what they’re actually willing to pay for it. This way there won’t actually be any surprises when it’s time to hand over the gear! [7] X Trustworthy Source State of Indiana Official site for state-approved sources related to life in Indiana, including laws, services, and culture Go to source If you’re selling on eBay or Facebook Marketplace, set your price based on the previously sold listings on eBay for your specific make and model. In some states and cities, sellers aren’t allowed to give you more than a certain amount for used catalytic converters. This is to minimize the incentives for thieves to take them. So, if you keep getting the same quote over and over, that’s probably why."

If you need to ship your converter, fill a heavy cardboard box with crumpled newspapers or bubble wrap. Use a hefty amount of cushioning! Then, seal the box completely with heavy-duty packing tape. [8] X Research source Take your driver’s license, registration for the vehicle the converter is from, and insurance just in case there are any questions about the provenance of your converter."

In most jurisdictions, commercial catalytic converter buyers need to do their due diligence to ensure they’re not buying stolen goods.
