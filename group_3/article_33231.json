While the mayor does not partake in any official rounds of gameplay, they oversee each round and add unique stories to explain players’ actions. Choose a moderator with a knack for organization and storytelling. Other moderator duties include: Distributing cards Telling people when to “sleep” and “wake” Timing discussions Informing people if they have been eliminated Declaring the winner"

      "content": "Split up a deck of cards so that there is 1 card for each role. Use a deck made up of as many cards as there are players. Set aside 1 king, 1 queen, 1 card of a certain suit for each mafia member, and enough additional cards of another suit to represent the remaining townspeople. Set aside 1 “mafia” card for every 3 townspeople. For example, when playing with 12 people, use 3 mafia cards, 1 king, 1 queen, and 7 regular cards. When playing with 16 people, use 4 mafia cards and so on. Always round down when assigning mafia cards [3] X Research source You may assign any suit to be the mafia suit, such as hearts, clubs, or spades. If you don’t have a deck of playing cards, assign roles by writing them on pieces of paper and letting players draw out of a bag or hat. The mayor can also hand-pick the various roles by telling players to close their eyes and tapping them a certain number of times on the shoulder."

The player that draws the queen card is the doctor. The player that draws the king card is the detective, and all remaining players are townspeople. [5] X Research source The mafia is responsible for killing 1 player every round, after players close their eyes. The doctor may point to 1 person who they wish to save each night cycle. If the mafia tries to kill the person the doctor chooses, that person is saved for the round. The doctor is allowed to save themself. Throughout the game, the detective is allowed to guess if players are members of the mafia. If the detective guesses correctly, that mafia member is eliminated. If the detective guesses incorrectly, nothing happens. The detective should be allowed a number of guesses equal to the number of mafia players. For example, if there are 3 mafia members, the detective gets 3 guesses per game. If there are 4, the detective gets 4 and so on. Townspeople do not have any special abilities. If you only have 5-6 players for Mafia, consider cutting all other non-mafia roles like the detective and the doctor."

However, if the person was wrong, then the detective knows who another one of the townspeople is and can choose someone else on their next turn. For an alternate, more difficult style of gameplay, do not automatically eliminate the mafia member if the detective guesses correctly.

[12] X Research source For example, the moderator could say something like: “The mafia attacked John last night, but the doctor was able to save him, so John is still alive.

Have the mayor set a timer for 5 minutes to ensure that the discussion doesn’t get out of hand or go on too long. [13] X Research source For example, players may say something along the lines of “Joey hasn’t said much, which seems pretty suspicious.” Then, Joey might say something like, “I don’t feel the need to say much because I haven’t done anything wrong.

The person who the lawyer defends cannot be voted out the following morning. The Peeping-Tom , who is allowed to open their eyes at any moment. This person may find out who plays each role in the game, but this makes them more likely to be killed by the mafia. The Grandma With a Shotgun. If the Grandma with a shotgun is visited by anyone during the night cycle, that person dies, but the Grandma cannot be killed. The Mafioso who works with the mafia. Every night, they reveal a townsperson's role to the mafia. The Jailer who, once every game, can put any person in jail. The jailed player is unable to perform their role for the night. The Vigilante who, once every game, can shoot anyone. If their victim is not the mafia, the vigilante dies of guilt. The Mayor who is allowed to reveal their card whenever they want. Once they reveal their role, their vote is doubled. Revealing their role may make them a target for the mafia. The Jester whose whole objective is to be voted off by the players. If they are voted off, they may choose to kill a player who voted to execute them in the following night. Cupid can make 2 players fall in love, which will put both of them at a higher risk of being eliminated. On the first night cupid picks 2 people to be the lovers.
