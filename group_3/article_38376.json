He also recommends using a small tool, like a Q-tip, with a small amount of alcohol applied, to clean the sensor and around the edges of the scroll wheel to remove any visible dust and debris. You can use something like a toothpick to get into tight cracks to dislodge anything blocking the scroll wheel from moving properly, then use a can of compressed air to clean more of your mouse. Mercer stresses never to use water when cleaning your mouse. Your mouse is very fragile, and you don't want liquid getting inside of it."
