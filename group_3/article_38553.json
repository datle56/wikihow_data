According to Bumble users on Reddit who've tested the SuperSwipe feature, the person who SuperSwiped you probably won't be the first person in your match queue , but they'll be near the top of the stack. When you reach the person who SuperSwiped you, you'll see a yellow icon with two stars and \"SuperSwiped You!\" on their profile. You'll still see SuperSwipes even if you swiped left on a person. If a person you swiped left on SuperSwipes you, Bumble will give you a second chance to check out their profile and see if it's worthy of a right swipe!"

However, that makes a SuperSwipe compelling: it shows you’re so confident and interested in someone that you’ve made an effort to get your “like” to stand out from the others. To use a SuperSwipe: [3] X Research source Open up your Swipe queue on Bumble. When you find someone you want to SuperSwipe, tap the star icon on their profile. Once you activate the SuperSwipe, the potential match will get a notification about it (and can then respond, if they want to)."

[7] X Research source Taking a photo of your left side may be surprisingly effective. When it comes to portraits, people tend to like the left side better. Try not to post photos with other people in them. Potential matches should be focused on you and you alone!"

Be genuine, focusing on who you are and your interests. If you can’t decide what to write, think about the type of person you want to attract and the values that matter most to you—and write your Bumble bio with those ideas in mind. For example, if you love to laugh and want to meet someone with a great sense of humor, include a witty joke in your bio. If you want to date someone as compassionate and altruistic as you, write a little about your past volunteer work."
