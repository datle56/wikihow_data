Realize that the shrinking process is permanent, so make sure you really want to shrink the item on which you are using this method. If the tag says \"preshrunk,\" your efforts may or may not be in vain. Give it a try, but know that any shrinking method won't be as effective. It could also shrink in certain places and not in others. Worth a shot?"

Since a bit of color loss may happen, it's important to shrink your items separately (unless they're the same color, of course). You may wish to stir the fabric with a wooden spoon to ensure that it is completely soaked. If you only want your item to shrink a bit, bring the water to a rolling boil, take it off the burner, and wait 5 minutes before you put your shirt in. The longer you wait, the less it'll shrink. Put directly into the water it can shrink up to 2 sizes."

If it's 100% cotton but \"preshrunk,\" you'll need to weigh your options. It's possible it won't shrink it all, that it'll shrink only in certain places, or that it'll shrink just fine."
