      "title": "Figure out your teacher’s marital status.",
      "content": "Figure out your teacher’s marital status. Check out their ring finger on their left hand. Is there a wedding ring? If so, you’ll need to decide if that is an obstacle that will deter you from pursuing them. If there is no ring, try to determine if they have a significant other. Some professors may casually mention their boyfriend, girlfriend, or fiancé in class. Listen up, and see if they throw out any hints. You can also ask current or former students if they’ve heard anything about their relationship status. If you can locate them on Facebook, that’s a great way to figure out if they’re available or taken. If you can’t determine their relationship status from afar, be bold. After class, walk up to your professor and say something like, “Hi, Professor! I think I saw you and your [girlfriend or boyfriend] at a restaurant last weekend. Was that you?” Hopefully, bluffing will get you some information. If you’re lucky, they’ll give away some valuable clues in their answer. Don’t make assumptions about their sexual orientation. If you’ve determined they are single, try to ask around to make sure they’re even interested in your gender! However, even if your teacher is believed to be straight, remember they can also be bisexual, or their sexual orientation may not be known on campus."

      "content": "Research your university’s policy on student-teacher relationships. Some universities ban them completely, while others only strongly discourage them. This information may not make a difference to you, but it can help you determine how difficult it might be to convince your professor. Your relationship may be technically permissible, and therefore it may not take much convincing at all. If it’s forbidden, the challenge (and the scandal) may simply make the relationship more exciting. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Determine the risk and reward. If you signed up for a random class solely in hopes of seducing the professor, you may not have much to lose. However, if your professor is also the head of the department for your major, you should probably consider outcomes before diving in headfirst. [2] X Research source When it comes to matters of the heart, though, sometimes you have to throw logic out the window. If the professor rejects you, will you be OK? If you know you have to take three more courses with them to get your major, tread carefully. Classes can be even more difficult if you have a strained relationship with your professor. If you successfully seduce them, could a relationship negatively affect your academic future?"

      "title": "Be a good student.",
      "content": "Be a good student. Pay attention in class and act interested in the material being taught. Participate in class discussions, answer questions, and take good notes. Stay off your cell phone and avoid daydreaming. Look truly interested in every word your professor is saying. While being a good student won’t seduce them, it will lay the groundwork. Remember, they are doing their job, and your interest in the subject will please them. [3] X Research source Even if you are unable to seduce them, at least you may get an A by paying attention and working hard."

    {
      "title": "Look good in class.",
      "content": "Look good in class. While you may think that professors are much too intellectual to care about appearance, they’re still human. If you look like a slob, you probably won’t catch their eye. Keep your outfits school-appropriate, but wear things that flatter you. Looking neat and polished will also show them that you respect their class. Try to look more elegant and mature than your peers: a vest instead of a hoodie or a nice knee-length skirt for girls will make you look more professional and equal to your professor. Putting a little extra effort into your appearance can also raise your confidence. If you look poised and self-assured, you’ll look more like an equal."

    {
      "title": "Use body language.",
      "content": "Use body language. Smile at your professor in class, and try to hold their eye contact whenever you can. [4] X Research source Nod slightly whenever you think they make a great point, just to show them that you’re listening and agreeing. Be a little shameless– if you know you have a great physical feature, find a way to discreetly show it off. Bend over to grab a pen, adjust your clothing to give a little peek, or simply take your time walking to your seat before class begins. The goal is to get their eyes on you. Don't stare while making eye contact. If they catch you looking, simply hold their gaze for a little longer than it's socially comfortable, and smile. If they smile back at you, it's a good sign!"

      "title": "Go to office hours.",
      "content": "Go to office hours. Many professors are required to hold office hours and a lot of students do not take advantage of them. Check your professor’s office hours, which they typically provide at the beginning of the semester. Go to their office hours regularly to get help with an assignment, talk about exam prep, or ask for help with a paper. Not only will they be impressed with your work ethic, but you’ll stick out. You won’t just be a face in the crowd of students, and you’ll form a bond. [5] X Research source Don't come to their office hours every week if you don't have anything to discuss. However, once you have developed the habit of seeing your professor during their office hours, you may come and just talk for a while about any other topic, not related with school. By this time, they will probably realize you are interested in them. Familiarity can lead to fondness. Simply getting in face time with your professor can lead to them developing feelings."

    {
      "title": "Talk to them before and after class.",
      "content": "Talk to them before and after class. Try to arrive to your classroom or lecture hall a few minutes early, and make it a point to greet your professor with a smile. Say hello, ask them how their day is going, discuss an aspect of the class, whatever! [6] X Research source Just make time to talk to them one-on-one. They will appreciate your friendly and outgoing nature."

    {
      "title": "Email them.",
      "content": "Email them. Ask them with a question about class or about a homework assignment. Share your thoughts on an interesting discussion brought up during class. Send them a link to an article that you think they would find interesting. Just do anything to make yourself stand out, and find reasons to start a dialogue. In your e-mails, stay professional, but a little bit playful. If you're sending an e-mail at night or during a day off, think of a witty way to justify this. If your professor uses smileys, include a winky face too. Every professor's boundaries in correspondence are different, and you have to figure out the best way of writing to your teacher. You don't want to be just another student who sends them boring e-mails every other day. Even if you want to talk to them every day, limit your correspondence unless it’s absolutely clear that your professor wants to speak that much as well. If you overdo it, you will be a nuisance."

      "title": "Engage them in conversation unrelated to class.",
      "content": "Engage them in conversation unrelated to class. This technique works particularly well during office hours. If they seem friendly and not pressed for time, try talking about topics unrelated to class. Inquire about their hobbies and interests, ask for advice on an issue unrelated to school, or tell them about something you’re passionate about. Ask them about their background and how they became a professor. By talking about subjects other than class, you can show them that you’re more than simply their student. You’re a three-dimensional person, just like them, and you can start to form a relationship like friends– and hopefully more! Although you can try this technique before or after class, usually professors don’t have much time to hang around and chat. Office hours also provide the luxury of privacy."

      "title": "Drop hints.",
      "content": "Drop hints. Unless you summon up the courage to put yourself out there, you probably won’t be able to set the stage for seduction. Put a little gift and a note on their desk. [7] X Research source It doesn’t have to be anything major – maybe just a new pen or a baked good. In your note, write something beyond what a student would typically say to a professor, such as, “I was thinking of you and thought this would make you happy.” It doesn’t have to be a declaration of love or a raunchy offer, but just a little something to show that you see them as more than simply your professor. Try to think of something small that your professor really needs. Do they constantly borrow pens from students? Get them one. Are they usually tired in class? Offer them a coffee. Do they complain about not having enough time to eat? Bring them a home-made muffin. This way, you can keep the note playful and light. If they ask you about the gift, or even try to give it back to you, don’t shy away. Tell them that you really like them, and you want them to have it."

    {
      "title": "Pay attention to their signals.",
      "content": "Pay attention to their signals. Observe how your professor interacts with you versus other students. Do they give you a lot of eye contact? Are they friendly and receptive to your attempts at conversation? Do they treat you differently than other students? If they don’t seem interested, don’t push them."

      "title": "”Bump” into them outside of class.",
      "content": "”Bump” into them outside of class. This may or may not be possible, but it is a great thing to do if you can manage it. Try to find out where they spend time on the weekends or after class. If they mentioned being a regular at a certain coffee shop near campus, do your studying there. If they brought up that their favorite musician was playing a gig that weekend, get tickets. If you’re committed to seducing them, go the extra mile to see them outside the classroom walls. Not only will this give you more time with them and another opportunity to prove you’re more than just a student, it will also show them that you have similar interests and hobbies. Don't be a stalker! If you 'accidentally' bump into your professor at a concert, you can ask them if they are going to the next one/another concert of a similar band. If they eat lunch at the same place every day, ask them if you can sit with them."

      "title": "Make a move at the end of the semester.",
      "content": "Make a move at the end of the semester. Make an appointment to talk with them after final grades have been submitted. Ask for their advice about a class next semester or admission to professional school. Try to steer the conversation towards other topics as well. If they seem receptive and you are feeling brave, casually ask them to coffee. Don’t make a move before the semester has ended. Most professors will not date you before the course has ended because of ethical and professional conflict."
