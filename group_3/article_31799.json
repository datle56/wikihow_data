      "content": "Turn the lift's firefighter's key switch from \"OFF\" to \"ON\". This key switch is red and brightly colored. This will send all elevators in the bank or building to the ground or skylobby floor. This will also occur if the fire alarm is triggered in the building. The firefighter's hat will illuminate, the elevator floor indicator may blink, and the elevator will then indicate to passengers to exit when the doors open."

      "title": "Verify that all elevators in the bank or the building have recalled to the ground or skylobby floor.",
      "content": "Verify that all elevators in the bank or the building have recalled to the ground or skylobby floor. In the event of an emergency, this will free passengers that may have become trapped because of a power surge or power loss. If there are elevators that have not made it to the ground floor, you may have to initiate a rescue."

      "title": "Ensure that there is no smoke, heat, or water inside of the lift shaft.",
      "content": "Ensure that there is no smoke, heat, or water inside of the lift shaft. If there is, use a different elevator or take the stairs up to the fire floor. Look up and shine a flashlight to check for signs of fire. You do not want to unnecessarily endanger yourself if there is a fire on a specific floor. Some buildings will have a dedicated firefighter's elevator or elevator bank that services all floors and that can be used in an emergency. This lift can be used in fire service and will be labeled with \"Firefighter's Elevator\" or \"Fireman's Lift\". Do not use the lift if an alarm was sent from outside one of the floor landings or machine room. This can be verified by checking if the firefighter's hat blinks instead of illuminates solid."

      "title": "Open the fire service operation cabinet to access the firefighter's buttons.",
      "content": "Open the fire service operation cabinet to access the firefighter's buttons. These buttons include call cancel, fire service, door open, door close, and emergency stop. In destination dispatch elevators, this should also include the floor selector. Some elevators do not have a cabinet but still do have fire switches."

      "title": "Put the lift into fire service operation.",
      "content": "Put the lift into fire service operation. Turn the fire service key from \"OFF\" to \"ON\" or \"FIRE SERV\". This will unlock the floor panel and allow it to be used by firefighting. The firefighters hat, the letters \"FS\", or the words \"Fire Service\" should appear on the floor indicator to indicate that the elevator is in firefighter's control."

    {
      "title": "Verify that each button works.",
      "content": "Verify that each button works. If a button does not function as expected, then do not use this specific elevator. Turn the fire service key back to \"OFF\" and find an appropriate elevator to use. To test the call cancel button, select a floor. Press the call cancel button to deselect all floors. In motion, this will stop the elevator and park it at the nearest available floor. To test the emergency stop button, select a floor. The stop button should deselect the floor immediately. In motion, this will activate the emergency brakes and bring the elevator to a stop. You may have to move the stop switch back into the \"RUN\" position to use the lift again. To test the door open and door close buttons press and hold them. Upon releasing them the door should stop moving and reverse direction. That means that when the door is closing the door should reopen, and when the door is opening the door should reclose. The door automatically closing is important to prevent smoke from entering the elevator, and the door automatically reopening is important to prevent closure on limbs. Door sensors should be rendered inoperable to prevent smoke from holding the lift door open. Some lifts only have a door open button and do not have a call cancel button. In this case, pressing and holding a specific floor should close the door and select it. Releasing that floor should reopen the door. All floor buttons should illuminate, even if they are normally locked by a security system."

It is recommended to select a floor a few floors above where you started. This will allow you to test for fire and smoke and later change to the stairs before smoke gets too thick. Be aware of any rescues you may need to make with occupants unable to descend stairs, such as the elderly or those in wheelchairs."

If you see any of these in the lift shaft, then put on your firefighting equipment, exit the elevator, and take the stairs up to the floor of the reported fire. When exiting the elevator, turn the key switch from \"ON\" to \"HOLD\". This will lock out the lift and prevent people from using it. The key can also be removed in this position."
