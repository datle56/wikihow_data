      "title": "Get a passport.",
      "content": "Get a passport. National passports are essential for those traveling out of their country. You will need to gather evidence of citizenship to qualify for a passport, (including your birth certificate, certificate of citizenship, driver's license, or previous passport). Once you have gathered the required documents, apply by mail or at a passport agency. Some countries require passports to have at least six months of validity remaining. If your passport is close to expiring, renew it at least one to two months before you travel. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "File for a visa, if necessary.",
      "content": "File for a visa, if necessary. To enter a foreign country legally, you may need a travel visa issued by the consulate or embassy of the country where you're traveling to. Depending on why you're entering the country, you may need either a work visa, student visa, or fixed-term visit visa. [2] X Research source If you're traveling for leisure purposes, verify whether getting a visa is even necessary - many countries have policies for passport-holders of certain countries where the visa requirement is waived if your whole trip is shorter than a certain amount of time, while others have visa-on-arrival policies where a visa can be purchased at the airport you arrive at for a fee just before the immigration checkpoint. Depending on the country, you can submit your application via mail or online. After the information has been reviewed, you may need to attend an interview with a consular officer. Plan ahead. A visa application can take anywhere from several weeks to a month to fill out. If your visa is rejected, ask for an appeal. Check the consular website of your intended country for information on appeals."
