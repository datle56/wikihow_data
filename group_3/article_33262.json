      "content": "Play with 2-5 total players. Monopoly Deal revolves around the spirit of competition—with this in mind, you’ll need at least 1 person to play against! If you’ve got at least 6 people who want to play, that’s okay—just grab 2 decks of Monopoly Deal so you have enough cards for everyone. For reference, each Monopoly Deal deck has 4 quick-start cards, 34 action cards, 28 property cards, 13 rent cards, 20 money cards, and 11 property wildcards. Double-check that each deck has this exact number of cards if you’re playing with more than 1. [1] X Research source Each deck has a specific ratio of action cards: 2 “Deal Breaker” cards, 3 “Just Say No” cards, 3 “Sly Deal” cards, 4 “Force Deal” cards, 3 “Debt Collector” cards, 3 “It’s My Birthday” cards, 10 “Pass Go” Cards, 3 “House” cards, 3 “Hotel” cards, and 2 “Double The Rent” cards. Each deck also has a specific number of money cards (counted in millions): one 10M card, two 5M cards, three 4M cards, five 2M cards, and six 1M cards."

Then, deal 5 cards face-down to each player. [3] X Research source You’re welcome to look at the cards in your hand, but don’t sneak a peek at anyone else’s. Keep these cards face-down when you’re not holding them."

There are 3 ways you can “play” during a Monopoly Deal turn: moving cards into your bank pile, assembling property sets, and/or playing an action card. Feel free to do 1, 2, and/or all 3 of these things during your turn. [7] X Research source For instance, you might play 1 action card, move 1 card to the bank, and arrange 1 card in a property set. Or, you could place 3 cards in your bank pile on your turn. You don’t have to play a card if you don’t want to! However, you’ll have to get rid of extra cards if you have more than 7 in your hand at one time."

This number is the cash value of your card. Place any money or action cards into your bank pile to redeem their cash value. [8] X Research source A typical match of Monopoly Deal can be fast-moving, with your fellow players charging you rent on their properties. When you save money in your bank pile, you’ll be able to pay back other players quickly and easily. For example, if you place a 3-million dollar money card and 1-million dollar action card in your bank, you’d have 4 million dollars at your disposal. Once your cards are added to the bank pile, you can’t use them for anything else."

Place up to 3 property cards face-up on the play surface in front of you. [9] X Research source Wildcards have 2 solid-colored bars on opposite ends, and can work with 2 types of property sets. However, you can only apply a wildcard to 1 card set. Flip the card upward so it matches the other cards in the corresponding property set."

Switch properties with another player using a Forced Deal card, or steal a single property with a Sly Deal card. Add 3 million dollars to a property set’s total rent value with a House card, or add 4 million with a Hotel card. Force all players to play you 2 million dollars with an It’s My Birthday card, or use a Just Say No card to get out of any forced action.

Play a split-colored rent card to charge the player of your choice for rent on your corresponding property. You can also play a rainbow-colored wildcard, which lets you choose which property to charge rent on. [11] X Research source You can only charge 1 player per rent card. You can use split-color rent cards if you have at least 1 of the property colors in your property sets. You can only use the “Double The Rent” action card when also using a rent card.

Unless you have a “Just Say No” action card, you’ll have to comply with whatever card or cards they put down. You can’t get change back in Monopoly Deal—If you don’t have the exact amount of rent money, you’ll have to overpay the player.
