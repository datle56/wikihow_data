Hand each player sheets of paper and a writing utensil. For example, players may write down musicians like Elton John or Taylor Swift, athletes like John Elway or Lebron James, or fictional characters like Draco Malfoy or Alien Galathynius. Use pieces of paper that are small, card-sized, and easy to hold in your hand. To make things a bit easier, you could use index cards or square notepaper."
