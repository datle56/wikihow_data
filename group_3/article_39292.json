      "content": "Choose a razor. You want a razor that’s comfortable to hold and sharp. There are several different types of razors to choose from. The straight razor is the sharpest option and usually takes the most time and skill. This razor might not be the best option for shaving with water unless you’ve been using it for a while. The safety razor (or a double-edged razor) is another option if you want a close shave. It’s also usually used with shaving products, but you can use it with water if you know how to use it. [1] X Research source Disposable razors are probably the best option for shaving with water. They’re easy to clean, and you can dispose of the blades (or entire razor) after a few uses. Electric razors can easily be used on dry or watered skin. The trade-off is that you won’t get as close of a shave as you would with any of the other options."

      "content": "Make sure your blade is sharp. If you aren’t sure if your blade is sharp enough, you can test it with a few methods. Wet your thumbnail and drag it across the edge of the razor, without applying pressure. You should be able to tell how sharp it is by feel. This test isn’t as reliable as some others, but it’s quick. [2] X Research source You can also drag the pad of your thumb across the edge of the blade to test its sharpness. If it’s sharp, you’ll feel a sticking sensation. Be careful not to apply too much pressure or you’ll cut yourself. [3] X Research source Shave a section of your hair to see how many strokes it takes to get a clean shave. It shouldn't take many (1 or 2). [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Wet your skin with warm water. Cover the whole area you’re shaving. The warm water will help open up your pores, making it easier to pull the hairs out of their follicles when you shave. [6] X Research source You can also place a warm cloth on your skin for a few minutes. Another option is to shave in the shower with the water falling onto your skin. If you go this route, shave at the end of the shower. By then, your skin will be moisturized and you’ll get a cleaner shave."

      "title": "Press the razor firmly against your skin.",
      "content": "Press the razor firmly against your skin. Don’t press hard enough to draw blood, but give enough pressure to remove the hair at the follicle. Angle your razor so that the blade is not placed at a 90-degree angle to your skin. Something closer to a 45-degree angle is what you’re aiming for."

So, if your hairs grow toward the floor, pull your razor downward, toward the floor. [7] X Research source [8] X Research source First shave the sections that don’t have any tricky corners or crevices. Shave the tricky spots last. For these areas, you might need to stretch the skin with your fingertips. You don’t have shaving cream to show you where you’ve shaved, so pay close attention. You might have to go over some spots twice."
