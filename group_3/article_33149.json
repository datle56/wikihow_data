Once the players have gathered into their corners, select a player to be “it.” Once you’ve selected the person who’s “it,” have them stand in the middle of the room and count down from 10. Once the time is up, they must point to a corner with their eyes closed. [4] X Research source If the middle player points to an empty corner, any student who’s out gets to return to the game."

While the person who is “it” is counting, the corner players can either stay where they’re at or move to another corner. Once the counter reaches 0 and points to a corner, anyone who is in that corner must sit down. Whoever is in the middle of the room or outside of a corner must also sit down. [5] X Research source"

Have another player stand in the middle of the square designated as “it.” The players must try to trade places without being tagged by “it” or letting “it” stand in their corner. [7] X Research source The French variation of Four Corners is played the same way as the Canadian game, but the fifth player is called the “chamber pot.”"

To play, make a square out of four poles or pillars (or use a four-squared room with the corners as pillars) and have one person stand at each pillar. With one person in the middle designated as “it,” each player must move between pillars while the middle player tries to steal their pillar. Whoever’s pillar is stolen becomes the next person in the middle. [8] X Research source"

Like Four Corners, have someone stand in the middle and have the remaining three people stand in corners facing the wall. Have the person in the middle count down from 3. Once they reach zero, move clockwise to the next corner. If there’s a demon or ghost, they will apparently appear in the missing corner. [9] X Research source This game is fairly simple. Like Bloody Mary , it’s unclear if ghosts or demons will actually come after you or if it’s just for fun."
