      "content": "Take your blinds down . When you paint your blinds, they need to be on a flat surface so you don't drip paint everywhere, which means you need to take them down. Alternatively, you may want to hang them up outside to paint to reduce the mess. Either way, you need to take them down from their indoor location. Usually, individual slats will unhook from the top.

      "content": "Remove the fabric insert from fabric blinds. Some vertical blinds have a fabric insert, while others are just fabric on one side and vinyl on the other. If yours have the insert, pull it out before you start painting. You may need to slip a credit card between the slat and the fabric to get it going. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Wash your blinds thoroughly. If your blinds have been hanging up for any length of time, they likely have dirt and grime on them. Wash them with soapy, warm water. Dish soap works well for this purpose. [3] X Research source It can be easier to take them outside to scrub. Some blinds are machine washable. Check the tag to make sure yours are. Coil them together in a pillowcase, and put them in the washing machine with a few towels. Use the gentle cycle, warm water, and detergent. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Let the blinds dry.",
      "content": "Let the blinds dry. Before painting, your blinds will need plenty of time to dry. If they're fabric, you may want to let them dry overnight. Lay them out flat, and turn them over after a few hours so both sides can dry. For vinyl blinds, you can wipe them down to speed up the process. The blinds should be completely dry before you start painting."

      "content": "Pick a spray paint. If you have fabric blinds, you should pick a spray paint meant for fabric, which you can find at a craft store. If you have vinyl or a combination of vinyl and fabric, pick a multi-surface spray paint. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Hang up the blinds outside.",
      "content": "Hang up the blinds outside. When using spray paint, it's easiest to paint the blinds when they are hanging up. However, you want to do it outside, as it can be very messy. Try hanging them on a clothesline or even nailing or hanging individual blinds to the fence. If you nail up your blinds, drive a nail into the fence and then hang the blinds by the hole at the top, where you'd normally place them on the hook. If you're worried about getting spray paint on your fence, place something behind the slats such as a tarp or cardboard. Obviously, this will only work on wooden fences. Use clothespins to hang them on the line. If you don't have a backyard, you can lay them flat. Just make sure to use a well-ventilated area. Pick a day that isn't windy or humid."

      "content": "Spray the blinds down. Spray a light coat up and down each blind. Wait for it to dry before applying another coat. You'll need 2 to 3 coats to get the blinds evenly coated. You don't want to use a thick coat because the paint can run or bubble. [6] X Research source You may need to flip the blinds top to bottom halfway through so you can get the part that's under the clip at the top."

      "content": "Lay the blinds down next to each other. Lay down the number of blinds equal to the width of your stencil. That could be 2 to 4 blinds in a row. Line them up, making sure the ends are even with each other. It can help to tape down the blinds to the surface at the top and bottom using painter's tape. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Place a small amount of stencil creme on your brush. Use a round stencil brush, and add a tiny bit of paint. You don't want to use too much, as you'll end up with a mess. Dab off any extra paint on a sponge or paper towel. You can buy stencil creme at craft stores. You can also use other vinyl or fabric paints."
