Apps like \"Unfollow Users Cleaner\" might seem like fantastic apps to mass remove those you follow, but there are many reports of privacy issues and ghost actions on their accounts that have this app. These apps may claim to do exactly what you need them to do, but then end up stealing your login information and hacking your Instagram account instead. These apps may have been legitimate in the past, but have since fallen into disuse. \"Unfollow Users Cleaner\" hasn't been updated since 2022 or received a rating since 2021. Mass unfollowing apps might also trigger Instagram's spam filter, which could lead to account restrictions or even a shadowban."

[1] X Research source Instagram implements limits in an attempt to keep spam to a minimum. They want their users to be human instead of bots. Some third-party services claim to act more human-like to avoid Instagram's consequences, but that is never 100% guaranteed. Signing up with a third-party service that mass unfollows profiles can trigger Instagram into thinking your account is a bot."

If you're not looking at a category, tap the three-dot button next to the Message button, then tap the red Unfollow button. In the browser, simply click the Following button next to the user you don't want to follow anymore."

[3] X Research source While Instagram has never confirmed if it has limits on the amount of accounts you can unfollow or follow in a day, many users have encountered these limits. [4] X Research source If your account is newer, you can unfollow 50 accounts per day. If your account is older than 6 months, you can unfollow around 200-400 accounts per day. If you go over this limit, you might see an \"Action Blocked\" error or earn yourself a shadowban . If you use third-party services and continuously go over this limit, you might get permanently banned."

These accounts may act human to avoid spam detection, but there are a few tell-tale signs that they are fake: [5] X Research source Their following count is way higher than their followers count.

      "content": "People who unfollowed you or those who never followed you. While your follower-to-following ratio doesn't really matter unless you're an influencer, [6] X Research source it can still be fun to figure out what your ratio is. You can also use this ratio to avoid accounts that are probably bots or spam accounts. If you have 10,000 followers and follow 1,000 accounts, your follow ratio is 10 (or 10:1). An account with 1,000 followers and 150 accounts that they follow appears to be more of a consumer account: they consume more content than create it. If an account has 145k followers and only follows 150 accounts, that person is most likely a creator and pushes out a lot of content. An account with less than a following ratio of .5 (0.5:1) is most likely a spam account using follow-back schemes to gain followers. An account with a following ratio between .5 and 1 (0.5-1:1) is a low-quality account. They aren't necessarily spam, but the account holder isn't particularly picky about the accounts they follow and if they get followers back. A 1:2 following ratio is an average following ratio for an account. This takes into account that the account holder follows a lot of celebrities or public figures, but also has a good amount of friends or networked followed accounts. A 2:10 following ratio signifies a quality account. These accounts are most likely worth a follow and tend to follow back. Accounts with a following ratio of 10:300,000+ are influencers. This sort of account gains a lot of followers and has a large influence."
