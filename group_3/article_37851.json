Let a neighbor, teacher, school counselor, or another adult family member know what is happening in your home. There are people who want to help you. Your abuser may have threatened you or told you not to tell; do not listen to them. If the first person you tell does not believe you, find another adult and tell them. Not every adult is a good listener, and if you aren't taken seriously, it doesn't mean your problem isn't real or serious. The adult you tell may call the police or call Child Protective Services."

Also, living on the streets can be very dangerous. Ask yourself some questions before you run away: [1] X Research source Do you have somewhere to go? Do you have resources? How will you continue to go to school and get an education? Who will you depend on if you leave home? What will you do about it? Have you reached out to anyone about your situation at home?

Good ways to make quick money include doing odd jobs around your neighborhood, babysitting, taking care of other people's pets, running your own business (e.g. sell candy, give manicures, sell any extra items) and house-sitting for friends and neighbors. If you get lunch money everyday, try to eat light or skip lunch and save the money instead. If you are 18, you can open a bank account on your own to keep your money. If you are still a minor, you will not be able to open an account without your parent or legal guardian. [2] X Research source"
