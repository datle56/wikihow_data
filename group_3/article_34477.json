      "content": "Know what a sexual predator is. A sexual predator is a person who harms other people in a sexual way. For example, they may touch others inappropriately or force them to watch inappropriate videos. They will often lie and manipulate you to get what they want, which is sex. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Understand that anyone could be a sexual predator.",
      "content": "Understand that anyone could be a sexual predator. People of any race, gender, religion, or class can be a sexual predator. You can't tell if someone is a sexual predator based on their looks or beliefs. People you know, like family friends or relatives could be sexual predators. You will have to watch their behavior to find out."

      "title": "Notice if the person befriends your caretakers very quickly.",
      "content": "Notice if the person befriends your caretakers very quickly. Predators want to get in contact with their victims very quickly, so they will establish good relations with the parents or relatives of the child first. They will eventually trust them and allow their child to spend time with them."

    {
      "title": "Notice if the person wants to spend a lot of alone time with you.",
      "content": "Notice if the person wants to spend a lot of alone time with you. Normally, a good friend or relative will respect your personal space and time, and they are willing to spend time with you alongside other people. However, if the adult insists on being alone with you frequently, they may be a predator. They want to isolate you in order to harm you where no one is watching."
    },
    {
      "title": "Listen to what the person likes about you.",
      "content": "Listen to what the person likes about you. Adults usually compliment kids based on their behavior. They may give awards if you get good grades or win competitions. Sometimes, parents or relatives may comment on how \"pretty\" or \"well-dressed\" you are. But, if the person only focuses on your appearance, they may be a predator. The person may say suspicious or inappropriate things about your appearance, such as what you look like in revealing clothing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pay attention to if they spoil you.",
      "content": "Pay attention to if they spoil you. After only a few times of meeting the person, they may shower you with gifts and compliment you on everything. They may never say no to your requests; even if this sounds great, it is a warning sign. This is very suspicious, and it may mean that they are disguising their predatory behavior by being super nice to you. [2] X Research source You will gain trust in the person, which will allow them to harm you badly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Notice if they touch you inappropriately.",
      "content": "Notice if they touch you inappropriately. People need to ask permission to touch you because it is polite and establishes boundaries. Sometimes, a person might forget to ask you, so they pat you on the back or bump into your arm by accident. These are accidents, so you don't need to worry too much. However, if the person touches you constantly or they touch you only in private areas (the places covered by your underwear), that person is a sexual predator. The person may find excuses for their behavior. They may say that they want to massage your back to loosen sore muscles or take you swimming at their pool in order to touch you inappropriately."

      "content": "Realize when they try to initiate sex. The person may tell you to undress, and they may touch you inappropriately (with their body or objects) while you are vulnerable. Adults having sex with minors is illegal worldwide, and having sex without the consent of both people is also illegal. This is called rape, and people suffer physical and psychological effects after it happens. This is a major red flag, and you need to tell someone in order to stop the predator.

      "content": "Think about what you and the person talk about. Does the person actively listen to you and talk to you about shared interests, or do they want you to fulfill something they want? If the person only talks about sexual topics, there is a chance that they are a predator. Think about how they describe you. Do they compliment your appearance all the time? If so, they may be a predator."

Being assertive means you are able to voice your opinions without being uncaring of others' feelings. Say something like, \"Please don't touch me there.\" if it's a one-off instance. If it happens again, say, \"Don't touch me!\" loudly; other people around you will hear and tell the person to stop. [5] X Research source [6] X Research source"

Keeping your personal information secret makes it tricky for criminals or predators to harm you. Instead, pick a random username that doesn't include this information. If you can, don't provide your age/school on websites. Don't post personal photos on social media if you are a child. If you are a teenager, limit who can see your posts to only best friends and family. Avoid posting pictures of yourself in your school uniform, especially with your tie or logo visible. Strangers online can find out the school you go to this way."
