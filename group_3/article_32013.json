For example, if you lost a loved one because you were emotionally vacant, try to spend less time in the office and more time at home. Or, for example, the fact that your current partner does not do something that made you end a previous relationship should be comforting."

      "title": "Consider whether your partner is truly the \"one.\"",
      "content": "Consider whether your partner is truly the \"one.\" Deciding if the person is \"right\" has much to do with how high of esteem you hold them in. Do some serious thinking if you will retain your respect for them during inevitable life changes. Their aspirations may be a good way to determine this. What kinds of things might cause you to lose respect for your partner? Drinking habits, money management, treatment of friends? Are these areas where you already have issues with your partner? Think about the history of your relationship with your partner. How has your partner dealt with conflict or other issues thus far? Can your partner's behavior give you clues about past, current, and future respect, flexibility, and compromise?"

      "content": "Think about your long-term commitments. Are you in a career track that will develop over the next several years or decades? Are you making car payments over the course of years? Do you have a house or rent an apartment by the month, or is it a multi-year lease? Nervousness over adding long-term commitments is a common aspect of fearing marriage. If you want to get married, you should make other long-term commitments, such as those named above, to acclimate yourself to the idea."

      "title": "Look at your current level of commitment.",
      "content": "Look at your current level of commitment. There are two kinds of commitment: dedication and constraint. A commitment based on personal dedication means you imagine growing old with your partner, you work together with your partner (like a team), and you can't see yourself with anyone else. A commitment based on constraint means you feel forced to stay in the relationship due to internal or external pressures (children, sharing of possessions, family, a feeling of obligation), you think about leaving your relationship but it feels too difficult or like you have gone \"too far\" to end it, that starting over sounds too difficult. Note that all relationships acquire constraints over time. Think about whether the constraints outweigh your personal dedication to the relationship. If you feel your constraints have increased but your personal dedication has decreased, consider if there are ways to reduce your feelings of constraint and increase your personal dedication."

      "content": "Learn to increase commitment. Even if you feel fully committed to the relationship, you may be wondering how to maintain that dedication or worry about it slipping away. Or maybe you feel that it already has begun to decrease. There are actions you can take to increase your commitment to your partner: Invest in your relationship. Remember that difficult periods are temporary. Put in the work to struggle through the hard times with your partner (inevitably there will be some) to emerge a stronger couple. Good times will return. Avoid scorekeeping. You may feel that you are doing more in your relationship; this is because you don't know everything your partner does throughout the day, you only know all the things you have done. Instead of keeping score to determine who loves whom more, focus on the good things your partner does and think about what you can do to make your partner happy. Don't \"hedge your bets.\" Don't hold back from your partner because you're afraid things won't work out. Trying to protect yourself in this way may hurt your relationship, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Assume that things are going to work out and be open and honest with your partner and work hard to strengthen your relationship."

You need to open up those channels of communication, however. If you are scared of losing your individuality or changing, remind yourself that everyone is changing, constantly. Staying unmarried will not keep the earth from spinning. Also, it's not like you lose all agency when you get married.

Even if you still think so, remember that your future is not determined by marriage or divorce statistics, and you can hold on to a marriage if you put work into it."
