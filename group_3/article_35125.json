      "title": "Recognizing blood pressure reading features.",
      "content": "Recognizing blood pressure reading features. Your blood pressure reading is made up of two numbers, a top and bottom one. The top number is called the systolic pressure and the bottom one is the diastolic. The systolic number shows how hard the pressure is when your heart has to pump blood, while the diastolic number is the pressure when your heart is resting between beats. [11] X Research source Read the number as, for example, “110 over 90.” You may see a mmHg after the number, which stands for the millimeters of mercury, or the units used to measure your blood pressure. Be aware that most doctors will pay more attention to the systolic pressure (the first number), as it is a better measure of the risk for cardiovascular disease in people over the age of 50. The systolic number generally increases with age because of factors such as increasing stiffness in the large arteries, long-term build up of plaque, and increased frequency of cardiac and vascular diseases.

Although most people will measure and watch blood pressure over time, there are some instances when a rapid spike in either systolic or diastolic pressure requires immediately medical attention. This can ensure that your blood pressure is brought back to normal and minimizes the risk of severe health consequences such as heart attack and damage to your organs. [15] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source Take a second reading if you get one high reading. Seek immediate medical attention if second reading is a systolic pressure over 180 or a diastolic over 110. You may have one number high and the other one normal or both could be high. Either way, it’s important to get medical attention as soon as possible. Be aware that you may experience physical symptoms such as severe headache, shortness of breath, nosebleeds, and severe anxiety with a high systolic or diastolic reading."

Most doctors don’t consider low pressure (for example, a reading of 85/55) a problem unless it is accompanied by noticeable signs and symptoms.

[17] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source Be aware that one abnormal reading doesn’t necessarily mean you have high or low blood pressure; however, if levels stay at the same reading over a few weeks or months, it’s important to see your doctor to rule out underlying medical conditions.
