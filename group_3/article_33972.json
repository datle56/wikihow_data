      "content": "Create a study schedule for yourself. Set aside a block of time every day for your studies. Work in 30-minute to 2-hour blocks to help yourself retain the most information. It’s best to list the topics or subjects you plan to study each day to help you stay on track. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Schedule your studies for the time of day when you feel most alert. For example, you might study for 1 hour every morning after breakfast and 1 hour every evening after dinner. If you were studying for your medical board exams, you might spend the first hour studying concepts related to cardiovascular conditions, while the second hour is dedicated to the respiratory system. If you're studying for your 10th year board exams, you might spend the first hour studying history , and the second hour studying geography."

      "content": "Designate an organized, distraction-free study space. Study in a clean space, such as at a desk or table. Turn off your phone, television, radio, and other distractions. Keep all of your materials at hand so you have what you need to study. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If listening to music helps you, choose stimulating music that doesn’t distract you from your studies. For example, you might listen to classical music. If you don't want to turn off your phone because of work or family concerns, put your phone in the next room. This way, you'll be able to hear it if you receive a call, but you won't be tempted to check it constantly."

      "title": "Review your syllabus or exam prep book and identify the main topics.",
      "content": "Review your syllabus or exam prep book and identify the main topics. Focus your studies on major ideas and concepts you’re expected to know. Study one main idea or concept at a time. Spend more time on topics that you’ve struggled to master in the past. [3] X Research source Don’t worry about minor details, such as dates and quotes, until you’ve gotten a basic understanding of the main ideas and concepts. You’ll perform better on most exams if you have a broad knowledge of the topic rather than a few memorized facts. To keep yourself organized, you might write the topics you need to study into your schedule. You might also review prior tests or check the board exam website to identify the best areas to study."

      "content": "Review your prior work to identify weak areas you need to study. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Knowing yours can help you more easily prepare for your exams. Go through any graded assignments you have or talk to your instructor or supervisor. You might also review the list of concepts you’re expected to know. Make a list of areas you need to spend more time studying. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You might spend less time studying material that falls under your strengths. Use the time you save to spend more time on the areas that are weaknesses for you. Taking pre-tests or practice tests will also help you uncover areas you need to study more. For example, if you're taking your medical board exams, you could use your test results from an In-Training Exam to determine which topics need more attention."

[6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Taking additional notes will also help you commit the ideas to memory. Re-read as much of the material as you can in the time you have to study. You may only have time to go over certain sections. Spend this time on areas where you’ve struggled. For example, you might go through your old textbooks to review highlighted portions and topics you struggled with the first time. If you have time, read up on current events or current peer-reviewed articles. For instance, when preparing for medical board exams, you might read medical journals related to your field."

A mnemonic device is a sentence or story where the first letter of each word represents something you need to remember. It might spell a word, represent a series, or remind you of a concept you need to know. As another option, you can create a rhyme using the information you need to remember. [11] X Research source For example, you might remember the planets of the Milky Way with the following mnemonic device: “My very excellent mother just served us nuggets.” This helps you remember Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. As an example of a rhyme, you might need to remember that litmus paper turns blue for bases and pink for acids. Your rhyme might be, “Bases are blue, acids are pink, use litmus paper, to help you think.”"

      "content": "Set the information to music for easy recall. Making up a song to a popular tune can help you remember difficult concepts. Choose your favorite song or a simple tune like “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.” It doesn’t matter if your song rhymes, as long as you can remember it. [12] X Research source Sing your song aloud to yourself to help you remember it. During your exam, you can sing it to yourself in your head. Use this trick for information that’s hard to remember. You likely won’t be able to create a song for every concept you’ll need to remember. For instance, Harvard Medical School students have produced a few songs about medical information, which are available on YouTube. [13] X Research source"

[19] X Research source If more than one prior test is available, use one to study the format and types of questions. Treat this test as a set of practice questions. Then, use another test as a practice test. When you’re doing a practice test, treat it like the real thing. Take the test in a quiet location and time yourself according to the test rules.
