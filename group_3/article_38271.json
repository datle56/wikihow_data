      "content": "Use the formula \"El numéro de mes .\" When someone asks you the date in Spanish, you'll always follow the same formula. Start with el (ELL), followed by the number that corresponds to the day. Then say de (DAY) followed by the name of the month. [2] X Research source You can start by saying hoy es (OY ESS) before the date, which means \"today is.\" For example, if someone asked you the date, you could say \"Hoy es el dos de febrero,\" or \"Today is February second.\" In most contexts it is also acceptable simply to say the date."

    {
      "title": "Start with the number of the day.",
      "content": "Start with the number of the day. In English, ordinals (such as \"second\" or \"third\") are often used to say the date. In Spanish, however, you always just use the number. To say the date in Spanish you'll need to know the words for all the numbers from one to 31. There is one exception to this rule. When you are talking about the first of the month in Spanish, you use the word primero , which means \"first.\" If you aren't yet comfortable with your numbers, practice counting in Spanish . You can also post notes around your house with the numeral and the Spanish word for that number so you get used to associating the two."

      "content": "Pronounce the month correctly. After saying the day, you'll add the word de (DAY) and then say the month of the year. If you don't already have the months of the year in Spanish memorized, buy a Spanish calendar so you're looking at them regularly. [3] X Research source January is enero (ay-NAIR-oh). February is febrero (fay-BRAY-roh). March is marzo (MAR-soh). April is abril (AH-breel). May is mayo (MY-oh). June is junio (HOO-nee-oh). July is julio (HOO-lee-oh). August is agosto (ah-GOHS-toh). September is septiembre (sayp-tee-AIM-bray). October is octubre (ahk-TOO-bray). November is noviembre (noh-bee-AIM-bray). December is diciembre (dee-see-AIM-bray)."

If you do, simply add another de after the month followed by the number that corresponds to the year. [4] X Research source In English you may have become accustomed to a shortened way of expressing years. For example, if you want to say 1991 in English, you would say \"nineteen ninety-one.\" However, in Spanish you say the whole number: \"mil novecientos noventa y uno,\" or \"one thousand nine hundred and ninety one.\""

Start with \"el\" for \"the,\" then separate the other parts of the date with the word \"de.\" [5] X Research source Just as in speech, there is an exception when you're talking about the first of the month. Use the numeral 1 with a superscripted o that looks similar to a degree symbol when writing the first: 1º. This symbolizes \"the first\" in Spanish. For example, you could write, \"Hoy es 1º de febrero,\" or \"Today is February 1st.\""

[13] X Research source Hacer + length of time + que (KAY) + the past tense conjugation of the verb describes an action that occurred at a particular point in time in the past. For example, you might say \"Hace tres años que empecé a trabajar aquí\" to mean \"I started working here three years ago.\" To talk about a past action that continues into the present, use hacer with the present tense conjugation of the verb.
