      "content": "People mirror someone’s body language when they like them. Do a little experiment: when you take a sip of your drink, does he take a sip of his? If you put your hands on your hips, does he copy you? If you notice him mimicking your every move, it likely means that he’s attracted to you. [3] X Research source Humans do this subconsciously, so it’s unlikely that he knows that he’s doing it. If you want to flirt back, try copying his body language, too. You don’t have to be super obvious about it, but if he crosses his legs, try crossing yours, too."

      "content": "Our pupils get bigger when we see someone attractive. This is a body language tell that he won’t be able to fake. When you first go up to him, look deep into his eyes and pay attention to his pupils. If he’s into you, they’ll get noticeably wider the first time he sees you. [12] X Research source Keep in mind that pupils also dilate in response to light changes. So if you walk into a super dark room, his pupils will also dilate right then. Want to be super flirtatious? Call him out! Say, “Did you know your pupils just dilated? I think that means you think I’m cute.”"

Yes, it’s true—if you notice that he’s sitting back with his legs spread, he’s subconsciously trying to give you a peek at his, ah… package. Fortunately, most guys aren’t aware they’re doing this, so you can take this as a positive sign rather than a creepy red flag. [21] X Research source He might also stand with his legs wide and his hands on his hips for the same reason. With this body language cue, it’s best not to stare down there too much.
