      "content": "Match the length of your rivet to the thickness of your materials. The rivet should be long enough to get through the material you’re using with about 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) to spare. Stack your materials together and measure their height, then add the additional 1/8 inch to find out how long your rivet should be. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose single cap rivets for one-sided projects.",
      "content": "Choose single cap rivets for one-sided projects. If your rivets will only be visible from one side – like if you’re decorating on a leather bag no one will see the inside of – you can use a single cap rivet. This will give your project a finished look. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use a double cap rivets for two-sided projects.",
      "content": "Use a double cap rivets for two-sided projects. If you’re making something that you can see the front and back of – like the strap of a purse, for example – use double-sided rivets. You install these the same way as single cap rivets – they just give your project a more finished look. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Select copper rivets for a sturdier finish.",
      "content": "Select copper rivets for a sturdier finish. Copper rivets are stronger than regular, silver, “quick” rivets. They’re great for using on any leather work that needs some extra strength. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Mark where you want your hole.",
      "content": "Mark where you want your hole. This is especially important if you’re creating a design that you want to look professional. Make sure you measure out where your holes should be in the leather, and then mark the spot with a marker or pen. Don’t make the mark too big – you want it small enough to disappear when you punch a hole through the leather at that spot."
    },
    {
      "title": "Punch a hole in your leather.",
      "content": "Punch a hole in your leather. You can do this by hand with an awl or with a leather punch. The hole just needs to be big enough for you to get the post of the rivet through."
    },
    {
      "title": "Push the rivet post up through the underside of the leather.",
      "content": "Push the rivet post up through the underside of the leather. The underside of the leather is usually less finished and will often be a lighter color. Make sure you push your rivet up through the leather from this side, or it will end up upside down. Your rivet post should only extend about 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) above the surface of the leather."

    {
      "title": "Place your leather piece on an anvil.",
      "content": "Place your leather piece on an anvil. You can buy pretty small anvils from most leather working supply stores. You only need an anvil big enough to accommodate the size of the leather you’re working on. Place it on the anvil with the bottom of the leather facing down and the post sticking up.

      "title": "Put the rivet cap on top of the post.",
      "content": "Put the rivet cap on top of the post. Some rivet caps will make a clicking or snapping noise when you place it over the top of the post. The rivet cap is the part that looks “finished” – it’s usually brass or copper and has a convex top."

    {
      "title": "Punch a hole in the leather.",
      "content": "Punch a hole in the leather. Copper rivets with washers tend to be larger than your everyday rivets. Make sure when you punch the hole that it’s big enough for a wider rivet post to get through. It should be big enough that you can push the rivet post through the leather but not so big that it slips right through."
