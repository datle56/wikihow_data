Start by lifting each corner of the key, listening and feeling for a snap as it unhooks. Repeat with each corner until the key is removed, after two to four snaps. Use light pressure only. If the key doesn't pop out, try a different corner. To remove larger keys, such as the Shift key and Space bar, lever from the top of the key (the side nearest the laptop screen)."

      "content": "Examine the retaining clip. The retaining clip, most often made out of white plastic, consists of two thin, square objects hooked around each other. These should be firmly attached to the keyboard, and to each other. If they are not, remove the clip by gently twisting the corners free with a screwdriver. See below for detailed instructions on replacing them."

      "content": "Check the silicone rubber membrane. This nipple-shaped membrane sits beneath the center of the key. Confirm that it is standing up, and try to depress it with a very gentle touch from a clean, soft object. If it sticks in the down position instead of popping back up, it needs cleaning or replacement. Do not touch it with a dirty or sharp object. This part of the keyboard is easily damaged. Clean with a lint-free cloth dampened slightly with rubbing alcohol. Pat with extreme care and wait for it to dry."

      "content": "Glue down a new membrane. Before you begin, realize that this is a risky fix, and could ruin the key if you use too much glue. For a more reliable repair, take the keyboard to a computer repair professional to replace the entire keyboard. If you do decide to try this yourself, do so as follows: Very carefully remove a membrane from a key you don't use by levering it off with a sharp knife. [3] X Research source It is very easy to damage the membrane this way, but this is usually your only source of replacement membranes. Use a toothpick to place a dab of strong glue, such as silicone adhesive, onto a sheet of paper. Pick up the membrane with tweezers and lower it onto the sheet of paper, then transfer it onto the keyboard. Let sit for at least 30 minutes, or according to adhesive label instructions. Reattach the retainer and key cap on top of this, and let sit another 20 minutes before using."

Purchase one online, making sure it matches your laptop model and the location of the attachment points. To put in the new key, hook one attachment point onto the keyboard, then rub your finger over the key until you hear two loud snaps, one at each end of the key. Alternatively, remove a key of the same size that you rarely use. Place it in the former key's position."

      "content": "Fix the metal bar on large keys. The space bar and ⇧ Shift keys are held flat by a metal bar. If this bar is not flat, you may need to re-attach it to the small plastic hooks on the keyboard. The bar should run along the lower end of the key, with the short arms of the bar running up the left and right sides and onto the hooks. Once the bar is reattached, press the key cap over it and test it. Once the bar is out of place, it often continues to have minor problems or gets a tendency to slip out of place again. Consider buying a replacement keyboard for your laptop, or having it repaired at a computer repair store. If you are installing a replacement for one of these keys, the replacement will come with its own bar. Remove the old bar first by gently levering it upward with a flat screwdriver.

      "content": "Examine the pieces for breaks. The retaining clip is made out of two pieces. The larger square or U shape fits onto the keyboard base and the key cap. The smaller piece, with a circular hole in the center, fits onto a small tab on the keyboard base. The two pieces fit together with two small tabs, one on either side of the smaller piece. If one of these pieces is missing or broken, order a replacement key or retaining clip for your exact keyboard model. If both pieces seem intact, continue to the next step. Before ordering a replacement key, make sure it includes a retaining clip. These are also sold as \"hinges.\" Alternatively, carefully detach a clip from a key you don't use as often, and reattach it to the broken key. On some models, the tabs are separate pieces. If they fall out, you can slot them back in with a pair of tweezers."
