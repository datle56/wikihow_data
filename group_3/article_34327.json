[1] X Research source Check Apple's official list of AirPrint printers at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201311 to find your model. If your model has AirPrint, it'll be much easier to use AirPrint instead . If you've already tried using your AirPrint-enabled printer but get the message \"No AirPrint Printers Found,\" it usually means the printer you're trying to use is offline, or that you are not connected to the same Wi-Fi network as that printer.
