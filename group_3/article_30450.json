If you're using the new version of Outlook on Windows or have opened Outlook in your web browser, you will see a gear icon at the top-right corner. Before you continue, it's important to know that the Mark as Read settings in these new Outlook versions do not allow you to mark messages as read when double-clicked. Previewing the message in the reading pane is considered \"opened\" in this version, and there is no way to distinguish single- and double-clicking a message. If you don't see a gear icon at the top-right, you're using Outlook Classic. Jump down to the Outlook Classic method instead."
