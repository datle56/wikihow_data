      "content": "Plenty of single Christian women are signed up on different online dating sites . In fact, sites like Christian Mingle, Christian Cafe, Christian Connection, and Christian Cupid are all dedicated to Christian singles looking for a strong, faith-filled relationship. While some of these apps require paid memberships, many offer a short, free trial to new users. [1] X Research source Free Dating Sites: Christian Cupid, Christian Dating for Free, Crosspaths, Upward, Catholic Match, Zoosk Paid Dating Sites: Christian Mingle, Christian Cafe, Christian Connection, eHarmony Keep in mind that many “free” dating sites only offer basic features to free accounts. To get the most out of your online dating experience, a paid membership is often your best bet. This isn’t to say that you can’t meet Christian girls through mainstream dating sites! Some dating platforms, like Bumble, let you filter potential matches by religion. [2] X Research source Stick to sites and apps that are specifically geared toward dating rather than scrolling social media apps like Instagram or Facebook. Reader Poll: We asked 861 wikiHow readers and only 10% think that following and engaging with women's social media accounts is a good way to meet them online. [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Church is the perfect place to find someone who shares your convictions. Chances are, a woman who goes to church of her own volition takes her faith pretty seriously—that already gives you a lot to talk about! Plus, most churches have a “coffee hour” or social time right after the service, which gives you an easy opening to make an introduction. [3] X Research source Feel free to strike up a conversation with a simple “How are you?” or “Great to see you this morning!” If you’ve never talked with her before, ask a question like “Are you a regular here?” or “Is this your first time here?” If meeting a single girl at church feels impossible, just think of Psalm 37:4: “Delight yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart.”"

From Bible studies to weekend activities, small groups give you the chance to meet and get to know different members of your church community. With any luck, you might cross paths with a fellow Christian single. Some churches even have groups dedicated to bringing Christian singles together. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Plenty of churches host big social events outside of their regular services. Maybe your church has a potluck, concert, or other big event on the horizon. Mark your calendar and take some time to stop by when the big day rolls around. Religious events typically have way bigger attendance than your average church service, which makes them the potentially perfect place to meet single Christian women. Ask around to see what events are coming up at your church, or take a peek at your church’s bulletin or website. Tune into the “announcements” portion of the service, if your church has one. This is a great way to stay up-to-date on the latest and greatest events in your spiritual community."

Depending on where you live, there could be a local Christian singles group ready and available for you to join. Open up the website and type in “Christian singles group,” along with your location or zip code. Some groups meet in person, while others take a more virtual approach to the dating scene with video speed-dating nights."

On mission trips, you travel to a different part of the country (or world) to help support the local community. These trips are a great way to not only grow in your faith but to connect and bond with your fellow mission workers—including the single ones! Plenty of Christian organizations plan and manage these trips, like: Experience Mission: https://experiencemission.org/ Mission Finder: https://missionfinder.org/ Lifeline Christian Mission: https://www.lifeline.org/mission-trips Mission Discover: https://www.missiondiscovery.org/"

      "content": "A semi-religious event could be a great place to meet a Christian girl. Not all weddings are religious affairs, but some definitely are. So, if you find yourself invited to a traditional, church-style wedding, try mingling with some of the other guests and see what happens. There are plenty of ways you can strike up a conversation, like: Commenting on the food (“Man, I wish I’d gone for the vegetarian dish. Your ravioli looks awesome!”) Mentioning the weather (“I know they say rain is unlucky, but this still was a really beautiful wedding.”) Asking for an opinion (“Wow, that was some maid of honor speech. What did you think about it?”) [5] X Research source"

[6] X Research source So, if you sign up for a hobby class or course, there’s a statistically good chance that you’ll run into a Christian-identifying woman there. Once you’re at your class or club, break the ice with comments like: “Wow! You’re really good at this. Mind giving me a hand?” “You really seem like you know what you’re doing. I’m assuming you’re not a first-timer?”"

      "content": "Your friends and family might be able to set you up with a Christian girl they know. Maybe your parents have a friend with a single daughter, or your friend has a single, church-going neighbor. There are plenty of possible match-ups out there that are just a phone call or text away, as long as you’re willing to put yourself out there. If you have a mentor in faith, that person can also be helpful. You might say something like: “Hey Daniel! I really want a GF who shares my faith, but I’ve been hitting a brick wall on Tinder and Bumble. I know you’re pretty active at your church—do you know anyone who might be interested in grabbing a coffee sometime?” “Hey Kelsey! I’m looking for a Christian girlfriend who shares my faith and values, but I haven’t had much luck. Do you happen to know anyone who’d be interested in meeting up?”"
