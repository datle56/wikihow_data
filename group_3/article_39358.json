      "content": "Choose someone to be the “Captain.” To play the game, one person must serve as the Captain; they’re in charge of giving out commands and running the game. Everyone else is a player—otherwise known as a “sailor.” You can play Ships and Sailors with smaller groups, though it’s ideal for larger ones; aim for at least 10 sailors, if not more!

      "content": "Set the boundaries of the play area if necessary. Ships and Sailors requires a large, open space to play in because it’s a movement-based game, so try playing in a big room or empty yard or field. If you’re outside in an open space, mark the edges of the playing field; that way, they’ll know how far to run when a command is issued. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Try to follow the captain’s commands as quickly as possible. After the Captain is chosen and the game begins, the Captain must call out a command of their choice. Then, all “sailors” must follow the Captain’s command, acting as fast as they can while the Captain watches. The last person to perform the command (and anyone who does it wrong) is out of the game. [3] X Research source Alternatively, the Captain can time the sailors, giving them anywhere from 3 to 5 seconds (or more, if they’re generous) to follow the command—and anyone who can’t complete it is out."

      "title": "Continue playing until one player or small group is left.",
      "content": "Continue playing until one player or small group is left. The goal of Ships and Sailors is simple: keep following the Captain’s orders and try to be the last person standing! The winner is the one person (or group) who never finishes a command last or acts out a command incorrectly—so listen to the Captain closely and make sure you know all the possible commands before the game. [4] X Research source In fact, it may help players review (and possibly practice) all of the commands before starting the game. Before playing, see if anyone is new to the game and needs a little practice!"

      "title": "Single-player commands",
      "content": "Single-player commands Single-player commands are the commands every player must carry out individually (meaning they’re not team-based actions). For these commands, the single player who finishes the command last should be out of the game, along with any players who do the wrong action. [5] X Research source Ships . This command can also be called “Sail west.” Every player must run to the right side of the playing area. Sailors . This command can also be called “Sail east.” Every player must run to the left side of the playing area. Captain’s coming . Every player must salute and stand still until the Captain says, “At ease.” Anyone who moves before that is out! Hit the deck . Every player must get down on the ground and lie on their stomach. Seasick . Every player must pretend to throw up. Pirates . Everyone must run to the front of the playing area. Alternatively, the command could mean players must act like pirates, jumping on one leg and holding a hand over one eye (like an eye patch). No pirates . Everyone must run to the back of the playing area. Beached whale . Everyone must get on the ground and lie on their backs. Shark attack . Everyone must lay on their stomach and hold up an arm like a shark fin. Alternatively, the command could mean players must get into a shark squat and freeze. Mermaid . Everyone must sit on the ground, sticking their legs out to the side while propped up with one arm—then start waving gracefully."

      "title": "Group commands",
      "content": "Group commands Group commands require two or more players to carry them out together—meaning any stray players who can’t find a group are out of the game, along with the team that follows a command too slowly. Some of these commands require teams of four, five, or six, which is why Ships and Sailors works so well with large groups. [6] X Research source Person overboard . Everyone must find a partner; while one kneels, the other stands behind them with a hand on their shoulder. Both must put their hands above their eyes and pretend to scan the ocean for the lost sailor. Jellyfish friends . Everyone must find a partner. Each pair must face one another and wiggle their arms (like jellyfish). Three hands rowing . Players must get in groups of three and sit in a row, one behind the other, while pretending to row a boat together. Four hands playing card s. Players must get in groups of four and pretend to be sailors playing a card game together. Five hands eating . Players must break into groups of five and pretend to eat a hearty meal together. Walk the plank . Players must break into groups of six and line up with their hands on the shoulders of the person in front of them."

      "content": "Make up any new commands that sound fun to you. Feel free to get creative! Ships and Sailors doesn’t require any materials—so it’s easy to add new elements to it. If you want to shake things up or make the game harder, try coming up with different (or more complex) commands for sailors to try and follow. Just make sure to explain them to the sailors before playing! [7] X Research source For example, you could introduce a “parrot” command where everyone must flap their arms like wings or a “crow’s nest” command where players must pretend they’re climbing up to a lookout spot on a ship."

      "content": "Tweak the commands to reduce the amount of physical activity if needed. If the ground isn’t suitable for players to be lying on it, for example, or you don’t have enough space to run around from side to side, you can always change the commands (or use different ones). Just be aware of your players’ needs and the space you’re playing in! [8] X Research source For example, if players can’t lie on the ground, you could change “hit the deck” to mean crouching down (but still staying on your feet)."

      "title": "Call out commands slower or faster to adjust the game’s difficulty.",
      "content": "Call out commands slower or faster to adjust the game’s difficulty. Want to start the game off easy so players can warm up? Give them a few extra seconds to complete each command. Want to build a sense of urgency and make it more competitive? Give players less and less time to complete commands as the game goes on! [9] X Research source For example, you could start the game giving players 6 to 8 seconds to complete commands, then bring that number down to 3 seconds as the game progresses."
