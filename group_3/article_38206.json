      "content": "Sa-rang-hae (사랑해) Sa-rang-hae is an informal form of the verb “sa-rang-ha-da,” which comes from sa-rang (사랑), the Korean word for “love,” and ha-da (하다), the Korean verb “to have/do.” You’d use this variety of “I love you” when speaking with a partner, close friend, or someone younger than you. [1] X Research source When calling someone by name using the casual “sa-rang-hae,” add an “ah” (아) suffix to the person’s name if it ends in a consonant or a “ya” (야) suffix if it ends in a vowel. “Sa-rang-hae, Su-a-ya” (사랑해, 수아야) translates to “I love you, Sua.” Since “Sua” ends in a vowel, the “ya” suffix is added. “Sa-rang-hae, Ye-jun-a” (사랑해, 예준아) translates to “I love you, Yejun.” Because “Yejun” ends with a consonant, the “ah” suffix is added. Korean is a contextual language where pronouns like “I” and “you” are often implied rather than actually said. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Sa-rang-hae-yo (사랑해요)",
      "content": "Sa-rang-hae-yo (사랑해요) Just like “sa-rang-hae,” “sa-rang-hae-yo” also stems from “sa-rang-ha-da,” the Korean verb for “to love.” This version of “I love you” is polite, and is what you’d use to platonically say “I love you” to someone like a parent or teacher. [3] X Research source If you’re calling someone by name with sa-rang-hae-yo, add the “ssi” (씨) suffix to their first or full name as a sign of respect. [4] X Research source “Sa-rang-hae-yo, uh-muh-ni” (사랑해요, 어머니) translates to “I love you, mom.” (You don’t need to add the “ssi” suffix when you’re talking to someone like a parent or teacher—instead, just use the normal title.) “Sa-rang-hae-yo, Min-seo-ssi” (사랑해요, 민서씨) translates to “I love you, Minseo.”"

      "title": "Sa-rang-hap-ni-da (사랑합니다)",
      "content": "Sa-rang-hap-ni-da (사랑합니다) While still a version of the “sa-rang-ha-da” verb, sa-rang-hap-ni-da is far more formal than “sa-rang-hae” or “sa-rang-hae-yo.” You only use this phrase when speaking to someone in a significantly higher social rank than you, like a grandparent or your employer. [5] X Research source Just like with “sa-rang-hae-yo,” add the “ssi” (씨) suffix when referring to someone by their name. [6] X Research source “Sa-rang-hap-ni-da, hal-meo-ni” (사랑합니다, 할머니) translates to “I love you, grandma.” “Sa-rang-hap-ni-da, Ji-yun-ssi” (사랑합니다, 지윤씨) translates to “I love you, Jiyoon.”"

      "content": "Sa-rang-haeng (사랑행) is a cute way to say “I love you” in Korean. “Sa-rang-haeng” takes the casual “sa-rang-hae” and replaces the “hae” ending with the “haeng” suffix. For some, the “haeng” sounds especially “aegyo” (애교), or cute. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Jo-a-hae-yo (좋아해요): “I like you” “Jo-a-hae-yo” stems from “jo-a-ha-da” (좋아하다), the verb “to like.” It’s a great way to share your feelings with a romantic interest in your life without sounding too intense. [8] X Research source Like “sa-rang-hae-yo,” “jo-a-hae-yo” also has different formality levels: Informal: Jo-a-hae (좋아해) - what you’d say to a best friend or someone who’s around the same age/younger than you Polite: Jo-a-hae-yo (좋아해요) - what you’d say to someone who’s a few years older than you or someone you don’t know well Formal: Jo-a-hap-ni-da (좋아합니다) - what you’d use in a formal setting (like with a teacher or employer)<"

      "content": "Na-do sa-rang-hae (나도 사랑해): “I love you, too” Let’s say that your partner just said “sa-rang-hae” (I love you) to you. In response, you could say “na-do sa-rang-hae,” or “I love you, too.” [9] X Research source Person:1: Sa-rang-hae (사랑해)! Person 2: Na-do sa-rang-hae (나도 사랑해)!"

      "content": "Dang-shin eob-shin mot sar-a (당신 없인 못 살아): “I can’t live without you” Want to take your romantic confession to the next level? Say “dang-shin eob-shin mot sar-a” instead of (or in addition to!) “sa-rang-hae.” It translates to “I can’t live without you,” and is a pretty powerful way to pull on someone’s heartstrings.
