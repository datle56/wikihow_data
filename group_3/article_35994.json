      "content": "Get in Child Pose . Kneel on the floor and fold your body downwards so that your forehead rests comfortably on the ground and your bottom rests on the heels of your feet. [3] X Research source Take deep, even breaths. Let your arms rest on the floor above your head and feel your entire body relax and sink downwards into the ground. Focus on your abdomen as you fill your back, ribcage, and spine with air. Reach your breaths all the way down your tailbone. Exhale slowly and easily. [4] X Research source Use a yoga mat, blanket or carpet to help cushion your body in this position. Repeat the breathing cycles at least 5 times, or until you feel fully and deeply relaxed."

      "content": "Try the Happy Baby Pose. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor, shoulder-width apart. Bring both knees towards your chest, letting your hips sink into the floor as you do so. You can pull your legs gently into a deeper stretch by holding them underneath your knees. Hold this position and breathe deeply and evenly. Stay there for as long as it is comfortable before relaxing and returning your feet to the ground. [5] X Research source For a deeper stretch, gently rock your body from side to side as you hold onto your raised legs."

      "title": "Stretch your adductors.",
      "content": "Stretch your adductors. To do this lie on your back on a comfortable surface with your knees bent. Gently let your knees fall to the side as you bring the soles of your feet together, forming a diamond with your legs. Breathe deeply and evenly as you feel your hips and knees sink towards the floor. Return to your starting position and then repeat. [6] X Research source If you feel too much discomfort from the pulling in your inner thighs or in your pubic bones, you can use pillows to support your knees. Adductors are the muscles found in the groin area or inner thigh and loosening these can help address pelvic floor tightness. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Stretch your piriformis. Lie on your back with your knees up and bent with your feet on the ground, spread shoulder-width apart. From here, pull your right foot up towards your chest, crossing it with your left knee. Rest it against the top of the left knee, just below the thigh. Reach your right hand between your legs to grasp your left leg underneath the knee and pull the left leg towards your chest. Hold for 30 seconds, breathing deeply and evenly, before relaxing. Repeat, on your other side. [8] X Research source The piriformis muscle is located at the back of the pelvis, stretching from the lower spine to the upper femur, or thighbone, on each side.

Rest your hands gently on your lower abdomen, just below your belly button. [10] X Research source A yoga mat is a great option, but a firm sofa or mattress will work, too."

      "content": "Breathe deeply and evenly. Breathe in and out through your nose in a regular and calm rhythm. Direct your breath towards your abdomen. Focus on the rise and fall of your stomach and imagine that the muscles in your pelvis are sinking down, towards your feet.

      "title": "Scan your body in your mind for areas of tension.",
      "content": "Scan your body in your mind for areas of tension. Begin with your head. Notice your eyes, your mouth, and your jawâ€”are they tight? As you notice problem areas, relax them and feel the tension melt slowly away. Between each area of your body, return for a moment to focus on your breathing and the rise and fall of your abdomen. Continue this cycle, moving your attention down the entire length of your body from your head to your feet. One of the primary benefits of using this approach is that it does not require you to tighten a pelvic floor that may already be tense or even painful. You can practice this awareness technique any time or place that you are able to focus and relax."

      "title": "Borrow progressive muscle relaxation techniques if necessary.",
      "content": "Borrow progressive muscle relaxation techniques if necessary. As you scan your body, you may have difficulty noticing if an area is tight or relaxed. If this is the case, tense the muscle first, as this can often be easier to do than relaxing on command. Once you've tightened it, release it. Using scanning with progressive muscle relaxation process can help you increase your awareness of where and when you are storing tension in your body."

      "content": "Rest your pelvis in the neutral 6 o'clock position. Lie on your back with your knees bent up and your feet set on the floor, shoulder-width apart. Imagine the line between your tailbone and the top of your pelvis represents the hands on a clock. Your tailbone points to the 6, while the top of your pelvis rests on the 12 of the clock face. [13] X Research source At rest you should feel your tailbone making contact with the floor while your lower back curves away from the ground slightly. Use a yoga mat or other firm but cushioned surface to avoid discomfort from the pressure on your tailbone."

      "title": "Rock your pelvis between the 6 and 12 o'clock positions.",
      "content": "Rock your pelvis between the 6 and 12 o'clock positions. To do this, gently move your pelvis forward and backward by lifting your tailbone off the ground while leaning on the top, or 12 o'clock, region of your pelvis and lower spine. Relax, then flex in the opposite direction to push the tailbone downwards while curving your lower spine. [14] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This is a gentle motion. Avoid squeezing your bottom muscles or tense your lower back. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Shift your weight and rotate left towards the 3 o'clock position. Slowly rotate your pelvis to the left as you rock gently. Focus and try to imagine the bottom of your pelvis rocking from the 5 o'clock, then the 4 o'clock, and finally the 3 o'clock position. Return to the neutral 6 o'clock position slowly and allow yourself a moment to rest. This technique helps you learn to feel and loosen up your pelvic floor muscles."

      "content": "Rotate your pelvis to the right towards the 9 o'clock position. Once again, move with focus as you rock your pelvis gently. Move it diagonally to reach the 7, the 8, and finally the 9 before returning to your neutral position. [16] X Research source This entire exercise should only take between 3-5 minutes to complete."

      "title": "Locate the pelvic floor muscles in your body.",
      "content": "Locate the pelvic floor muscles in your body. Your pelvic floor is made up by a group of muscles that supports the organs in your lower abdomen, including the bladder, bowel, and the uterus. Without these muscles, you could imagine having a very saggy pouch stretching down between your knees. Your pelvic floor muscles keep your insides securely in place in your abdomen. [17] X Research source The pelvic floor is a complex area of the body where muscles, nerves, and important internal organs are interconnected."

As you release your urine, see if you can stop your flow mid-stream. [18] X Expert Source Allison Romero, PT, DPT Pelvic Health Specialist Expert Interview. 2 December 2020. Once you have stopped the flow, relax again to continue emptying your bladder.

      "title": "Visualize your pelvic floor muscles.",
      "content": "Visualize your pelvic floor muscles. You can learn to identify your pelvic floor muscles by imagining that you are trying to prevent the flow of urine or passing gas. Choose a position that is comfortable for you (lying down, sitting, or standing) and keep your legs slightly apart so that your feet are roughly aligned with your shoulders. Relax your abdomen, bottom, and thighs and visualize yourself stopping the flow of urine. Relax and repeat, this time focusing your mind on your bottom as though you were trying to stop from passing gas. Then relax. [21] X Research source Repeat this cycle until you can identify and control your pelvic floor muscles. These exercises are used to strengthen a loose pelvic floor, so do not perform them frequently if your pelvic floor is already too tight. This process should only be used sparingly to help you become aware of this area of your body."
