      "title": "Replace incandescent bulbs.",
      "content": "Replace incandescent bulbs. Incandescent light bulbs, which includes halogen bulbs, create much more heat than light, and this makes them very inefficient. Replacing incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescent or LED bulbs will reduce the amount of energy you use on lighting by up to 75 percent. Lighting typically accounts for roughly 10 percent of your energy use. A single CFL bulb could save you about $30 in energy costs over the course of its life compared to an incandescent bulb. They cost much more but they last much longer, [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Seal leaks and drafts.",
      "content": "Seal leaks and drafts. Keeping your house at a comfortable temperature requires a great deal of energy. Leaks and drafts around the house that let outside air in and climate controlled air out further increase the amount of energy it takes to heat or cool your house. [4] X Research source Install weather stripping on doors, windows, and attic or crawl space access holes. Seal up mail slots that don’t get used. Seal openings and cracks in the roof, walls, around electrical outlets, and around pipes and wires with expanding caulk or foam. Plug large holes, such as by using a foam product. Install transparent plastic sheeting on drafty windows. Buy thermal curtains. These touch the floor and are wrap around to touch the walls, to trap cold air behind them. Normal curtains allow the cold air to escape by convection airflow."

      "content": "Increase insulation around the house. Adding insulation should allow you to pay less for heating and air conditioning, while keeping your home at the same temperature. Check the thickness of the insulation on your attic floor, attic walls, and roof if they have fiberglass batt insulation that is not covered by flooring or drywall. Compare these thicknesses with the DOE recommended thicknesses of fiberglass batt insulation for your region of the country: https://www.energystar.gov/campaign/seal_insulate/identify_problems_you_want_fix/diy_checks_inspections/insulation_r_values .

Energy Star appliances use up to 50 percent less energy and water than their traditional counterparts. [8] X Research source Buy washers and dryers with many energy-saving features. Front-loading washing machines are the most energy-efficient. Refrigerators with the freezer on top or the bottom are more energy-efficient than side-by-side refrigerator-freezers Stoves with ceramic induction cooktops are more energy-efficient than traditional range cooktops Tankless on-demand water heaters are much more energy-efficient than tank-style water heaters Portable dehumidifiers use a lot of electricity. If you need to run yours often, try fixing problems that are making your home damp. For example, if your basement walls are bare block, paint them with waterproofing paint. Check that your gutters and downspouts work correctly, and repair them if necessary. [9] X Expert Source Walter Brant Handyman Expert Interview. 2 September 2020."

[10] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Department of Energy Official site for the U.S. Department of Energy, which provides resources related to energy safety, conservation, and efficiency Go to source Older windows are often very drafty, and this means your furnace and air conditioner have to work harder to heat or cool your house, and this means using more energy. When it’s time to update your windows, look into more energy-efficient double- or triple-paned ones that will help reduce your energy use. If you have storm windows, caulk around their frames. Wind draws air out through storm windows and primary windows if the storm windows are not air-tight. In many places, there are tax credits available for homeowners who upgrade to energy-efficient windows, so look into government programs where you live."

You can save energy by turning off lights when you leave a room, turning off the television and radio when you're done watching or listening, and putting your computer into sleep or hibernate mode when you leave the room. When you go away for overnight or longer, unplug all appliances and electronics, because many of them use energy even when they're not on. To make your job easier, use power strips for appliances that are often used together, such as the TV, stereo, and DVD player.

[12] X Research source Cut down on the Phantom Loads. Some appliances and electronic devices continue to consume energy even when they are not in use. This is commonly referred to as the Phantom Load. It is usually caused when electronics are still plugged in or are not turned off.

Finding ways to save water at home, therefore, can help you conserve energy. Some quick ways to save water include: Taking shorter showers Turning off taps when you're lathering up Filling the sink with water to wash dishes rather than letting it run Saving kitchen water for the garden Reusing cooking water Flushing less Investing in water-smart fixtures and faucets Capturing condensation from your air conditioning unit and using it to water plants."

Your washing machine already uses lots of energy, in the form of water and power, but you can reduce the amount of power it uses by washing with cold-water cycles.

To take advantage of this, plant deciduous trees on the south side of your home or install an awning. The trees or awning will shade your house. In winter, the leaves will fall off the trees and allow warming sunlight into your home. Instead of planting deciduous trees, you can also install thick curtains that will block the sun, sun screens, or a UV-protective film on the windows to tint them."

It requires a lot more energy to produce a new battery than it does to recharge one that’s already made, so when your current batteries die, replace them with rechargeable ones.

Better yet, try to reuse items around the house, such as washing glass jars and keeping them for food storage. Depending on your municipality, items you may be able to recycle include glass, aluminum cans, bottles, plastic, cardboard, paper, and more. Buying products with minimal packaging is also a good way to save energy, because no resources or energy is wasted manufacturing or recycling the packaging. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Use ACs with Smart Time Switches. Air conditioning can act as a heavy load on energy consumption. Smart switches are electrical switches with a built-in timer, turning off and on an electronic circuit. Smart switches can be programmed to allow the cooling for a certain period and cutting off the electric supply until the next cycle of cooling. This way you will be able to conserve energy especially during the night hours."
