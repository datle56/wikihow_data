If a person in your life is sick with a cold, the flu, or another mild illness, it’s best to politely express your empathy and offer any support or help (if needed). If the ill person is just an acquaintance, you can stick with something simple like “I’m sorry to hear that, hope you feel better !” If it’s a close friend, however, you might add some teasing humor to cheer them up, like “You better bounce back quickly so we can hang out!” Here are some more examples of how to respond when someone says they’re not feeling well: [1] X Research source “Aw, that’s awful! I’m sorry you’re sick.” “I hate it when the coolest people in my life get sick!” “I’m sorry you aren’t feeling good. Is there anything I can do to help?” “I’m sorry to hear that! Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything.” “Oh man, I’ve been there before. Seems like there’s something nasty going around.” “I can swing by and drop some soup off if you want. I know how tough it is to be sick.” “You better get healthy soon. I don’t have anyone to crack bad jokes with if you aren’t around.” “You have no right getting sick just when I need my best work friend! Jk. Feel better!”"

If someone is dealing with a more serious illness or health crisis, make sure to acknowledge their feelings and offer a concrete show of support while also letting them lead the conversation—focus on listening and empathy, rather than being overly preoccupied with your own reaction. If you truly feel shell-shocked, it’s okay to be honest with them and say that you’re speechless or aren’t sure of the right words. Here are some examples of what you might say: [2] X Research source “I’m really sorry you’re going through this.” “Do you want me to bring you some food? What is your favorite food?” “I’ll be thinking about you. I would be devastated if anything happened to you.” “Just want you to know that I’m thinking about you. Fingers crossed today is a good one.” “What you just shared with me was so heartfelt and I really appreciate you opening up to me in this way.” “If you want to scream, or cry, or whatever, I’m here for it. You can say or do whatever you need to do right now.” “If there’s anything you need from me, tell me. Seriously. I can watch your dog, or offer rides on the weekend. Just let me know.” “I don’t know what to say right now, but I want you to know that I am 100% here for you, and will be by your side every step of the way.” “Sending through your Monday morning reminder that you’re important to me and I’d be lost without you. Adore you to the moon and back.” \"Do you have heaps of appointments again this week? I’m around, and have heard I’m not bad for a non-Uber driver. I can take you wherever you need to go (as long as we can stop for snacks on the way).\""

Get well soon, my little fighter!” “Sorry things aren’t much fun right now — I hope that changes soon.” “You’re a superstar, and I’m so proud of you!

      "content": "Avoid minimizing the situation or offering advice and empty platitudes. While there’s no one perfect way to respond to someone when they’re sick, there are a few notable phrases and messages that are best avoided. We’ve outlined these below, but keep in mind that most people will understand your good intentions—if you say something that doesn’t sit quite right, just move on from that moment and try something different. [13] X Research source “What can I do to help?” This message seems nice and obviously displays good intentions, but it puts the onus of the what on the ill person. Instead of offering to do something (like bring food or help out around their house), just do it. “At least you’re not… Avoid any sentences that start with “at least.” You may feel like you’re trying to offer some sort of silver lining, but seeing the positives in a truly painful situation will likely come off as useless or irritating to a seriously ill individual. “When I was sick, I… You may have experienced a similar illness or situation, but that doesn’t mean the two experiences are the same. Making a comparison between you and the sick person may make them feel shut down or unable to share their unique experience with you. “My thoughts and prayers are with you.” Even with the best of intentions, this phrase is ultimately a cliche that people turn to when they don’t know what else to say. It doesn’t come off as super heartfelt, so it’s best to say something more like “I’m thinking of you.” “Did you try that ___ I recommended?” Avoid offering any type of natural medicine, mindfulness exercise, or other believed \"cure.\" Even if you’re just trying to help, trust that your sick friend is getting all of the medical advice they need from their doctor and other health advisors. “Everything will be okay.” The truth is, you don’t know if everything will be okay. Offering this overly optimistic phrase to an ill person is only likely to remind them of that fact—plus, it’s totally okay for them to be feeling down and angry right now."

      "content": "Choose a mode of communication based on your relationship. If you find out that someone in your life is sick from a source other than them, you may want to reach out to them immediately—but what’s the best way to do that? You could text them, call them, send an email, or send a card. None of these are bad options, but whether one is more appropriate than another really depends on your relationship—so we’ve outlined when you may want to use each one below: Sending a get-well card: Cards are a good option for anyone who’s dealing with a long-term illness or major health episode, and they work for pretty much any person in your life. A card is heartfelt and sweet and lets someone know you care without any added pressure. Calling them on the phone: Phone calls are a good way to reach out to people who are dealing with moderate-to-severe illnesses, but they can feel invasive or stressful. For that reason, they may be better used for when you have a close relationship with the ill person. In either case, don’t expect them to pick up and leave a heartfelt message that emphasizes that there’s no need for you to return their call. Shooting them a text: Texts are more casual, so they’re best for close friends and family members or when someone is experiencing a mild illness. Similar to phone calls, however, they may put pressure on the other person to respond, so make sure to end your text with something like “Please don’t feel like you need to respond to this if you aren’t up to it.” Sending them an email: Emails can be a nice middle point between cards and calls—they’re easy to send, and you can write a longer message or even include a heartwarming visual or photo of the two of you. They also don’t imply the need for a more immediate response from the recipient."

If you can’t give an easy “yes” to any of these questions, it’s probably best to play it safe and skip the humor. [18] X Research source"

Keep being yourself and try to keep treating your friend as normally as possible. Avoid giving advice or asking tons of questions, unless they invite you to. Try not to take it personally if they ever seem distant or angry—it’s not about you. Avoid making things seem better or worse than they are. Be realistic and genuine. Save heavy emotions for when they aren’t around. Vent to other friends, not them."
