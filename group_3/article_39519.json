The process also uses considerable water and electricity. If you are on a budget or want to conserve energy, this may not be your ideal option. [2] X Research source"

Sitting in the tub with jeans on and walking around in wet pants certainly isn't the most comfortable activity. This method, however, is the best for making the jeans form fitting while avoiding potential damage to the fabric. If you have expensive jeans or are worried about discoloration or shrinking your jeans too much, this is the method for you!"

Cut a strip of elastic into a segment roughly 6 inches (150 mm) long and pull it tightly across the inside of the rear waistband. Starting in the middle of the strip, use zigzag stitching to secure the stretched elastic to the jeans' waistband. [4] X Research source"
