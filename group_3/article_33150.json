      "title": "Get song suggestions.",
      "content": "Get song suggestions. Ask everyone what songs they like, so everyone can have fun! Tell the participants to not ask for slow songs since it's difficult to dance to. Use upbeat music, such as pop and rap, or you could use upbeat nursery rhymes songs for small children. Play music that is age appropriate; obviously you shouldn't play songs with inappropriate messages and language for small children and you shouldn't play childish songs for teenagers and older children."
