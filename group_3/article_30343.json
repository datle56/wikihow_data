[1] X Research source www.pamf.org/preteen/mybody/girls/hairremoval.html This means that, depending on your hair type, the results may last fewer than 4 weeks. They typically work best on those with fair skin and light, fine hair. If you have very dark skin, the bleach may actually make the hairs on your arm more obvious. Keep in mind that everyone is different, however, so they may work for you. [2] X Research source www.pamf.org/preteen/mybody/girls/hairremoval.html If you have very dark or coarse hair, the bleaching kit may not be strong enough to lighten the hairs on your arm significantly.

This type of bleach is stronger than the type you'd use on your face, but gentler than the kind you'd use on the hair on your head. Some kits also specify what skin and hair type they work best on, so be sure to get the right one. [4] X Research source For example, if you have sensitive skin, get a kit that's either gentle, mild, or designed for sensitive skin."

Here is what you need to do: Mix up a small amount of the bleach cream, typically one part of the powder and two parts of the cream. Apply thumbnail-sized amount to your inner arm. Wait 10 minutes, then wash it off with cold water. Wait 24 hours. If no irritation occurs, then you may proceed. If irritation does occur, then do not use the product."
