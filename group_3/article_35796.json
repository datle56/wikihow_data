If it's a very small amount (a serving for a single meal), begin with 1.5 minutes of reheating using the normal setting on your microwave—usually 1,000 watts. If you have a large amount of chicken, begin with 2.5-3 minutes of microwaving. At the halfway mark, carefully flip the chicken over so both sides heat evenly. Check the temperature either by touching the chicken with your finger or by tasting a small bite to see if it's been warmed through properly. Continue to reheat in 30-second increments until it reaches an appropriate temperature."

A non-stick pan is ideal for reheating chicken — especially when the skin has been left on the meat, since the fatty skin tends to stick to heated pans. You should be able to feel heat emanating off the pan when you place your hand 2 inches (5.1 cm) above it. Keep in mind that you don't want the pan to be as hot as you'd use to cook raw chicken, as intense heat will dry the chicken out."

[10] X Research source For best results, Chef Campbell recommends taking the chicken out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before reheating it. “That way, it starts to come to room temperature, and it’s not as cold when you cook it,” she says.

Rub butter or oil on the surface of the dish, or spray it with nonstick cooking spray, to keep the chicken from sticking to it. Next, place the whole rotisserie chicken in the dish and cover it with aluminum foil. Because the chicken has already been cooked, you don’t really need a roasting dish with deep sides, because there won’t be juices running off the chicken. However, a roasting dish is still a good size for reheating a rotisserie chicken."

Depending on how large your chicken is, you might need a little more or less time, but it should take about 25 minutes for your chicken to reheat thoroughly. [13] X Research source Begin checking the temperature a few minutes early, especially if your chicken is on the small side. Don’t let the chicken overcook, as it gets tough and dry—especially the white meat. If you’re reheating fried chicken, Chef Campbell recommends turning the oven on broil, then “letting the texture crisp up under the broiler” for the last few minutes of cooking.
