      "content": "Test a cleaning product on a corner of your carpet. Lipstick stains attach to the carpet fibers with grease, so you will need a cleaning product that dissolves grease or oils. [2] X Research source Most all-purpose stain removers will work, as will dry cleaning fluid. However, these may discolor your carpet. [3] X Expert Source Haim Shemesh Carpet & Rug Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 12 May 2020. Apply the cleaning product to an inconspicuous corner of the carpet first and let sit five minutes before blotting dry with a clean cloth. If the discoloration is severe, you may wish to find another product. Dry cleaning fluid is especially likely to discolor your carpet. If you do not have any stain removers or dry cleaning fluid, see the section on alternate cleaning solutions for other products or homemade mixtures you may have access to."

      "title": "Blot with the cleaning product.",
      "content": "Blot with the cleaning product. Apply the cleaning product to a clean sponge or cloth. Press repeatedly over the stain, switching to a clean side if the cloth becomes heavily stained. Avoid rubbing, which may work the lipstick further into the carpet fibers or spread it to a wider area. Depending on the cleaning product, lipstick, and freshness of the stain, this step may remove the lipstick on its own. Alternatively, you may spray the cleaning product onto your carpet and let sit five minutes before blotting. This may be more effective at removing the stain, but has a greater risk of discoloring your carpet. Even if the stain is removed, skip to the end of this section for instructions on cleaning up traces of the solvent."

      "content": "Repeat if you are seeing good results. If most of the stain has been removed, launder or rinse out the sponge or cloth, then apply more of the same cleaning product and blot. Two or three attempts may be enough to remove the stain, although you should stop and choose another product in the alternate cleaning solutions method if you see no major improvements."

      "content": "Hand wash the cleaning product and stain remnants. Whatever product you used, wash your carpet afterward to remove traces of cleaning product that could discolor your carpet or damage its fibers. Hand wash the area with a white cloth and a small amount of laundry or dish detergent mixed with warm water. Depending on how much stain is left, you may opt to use only a few grains of detergent in a glass of water; use 1/4 teaspoon (1 mL) for a stronger mix or even form a granular paste that you can rub thoroughly against the carpet. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source Check the detergent ingredients first. Avoid products that contain lanolin or bleach, as these may damage your carpet. [6] X Research source If you're uncertain, test the product in an inconspicuous area of the carpet, such as a corner usually underneath furniture. If you do not own detergent, skip to the next step."

This should remove the detergent along with the traces of cleaning product and stain it picked up. If the last residual traces are persistent, you may need to blot several times. Alternatively, leave a few wet paper towels in the area, weight them down with a heavy object, and wait for them to dry. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Sponge the stain with rubbing alcohol. Rubbing alcohol, or isopropyl alcohol, is a powerful grease solvent, and may be your best bet if a commercial cleaning product does not work. Be careful not to use too much alcohol, as it could reach the backing of the carpet and damage it. [8] X Research source Avoid circular motions while rubbing, which could damage the carpet texture by tearing its fibers. If you do not own rubbing alcohol, skip to the next step. It may be necessary to purchase some if you have persistent stains, however."

While you are unlikely to suffer any harm when exposed to small amounts of acetone on skin or inhaled as fumes, it's a good idea to work in a ventilated are and keep the acetone product away from children and pets. [9] X Research source You may apply acetone directly to the stain and let sit five minutes before blotting. Test in a less obvious corner of the carpet first to check for damage or discoloration."

      "content": "Use hairspray if rubbing alcohol is not available. One of hairspray main ingredients is alcohol, but as with any complex product not intended for cleaning, the other ingredients could have an unpredictable effect. If other methods do not work and you do not have rubbing alcohol, spray a small amount of hairspray onto the stain and let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes. Wipe the area with a wet, warm cloth."

This method is best used to bleach the last traces of stain after you have removed the majority of it with other methods. Hydrogen peroxide can be found at most drug stores, although you should check the labeling to make sure it is a 3% solution. Weaker solutions (lower percentages) will not be as effective, while stronger ones could damage your carpet."

You may add additional hydrogen peroxide if you see improvement, but the stain is not completely gone. There is no need to rinse the carpet afterward, since the hydrogen peroxide will break down into water."
