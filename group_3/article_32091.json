      "content": "Measure your luggage before you purchase a packing cube. It’s easy to estimate the size of your luggage incorrectly and end up with packing cubes that are wider than your suitcase. Use a tape measure to take the dimensions of your luggage, so you can easily compare the packing cubes’ dimensions with your luggage before you buy them. [1] X Research source If you are a backpacker, it is critical to purchase packing cubes that will fit inside your larger backpack, even when full. For standard travel backpacks, it can be best to purchase a combination of small and medium-sized packing cubes [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Organize the packing cubes by category.",
      "content": "Organize the packing cubes by category. This is the most straightforward packing strategy. Pack your things into the cubes based on type to keep everything organized and easy to find. For example, you would have a packing cube for shirts, as well as one for pants, one for swimsuits, and one for undergarments. This is where having access to packing cubes of different types, shapes and sizes can be extremely handy. [10] X Research source This works well for long-term trips that requires you to mix and match many of the same pieces."

      "content": "Pack specific outfits for each day or activity. If you like to plan out your outfits ahead of time or you’ve planned activities that require specific kinds of clothing, you can pack a cube for each day. This method is perfect if you’ll be on the go and won’t have much time to search through each cube for what you’ll need. For example, if you’re going swimming one day and hiking the next, you could pack one cube with your swimsuit, goggles, cover-up, flip-flops, and a change of clothes, and another cube with a T-shirt, shorts, socks, and a light jacket for hiking."

      "content": "Purchase cubes in different colors to color-code. If you need to pack for multiple people in one suitcase or want to locate cubes more easily, color-coding may be a good option. Purchase several cubes in each color and decide how to color-code the things you’re packing. [11] X Research source For example, you could designate a color for each person and pack their all of their things into cubes of the same color. This could be especially helpful for parents packing for their young children. You could also designate a color for different categories of clothing, such as dressy and casual, or clothes for warm weather and clothes for cool weather."
