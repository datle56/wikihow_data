      "content": "Lay the jacket out on a flat work surface like a table. Place the jacket face-up and spread out the arms so you can access the whole front side of the jacket. Smooth it out so that there are no creases hiding parts of the leather. Undo any buckles or buttons so you can get in all the cracks. [1] X Research source This method will work for leather jackets of any color. Use it to restore the color to a jacket that is dry, cracked, and faded due to age and wear. It will also help to protect and preserve the jacket, so you can wear it for years to come."

      "content": "Brush the entire jacket off with a horsehair brush to remove loose dirt. Start on the front side and brush the entire front of the jacket off using short, even strokes away from you. Flip the jacket over, smooth it out again on your work surface, and brush off the entire back side in the same manner. [2] X Research source Horsehair brushes are typically used for shoe shining or caring for other leather products. They help to clean and polish leather without damaging it. You can usually get one wherever they sell shoe shining products or leather goods."

      "title": "Wipe the entire jacket down with a damp lint-free cloth.",
      "content": "Wipe the entire jacket down with a damp lint-free cloth. Moisten a lint-free cloth with clean, cool water and wring out the excess water. Wipe down the entire front and back of the jacket with the cloth to remove any remaining dirt and get the jacket ready to restore. [3] X Research source A microfiber cloth works well for this. However, if you don’t have one, you can also use an old cotton T-shirt cut up into smaller pieces as a good substitute."

      "title": "Use a neutral-colored, wax-based leather preservative to restore the jacket.",
      "content": "Use a neutral-colored, wax-based leather preservative to restore the jacket. Leather preservative is a natural preservative, often made of beeswax and lanolin, that is also sometimes called leather conditioner or boot wax. It moisturizes, waterproofs, and protects leather against scuffs and scratches. [4] X Research source As the leather absorbs the preservative, the shine will be restored and the jacket won’t look dry and faded anymore. You can get leather preservative in a shoe store, a leather goods store, or online."

    {
      "title": "Test the leather preservative on an inconspicuous area of the jacket.",
      "content": "Test the leather preservative on an inconspicuous area of the jacket. Some leather preservatives can darken the leather, so test it on a hidden area first to see what effect it has on the color. Try another brand of leather preservative if the color changes to something you don't like. If the color of the leather does change slightly, you don't necessarily have to view this as a negative thing. Continued wear of the jacket and applications of leather preservative over time can help bring out its unique character and give it a look that just gets better with time."

      "title": "Rub the leather preservative into the leather jacket with your fingers.",
      "content": "Rub the leather preservative into the leather jacket with your fingers. Scoop out a penny-sized dollop of the leather preservative on one of your fingertips. Start rubbing it into the jacket, moving your fingertips in circular motions, until it is absorbed into the leather. Repeat this until you have covered the entire jacket. [5] X Research source The heat from your fingertips helps the leather preservative to melt and get absorbed better into the wax. The substance will not harm you in any way. Just wash your hands after you are done to remove the greasiness."

      "title": "Repeat this process every 6 months to keep your jacket in top condition.",
      "content": "Repeat this process every 6 months to keep your jacket in top condition. Regularly cleaning and conditioning your jacket with leather preservative will keep the leather from drying out, cracking, and losing its color due to wear and weather exposure. Take care of your leather jacket right, and you will have it for life. [6] X Research source Whenever you aren’t wearing your jacket, store it properly by hanging it up on a wooden or padded hanger in a cool, dry closet and never keep it anywhere where it will receive direct sunlight."

      "title": "Rub minor scratches with your hand until they disappear.",
      "content": "Rub minor scratches with your hand until they disappear. Firmly massage the scratch with your fingertips using circular motions. The heat and pressure from your hand will help light scratches disappear and blend back in with the rest of the jacket. [7] X Research source This usually works for very fine scratches, such as from the nails of a dog or cat."

      "title": "Use a hair dryer to heat up bigger scratches as you rub them in.",
      "content": "Use a hair dryer to heat up bigger scratches as you rub them in. Turn a household hair dryer on to high heat and hold it 6–12 in (15–30 cm) away from the scratch. Heat up the scratch as you massage it back into the jacket using circular motions. [8] X Research source The heat from the hair dryer activates the waxes and oils in the leather, which allows them to be transferred more easily into the scratch and blend it back into the leather jacket. If the heat is too hot for your hand, then turn it down. If it is too hot for you, then it is too hot for the leather and can end up drying it out."

    {
      "title": "Apply leather preservative if you can’t make the scratches disappear with heat.",
      "content": "Apply leather preservative if you can’t make the scratches disappear with heat. Put a small dollop of leather preservative on the tip of your finger. Rub it into the scratch using circular motions until it is absorbed by the leather and the scratch is no longer visible. [9] X Research source If the area where you repaired a scratch with this method is a noticeably different color than the surrounding area, then buff it in using a lint-free cloth and circular motions until it is no longer noticeable."
