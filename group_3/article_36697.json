Liquid bandages are meant to stay on your skin until they come off but you can remove the bond between the bandage and your skin by softening the bandage to loosen the bond.

This will help soften the bond between your skin and the bandage. Optionally, you can place a clean, wet towel over the bandage to soften it and loosen the bond between it and your skin. You can also soften the bandage during a bath, or by giving the bandaged area a soak in a bowl of water."
