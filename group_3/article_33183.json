      "content": "Think before you share any romantic feelings. If you’ve had feelings for your friend for a while, it can be hard to work up the courage to ask them out. When you do, don’t spill all your feelings at once, saying, “I’m in love with you, are you in love with me?” Chances are, they didn’t think about you that way yet, which would really shut down the conversation. [6] X Research source Instead, say, “Want to go out for dinner this week?” You don’t have to explicitly say the word “date.” You can wait for them to do that, maybe after a few “hang-outs.” Same goes for asking out somebody you’ve been admiring from afar. Try to avoid saying, “I’ve been crushing on you for the past year,” and instead say, “Hey, do you want to go see the new Spiderman movie this weekend?” This takes the pressure off."

Let me know if you want to do this again!” That makes it clear that you want to hang out again, but it avoids saying, “I didn’t sleep at all last night I was so excited thinking about our future wedding,” which (though it might be true), would probably freak out your crush. [8] X Research source You don’t want to pretend not to like your crush, because they might give up entirely.

You can hint at your feelings, by saying things like, “I really like you,” or “I love spending time with you,” or “I’m crazy about you,” but let your partner be the first one to say the big three words. This will make you feel absolutely confident that they mean it, and then you can reciprocate. Once they actually say, “I love you,” don’t hold out on them to play hard to get. That’s too mean! If you love them too, say it."
