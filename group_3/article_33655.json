      "title": "Rub the lacquer with coarse- or medium-grit micro-mesh.",
      "content": "Rub the lacquer with coarse- or medium-grit micro-mesh. Examine your lacquered surface and look for any obvious blemishes or scratches. If the surface is covered with pretty obvious marks, use a piece of 2000-grit or so micro-mesh to buff the surface. Work in short, vertical movements, keeping the micro-mesh moving in the same direction as you go. [1] X Research source You can purchase micro-mesh online, or in a hardware or home improvement store. You can also use finishing paper to get rid of scratches and blemishes. Place a cork sanding block on top of the micro-mesh sheet to make the sanding process easier. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Switch to a finer grit to continue smoothing out the surface. Grab a piece of micro-mesh that’s around 4000-grit or so. As you did before, rub down the lacquer in short, vertical motions. After rubbing the entire surface, continue switching to a higher grit, like 6000. Keep alternating your micro-mesh sheets and rubbing the surface of the lacquer until the scratches and blemishes are barely visible. [3] X Research source Using different grits helps make your polishing job look more even."

      "content": "Buff the surface with a very fine-grit micro-mesh. Choose a smooth, 12,000- or so grit sheet and rub in short, vertical strokes along the surface of your lacquer. Try to buff away any remaining marks or scratches so the lacquer can look as smooth and flawless as possible. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Touch the surface to check for any blemishes.",
      "content": "Touch the surface to check for any blemishes. Look for obvious scratches and marks that you can detect with your fingertips. Additionally, examine the lacquer to make sure that it’s completely smooth and reflective. [5] X Research source You don’t want there to be any visible scratches once you apply the polish."

      "title": "Install a correcting foam polishing pad into a mechanical polisher.",
      "content": "Install a correcting foam polishing pad into a mechanical polisher. Search online or in an auto supply shop for a round, bumpy foam pad designed for correcting or polishing. Slide this pad onto your the base of your polisher to secure it in place. [7] X Research source Check the user manual for your polisher if you aren’t sure how to add a new pad. Foam pads help to polish the surface without causing abrasions."

      "title": "Use a polishing cloth if you’re buffing the lacquer by hand.",
      "content": "Use a polishing cloth if you’re buffing the lacquer by hand. Shop online or in a car supply shop for a special polishing cloth. Don’t use a microfiber cloth for your polishing projects, as the fibers may scratch the surface of your lacquer. Instead, purchase a smooth, soft towel or cloth that’s specifically designed for polishing work. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Spread a pea-sized amount of correcting polish on the lacquer.",
      "content": "Spread a pea-sized amount of correcting polish on the lacquer. Add the polish to the specific area or corner that you plan on polishing. If you’re buffing a large surface, you can use extra polish as needed for other sections of lacquer. [9] X Research source If you’re using a polisher, feel free to apply the polish directly to the foam pad. You can purchase polish online, or at a hardware or home improvement store. Ask a store associate for help if you need specific recommendations for a project."

      "content": "Rub the polish into the lacquer using slow, careful motions. If you’re using a polishing cloth, take a small section of the cloth and rub over the polish carefully. Move it in slow, circular motions to spread the polish and buff the surface. If you’re using a mechanical polisher, set the tool to a relatively slow speed (e.g., machine speed 4), and move it in vertical or horizontal lines to spread the polish. [10] X Research source"

Work in small sections at a time, making your way from 1 side of the surface to the other. If the wax begins to dry, rub in a new layer of wax to soften the original. [14] X Research source It doesn’t matter how you rub the wax, as long as you’re consistent."
