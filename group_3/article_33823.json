You can even send a message to be displayed to the prankee to indicate how long he has until his computer remotely shuts down. You and the prankee will need to have computers that are somewhat recent and running Windows XP or newer. Windows version 7, 8, 8.1, and 10 should work with this prank. [3] X Research source"

Depending on your version of Windows, there may be small variations in how to check the networks for each computer, but generally, you should be able to do this by: Navigating to your control panel, which can be found in the lower left hand corner start menu of older versions of Windows. You can also open your file explorer by clicking its icon on the lower status bar of most recent versions of Windows, and in the following window, select \"Network\" from the directory pane on the left. In the resulting window, you should see a list of computers. At minimum, you should see your own computer and its network status. You'll need both your own computer and the prankee's computer to be listed in this window with a connected status. [4] X Research source"

Hold his hand palm up, and with your finger draw the rough image of his favorite fruit. Some excuses you might use to explain what you are doing: \"I learned a real cool trick in my psychology class. You can actually trick the brain into imagining certain smells, like fruit. Here, let me show you.\" \"The other day I was hanging out with my friend and he showed me this real cool magic trick. Can I show you?\" \"I read about this silly trick online that's supposed to fool your nose into smelling something that isn't there. It didn't work on me. You want to give it a try?

That's why I had to pull it on you!\" \"I gotcha pretty good, didn't I?\""

To accomplish this, you'll be using tape to fasten an air horn in an unlikely location in such a way that the airhorn is triggered and a loud noise made without the prankee realizing beforehand. For this prank, you'll need: [7] X Research source Airhorn Tape NOTE : depending on the surface you are taping your airhorn to, you may need gentler tape so as not to do damage to paint or wallpaper."

You might tape the airhorn to the wall in such a way that when a door is opened it causes the airhorn to go off, startling the prankee. You could put it beneath his chair so that when he sits the airhorn triggers. Use camouflage to disguise your airhorn when you are able. An airhorn taped to the bottom of a chair will be quite suspicious. Disguise this prank by putting a jacket or hoodie sweatshirt on the back of the chair to block the horn from view.

Don't worry - you'll know it when you hear it. If the prankee is away for a period of time, you may want to check on your prank several times throughout the day. Depending on heat, humidity, tape quality, and the surface you've taped the airhorn to, your tape may loosen over time, ruining your prank."

A car is a big investment for most people, and by making your prankee believe that his car window has been destroyed, you can get a hilarious response out of him. You'll have some cleanup after you set up the prank, but to perform it you'll only need: Car window (similar to the prankee's car window) Gloves (recommended; optional) NOTE : cheap car windows can likely be purchased from your local junkyard or salvage shop. You might even be able to get staff to help you choose the right kind of window by bringing them in on the prank!"

While the prankee is otherwise occupied, like right before he wakes up in the morning, snag his keys and unlock his car. Then: Remove anything of value from the car. You don't want anything to be stolen because of your prank! Roll down one of the windows of his car so that it is completely inside the door and cannot be seen. Shatter your window carefully and quietly. Then use your gloves to spread the glass around the door of the rolled down window and a little bit inside the car to make it look realistic."

You might point out that at least he didn't have anything valuable in the car - an excellent tactic if you've removed something valuable from the car the night before when setting up your prank."

      "content": "Time your prank to prevent actual theft. With the window rolled down, the prankee's car will be vulnerable to actual theft. You'll either need to keep an eye on it so it isn't stolen, or time your prank so that the car is only left unattended for a few moments before your friend comes out and sees it. You might arrange for your friend to drive you somewhere the morning of your prank so you know exactly when the both of you will be headed to the car. Don't perform this prank before the prankee leaves for work. Shattered glass can be dangerous, even if his car window isn't actually broken."

Use a vacuum cleaner to suck up little bits of glass that are scattered on the inside of the car and sweep up any shards outside the car as well."
