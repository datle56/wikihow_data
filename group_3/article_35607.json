      "title": "Put a dash of salt in the coffee.",
      "content": "Put a dash of salt in the coffee. Adding a dash of salt to your coffee can help to suppress the bitterness in the coffee and enhance the coffee’s flavor. This is because sodium chloride, or table salt, makes the sodium in coffee more distinct, resulting in coffee that tastes less bitter. You can add a dash of salt to freshly brewed coffee to cut down on the bitterness. You can use common table salt for this method. Keep in mind that adding a small amount of salt to your coffee will not make it taste more salty or ruin the underlying flavors in the coffee."

      "title": "Add cream or milk to the coffee.",
      "content": "Add cream or milk to the coffee. Another easy option is to add cream or milk to your coffee to cut down on the bitterness. This may be a good option if you tend to drink your coffee with cream or milk and want to have a more neutral taste. The fat content in cream and milk can counteract the bitterness in the coffee. [1] X Research source If you tend to drink your coffee black, but want to try this method, you can try adding a spoonful of cream or milk and taste the coffee to see if it is to your liking. You may then add more cream or milk if the coffee is still too bitter."

      "title": "Put sugar in the coffee.",
      "content": "Put sugar in the coffee. If you don’t mind counteracting bitterness with sweetness, adding sugar to your coffee may be the way to go. Put a teaspoon of sugar in your coffee to cut down on the bitterness and give your coffee a sweeter taste. [2] X Research source You can use white sugar or brown sugar for this method. Cane sugar tends to have less additives so it may be the better option."

    {
      "title": "Go for drip coffee.",
      "content": "Go for drip coffee. Drip coffee or pour over coffee tends to have less bitterness than other brewing options like french press or espresso brewing. If you are trying to avoid bitter coffee, you may go for drip coffee at home or when you are getting coffee at a coffee shop. Avoid espresso brewing, such as an espresso shot or an Americano style coffee, as these tend to be the most bitter. [3] X Research source If you brew your own coffee at home, the bitterness of the coffee will depend on the type of bean you use, the roasting method used on the beans, and the amount of beans you use. You may need to play around with your drip coffee method to find a brew that is not too bitter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Adjust the grind size of the coffee.",
      "content": "Adjust the grind size of the coffee. If you prepare your own coffee at home, you should grind your own beans for the freshest coffee possible. When you do this, make sure you are not grounding the coffee too finely. Brewing methods like french press and drip brewing will require different grind sizes. Often, french press tastes less bitter if the grinds are coarse and not too fine. Drip coffee tends to taste less bitter if the grinds are medium fine rather than very fine. [4] X Research source You may need to experiment with the grind size for your coffee depending on what type of brewing method you use. Finding the right grind size may improve the overall taste of your coffee, including the level of bitterness in the coffee."

      "title": "Check that the water you use is not too hot.",
      "content": "Check that the water you use is not too hot. Another reason why your home brewed coffee may be bitter tasting is because you are using water that is too hot to brew the coffee. Using water that is too hot to brew the coffee can lead to more bitterness in your cup. You should aim for water temperatures between 195 degrees Fahrenheit (91 degrees Celsius) and 205 degrees Fahrenheit (96 degrees Celsius). Do not let the water boil to beyond 210 degrees Fahrenheit (98 degrees Celsius). [5] X Research source It may also be good to get into the habit of letting the water sit for a few minutes in the kettle so it can reduce in temperature before you pour it over your coffee grounds. Stirring the coffee grinds rapidly with a spoon once you have poured the water over them can also improve the flavor of the coffee."

      "title": "Keep your brewing equipment clean.",
      "content": "Keep your brewing equipment clean. Make sure you rinse out all your brewing equipment every time you brew coffee. Residue grounds can end up getting into your next cup, affecting the flavor and perhaps making it too bitter. Use hot water to rinse out the drip coffee equipment as well as the french press equipment so it is clean for the next time you brew coffee at home. [6] X Research source You should also let your brewing equipment air dry so it is clean and ready for use the following day."

      "title": "Store leftover coffee in a thermos.",
      "content": "Store leftover coffee in a thermos. If you use the french press brewing method, you should always pour out any leftover coffee in the french press into a thermos to keep it warm. Leaving the coffee in the press will make the coffee more bitter as it will sit longer with the grinds. When you go to pour the leftover coffee in your cup, you may end up with a very bitter cup of coffee. [7] X Research source You may also try to avoid having leftover coffee by measuring out the water by cup when you brew the coffee. For example, if you are planning to have two cups of coffee, one for you and a friend, you may measure out enough water for two cups exactly so you do not have to worry about leftover coffee sitting in the press."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go for medium roast coffee.",
      "content": "Go for medium roast coffee. Medium roast coffee tends to have a less bitter flavor than dark roast coffees. This is because medium roast coffees are often roasted for less time and at a lower temperature than dark roast coffees. As a result, medium roast coffee varieties tend to have a higher acid content and a more potent aroma than dark roast coffees, as well as less bitterness. [8] X Research source Look for medium roast coffee at your local coffee shop. Or buy medium roast coffee beans and brew your own coffee at home to your liking."

      "title": "Try decaffeinated coffee.",
      "content": "Try decaffeinated coffee. The decaffeination process of coffee has also been shown to reduce bitterness. You can try having decaf coffee beans to see if they taste less bitter. Go for decaf coffee at your local coffee shop or purchase decaf coffee beans and prepare them at home. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid instant coffee.",
      "content": "Avoid instant coffee. Though you may be tempted to save some time and energy by going for instant coffee, keep in mind it can often taste too bland or too bitter. Instant coffee only requires hot water and a few stirs to create a cup of coffee, but it can contain additives, preservatives, and low quality coffee beans. If possible, substitute instant coffee for the real thing. Go for brewed coffee that is not too bitter and enjoy the real taste of coffee in your cup. [10] X Research source"
