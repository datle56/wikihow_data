      "title": "Wash your jeans in hot water.",
      "content": "Wash your jeans in hot water. Put your jeans in your washing machine and run them through a standard washing cycle. Set the machine to the hottest water level possible preferably 60 Â°C or higher. Avoid using delicate or hand-wash settings. Instead, use a permanent press or heavy duty setting. The combination of hot water and heavy churning will cause the fibers in your jeans to contract. Use detergent and liquid fabric softener as usual. Detergent will not reduce the effectiveness of this technique, and fabric softener can actually help to prevent the jeans from becoming too stiff as they shrink."

    {
      "title": "Dry your jeans in a drying machine.",
      "content": "Dry your jeans in a drying machine. As soon as you remove your jeans from the washing machine, transfer them to your dryer. Dry the jeans completely using the hottest setting possible. The heat of the dryer will cause the fibers to contract even more than they did in the washer. Let your jeans dry completely. In fact, if you can leave the jeans in your dryer for 5 to 10 minutes longer after they finish drying, you may have even better results. Do not air dry. Air drying your jeans following this method can actually cause some of the shrinkage to stretch out. Do not air dry or hang your jeans, just fold and store them in the closet."

    {
      "title": "Repeat as needed.",
      "content": "Repeat as needed. One cycle is usually enough to tighten up your jeans, but if your jeans still feel a little loose, try running them through another cycle or two. Try a professional dry cleaner if you cannot get your jeans to shrink sufficiently in your own washer and dryer. The machines at a dry cleaner have higher heat settings."

    {
      "title": "Fill a spray bottle with fabric softener and hot water.",
      "content": "Fill a spray bottle with fabric softener and hot water. Mix three parts water with one part liquid fabric softener inside a standard spray bottle. [1] X Research source Put the top on the bottle and shake vigorously to combine. You need to use a combination of water and fabric softener. This technique will not work correctly if you only use plain water. Do not use detergent, however, since you will not be rinsing the detergent out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spray the area you want to shrink.",
      "content": "Spray the area you want to shrink. Douse the area you want to shrink using your diluted fabric softener. [2] X Research source Make sure that the entire area is well-soaked. The dry portions of your jeans will not be affected. This method is especially helpful if the waistband has begun to stretch out. If this is the case, spray the solution on the waistband of your jeans, saturating the fabric completely around the entire band."

    {
      "title": "Throw your jeans in the dryer.",
      "content": "Throw your jeans in the dryer. Put your jeans through a standard drying cycle using the hottest heat setting possible. The high heat should cause the fibers of the wet fabric to constrict. Air drying the jeans will not have the same effect."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat as needed.",
      "content": "Repeat as needed. If the area does not shrink as much as you would like, apply more of your fabric softener solution and dry it again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put your jeans on.",
      "content": "Put your jeans on. Slip on the loose pair of jeans, zippering and buttoning them up as usual. [3] X Research source This is the only method in which you must wear your jeans as you shrink them. Since you will be shrinking your jeans as you wear them, the jeans will shrink around your legs, create a perfect, snug fit. You should begin this process on the same day you plan to wear your jeans. If this is not possible, then use this method to shrink your jeans a day or two before you wear them. Do not wash the jeans after shrinking them, though, since doing so could cause the fibers to relax and ease back into their original, loose position."

      "title": "Fill the bathtub with hot water.",
      "content": "Fill the bathtub with hot water. Fill the tub with enough hot water to cover your legs and waist completely. Make the water as hot as you can tolerate. Obviously, you want to avoid burning yourself with water that is too hot to handle, but lukewarm water will not be able to cause the fibers to contract enough for sufficient shrinkage. Test the temperature of the water with your hand to gauge how hot it is."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get in the bathtub.",
      "content": "Get in the bathtub. Slowly ease yourself into the hot water while still wearing your jeans. Remain in the bathtub until the water cools to room temperature. If you made the water sufficiently hot, it should take at least 20 minutes for the water to cool. Make sure that your jeans are completely submerged under the water. If your legs or part of your waistband remain above water, add more hot water to the bathtub until these exposed portions are submerged, as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sit out in the sun until dry.",
      "content": "Sit out in the sun until dry. Air dry your jeans so that they conform to the shape of your legs. If possible, sit outside in a sunny location to do this. Make sure to choose a hot day to prevent yourself from getting sick and to help the jean fibers continue to contract. Sit in a plastic or metal chair. Avoid absorbent surfaces that may soak up the water from your jeans. You may need to turn yourself as you sit or lie out in the sun. Otherwise, the tops of your legs will dry while the back will remain wet. It can take several hours for your jeans to dry."

    {
      "title": "Turn your jeans inside-out.",
      "content": "Turn your jeans inside-out. Make sure that the jeans are turned completely inside-out. Fold them loosely and set aside. [4] X Research source Turning your jeans inside-out will lessen the amount of fading that will occur. Your jeans should still shrink the same way without any problems, even if turned inside-out. This step is especially necessary if shrinking new jeans with a fairly dark wash. If working with a pair of light wash jeans or an old pair of jeans that area already faded, you might be able to skip this step without causing much if any damage."

      "title": "Boil a large stockpot of water.",
      "content": "Boil a large stockpot of water. Fill a large stockpot halfway to three-quarters full with standard tap water. Set it on the stove and bring it up to a full, rolling boil using high heat. The water is at a full boil when large, rolling waves of bubbles violently break the surface of the water. You need to make sure that you use enough water and a large enough stockpot so for the jeans to be completely submerged."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dunk your jeans in the boiling water.",
      "content": "Dunk your jeans in the boiling water. Use tongs to place your jeans in the boiling water. Let them soak for 20 to 30 minutes as the water continues to boil. Do not cover the stockpot as your jeans soak. Check periodically to make sure that the fabric stays submerged in the water. If needed, push the jeans under from time to time using your tongs."

    {
      "title": "Dry your jeans in the dryer.",
      "content": "Dry your jeans in the dryer. Remove your jeans from the boiling water and transfer them to your dryer immediately. Use the hottest dryer setting possible and dry your jeans completely. The intense heat of the dryer will further tighten the fibers already tightened by the hot, turbulent water. Make sure that you use tongs as you hand the jeans since they will be very hot. Do not air-dry the jeans. Make sure that the jeans are completely dry when you remove them from the drying machine."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wash your jeans using hot water.",
      "content": "Wash your jeans using hot water. You can use a standard hot water cycle in your washing machine or you can boil the jeans in hot water. The former will allow you to wash your jeans as you shrink them, while the latter will be quicker. The boiling method is also slightly more flexible. If you only wanted to shrink a portion of your jeans, like the legs or waistband, you could submerge that portion only under the boiling water. Hold it in place using tongs. If using the washing machine method, add detergent and liquid fabric softener as usual. Make sure that the water is as hot as possible for either method."

    {
      "title": "Dry your jeans until damp.",
      "content": "Dry your jeans until damp. Throw your jeans into the dryer and dry until they are damp but not soaked. Set the dryer on its highest heat setting. This is especially important if you used boiling water or if your washing machine did not put your jeans through a spin cycle. Your jeans should still be wet, but not dripping wet."

    {
      "title": "Iron the jeans until dry.",
      "content": "Iron the jeans until dry. Place your damp jeans on the ironing board and iron until the fabric is completely dry. Use a moderate heat setting. Note that this may not shrink the jeans as much as some of the other methods described, but it can be effective if you only need a slight adjustment."
