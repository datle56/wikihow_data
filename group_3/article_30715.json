      "content": "Use a common 12 inch (30 cm) ruler to roughly measure a small tree. This is a great technique for a quick estimate, but not ideal for taking a precise measurement. Hold the ruler against the tree at diameter breast height (DBH), or 4.5 feet (1.4 m) above ground. Line up the left edge of the ruler with the left edge of the tree and read the measurement where the right side of the tree visually lines up with the ruler. This method is best only when you want a very rough and fast estimate of a tree’s diameter. If the tree is growing on a slope, measure DBH on the uphill side of the trunk. [1] X Research source If the tree has a split or forked trunk, measure the trunk just below the fork as close to DBH as you can."

      "content": "Find the tree's circumference with a measuring tape and divide by pi. Just wrap a common measuring tape all the way around the middle of the tree at DBH. Record the circumference at the point where the two ends of the tape meet. [2] X Trustworthy Source State of Massachusetts Official website for the State of Massachusetts Go to source Then, all you need to do to calculate the diameter is divide that number by pi (3.1416). Using a cloth measuring tape (like a tailor would use) is better than a common household metal tape measure because it is more flexible and will conform to the shape of the tree."

      "content": "Measure circumference precisely with a string, then calculate diameter. For this method, wrap a long string around the tree at DBH and cut the string where it meets. Then, measure that length with a measuring tape or yardstick to find the circumference. [3] X Trustworthy Source State of Massachusetts Official website for the State of Massachusetts Go to source Divide that number by pi (3.1416) to get the diameter. [4] X Research source Using a string to take the circumference measurement is more accurate than using a measuring tape because the string is more flexible and bends easier to the tree. If the tree is very big, recruit a friend to help with this method or bring along a thumb tack to secure the string to the tree."

      "content": "Take an easy measurement with a tree caliper. To use a tree caliper , open the caliper wider than the tree, place its arms on either side at DBH, and close the caliper as tight as it will go around the tree. Then, read the number on the caliper at the point where the lower arm stopped on the guide to find the diameter. [5] X Research source If the tree is not perfectly round, take two measurements: one on the wider side of the trunk, and one on the narrow side. Then, calculate the average of both by adding them together and dividing by 2. [6] X Research source If the tree is leaning at an angle, hold the caliper at the same angle of the lean to keep it perpendicular to the tree."

      "content": "Hold a tree-scale stick up to the tree for an estimated measurement. Hold the tree-scale stick against the tree at DBH, 25 in (64 cm) from your eyes. Then, line up the left edge of the stick to the left edge of the tree and read the number on the stick that lines up with the right edge of the tree. [7] X Research source Like the ruler method, this is not the most accurate way of measuring diameter, but is useful if you want a rough estimate. Tree-scale sticks are also known as Biltmore sticks."

All you have to do to use the tape is wrap it around the tree at DBH and read the number where the tape meets. This number is the diameter of the tree and there are no further calculations necessary.

      "content": "Measure multi-stemmed trees with the formula d=x+(y/2) . In this formula, d is the total diameter of the multi-stemmed tree, x is the diameter of the largest stem, and y is the diameter of all other stems combined. To start, measure the diameter of each stem. Then, add the full diameter of the largest trunk ( x ) to half of the diameter of each additional trunk ( y ). The result is the total diameter of the multi-stemmed tree ( d ). [10] X Research source For example, if you have 4 stems measuring 7, 6, 6, and 4 inches, you’d add 7+((6+6+4)/2), or 7+(16/2), to get a total diameter of 15 inches. If the stems split apart closer than 6 inches (15 cm) from the ground, then they are considered separate trees and should be measured individually."
