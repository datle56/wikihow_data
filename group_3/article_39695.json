      "title": "Even if you’re apart, you see them after you drift off to sleep.",
      "content": "Even if you’re apart, you see them after you drift off to sleep. Can’t get your mind off them, no matter how hard you try? Do you do your due diligence to avoid obsessing over someone, like an ex, but you still regularly dream of them? If that’s the case, then this person might be thinking of you all day and sending psychic signals your way. If a person consciously wants to contact you, they’ll send that intention out into the Universe, and the Universe will relay a message through one of your dreams. For example, if a person wants forgiveness, you might dream about hugging them and accepting an apology."

      "title": "They use their gift to confirm what you’ve suspected.",
      "content": "They use their gift to confirm what you’ve suspected. If the idea that a person can’t go without you keeps needling you, you might choose to consult an oracle who can read minds or interpret signs from the universe. If this individual’s pining for you is clear enough, then a psychic may be able to easily determine that you have an admirer."

      "title": "A white feather may be a special sign from a spiritual guide.",
      "content": "A white feather may be a special sign from a spiritual guide. For example, your guardian angel—perhaps Archangel Uriel, the patron of love and romance—might arrange for you to stumble upon a white feather. This beautiful and pure token might be an indication that someone has desperately fallen for you and wants you back. Butterflies are also signs of an angelic presence that wants to shepherd you toward a special person."

      "title": "These are cues from Heaven that you two are meant for each other.",
      "content": "These are cues from Heaven that you two are meant for each other. If you notice angel numbers, like 222 or 444, during multiple times of the day, then your spirit guides are gently reminding you to pay attention to a soul connection . Your angels may be conspiring to give you an extra nudge to break a period of silence and talk to someone again. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "You feel shivers when you think about this person.",
      "content": "You feel shivers when you think about this person. Even if it’s a warm summer day, it’s as though a draft has hit you, and your skin breaks out in goosebumps. It may feel like a haunting sensation, and you might even get a little perturbed. Take a deep breath and relax—someone who loves you might just be trying to send you a psychic signal. Goosebumps usually happen when you have a strong telepathic connection with someone. If you’re both thinking of each other at the exact same time, then goosebumps are a sign that each of you have a “sixth sense” and can intuit one another’s feelings."

      "title": "When your eye twitches, it might mean someone has their mind on you.",
      "content": "When your eye twitches, it might mean someone has their mind on you. If you’ve been eating well and aren’t deficient in vitamins or overusing caffeine, then your eye might twitch because you make someone’s heart flutter. Since they’re not with you right now, they send out a wish, and the Universe may translate it by making your eye twitch. It could be a way to open your eyes to someone’s love for you."
    },
    {
      "title": "They finally contact you because they need you.",
      "content": "They finally contact you because they need you. This is one of the more obvious signs that someone has been longing for you. Even if they send a fairly innocent message, like saying hello or asking about how your day has been, it’s secretly a big declaration. Their text is likely proof that they’re enamored with you and crave a response. If they work up the courage to reach out after a long time, it’s a clue that they have intensely strong feelings for you."

    {
      "title": "The sensation of a soft caress is a sign that someone wants to hold you.",
      "content": "The sensation of a soft caress is a sign that someone wants to hold you. Even though you’re alone, you might feel as though a person is stroking your hair, arm, or back. This “phantom touch” may feel alarmingly real and make your heart melt. If so, then you’re probably receiving a telepathic message full of love and longing. It’s a psychic way to “stay in touch” with you. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

    {
      "title": "You get struck with an intense sense of loss.",
      "content": "You get struck with an intense sense of loss. There are varying degrees to this sign from the Universe—you may mournfully feel as though you’ve lost a part of you, like a piece of your heart, or you might think you’ve misplaced a small but important object, like your keys. Either way, it’s a clue that someone feels like you’re the missing element in their life. The Universe will intensify your emotions so you can empathize with how strongly someone craves your presence in their life. The Universe doesn’t just make you miss old lovers—it’ll also intervene to reconnect with old friends who you share history with."

    {
      "title": "You feel that you’ve got to go searching until you find someone.",
      "content": "You feel that you’ve got to go searching until you find someone. If you’re very anxious and can’t stay in one place, then someone might be inspiring you to get closer to them. Once you take some steps to reconnect with the person you’ve fallen out of touch with, then your nervousness is likely to subside. The Universe will reward you with a sense of peace for going through the journey of rekindling things."

    {
      "title": "Their name is on the tip of your tongue because you’re on their mind.",
      "content": "Their name is on the tip of your tongue because you’re on their mind. If this person is smitten with you, then you’ll feel tempted to keep using their name. If your heart is open to them, even if you haven’t spoken, then the two of you might have a special connection. You both find it all too easy to mention each other. The Universe may nudge you to say their name more often as its sneaky way of encouraging you to get back in touch with them. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Their positive and loving energy makes you melt.",
      "content": "Their positive and loving energy makes you melt. Even if you’re not consciously aware of it, you might inspire “high vibration” emotions in someone else, like love, hope, or faith. Since you’re such an uplifting presence for someone else, you’ll feel their state of mind from afar. Their warmth and happiness will perk you up and make you smile. The Universe will fill your heart with positivity so you’re more likely to remember the good times you shared with someone."
    },
    {
      "title": "Since this person thinks about you so much, their inner circle likes you.",
      "content": "Since this person thinks about you so much, their inner circle likes you. You don’t have to go out of your way to influence them or even strike up a conversation with them. Instead, the important people in this person’s life will naturally embrace you. Since you’ve left such a positive impression on this individual, you’ll come across as a unique and remarkable presence to everyone else."

    {
      "title": "Your synchronistic encounters are proof you’re meant for one another.",
      "content": "Your synchronistic encounters are proof you’re meant for one another. Remember—if there’s a will, there’s a way. When someone has their heart set on finding you again, the Universe will find a way to help out. It’ll create a series of “event paths” that’ll lead you both back into each other’s life. Once you meet up again, you’ll probably feel an incredible spark and reignite things again."
    },
    {
      "title": "They’re flustered when they’re around you because they adore you.",
      "content": "They’re flustered when they’re around you because they adore you. If they finally get the chance to see you again, they’ll savor the moment. On top of that, their cheeks will burn because you fire them up. They’ll probably start envisioning starting or revisiting a love connection, so now’s a good time to explore romance (if that’s what you’re in the mood for)."
    },
    {
      "title": "This person is searching for every possible way to reach you.",
      "content": "This person is searching for every possible way to reach you. Words have a lot of power, and maybe the person who’s missing you is too shy to get in touch. Instead, they’ll surrender and leave everything up to the Universe. This higher power might have a wonderful sense of humor and leave you with a message like, “You are being fondly thought of,” when you crack open a fortune cookie."
    },
    {
      "title": "They’re walking down memory lane, so you do, too.",
      "content": "They’re walking down memory lane, so you do, too. Whenever they get tempted to think fondly about the past, then you’ll also be inspired to do the same. For example, they might play a song that you both listened to on your first date. Suddenly, you’re hit with a desire to turn it on, too. Even from afar, the both of you will share a special moment together (even if you don’t know it). The Universe orchestrates this series of events so you can realize that it’s destiny for you to reconnect with this person."
    },
    {
      "title": "They have a tight bond with you, so they intuit what you’re up to.",
      "content": "They have a tight bond with you, so they intuit what you’re up to. It’s likely that their heart is open to you, so they can sense whenever there’s a new development in your life. For example, if you get a promotion, they might feel a rush of joy. When they speak to you again, they might make a statement like, “I’m so proud of all you’ve accomplished at work!,” even if you haven’t said a word about it."
    },
    {
      "title": "You’re hit with an impossible-to-ignore passion and miss their presence.",
      "content": "You’re hit with an impossible-to-ignore passion and miss their presence. It’s almost as though you’re going through withdrawal now that you’re not seeing each other anymore. Every iota of your being seems to be pressing you to make amends and get back in touch with this person. You feel as though you won’t be “complete” until you reunite. This sensation is often the Universe's way of trying to manifesting love or a tight bond."
    },
    {
      "title": "You’re up and down all day.",
      "content": "You’re up and down all day. If you’re you’re spiritually synched with someone with someone, then you’ll start to experience all of their emotions. So, even if you’ve had a wonderful day, they might be going through a crisis. If that’s the case, then you’ll internalize what they’re going through, which can result in the sense that you’re not in full control of your feelings anymore."
    },
    {
      "title": "They use their online presence as a way to get your attention.",
      "content": "They use their online presence as a way to get your attention. Even if you’ve blocked or unfollowed them, you might still see them on other people’s pages. For example, they might be tagged in pictures of parties or outings. If you can’t evade them in the digital world, then the Universe may be encouraging you to strike up a conversation."
    },
    {
      "title": "The Universe communicates someone’s stuck on you with hiccups.",
      "content": "The Universe communicates someone’s stuck on you with hiccups. If you haven’t been eating or drinking too quickly and you suddenly have a fit of hiccups, it’s probably a cosmic sign. Sneezes or inexplicable stomach aches are other ways a higher force might tell you someone's thinking about you. Keep in mind that it’s all in good fun—the Universe just wants you to stop for a moment and reflect on someone special. [4] X Research source Hiccups are one of the more comical ways that the Universe gets its message across—sometimes it just likes to play around! The Universe is especially likely to use this method if it wants to reconnect you with someone who has a great sense of humor."
