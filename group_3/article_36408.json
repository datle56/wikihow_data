      "title": "Shut off the power.",
      "content": "Shut off the power. Whether you are removing the light fixture from the ceiling or wall, or stripping it as it is, cut off the electricity before you start. Go to your circuit breaker or fuse box. Switch off the appropriate circuit or unscrew the correct fuse. Eliminate the risk of electrical shock and injury. [1] X Research source If your circuits or fuses are missing labels, either shut off all the power or test each one until you find the correct one."

      "title": "Remove the light fixture.",
      "content": "Remove the light fixture. If possible, favor taking it down over cleaning it where it is. Reduce the chance of stripping paint from the ceiling or wall by accident. Work in an area of your choosing, with proper ventilation and safer footing than a ladder. Exact instructions for removing light fixtures will vary according to their design, but generally they follow these points: [2] X Research source Taking light bulbs out to avoid damage. Unscrewing the plate from the mounting bracket in the ceiling. Using a circuit tester to confirm that the wiring is powerless. Disconnecting the wiring."

      "title": "Protect other surface areas.",
      "content": "Protect other surface areas. Lay down a dropcloth, tarp, newspapers, or similar material over the floor. If you have removed the light fixture, also cover your worktable. If you are using more than one covering, check for gaps between them. If you are keeping the fixture in place, apply painter’s tape around it to protect the ceiling or wall. [3] X Research source Drips from the cleaning agent may strip paint or otherwise mar other surfaces."
    },
    {
      "title": "Protect yourself.",
      "content": "Protect yourself. Wear cleaning gloves. Protect your eyes with safety glasses, especially if you are working from underneath the fixture. If using a ladder, make sure it is high enough to work safely, rather than overreach and lose balance on a shorter ladder. Open windows and use fans to create cross-breezes for circulation. [4] X Research source Fumes from cleaning agents may be overpowering or poisonous. For long projects or areas with poor ventilation, wear a ventilation mask, especially if you are working on a ladder."

      "title": "Determine the type of paint.",
      "content": "Determine the type of paint. If you painted the fixture yourself, ask yourself what you used: latex, acrylic, or spray paint. [5] X Expert Source Jeff Baldwin Residential Painter Expert Interview. 1 March 2021. For latex or acrylic, you will need rubbing alcohol to strip it. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source For spray paint, you will need acetone. [8] X Research source If someone else painted it, look for brush strokes, which indicates latex or acrylic paint. If you are still unsure, select two separate areas to test each chemical. [9] X Expert Source Jeff Baldwin Residential Painter Expert Interview. 1 March 2021. Do not mix rubbing alcohol and acetone by applying it to the same area. Wipe off whichever one doesn’t work, wipe again with clean water to rinse, and let it dry before using the other."

    {
      "title": "Soak your cleaning cloth.",
      "content": "Soak your cleaning cloth. If the area to be cleaned is very small, simply wet a corner with rubbing alcohol or acetone. For larger surface areas, pour the agent into a plugged sink or bowl and soak the whole cloth. Wring out any excess to reduce the chance of accidental drips. [10] X Research source Both rubbing alcohol and acetone may affect other surfaces if they come into contact by mistake."

    {
      "title": "Rub the paint.",
      "content": "Rub the paint. Scrub the surface area with your soaked cloth. [11] X Research source Soak the paint first so the cleaning agent has time to be absorbed and loosen the paint’s bond. Then scrub more forcefully to remove the paint. [12] X Expert Source Jeff Baldwin Residential Painter Expert Interview. 1 March 2021. Due to the heat generated by light bulbs, the paint may have baked onto the surface, which may make rubbing ineffective. However, always start with cloths to see if that works, since harder tools may damage the metal, wood, or plastic."

      "title": "Soak the paint with mineral oils if necessary.",
      "content": "Soak the paint with mineral oils if necessary. If rubbing with a cloth doesn’t work, use a utility knife to cut X’s in the paint. Apply as little pressure as possible to avoid nicking the fixture’s original surface. Then soak a new cleaning cloth with mineral oils and wipe it over the paint. Give it a half-hour or more to sit. Then try rubbing the paint off again. Repeat as needed. Depending on how thick the paint it is, this may require several soaks. Very thick coats may require a few days’ worth of repeated applications."

      "title": "Wet your cleaning cloth.",
      "content": "Wet your cleaning cloth. First, put on a pair of heat-resistant cleaning gloves. Protect your hands from scalding, since you want to use the solution while it’s still hot. Immerse a portion of your cleaning cloth into the water. Squeeze out the excess to avoid dripping boiled water on yourself. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Soak the glass. Gently rub the cloth over the painted area, rewetting as necessary. Worry less about removing the paint at first and more about soaking it. Let the heated solution weaken the paint’s bond to the glass for easier removal. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Scrape if necessary. If any paint refuses to budge, wet the surface area again with your solution. Depending on how long you’ve been working, it may have cooled off by now, so reheat it if you need to. Wait a moment for the paint to soak it in. Then gently scrape the paint off with a utility knife. Work slowly and surely to avoid scratching the glass. [17] X Research source"
