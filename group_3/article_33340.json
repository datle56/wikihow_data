      "title": "Quordle is like Wordle, only you play 4 games at once.",
      "content": "Quordle is like Wordle, only you play 4 games at once. The rules of Wordle are simple: players have 6 attempts to correctly guess one 5-letter word. They receive hints for this word via green, gray, and yellow tiles, based on their previous guesses. Quordle uses the exact same game mechanics as Wordle, but in Quordle, players have 9 attempts (not 6) to guess four 5-letter words (divided into quadrants), instead of just one. Basically, Quordle is Wordle, if it were 4 times harder and 4 times more fun! [1] X Research source"

To download it , go to your device’s app store, search “Quordle” and click the “get” or “install” button next to the first search result. Because of the game’s popularity, you’re likely to find multiple offbrand versions of Quordle in your app store.

      "title": "Guess a 5-letter word.",
      "content": "Guess a 5-letter word. Much like you do when you play Wordle , begin a Quordle game by typing your first 5-letter guess into the empty boxes on your screen. Each guess you make is counted in all 4 Quordle quadrants. You must correctly guess all 4 words within 9 tries, so choose wisely. [3] X Research source For your first few guesses, choose words with multiple vowels and completely different letters like “abide,” “radio,” “quiet,” “unique,” and “hokey.”"

      "title": "Analyze the color of your tiles after each word.",
      "content": "Analyze the color of your tiles after each word. After each guess, your Quordle game will give you hints for each word by changing the color of the tiles in your previous word. [4] X Research source Green tiles mean you correctly guessed a letter for your word and the letter you guessed is in the correct position. Yellow tiles mean you guessed the correct letter for a word, but it’s in the wrong place. Gray tiles mean the letter you guessed is not in the correct word whatsoever. Quordle will give you different hints for each of the 4 words, so your colored tiles will be slightly different in each quadrant."

      "title": "Get as many letters as possible on the board in your first 3 guesses.",
      "content": "Get as many letters as possible on the board in your first 3 guesses. Because you have only 9 tries, be tactful with your word choices. Instead of trying to solve any of the 4 words after your 1st guess, choose a new word with 5 completely different letters. The more hints you give yourself early on, the easier guessing will be in the later half of the game. [5] X Research source For example, if your 1st word was “peach” tiles might show the letters c, h, and e as yellow in 1 quadrant, but gray in the other 3. Trying to solve immediately with a word like “chest” or “niche” would require you to use at least 3 letters you know won’t appear anywhere else, meaning you’d be restricting 60% of your clues on the rest of the gameboard. Good 3 word combos to start your Quordle game include “burly,” “atone,” and “pinch;” “media,” “prowl,” and “funky;” and “bayou,” “melts,” and “prick.”"

      "content": "Enter words with green and yellow letters for your final 6 guesses. Once you’ve input a variety of letters in your first 3 guesses, begin using the tile colors from your previous words to inform your final 6 guesses. Because Quordle includes 4 different Wordle games, the tile colors may be different on each board. A letter may show a green tile in 1 game and a gray tile in another. Try to refine your guesses so your letter placements have a big impact on all 4 games at once. [6] X Research source Once you correctly guess 1 of the 4 words, none of your guesses will be applied to that word’s quadrant anymore."

      "title": "Continue guessing words until all the letter tiles are green.",
      "content": "Continue guessing words until all the letter tiles are green. After each guess, you’ll receive more colored tiles, which will offer more insight into the correct word in each quadrant. Guess the different words in all 4 quadrants within 9 tries to win a Quordle game.

Your friends will be super impressed that you won 4 games at once."

      "title": "Solve 1 quadrant at a time with your remaining guesses.",
      "content": "Solve 1 quadrant at a time with your remaining guesses. Once you’ve gotten some hints on the board, focus on solving 1 of the 4 words at a time. Start with the word that has the most green and yellow tiles and work your way across the board from most to least tiles filled. If you have a lot of yellow letters in a word, think of common letter combinations that tile might appear with. For example, th, re, and en appear a lot at the beginning of words (third, throw, thank, reuse, relay, reply, enter, enemy, enjoy) while nt, nd, and ed appear a lot at the end (faint, scent, blunt, grind, blend, round, wired, payed, shred)."

      "title": "Use words with 2 of the same letter if you’re stumped.",
      "content": "Use words with 2 of the same letter if you’re stumped. Sometimes, a word may include 2 of the same letter in multiple places. Look at your green tiles and try to determine if that letter might appear multiple times in your word. [8] X Research source For example, if you had a green “o” tile in the middle space, think of words with double o patterns like floor, broom, and moose. The most double letter patterns are ee (cheek, freed), ll (still, walls), ss (cross, dress), oo, tt (matte, attic), ff (staff, riffs), rr (carry, hurry), nn (funny, annex), pp (happy, penne), and cc (mecca, occur). Ee, ll, ss, and ff are the most common double letter patterns that end a word. Double-consonants almost always begin and end with a vowel on either side. Only use this strategy late in your Quordle game, when you’re truly lost on what the word might be. Using the same letter for a word early on limits your options and makes your guess less effective."
