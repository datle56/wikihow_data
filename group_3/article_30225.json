      "content": "Pour 3 tbsp (51 g) of salt and water into 3 plastic water bottles. Use any size of disposable plastic bottles for the easiest set-up and clean up. Pour 3 tablespoons (51 g) of table salt per bottle. Fill the rest of the bottle with water (if they’re not already). Put the caps back on and shake the bottles to thoroughly mix the salt. Salt lowers the freezing point of water (or ice), which can make it feel colder than regular water. [1] X Research source Any standard salt you have in your kitchen will work."

      "content": "Freeze all of the bottles. Leave them inside for a few hours until they are completely frozen. Once the water turns to ice, take the bottles out and set them aside. [2] X Research source How long it takes for the water to freeze depends on the size of the bottles and the temperature of your freezer. To speed up the process, adjust the freezer to its lowest setting. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Set the bottles 6 in (15 cm) in front of your fan. A table fan or box fan works best, but you can use any fan you want. Turn on the fan and put your bottles in front of it. The air will circulate around the ice, picking up its cold temperature and distributing it throughout your space. [4] X Research source Keep the fan on as long as the bottles are frozen. Try to spread the bottles out so they don’t block any of the fan’s airstream. Put the bottles on a small table in front of a standing fan. Try not to use the oscillation setting on your fan if it has one. Instead, keep it pointed at the water bottles for the whole time."

      "content": "Put your bottles back in the freezer to reuse them. When the ice melts, simply freeze the bottles again. In a few hours, you can run your fan like an air conditioner again! Keep multiple bottles of water and ice in your freezer so you don’t have to wait for them to freeze again."

Hold the bottle securely with your non-dominant hand against a cutting board, and poke the tip of utility knife through the bottle and work halfway around the bottle. Do the same cut on the other bottle. [5] X Research source Be careful when handling a utility knife."

Make a row of holes around the bottle 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) above the cut. Once you finish making the first row, drill 2-3 more rows above it, spacing them 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) apart.

Feed a wire or string through 2 of the holes in each bottle. Wrap the string around the fan grating and tie a knot to secure them. To keep them in place, tie another string around the bottles’ nozzles. [7] X Research source Tie one bottle on each side of the motor compartment of the fan. You can also place 2 frozen ice packs inside mesh bags and hang them from the grating on your fan with paper clips, string, or zip ties . [8] X Research source"

Turn your fan on high and point it towards the area you want to cool down. [9] X Research source The fan will pull the cold air from the bottles through the holes you drilled. Since the bottles are attached to the fan, you can use the oscillating feature if your fan has one."

Open the window on the side of your house where the wind blows inside, or open a window that faces shaded, cooler areas outside. On the opposite side of your home, open the window and place a box fan so that it blows air outside. This way, one window will pull in cool air and the fan will push out hot air. [11] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Department of Energy Official site for the U.S. Department of Energy, which provides resources related to energy safety, conservation, and efficiency Go to source Hot air tends to rise, while cold air sinks. [12] X Research source If your house has multiple levels, position the fan (or multiple box fans) on the upper level and open the windows on the bottom level. To create natural ventilation without a fan, slightly open the window facing the direction where the wind blows into your home. Open the window on the opposite side of your home even wider.

The water will evaporate and create a wind-chill effect. [14] X Research source As wind chill increases, it draws heat away from the air and your body, driving down your skin and internal body temperature. [15] X Research source Although this method doesn’t actually cool the air, it does make it feel cooler and make you feel more comfortable in your home."

      "content": "Set your ceiling fan so it rotates counterclockwise in the summer. Ceiling fans are the most effective types of fans because they circulate tons of air to create a draft throughout the room. In the summer, make sure your fan is rotating in a counterclockwise direction so it moves cold air upward. [16] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Department of Energy Official site for the U.S. Department of Energy, which provides resources related to energy safety, conservation, and efficiency Go to source If it isn’t, turn it off and press the small button or switch near the top. In the winter, flip the switch again to turn your fan in a clockwise direction and set it on a low speed. This will move warm air from the ceiling down to the other areas in your space. To cut down on your energy bills, make sure to turn off ceiling fans when you leave the room."

Most fans come with a manual that tells you how to best clean the blades, but if that’s not available, unplug the fan and remove any screws holding the plastic cage over the blades. [17] X Research source Pry the cage off the fan with a flat-head screwdriver or putty knife. Use a vacuum to suck the dust off the blades. For a deeper clean, scrub the blades with a cloth and hot water. Optionally, add 1 ⁄ 4 c (59 mL) of vinegar and a couple drops of dish soap to the water. Additionally, remove any dust from the plastic cage, either with the vacuum or a damp warm cloth."

Both cold and hot drinks work well, but it’s best to stick to water, which can cool you down without any side effects.

Belavus says one of the best ways to stay cool without an air conditioner is to “take a cool shower before bedtime.” Cooling down in the shower can also help you feel better mentally and emotionally. [22] X Research source Regular cold showers have also been found to boost your immune system, combat symptoms of depression, improve circulation, and reduce muscle inflammation and soreness. [23] X Research source Alternatively, put your hands and feet in cold water. Your wrists and ankles have pulse points where blood vessels are close to the skin, so the water will make you feel cooler quickly. [24] X Research source"
