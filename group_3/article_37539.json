If you get mail sent to the correct address, but the recipient doesn’t live there, clearly print “Not at this address” somewhere on the item. Don’t write “Return to sender” or any other messages. If you see a barcode on the item, cross it out. This will help ensure that the item doesn’t come back to your address. [1] X Research source Don’t erase or cross out the address. If you keep getting mail addressed to someone who doesn’t live at your address, tell your mail carrier or contact your local post office. They can help ensure that you don’t keep getting misdelivered mail."

After picking up your mail, put the misdelivered item back in the box and put the red flag up. The flag on your mailbox signals to your mail carrier that you have outgoing mail in the box. [3] X Research source If you get a Priority Mail Express item that’s been delivered to the wrong address, call 1-800-ASK-USPS (1-800-275-8777) and request the number for the Priority Mail Express Reporting Unit.

Don’t erase or cover the address or any of the other information on the item, either. Marking or erasing anything on the item could interfere with it going to the correct address. If the item does need to be returned to the sender rather than sent on to the intended recipient, the post office has its own authorized “Return to Sender” mark for this purpose.

Do include the individuals name as seen on the mail."

[8] X Research source If your mail carrier left you a delivery notice to sign in your mailbox, check “Refused,” sign the notice, and put it back in your mailbox. Some common types of accountable mail include Priority Mail Express , Registered Mail, Certified Mail , Collect on Delivery, and items insured for more than $200.
