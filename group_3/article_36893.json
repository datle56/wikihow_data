      "content": "Real leather doesn’t peel, but you can fix cracked leather shoes. Real leather doesn’t peel, chip, or flake, so if your shoes are peeling, it’s likely they’re actually made of faux leather. [1] X Research source Real leather can dry out and crack, though, and you can easily repair that. Clean the surface with a shoe cleaner and stuff your shoes with newspaper or rags so they hold their shape. Rub mink oil over the surface to rehydrate the leather. Then, apply a leather filler with a pallet knife, smooth it over the cracks, and allow it to dry for 6 hours. [2] X Research source You can follow up with fine sandpaper, such as 220-grit sandpaper, to gently buff the leather filler smooth if you like."

      "content": "Use sandpaper, a permanent marker, and shoe polish. Start by sanding off all of the peeling bits of faux leather with 180-grit sandpaper so you’re left with a smooth surface. Fill in the cracks with a permanent marker that closely matches the color of your shoes. Then rub shoe polish that matches the color of your shoes over the peeling area and let it dry.

      "content": "Apply shoe glue and let it dry for 24 hours. Shoe glue is a type of glue known ad E6000, which is commonly used for crafts and for, well, repairing shoes! Peel back the sole to expose as much of the surface as you can and spread a thin layer of the glue all over the inside of the sole. Put your hand in the shoe and push against the sole to form a tight seal. Then, clamp the shoe and sole together with a spring clamp and leave it to dry for a full day before you wear them.

      "content": "Cut a denim patch and attach it with fabric glue to replace the lining. If the fabric on the inside part of the heel is flaking or coming loose, you can replace it with a patch. Cut a patch of fabric from some denim or cloth. Hold the patch against the inside of the heel and mark the edges with a marker. Cut the patch to fit neatly inside your shoe with a pair of scissors. Then, apply fabric glue to the inside of your shoe and place the patch on top. Smooth out the surface and allow the glue to fully dry before you wear the shoe. [6] X Research source Check the packaging on the glue for specific drying times."

A shoe tree is a wooden stand that’s designed to hold your shoes in a way that helps prevent creases and cracks from forming. Instead of storing your shoes on the floor or in a closet, slide them onto a shoe tree until you’re ready to wear them. If you have pets, keep your shoes out of reach!"

      "content": "Store your shoes away from light and heat. Heat and light can warp your shoes and over time can cause them to peel. Keep them stored in a location away from direct sunlight or a heat source. Somewhere like your closet or a corner in your room should work fine. Allow your shoes to fully dry before you store them. The moisture can cause them to crack."

At least once a month, polish up your shoes with quality shoe polishing items such as wax polish, cream polish, or leather conditioner for leather shoes. Choose a shoe polish that matches the color of your shoes."
