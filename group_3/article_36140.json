Then, take out all of the drawers and trays and place them in your sink. Once the freezer is empty, turn it off and unplug it from the wall. [1] X Research source To help keep your food frozen in a cooler, mixologist Nathan Taylor recommends insulating the container with towels, sprinkling salt on the ice or ice packs, and wrapping the cooler in aluminum foil."

      "content": "Lay towels around the freezer and refrigerator. To protect your floor and other appliances from melting ice, lay towels on the bottom compartment of the freezer. If you’re defrosting a chest or standing freezer, place towels underneath and around the base of the appliance, too. If the freezer is connected to your refrigerator, lay towels under it. [2] X Research source If your freezer or refrigerator has a drainage hose, disconnect it and place it in a bowl or container to catch water. The hose is usually located under the grill at the bottom of the appliance. Simply use a screwdriver to remove the grill and pull out the hose. If you’re not sure if your appliance has a drainage hose, check the user’s manual."

      "content": "Place pans of hot water in the freezer, replacing them when they cool. Fill up several shallow pans with hot water using your tap, a microwave, or an electric kettle. Just make sure the water is hot, not boiling. Then, set the pans of hot water on top of towels in the freezer to help melt the ice. [3] X Research source Check on the water every 5 to 10 minutes. Once it starts to cool, dump it out and add fresh hot water. How long it takes the ice to melt depends on the buildup you’re dealing with. Light buildup might take 1 to 2 hours, while heavy buildup may take longer. To help speed up the defrosting process , use a plastic scraper or spatula to remove the softened ice. Warning : Do not place boiling water in your freezer. The high temperatures can potentially melt and damage parts of your freezer, affecting its performance."

      "content": "Dry and clean out the freezer . Use a clean towel to dry off any leftover ice and water inside the freezer. Then, mix warm water and a few drops of dish soap in a bowl. Wet a sponge or rag in the soapy water and wipe down the freezer. Simply dry the freezer with a cloth when you’re done. [4] X Research source Take a moment to wash the drawers and trays you removed from the freezer, too. House cleaning professional Chris Willatt says all you need is dish “soap, water, [and a] sponge to clean them.” Then, dry them off with a towel. As an alternative, clean your freezer with baking soda. Mix 1 tbsp (14 g) of baking soda with 2 cups (473 ml) of warm water and wet a sponge or cloth with the solution."

Once it’s cold inside, put your frozen items back in the freezer. [5] X Research source It may take 1 to 2 hours for your freezer to get cold again. If you removed the drainage hose, don’t forget to put it back inside the freezer or refrigerator. Hook the hose back inside the appliance and screw the grill back in place."

      "content": "Let the freezer stand open for 2 to 4 hours. Keep the door propped open to expose the freezer to the warm air in your home, which helps melt the ice more quickly. If you need to, place something, like a wedge, in the door to keep it open. [8] X Research source To help speed up the defrosting process : [9] X Research source Use a hair dryer to melt the ice. Hold it 6 to 12 inches (15-30 cm) away and move it back and forth across the ice. Just keep it out of direct contact with any water or ice. Aim a fan at the freezer to blow warm air inside. Put hot water in a spray bottle and spray it onto the ice. Warning : Do not use a heat gun to melt the ice. Heat guns operate at high temperatures which can potentially damage and ruin your freezer."

      "content": "Scrape the ice with a plastic spatula or wooden spoon. This is one of the quickest ways to remove frost build-up. It is safest to use a plastic spatula or wooden spoon because they are less likely to hurt you or damage the freezer. Just gently dig underneath the ice with the tool to remove it and have a bucket nearby to collect the scrapings. [12] X Research source Take out all of the food, drawers, and trays in the freezer before you begin. Lay towels on the ground around the freezer to soak up any water as you're removing the ice. With this method, you can keep the freezer running. However, this can waste a lot of energy, so it’s a good idea to turn off and unplug your freezer regardless. This method works best when combined with another method, like melting the ice with hot water. Warning : Do not use an ice pick, metal scraper, hammer, knife, or other sharp tool to scrape the ice. Hard tools can potentially puncture the freezer walls or damage the temperature elements, which could result in you needing to completely replace your freezer."

      "content": "Melt the ice with rubbing alcohol and a hot cloth. To help melt the ice and make it easier to scrape off, dip a clean rag into boiling water with tongs. Then, pour rubbing alcohol onto the cloth over the sink. Simply use the tongs to place the rag on top of the frost. Then, use a dry cloth to soak up the melted ice. [13] X Research source Alcohol lowers the freezing point of ice, which helps make it melt faster. [14] X Research source This method typically works better when you’re removing thin layers of ice rather than large chunks."

      "content": "Defrost freezers every 6 months, or when there’s lots of frost buildup. Appliance repair specialist Gevorg Grigorian recommends defrosting your freezer chest, standing freezer, or refrigerator-freezer combination appliance about every 6 months. It’s also a good idea to remove frost buildup whenever you notice ice that’s ¼ inch (6 cm) thick. [15] X Research source Grigorian notes that most newer freezers are “frost free” and don’t need regular defrosting. Frost free freezers have “a designated defrost cycle” that “will run between 6 to 8 hours.” He says “you might hear some sizzling coming from the freezer, which is normal because there's a heater there and it melts all that water off of the evaporator” to keep frost from forming. If your freezer keeps forming frost buildup or your frost free freezer develops buildup, Grigorian recommends calling an appliance repair technician to look at it, as there might be an internal issue causing the problem."

      "content": "How long does it take a freezer to defrost? How long it takes to defrost a freezer depends on how much frost has built up. Lightly frosted freezers might take 2 to 4 hours, while heavily frosted freezers might take up to 24 hours. Using hot water, a fan, or a hair dryer helps speed up the defrosting process. Using these methods may cut down the total defrosting process by 1 to 2 hours."

      "title": "Why does ice build up inside a freezer?",
      "content": "Why does ice build up inside a freezer? Ice buildup is usually due to moisture and heat. Both humidity and temperature fluctuations can cause a freezer to overwork itself and produce more ice. This might happen if you live in a humid area, put warm or hot food in your freezer, or have a freezer door that doesn’t seal properly. [21] X Research source Over or underfilling your freezer can lead to frost buildup, too. Too much food in your freezer can block the sensors and airflow, while too little food can lead to uneven temperatures. In some cases, ice buildup might be caused by damaged sensors or other parts in your freezer."

Sharp tools can easily puncture the walls of the freezer or damage sensitive parts, which can prevent your freezer from working properly. Avoid using high heat to defrost your freezer, too. Boiling water and tools like heat guns can damage the freezer’s walls, sensors, and cooling elements, too."
