      "title": "Place the index finger of your dominant hand under the tab’s ring.",
      "content": "Place the index finger of your dominant hand under the tab’s ring. This is the upper portion of the tab with a hollowed out center, closest to the edge of the can. Your finger goes behind the top of the tab. [1] X Research source The opposite end of the tab will be more in the center, and it will be the end to physically open the indentation. If you can't get your finger under the tab, use a butter knife or another flat object to pry the tab up."

      "title": "Rest your thumb on top of the tab to maintain your grip.",
      "content": "Rest your thumb on top of the tab to maintain your grip. Using the same dominant hand, put your thumb on the very center of the can. This should be on the bottom of the tab, helping to direct it."

      "title": "Hold the can with your other hand to keep it in place.",
      "content": "Hold the can with your other hand to keep it in place. This is super important so that you don’t end up spilling your drink everywhere. Grasp the side of the can so the tab is facing you, making it easier for you to open it. Place the can on a stable surface to avoid spilling it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lift the backside of the tab using your thumb and index finger.",
      "content": "Lift the backside of the tab using your thumb and index finger. Your thumb will be pressing down on the can while your index finger lifts up the back of the tab. You’ll feel resistance, but keep lifting the tab up until you pierce the opening of the can. Make sure you have a firm grasp on the can with your other hand while lifting the tab to prevent the can from moving. The bottom of the tab will put pressure on the part of the can that opens, making a hole once the aluminum is pierced."
    },
    {
      "title": "Push the tab back down, if desired.",
      "content": "Push the tab back down, if desired. Once you’ve lifted the tab completely, the hole in the can should be open and the tab will be vertical. You can push the tab back down to its original position to get it out of the way, making it lay flat again. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Create a hole in the can using a can piercer.",
      "content": "Create a hole in the can using a can piercer. Can piercers have a sharp end in the shape of a triangle, allowing you to make holes in aluminum. Place the pointy end against the top of the can (it doesn’t matter where), and hold the can in place with your other hand. Use pressure to pierce the can and form a hole. [3] X Research source Pour the drink into a glass or cup, if possible, to avoid cutting your lip on the pierced opening."

    {
      "title": "Alternatively, rub the lid of the can using a skinny, blunt object.",
      "content": "Alternatively, rub the lid of the can using a skinny, blunt object. Use the object, such as a marker or key, to create friction against the front of the indentation—right where your lips would go when you’re taking a sip of the drink. Rub the object back and forth quickly on this spot until the lid bursts open while holding the can steady with your other hand. [4] X Research source This method often creates a loud pop when successful. Make sure the object isn’t sharp—you’re trying to create friction, not tear the lid open with the object."

      "title": "Or, use a blunt butter knife to push the indentation open.",
      "content": "Or, use a blunt butter knife to push the indentation open. Find the light line where the tab would open the can, breaking the aluminum. Place a butter knife right on the edge of this line while holding the can steadily with your other hand. Apply pressure with the knife until it creates an opening, similar to how the normal tab would work. [5] X Research source Face the butter knife away from you to avoid hurting yourself. Alternatively, use a flathead screwdriver to open the can."

      "content": "Stack one can of soda on top of another can. They don’t have to be the same brand of soda, as long as both cans have a circular ridge at the bottom. Place the bottom can on a flat surface to avoid any spills. [6] X Research source This is a viral method from TikTok, with more than 1.3 million likes on the original tutorial. It’s also a great hack if you just got a manicure and want to preserve your nails !"

      "title": "Tilt the top can back so the ridge hooks under the tab of the bottom can.",
      "content": "Tilt the top can back so the ridge hooks under the tab of the bottom can. Think of the bottom ridge of the can as the tip of your finger—it needs to go underneath the tab so you can open the soda. Position the ridge in the center of the tab, or slightly off center, to get enough leverage to lift the tab up. [7] X Research source It might take a few tries to correctly position the ridge underneath the tab."

      "title": "Keep pushing the top can down to pop the tab of the bottom can.",
      "content": "Keep pushing the top can down to pop the tab of the bottom can. Once you hook the ridge of the top can underneath the tab of the bottom can, push the top can down (or away from your body) to lift the tab up. You’ll hear a popping or cracking noise when you successfully open the soda. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Place the soda can in the freezer for 5-10 minutes. Chill your soda in the refrigerator, then pop it in the freezer for a few minutes before opening it. By reducing the temperature of the soda, less carbon dioxide gas escapes the can when you crack the seal, resulting in less noise. [9] X Research source When soda is carbonated, carbon dioxide gas is added to the liquid. The gas becomes more active at higher temperatures, so if you open a soda at room-temperature (or warmer), it produces a louder sound.

      "content": "Cover the opening of the soda with a soft cloth or towel. Spread the cloth across the opening of the soda can, then gently press the edges over the sides of the can for a secure fit. This will act as a buffer to muffle any noise when you open the tab. [11] X Research source If you’re in public, stack a few napkins together to cover the opening."

      "content": "Hold the can firmly in one hand and put your thumb over the opening. Make sure that your thumb covers the edges of the opening, where the carbon dioxide gas will be released. This will act as an additional layer of soundproofing to muffle any noise. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Tilt the can away from you and open the tab slowly.",
      "content": "Tilt the can away from you and open the tab slowly. Put your index finger under the tab, then use a smooth and controlled motion to open the can. Opening the can too quickly can produce a loud popping noise, which is what you’re trying to avoid. Press your thumb into the opening of the can while you pop the tab to minimize the sound, then enjoy! [13] X Research source Tilting the can at this angle may help the carbon dioxide gas release more gradually."
