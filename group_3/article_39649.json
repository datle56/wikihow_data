      "title": "The interior lights don’t come on.",
      "content": "The interior lights don’t come on. Normally, your car’s dome lights will turn on when you open a car door. If they don’t, this could be a sign that they’re not receiving power due to a weak battery. Unless you’ve turned off this function or the fuse is blown, this is likely a sign to check your battery. [4] X Research source A dying car battery can also lead to other electrical issues. Your power windows may move more slowly, your radio might cut in and out or not work at all, or your lights and radio may come on, but the car won’t start."

      "title": "The headlights are dim or flickering.",
      "content": "The headlights are dim or flickering. Your car’s headlights will often appear duller and dimmer than normal when the car’s battery is dying, as there isn’t enough power for them to function normally. The lights may adjust their brightness randomly or not turn on at all. [5] X Research source If this is the only sign, there could just be something wrong with your headlights. However, when accompanied by one or more other warning signs, it’s likely an indication that your battery is dying."

      "title": "The battery is leaking or appears swollen.",
      "content": "The battery is leaking or appears swollen. Pop your hood and take a look at the battery itself. If there is evidence of corrosion or leaking (like dried fluid or blue, powdery battery acid), it’s time to replace the battery. Similarly, if the battery box appears swollen or cracked, it needs to be discarded. [6] X Research source A misshapen car battery needs to be properly disposed of via recycling. Ask your local auto repair shop how to do so. [7] X Research source Handling a leaky battery can be dangerous. Never touch battery acid with your bare hands. If you have to remove the battery yourself, wear gloves."

      "title": "The car needs frequent jump starts.",
      "content": "The car needs frequent jump starts. This may seem pretty obvious, but if your car can’t start without a jump, the battery is probably dying. This may happen if the battery was drained because you left your lights on or if it’s getting too old to hold a charge. Jump starts only work if the battery is weak, not if it’s completely dead, so try to get the battery replaced as soon as possible to avoid having to tow your car. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Position the booster vehicle close to the dead one.",
      "content": "Position the booster vehicle close to the dead one. Have someone with a working vehicle park as close to the dead car as possible. In most cases, the battery is located beneath the hood, so parking hood-to-hood is ideal. Sometimes, though, the battery may be located elsewhere (like the trunk), so check your owner’s manual if you have trouble finding it. [10] X Research source If you suspect your car battery is dying and don’t see any obvious signs of corrosion, try jump-starting it first to see if you can recharge it before replacing the battery altogether. It could’ve died because of a fluke, like leaving your lights on or being exposed to cold weather. If you have to jump-start it frequently, however, it’s probably time to see a mechanic or replace the battery. If your battery is located somewhere other than beneath the hood, Maynes says it’s called a “relocated battery.” Vehicles with these batteries have “jump points underneath the hood,” so refer to your owner’s manual for instructions on how to jump-start your car."

      "title": "Locate the battery and connect the jumper cables.",
      "content": "Locate the battery and connect the jumper cables. Once you’ve found your car’s battery, look for the battery terminals, which are metal nubs located on the top or side of the battery. Keep the metal clamps of the jumper cables from touching each other while clipping the batteries, and wear gloves and protective eyewear. Follow these steps to properly attach the jumper cables: 1. Attach a red clamp to the positive (+) terminal on the dead battery. 2. Attach the other red clamp to the positive (+) terminal on the booster battery. 3. Attach a black clamp to the negative (-) terminal on the booster battery. 4. Attach the other black clamp to an unpainted metal part on the car with the dead battery. Maynes says attaching the second black clamp to an unpainted metal part prevents the energy spike from “[jumping] over and [spiking] your system” when the car starts. Otherwise, it could damage your alternator."

Then, try starting the dead car. If it doesn’t start immediately, continue to charge it for a few minutes. When it starts, it should be charged enough to run. Generally, it should take about 5 minutes to jump-start a car, but it could take longer depending on outside factors, like cold weather."

Disconnect the jumper cables in the reverse order they were attached. Make sure the metal clamps do not touch each other as you disconnect them. Follow these steps to disconnect the cables properly: 1. Disconnect the black negative (-) clamp from the jumped (dead) car. 2. Disconnect the black negative (-) clamp from the booster car. 3. Disconnect the red positive (+) clamp from the booster car. 4. Disconnect the red positive (+) clamp from the jumped car."

      "content": "Take your car to a professional if you don’t have experience. While changing a car battery yourself isn’t too difficult, it can be dangerous if done incorrectly. If you’re not sure about your abilities, play it safe and have a mechanic or other auto professional replace it for you. This may cost a bit more than doing it yourself, but it isn’t worth injuring yourself or causing damage to your car. A professional can also determine if the car battery is dying or if something else is the problem. [12] X Research source If you feel confident that you can replace the battery yourself, proceed to the next steps."

      "title": "Test the battery before replacing it.",
      "content": "Test the battery before replacing it. Turn off the ignition and any accessories, and set your multimeter to 20V DC if it isn’t auto-ranging. While wearing gloves, attach the red, positive (+) multimeter lead to the positive battery terminal and the black, negative (-) lead to the negative terminal. Turn the ignition key to the “On” position and turn the headlights on for 30 seconds. If the reading is over 12.5 volts, the battery is fully charged and in good condition. If it’s between 12-12.3 volts, it’s operating at 3/4 capacity and shouldn’t need to be replaced right away. If it’s at 11.8 volts or lower, it’s in critical condition, operating at only 25% capacity, and needs to be replaced. [13] X Research source Sometimes, it may seem like your battery is to blame when something else is actually wrong with your car. Testing the battery is a great way to see if it actually needs to be replaced or not. If the battery isn’t entirely dead, try jump-starting it before replacing it. If nothing is obviously wrong with the battery, it could’ve died on a fluke, like cold weather. If you’re not comfortable testing the battery yourself, take your car to a professional. Generally, it’s recommended to have your battery tested at least twice a year."

      "title": "How does a car battery work?",
      "content": "How does a car battery work? Car batteries are composed of lead plates alternating with plates of other materials, which are surrounded by an electrolyte solution of sulfuric acid and water. When the car ignition is engaged, the electrolyte solution reacts with the lead plates and starts the car. In short, the battery sends electrical energy to the car’s ignition and starter motor. [33] X Research source The alternator helps the battery recharge and maintain a charge. When the engine runs, the alternator siphons some energy from the engine and turns it into electrical energy, which is then transferred to the battery to recharge it."
