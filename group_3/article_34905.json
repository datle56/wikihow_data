Not only do you need to know coverages and plays but also how to read them. You also need to know every play in the playbook and how to perform it. Only one way to do this and that's study, it might be long and boring, but it's crucial to become a great QB."

      "content": "Develop your leadership skills. Quarterbacks need to control the game. There is no room for error in a football game, so quarterbacks need to keep their heads up. Make sure to be a leader during practices too. Your team won't respect you if you only goof off during practices and then try to tell them what to do in the game. [1] X Research source Make sure to always be calm and collected. If you make a bad throw or your team starts losing, don't freak out. You need to be the leader of the team and be able to rally your team and get them back into it."

      "content": "Build up your arm strength and legs too. You'll need to throw the ball far and be accurate when you throw. You need to have great arm and leg strength. In order to throw far and on target, develop strong arms and strong legs to step into the throw. Ways to work on these are push-ups, crunches, pull-ups, etc. [2] X Research source The stronger legs you have, the better the footwork, and you'll have increased accuracy in passing, and even more throw power."

      "title": "Develop speed.",
      "content": "Develop speed. Speed is not critical but is useful. Sometimes a QB will find a big defensive gap and decide to run instead of pass. But if you can barely run, this will be very little help. Practice by running ladders or doing a daily exercise. It will build your ability very quickly. [5] X Research source"

If you're running, then you should change it to a pass. But if they call an audible, see what formation they are in. If they are in a nickel and you're passing it, change the pass to a run."

      "content": "Trust your teammates. For any of these tips to work at all, you need to have people you know you can rely on to take a ball to the end zone, and do it with confidence. You can do this by meeting after games and talking with your running-back, wide receivers, linebackers, etc. and gain their trust as well as vice versa."
