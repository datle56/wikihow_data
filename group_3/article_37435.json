    {
      "title": "Show you’re thankful if it’s a friendly compliment.",
      "content": "Show you’re thankful if it’s a friendly compliment. Enjoy the attention when a buddy describes your personality perfectly. After you’ve known a person for a long time, you can tell that any of their rave reviews about you are really sincere. Check if he’s talking about a ton of awesome traits that have nothing to do with your appearance—your honesty, integrity, and empathy all count. Say you’re glad that he sees what you value about yourself. [1] X Research source “Aw! You’re really thoughtful.” “That feels really good to hear.” “You always see the best in me!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Be a little vulnerable if a friend is trying to cheer you up.",
      "content": "Be a little vulnerable if a friend is trying to cheer you up. Accept comfort and solidarity when he’s just being sympathetic. That specific word might’ve just slipped out because he’s worried about you. If he’s playing it safe and just patting you on the shoulder or asking you what’s wrong, he probably sees you like family. It’s possible that he just wants to fix the situation ASAP. If his support really helps and you value the friendship, thank him for listening. [2] X Research source “That means a lot to me. Things have been rough.” “I really needed that. Mind if I vent a little more?” “You’re such a good friend. I’m glad you’re in my life.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Say you want to stay platonic if your friend has a crush.",
      "content": "Say you want to stay platonic if your friend has a crush. Look out for any sudden changes in his behavior—maybe he’s making more flirty comments or inviting you out to places that seem like dates. That’s a big sign he’s developed an attraction. Remind him you prefer to keep it friendly. [3] X Research source “Interesting word choice! Where’d that come from?” “Um… why don’t we just stick to “buddy” instead of “sweetheart”? “Oh, hey. I really like the friendship we've built. I don't want to change it.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Share that you’re interested in him if he’s flirting.",
      "content": "Share that you’re interested in him if he’s flirting. Explain that the feeling’s mutual and set a fun tone. Maybe he’s seen you around often or he’s a really bold stranger that approached you the moment he saw you. If you both strike up a conversation, he might casually test out an affectionate phrase. Use that as your opportunity to say you’d like to pursue him. [4] X Research source “You’re not so bad yourself.” “I’ve been waiting for you to come up to me!” “Slick. Want to take me out?” “Just for that, I’m buying you coffee.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Act shocked to create some fun tension and chemistry.",
      "content": "Act shocked to create some fun tension and chemistry. Tell him how unexpected that phrase was and that you hardly know what to say. He'll enjoy getting a reaction out of you and adding some surprise to your day. \"Oh my goodness! What do I say to that?! How about...thank you!\" \"Wow! I wasn't expecting to hear that today.\" \"Aw! I'm speechless.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Reply by addressing him with his own pet name to be bold.",
      "content": "Reply by addressing him with his own pet name to be bold. Get a little playful and dish out a similar phrase. Since he took the big step to show his attraction with his brave word choice, he'll love the fun teasing and feel more encouraged. [5] X Research source “Are you flattering me, darling?” “Oh, honey! You're making me melt.” “Feeling brave, aren't you, babe?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep it polite with a stranger or customer.",
      "content": "Keep it polite with a stranger or customer. A quick and professional response is enough—then, just move on. When you’re around people you don’t know, you can get all kinds of comments. If you feel relaxed because whoever you’re interacting with seems laidback and nonthreatening, give a really brief reply. Smile and be straightforward. They’ll understand you’re just doing your job or simply trying to mind your own business. “That’s very kind of you.” ”You’re welcome!” “Anything else I can get for you?” “No problem! Happy to help.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Try a formal reply if there’s a cultural difference.",
      "content": "Try a formal reply if there’s a cultural difference. Be a role model and demonstrate the social skills you’re comfortable with. Maybe the guy is from a place where it’s totally normal to use terms of endearment casually. He could also be part of a generation where it’s acceptable to make “cute” remarks in everyday settings like work. If he seems to mean well but you’d like more respect, steer the conversation in another direction. [6] X Research source “I appreciate that. I’ve been working on this report for months.” “It’s always great when your contributions are valued.” “Thank you. I take my work very seriously.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Politely stand up for yourself if he's being condescending.",
      "content": "Politely stand up for yourself if he's being condescending. Make your boundaries clear so he’ll change his behavior. If his tone of voice sounds condescending, and he smirks or laughs at you, act in the exact opposite way. Speak calmly and stick to a neutral facial expression. Either tell him how he should refer to you, or just directly tell him not to use such an inappropriate phrase. [7] X Research source “Oh, just to let you know, my name is…” “Please don’t call me that.” “We don’t have the kind of dynamic where you can say that.”"

    {
      "title": "He wants to show his affection for you.",
      "content": "He wants to show his affection for you. Many guys use the term sweetheart to let you know they care. They can use this term for both a romantic partner or a good friend. If you’re not romantically involved yet, you can better figure out where he’s coming from by paying attention to any flirtatious body language. If a guy cares about you romantically, he may also use sweetheart to let you know how special you are to him. He’s using sweetheart as a pet name for his female friends; this is especially true if he has a lot of female friends."
    },
    {
      "title": "He’s testing the waters to see how you’ll respond.",
      "content": "He’s testing the waters to see how you’ll respond. It doesn’t necessarily mean he’s provoking you; he may just want to get on your good side so you’ll do a favor for him. He might also be insecure and feels the need to use sweetheart so he can build up his confidence when talking to you."
    },
    {
      "title": "He’s feeling down and needs someone to cheer him up.",
      "content": "He’s feeling down and needs someone to cheer him up. He views you in a positive light and knows that you bring him happiness, whether as a friend or romantic companion. He wants to let his guard down and allow himself to feel vulnerable with you."
    },
    {
      "title": "He has feelings for you and doesn’t know how to show them.",
      "content": "He has feelings for you and doesn’t know how to show them. He may be shy and not know how to express his emotions. Different guys have different ways of telling you how they feel, so he might begin by using sweetheart to say he adores you."
    },
    {
      "title": "He’s an old-fashioned guy who loves classic terms of endearment.",
      "content": "He’s an old-fashioned guy who loves classic terms of endearment. There was a time when calling a woman sweetheart was considered a term of affection. Other more modern terms of endearment are “babe” and “love.” If his main goal is treating you with respect, then calling you sweetheart is just one way he can think of to show it. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider your relationship with the guy.",
      "content": "Consider your relationship with the guy. Is he a friend, a colleague, a family member, or someone you’re seeing romantically? When a guy calls you sweetheart, your response may depend on the context of who he is to you. Decide on whether the relationship is one where you’re comfortable being called sweetheart. [9] X Research source It may be a term of endearment coming from a father or paternal figure, but it can feel inappropriate or condescending coming from a peer, friend, or stranger."
    },
    {
      "title": "Think about his social status in proportion to yours.",
      "content": "Think about his social status in proportion to yours. If he’s much older than you, he may be more comfortable with using the term sweetheart when addressing a woman. Take his age and societal position into consideration when responding to being called sweetheart. Think about whether he means it as a term of endearment or in a patronizing way."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pay attention to his body language when he says it.",
      "content": "Pay attention to his body language when he says it. Is he loose and comfortable, or aggressive and forceful? If his body language seems flirty, he may be interested in you and trying to use sweetheart as a term of endearment; if he’s stand-offish, he could be attempting to condescend to you. Figure out his intentions before you respond in a way you might regret."
    },
    {
      "title": "Listen to his tone of voice when he says sweetheart.",
      "content": "Listen to his tone of voice when he says sweetheart. He may sound honest and sincere or caring and expressive. This means he’s calling you sweetheart in a genuine way because he feels positively about you. If his tone is aggressive, dismissive, or patronizing, he’s more likely to be using sweetheart negatively. Understand which angle he’s coming from so you can reply correctly. [10] X Research source"
