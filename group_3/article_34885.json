      "title": "Use leather for a comfortable and durable loincloth.",
      "content": "Use leather for a comfortable and durable loincloth. Leather is a common material used in most loincloths. Try using leather for a more durable and traditional loincloth. However, leather can be quite warm and is not a very breathable material. Certain leathers can be bought in bulk at various fabric or textile supply stores. Try using deerskin leather for a comfortable and durable loincloth. You can purchase pre-cut leather loincloths at online retailers, like etsy. You will ultimately want a piece of leather that is at least 6 feet long and one foot wide in order to get the best wrap possible."
