Bleach can remove both stains and odors caused by mold. However, check any garment label to determine if the item can be bleached, as chlorine bleach discolors items that are not white. Bleach can permanently discolor or damage clothing or fabrics. Natural fabrics such as silk, wool, or animal fibers are very likely to suffer bleaching effects. Check clothing tags for any \"do not use chlorine bleach\" warnings. Do not over wash clothes with chlorine bleach, as it can weaken fabrics such as linen, cotton, and rayon over time. The occasional bleaching will not do a lot of harm."
