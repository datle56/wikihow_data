      "content": "Get rhythm . Rapping is about more than saying something that rhymes. If you want to rap, you'll have to get a feel for the music in your bones. If your brain and body are not conscious and in tune with the beat, your rap will feel stiff and unnatural. [1] X Research source When you listen to some rap that you like, try to ignore the words. Just listen to the instrumental, and how the flow of the words seems to fit into the beat. Consider beatboxing as a tool to learning rhythm—not only will this help you understand rhythm, but it will be a useful technique once you start rapping yourself."

      "content": "Rap along. Memorize the words to your favorite rap song and rap along in your earphones, in your stereo, in your car, etc. Do it loud, and do it with confidence!

If not, find one that's similar. You can download from many websites online. Practice the verses you've memorized over the instrumental beat. Again, do your best to stay on-beat. This will help you learn how to keep a rhythm and tempo. [2] X Research source Once you're able to perform the rap song that you've memorized fairly consistently over the instrumental beat, try to adapt it to another beat. Pick one with a different sound and possibly a different tempo. Again, you can find rap beats online in many places. The point here is that you are working on becoming adaptive to the music that you are rapping on."

If you can do this correctly for many songs, it's safe to say you've mastered rhythm and staying on-beat. Practice by just reading the lyrics. Then, read the lyrics like you're trying to get a raise from your boss. Try to get it on the beat. Imagine when you are rapping that you are doing it in front of someone you know well and respect. Don't try to make your voice sound like someone you're not. Relax."

      "title": "Write some lyrics.",
      "content": "Write some lyrics. Once you feel comfortable rapping on different beats, start to make up rhymes of your own. No need to worry about what you are rapping about, just pick out things that you see around you. You could even rap about getting dressed in the morning, walking the dog, cooking your dinner, commuting to work, or even about a conversation you had with someone. [3] X Research source Write at least ten rhymes a day. Even if you don't like what you've written, later on you could come back and re-word those rhymes into something you do like. When you finally like what you're hearing, test them in front of your friends and hear what they think. Get a rhyming dictionary to help improve your rhymes, and try to develop your vocabulary by reading as much as you can. Depending on who you're influenced by, the content of rap songs can differ greatly. Every Lil Wayne song is basically one-liners about the greatness that is Weezy F Baby, while a rapper like Raekwon will tell complicated stories with peppered with flights of sonic wordplay. Try different things and see what feels natural."

GZA said that \"Wu-Tang\" stood for \"Witty Unpredictable Talent and Natural Game,\" which is as good a description of any as what it is we're looking for in good rap music. To make it second-nature, you've got to rap all the time. Listen to rap music as much as you can, analyze it, and draw inspiration from everything. Successful rapping takes hours and hours of practice , so you should do whatever you can whenever you can. [4] X Research source Make a rap journal. Keep track of your raps, and practice them out of the journal. Carry it everywhere so that when inspiration strikes, you have a place to write your thoughts down. A regret can last a lifetime, don't simply not write down an excellent idea because you think you'll remember it, because the chances are, that you'll probably forget. Jay-Z doesn't write his rhymes down and as a result of this, has said he's forgotten entire albums' worth of rhymes."

      "content": "Learn how to rap effectively. Beyond good lyrics and attention to rhythm, there are a few techniques you can use to be better understood and get your message across. Stress the consonants. If you try to rap the way you talk, it won't be comprehensible. Keep your words clear. Pay attention to keeping your words sharp. Rhythm is more important than rhyme. Don't stumble or stop if your freestyle doesn't rhyme—just stay on-beat and everything will be fine. Be loud! While being too loud is never a good thing, it's important to both literally and metaphorically be heard. Think ahead of what you're rapping so you don't get stuck stuttering or searching for the words. Nothing's worse than having to stop in the middle of a rap flow. Be able to think about your next line while still giving 100% to the line you're currently rapping."

      "content": "Be real. The best songs are believable because the artist puts their heart and soul into them. Even though it's tempting to emulate your favorites, it'll be hard to rap about your global cocaine empire if you're a teenager from the suburbs. You don't necessarily have to tell \"the truth\" 100% of the time, but you do have to be real and be believable. Figure out what's unique about you, and what you bring to the table of rap. You don't need to have an ingenious or cookie-cutter answer to this question, but don't try to be just like another rapper, even if they're one of the best. In order to do well, you will need to introduce something fresh to the industry."
