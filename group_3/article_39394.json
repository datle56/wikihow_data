      "content": "A short-term relationship has no long-term commitments. Short-term relationships are exactly how they sound: short. This specific type of dating is for those who aren’t looking for a life-long partner but a causal sexual or romantic relationship instead. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Both parties usually aren’t interested in marriage, having kids, or spending the rest of their lives together. They focus on the present moment rather than the future. Friends with benefits (FWB), one-night stands (ONS), and vacation flings are all examples of short-term or casual dating. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Short-term relationships can last weeks, months, or even a year—it all depends on the couple and their individual needs. Now, it’s important to note that short-term and long-term relationships can end at any given moment. Not all relationships last, and that’s okay! Some relationships might end, regardless of if they’re short- or long-term, because the people aren’t a good fit for one another."

      "content": "A long-term relationship focuses on a future together. The main difference between these two relationships is that long-term relationships often end in a lifelong commitment, while short-term relationships don't. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you’re ready to settle down with someone, you’re probably seeking a long-term relationship. If you want to date around and discover your likes and dislikes, you likely want a short-term relationship."

      "content": "Short-term can become long-term, but long-term can’t become short-term. Think of it this way: once you’ve committed to something, it’s harder to back down without calling it quits. If you enter a short-term relationship and catch strong feelings for your partner, you could potentially start building a future with each other (as long as both parties are on the same page). [4] X Research source On the other hand, if you’re in a long-term relationship, stepping away from emotional commitments is more difficult because a future has already been established or imagined."

When going into a short-term relationship, it’s best to let your potential partner know what you hope to gain from the relationship as soon as possible. Lay down the ground rules—are you both allowed to see other people? Will the relationship have a definitive end? This is an excellent way to protect yourself and your emotions. [5] X Research source For instance, if you’re using a dating app like Hinge, put that you’re only interested in short-term dating somewhere in your profile. This way, potential matches will know what to expect before they message you. In other words, don’t leave them guessing about what you want, as this could lead to misunderstandings later.

      "content": "Set a time frame. While this step isn’t crucial, it can help maintain boundaries in the relationship. For instance, maybe you met someone cute on vacation and want the fling to end when you get back on the plane. When the relationship ends is totally up to you and your partner; just make sure you both agree on when that is. It’s perfectly okay to move on from the relationship once it’s no longer serving you. Short-term relationships can last 1 week, 1 month, or 1 year—it all depends on your needs."
