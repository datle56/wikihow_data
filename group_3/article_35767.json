      "title": "Understand how this method works.",
      "content": "Understand how this method works. You can use a combination of the \"regsvr\" command and a DLL file's name to register the DLL if the DLL file supports the Register Server export command. This will create a path from the Windows registry to the DLL file, making it easier for Windows processes to find and use the DLL file. You'll most commonly need to use this method to register DLLs which came with third-party programs that are supposed to interface directly with system-level resources (e.g., Command Prompt)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Know what the \"entry point\" error means.",
      "content": "Know what the \"entry point\" error means. If the DLL is already registered, it doesn't support the Register Server export command, or its code doesn't allow it to be connected to the Windows registry, you'll receive an error which says, \"The module [DLL name] was loaded but the entry point DllRegisterServer was not found\". If you see this error message occur, the DLL cannot be registered. The \"entry point\" error isn't so much a problem as it is a confirmation, as seeing this error means that your DLL doesn't need to be registered."

      "title": "Find the DLL you want to register.",
      "content": "Find the DLL you want to register. Go to the folder location of the DLL that you want to register. Once you've found the DLL file that you want to register, you can proceed. If you installed a program for which you want to register a DLL, for example, you would go to the program's installation folder (e.g., \"C:\\Program Files\\[program name]\")."

      "content": "Note the DLL's name. In the text box at the top of the Properties window, you'll see the DLL's full name. This is the name you'll need to enter later. Since most DLLs have difficult-to-remember names, consider leaving up the Properties window when you're done here; that way, you'll be able to copy the name later."

For example, if the DLL's name is \"usbperf.dll\", your command would look like this: regsvr32 usbperf.dll To copy the DLL's name at this point, re-open the folder with the DLL in it (the Properties window should pop up), then highlight the name in the text box and press Ctrl + C . You can then paste the name into Command Prompt by pressing Ctrl + V .

Make sure to replace \"name\" with the DLL's name. Type in regsvr32 name.dll and press ↵ Enter , again remembering to replace \"name\" with the DLL's name."
