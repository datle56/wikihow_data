      "content": "Some people say that narcissists have black, dead, or soulless eyes. Maybe you've seen it trending on TikTok or Instagram: users have taken to social media to share their experiences of dealing with someone they suspect has Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). Many of them claim the person's eyes appeared \"black\" (as if their eyes were dilated), empty, or soulless and that they have an intense gaze or stare. There’s limited research on the subject, but some studies suggest people who struggle to feel empathy (such as those with NPD) may actually experience dilated pupils less frequently than those who don’t. [2] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Claims that people with NPD have dead eyes, on the other hand, may be more accurate: research has suggested that people who struggle to experience empathy or have difficulty processing their emotions (both symptoms of NPD, but not exclusively) may possess a dead-eyed or vacant look and avoid looking others in the eye. Note that you can't tell if someone is a \"narcissist\" just by looking at them, and only a licensed therapist can diagnose someone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Some people on social media embrace the dead eyes look and purposefully try to achieve it with makeup for aesthetic reasons."

People who have undergone a severe trauma—such as combat veterans or victims of abuse—and are suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder may sometimes have a vacant or dead-eyed look. A blank gaze may indicate the person has dissociated from reality due to the trauma they’ve experienced. [4] X Research source The term “1000-yard stare,” which refers to a vacant, tired facial expression, was originally coined to describe the blank gaze seen on the faces of combat veterans."

      "content": "People may have a dead-eyed look when they’re tired or bored. Simply not getting enough sleep or attending a boring lecture could give someone a dead-eyed look—also sometimes called “staring into space” or \"zoning out.\" After getting more sleep or doing something more stimulating, their gaze will likely become more lively again. Zoning out may also be more common among certain neurodivergent people, such as those with ADHD or autism.

      "content": "No, but research suggests people with NPD may have distinctive eyebrows. According to one study, people with NPD may have fuller, better-groomed eyebrows. In the study, participants were able to accurately pick out people with NPD based on images of their eyes and brows. [6] X Research source Interestingly enough, when participants were only showed pictures of the top half of the face, they were able to accurately pick out those with NPD, but when showed pictures of the bottom half of the face, they were unable to identify who had NPD. And when the participants were shown only a person's eyes (without the brows), they weren't able to accurately determine if the person had NPD or not. This indicates that eyebrows may be more helpful in identifying narcissism than \"narcissist eyes.\" Still, it's not a black-and-white science, and it doesn't mean you can diagnose NPD at a glance."

[9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This sense of entitlement can make them act superior to others (despite believing, very deep down, that they're inferior). They may choose to only spend time with people who are their \"equals\" and believe that they can only be understood by \"special\" people. Being entitled may also make them more likely to take advantage of others or to manipulate others to get what they want."

Rather than wondering whether someone you know has NPD, consider asking yourself if you feel safe and happy with them, regardless of any diagnosis. If the answer is no, it’s reason enough to keep your distance or set some boundaries."
