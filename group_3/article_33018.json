      "content": "Prepare the scorecard. Before you begin playing baseball darts, prepare the scoreboard. To do so, you'll have to list all the player's names. Write the numbers 1 through 9 on the lefthand side of the scoreboard. Across the top of the board, write the names of all the players."

      "content": "Determine batting order. Before you can start playing baseball, you'll need to determine the batting order. That refers to the order the players compete. Have each player throw a dart on the board. The player closest to the bullseye goes first. The player furthest away goes last."

      "title": "Hit the right target.",
      "content": "Hit the right target. To score in baseball, you need to hit the right section a dart board. A dart board is sectioned off, sort of like a pizza. There are numbers written along the side of the board. Each slice has a different number. To play baseball darts, you try to hit the slice of the dart board corresponding to the inning of the game. For example, if you're in the first inning all the darts you throw need to land in the slice of the dart board marked \"1.\" Darts outside the region for that inning do not count towards your score. For example, if a dart hits the 7th section of the board during the 8th inning you will not get any points for that dart."

      "title": "Count runs correctly.",
      "content": "Count runs correctly. In baseball, your points are referred to as your \"runs.\" Where your dart falls makes a difference in scoring runs. A dart board has two rings: the double ring and the triple ring. The double ring is the outermost ring on the dart board and is the circle that essentially outlines the board. The triple ring is the circle in the center of the board, about halfway between the bullseye and the double ring. In baseball, if a dart hits the triple ring you get three runs. If a dart hits the double ring, you get two runs. Anywhere else your dart hits on the slice of the dart board corresponding with the inning counts as a single run. To make this clear, let's look at an example. Say you're in the second inning. You throw your three darts. Your first dart hits the triple ring, your second hits the double ring, and the last dart falls in the \"2\" section of the dart board but does not make it into either ring. You would get 3 runs for the first dart, 2 runs for the second, and one run for the last. Your score for that round would be 6."

      "title": "Throw 3 darts per player each inning.",
      "content": "Throw 3 darts per player each inning. In each inning, the player throws three darts. As you throw the darts, aim for the number that corresponds with the inning. Also, keep in mind you get more runs if you get your darts inside of the rings of the dart board. Aim for the rings as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add",
      "content": "Add up your score at the end of each turn. At the end of each turn, add up your score. As the innings progress, add your scores together. For example, say you scored 5 runs in the first inning and a 2 runs in the second. By the end of the second inning, you have 7 runs. Keep adding runs to your total score as you go. Whoever has the most runs after 9 rounds wins."

      "title": "Consider adding a twist in the 7th inning.",
      "content": "Consider adding a twist in the 7th inning. Some people like to play with a special \"7 inning stretch rule.\" Players who do not score any runs in the 7th inning will have their total score cut in half. This can make the game more fun as it adds some tension. However, if you and your friends are new to the game this may only add frustration. It can take awhile to aim and throw darts correctly, making scores very low when beginners are playing baseball darts. The 7th inning rule is best used for more proficient players.
