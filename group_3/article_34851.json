      "content": "Choose a type of colored hair extension. There are two main types of hair extensions: synthetic and real hair. Synthetic extensions are cheaper, and readily found in beauty supply stores and \"punk\" stores, such as Hot Topic or Claire's. Real hair extensions are more expensive, and can be found in salons and beauty-supply stores. Unlike synthetic extensions, they can be straightened and curled. [1] X Research source Some synthetic hair extensions are heat safe. The packaging will usually indicate up to what temperature it is safe to curl or straighten the hair."

You never want to add an extension to the top of your head, because the comb and weft will be visible. [2] X Research source Clip your hair out of the way, if needed."

If you used an extension made from real hair, you can curl it or straighten it to match your hair texture. Cut upwards into the strand to thin out the ends and make them lay like real hair. Use a lower heat setting on your straightener or curling iron. A high-heat setting can damage an extension, even if it's made from real hair."
