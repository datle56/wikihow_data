      "content": "Sing any note naturally. Sing a note that's comfortable and within your range. The starting note before you enter your subharmonic or lower vocal range is the note that you naturally speak at. Find the note that's in the middle of your register or the note that's closest to your speaking voice or chest voice. This will be a starting point before you go into your subharmonic or lower range. If you're unsure of your vocal range, read Find Your Vocal Range . Tenor range is in between C3 to B4. Baritone range is usually between G2 and a G4. Bass range is typically between D2 and an E4. Soprano range is typically between C4 and C6 Mezzo-soprano range is typically between A3 and A5 Alto range is typically between F3 to F5"

      "title": "Sing the note a fifth up from your lowest register.",
      "content": "Sing the note a fifth up from your lowest register. Bring your voice the fifth note from what you were singing. Play a piano note in tandem with your voice so that you can correctly raise the note a fifth. This is the note you'll be in when singing in your subharmonic range. This should also be one octave below your chest voice. [4] X Research source If your chest voice is an A2 note, your subharmonic tone should be in A1."

      "content": "Push up from the back of your throat. Build up your subtone note until it feels comfortable to hold it. As the pressure builds into your torso, push out the note from the back of your throat. The goal is to sing with both sets of vocal cords to produce your subharmonic tone."

This buzz or hum that is found in your voice is what vocal fry is. Practicing the technique when you first wake up is easier if you've never done it before. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Open your mouth and grumble. Use the least amount of air as you can to vocalize the grumble. This cracking sound is what it should sound like when you are doing vocal fry. Isolate your vocal cords, and try to increase the sound of this grumble. You should feel your vocal cords vibrate in your throat."

Continue to practice until you have control over it and can adjust it whenever you want to. [6] X Research source"
