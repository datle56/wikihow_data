Such feelings may cause you to feel angry, leading to your desire to seek revenge. [1] X Research source Emotions are felt physically, so recognizing the physical signs of each emotion can help you get them under control. For example, when you are angry, your blood pressure rises and heat radiates from your shoulders through the back of your head. Your emotions can drive your decision making by creating a deeper connection to each decision. When you are feeling angry, you might make more rash decisions than if you felt happy.

      "content": "Repeat self-calming statements. Your emotions may become overwhelming and difficult to handle.

      "title": "Take actions that exceed those of your adversary.",
      "content": "Take actions that exceed those of your adversary. Instead of stooping to your adversary’s level, take the high road and do something that makes you the bigger and more accomplished person. For example, if your enemy mocked you for doing poorly on a test, instead of seeking revenge on this action, study extra hard for the next test to get the best grade. Your enemy will be unable to continue his mockery of you. By taking the high road, you make yourself feel good by accomplishing something great, and you stop the actions of your adversary.

      "content": "Write down how you might want to take revenge, and then rip up the paper. Think about all the possible ways, from mild to nasty, to take revenge on your foe. You could ignore someone entirely, block her on social networks, undermine her efforts, send her mean texts anonymously, publicly embarrass her, etc… Reflect on each revenge option, and predict how you will feel afterwards. When you have thought about what you could do, rip up the piece of paper and feel a release."

[6] X Research source When you are having an especially difficult time overcoming your desire for revenge, seek the company of others. You do not have to talk about your feelings or desires.

      "title": "Let time pass.",

      "title": "Talk to the person.",
      "content": "Talk to the person. If it is possible, open a dialogue with your aggressor to try to learn his point of view. Ask him questions like, “Is there something specific I did to offend you?” or, “What can I do to make things right between us?\" Do not be condescending or argumentative; instead, be understanding and empathetic. [8] X Research source It may be difficult to face your adversary, so you could try texting or emailing.

    {
      "title": "Understand that forgiveness is up to you.",
      "content": "Understand that forgiveness is up to you. Forgiveness and reconciliation differ greatly because reconciliation requires both parties to work together, whereas forgiveness only requires yourself. Forgiving someone doesn’t mean letting her off the hook, it simply means that you accept what happened and you are willing to move on. [11] X Research source [12] X Research source To “forgive and forget” may not be the best strategy. It is good to remember what your adversary has done to you so that you can learn from the experience and recognize it if it happens again."
