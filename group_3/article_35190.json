      "content": "Treat numbers with smaller digits first as subtraction. Most people who use Roman numerals save space by using subtraction to show certain numbers. You'll know this is happening if a smaller digit is in front of a larger digit. This only happens in a few situations: [4] X Research source IV = 1 subtracted from 5 = 5 - 1 = 4 IX = 1 subtracted from 10 = 10 - 1 = 9 XL = 10 subtracted from 50 = 50 - 10 = 40 XC = 10 subtracted from 100 = 100 - 10 = 90 CM = 100 subtracted from 1000 = 1000 - 100 = 900"

[5] X Research source Always make sure you catch any \"subtraction problems\" with a smaller digit in front of a larger, and include both the digits into the same group. For example, try to read DCCXCIX. There are two places in the number with a small digit in front of a larger one: XC and IX. Keep the \"subtraction problems\" together and break up the other digits separately: D + C + C + XC + IX. Translate into ordinary numerals using the subtraction rules when necessary: 500 + 100 + 100 + 90 + 9 Add them all together: DCCXCIX = 799."

[6] X Research source Be careful, though: many people draw a horizontal line above and below every roman numeral, just as decoration. For example, an X with a \" – \" written over it means 10,000. If you're not sure whether the bar is just decoration, think about the context. Would a general send in 10 soldiers, or 10,000? Would a recipe use 5 apples, or 5,000?"

D was sometimes written as I) Enclosing the above numbers inside additional ( and ) symbols meant multiplication by ten. For example, (CI)) = 10,000 and ((CI))) = 100,000."
