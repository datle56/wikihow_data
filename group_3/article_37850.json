Most of these programs work very similarly. To open your file manager, click the icon that resembles a file cabinet, or a folder that says \"Home\" on your desktop, dock, or Activities menu. [1] X Research source If you are not sure where to locate your file browser app, you can press the Super (Windows) key and type \"Files\" (or the name of the file manager) in the search bar. If you don't like the file manager that came with your Linux distribution, you can install a different file manager in the Terminal. To do so on Debian / Ubuntu , open the Terminal and type sudo apt install <app name> and press Enter . On Fedora , open the Terminal and type sudo dnf install <app name> and press Enter . Replace \"<app name>\" with the name of the app you want to install. [2] X Research source"
