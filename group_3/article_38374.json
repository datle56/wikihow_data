[3] X Expert Source Jennifer McVey, Cht Spiritual Director Expert Interview. 21 December 2021. It’s kind of like speaking things into existence, and people who practice it often believe it works both ways. You can draw positive or negative experiences, depending on what you tell yourself. [4] X Research source As an example, you’ll accomplish a lot more at work or school if you tell yourself, “I am capable” than if you say, “This is too hard.” When practicing the LOA, it’s important to remember that you aren’t to blame for traumatic events, harm inflicted by others, or difficult circumstances. It’s absolutely not your fault if something bad happens to you. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Use present tense.",
      "content": "Use present tense. The trickiest part of script manifesting is remembering that the future is now. When you script manifest, you act like you already have what you want. So, write like your dream is happening to you right now. [9] X Expert Source Jennifer McVey, Cht Spiritual Director Expert Interview. 21 December 2021.

Maybe you’re head-over-heels in love, or perhaps you finally have your dream job. You could be holding the keys to your brand new car, or relaxing in your cozy new house. Jot down a a few sentences describing what your perfect future looks like. [10] X Research source It’s totally up to you how much you write. You might write a couple of sentences about a car you want, or you might write several pages about how you want to spend your ideal day. There are no wrong answers. You may prefer to just write an affirmation or one word that represents what you want. Do what works best for you. This is your manifestation practice."

      "content": "Include specific details using your 5 senses. The more detailed your script, the more likely it will come true. [11] X Expert Source Jennifer McVey, Cht Spiritual Director Expert Interview. 21 December 2021. When you write about the specifics, it helps you really focus on what you want so you can go after it. In addition to a visual description, use your imagination to describe the textures, scents, sounds, and tastes you’ll experience when you achieve your goal. [12] X Research source You could write: “My car smells like new leather and has warming seats. I listen to the purr of the engine as I cruise around the city.” “Alex and I are on a date in my favorite Italian restaurant. The live band is playing a romantic song while Alex tells me about his day. We both ordered the spaghetti, and I can’t help but think of the date scene in Lady and the Tramp .”"

      "title": "Focus only on what you want–not on what you want to avoid.",
      "content": "Focus only on what you want–not on what you want to avoid. It’s really easy to slip into a list of what you don’t want. However, that comes from a place of negativity, so it can really mess up your manifestation efforts. Remember to stick to positive statements only. [13] X Research source Steer clear of things like, “I don’t want a used car,” “I only want to go to my top choices for school,” or “I don’t want a promotion if it doesn’t come with a raise.”"

      "content": "Try the 3-6-9 method to attract a specific item or person. With the 3-6-9 method, you write down what you want on a slip of paper. Usually, you’ll just write one word to represent what you want, such as “car” or your crush’s name. Write 3 scripts in the morning, 6 scripts in the afternoon, and 9 scripts in the evening. [14] X Research source If you want to take it one step forward, sleep with your scripts under your pillow."

      "content": "Imagine what success would feel like. Emotions increase your vibrations and help you add more energy to your manifestation scripts. As you increase your energy, you can improve your ability to manifest what you desire. As you write your scripts, really focus on how getting what you want will make you feel. [15] X Research source You might feel warm and fuzzy when you think about going out with your crush, or you could feel excited and adventurous when you climb behind the wheel of your new car."

      "content": "Believe your script is true. When you’re manifesting, you have to believe that you deserve what you want and that you’ll get it. Do your best to stay positive and believe that you can achieve what you want. [16] X Research source Try re-reading your script and using it as motivation to keep working toward what you want. It’s helpful to make your script believable. For instance, you might use script manifesting to attract a promotion at your job, which is believable. On the other hand it’d be less believable that you could become the leader of a country using script manifesting. Remember that actions are super important. Script manifesting isn’t like wishing for something—it’s a tool to help you pursue what you want."

      "content": "Keep your scripts totally positive. Any kind of negative language will interfere with your manifestation. Similarly, using limiting words like “maybe,” “hopefully,” or “I guess” will undermine your efforts. Always write your scripts from a place of positivity, gratitude, and abundance. [17] X Research source Instead of “I guess I want a new car,” write “I love my new car!” Rather than “Hopefully Drake will ask me out,” write “Drake asked me out, and I said ‘yes.’”"

[18] X Research source Identify the first few steps you need to take to get what you want. Then, start working on the first step. If you want a promotion, you might talk to your boss or put in your application for an open position. If you’re hoping your crush will chat with you, you might post a cute snap with a message about being single or you could go to an event you know they’re attending. If you want a new car, you might start shopping around or start saving money for a down payment."
