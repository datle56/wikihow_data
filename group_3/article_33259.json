      "title": "Choose your hero!",
      "content": "Choose your hero! A player needs someone to have something, so decide who you want to main first! This decision-making skill will be important when you reach Epic in Mobile Legends (Ranked Game). If you are new to the game, take advantage of the heroes you get first (AKA Eudora, Zillong, Layla, and Miya). Once you get the hang of someone, choose someone that can be based on your needs. If you want to use your skills more than a basic attack with magic power (Mages), you can use Gord, Esmeralda, Alice, or Aurora. If you want to have a hero that slowly develops over time with offensive/defensive capabilities (Fighter), use Balmond, Bane, Badang, Sun, or Guinevere. If you want to be the backbone of your team (Tank), use Tigreal, Atlas, Gatokaca, or Franco. If you enjoy using your basic attack with an extended range (Marksman), use Granger, Lesley, or Claude. If you like helping others (Support), use Angela, Rafaela, or Diggie. If you rely on quick kills (Assassin), use Natalia, Helcurt, or Hanzo. The possibilities can be endless with your selections!"

      "title": "Be wary of your laning.",
      "content": "Be wary of your laning. In the game, you will have the side lanes formatted for the first seven minion waves. The EXP lane will level your hero quicker, and the Gold lane will let you earn more gold for your equipment. The one carrying the special needs is the siege/cannon minion (AKA the one with an arrow). During the timeframe, the mid-lane will also be adjusted. Instead of a Cannon/Siege Minion, an Infantry and three Lancer minions will spawn instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Push your lane!",
      "content": "Push your lane! Since the game's goal is to destroy the enemy's base, you should destroy the turrets blocking your way. All turrets have a shield on the part of the game, which will make it harder but can be helpful in any given situation."

    {
      "title": "Know how to gank",
      "content": "Know how to gank . Ganking is a way to join team fights safely and suddenly for the enemies. To gank, go to a bush where a fight is occurring. You should then use a skill that can suddenly change the tides of the battle. For example, use an initiation skill (Guinevere's 2nd skill or Atlas' ultimate) as a way to suddenly surprise the enemies when ganking."
    },
    {
      "title": "Communicate!",
      "content": "Communicate! Since teamwork relies on help, tell them if you want them as a backup or to retreat when needed. These controls can be seen at the top-right corner. You can also hold to discover Smart Battlefield Messages. It tells them that they are behind/ahead on Gold or to Attack the Lord/Turtle. Also, you can use Emotes! Emotes are a fun way to express the current situation. You can give a Thumbs-Up to a :P emote! (Note: You will need to buy them via Diamonds or retrieve them in limited events)"
    },
    {
      "title": "Decide on the Lord.",
      "content": "Decide on the Lord. Within 8 minutes of the game (or later, depending on the Turtle), the Sanctuary Lord will spawn in the game. The Lord can be helpful and let you push for the team. It's better to not attack the Lord until you wipe out the enemy team or when the enemy is focused on a team fight (or defending the base) that doesnâ€™t include you. This is so the enemy team avoids ganking for the last shot. When the Lord spawns to assist a team, the Lord will attack a turret that's on the lane once it approaches. Killing the Lord may be strategic; it might be best to hold off the lord until one of your lanes only has the inhibitor turret left. The Lord is enhanced at the 18-minute mark, which makes the Lord more powerful with higher HP and attack."

    {
      "title": "Push for the win!",
      "content": "Push for the win! If you manage to wipe your enemy team out, don't go for the creeps right away! Try following your minions and attack the turrets. Remember, killing enemy heroes isn't the objective, destroying the base turret is."

    {
      "title": "Upgrade your Emblems",
      "content": "Upgrade your Emblems . Emblems are light tune-ups for a hero and can provide you with quick assistance! Try focusing on grabbing Magic Dust from certain events or emblems from achievements. You can adjust talents for the emblems that you unlock (you'll unlock new talents for that emblem at Levels 20 and 40). Click on the talent and adjust it to your hero's liking. You can also adjust it by checking pro setups and by equipping their setup."

      "content": "Do other game modes. Once you have the hang of Classic mode, try other game modes that can enhance your experience! If you want a quick game, use Brawl Mode. If you want to discover a fun chess experience, play Magic Chess (may not be available for all users.)"

    {
      "title": "Buy items in the shop.",
      "content": "Buy items in the shop. The shop is a great way to increase your collection of heroes and skins. Once you have the hang of newer heroes, try getting another one. If you want to be stylish, buy skins for your heroes! Even though it only gives a small boost to your hero, it will impress your team! (Diamonds are needed to get skins or via limited-time events that can give it for free, etc.)"
