      "title": "Watch the news media for an alert about an upcoming attack.",
      "content": "Watch the news media for an alert about an upcoming attack. If a nuclear attack on your region or city is imminent, the local and national news media will be reporting on the event. Also pay close attention to any ballistic-missile warning systems that may broadcast a warning across radio, TV, or even though text messages. Hawaii's ballistic-missile-threat system is a good example of this type of warning. [1] X Research source Even 5–7 minutes of warning before the blast will provide enough time for you to take steps that will save your life."

      "title": "Get inside of a sturdy building and make your way to the center.",
      "content": "Get inside of a sturdy building and make your way to the center. Inside of a building is the safest place to be in the case of a nuclear strike. Enter the building as soon as you hear the siren, even if you suspect that it may be a drill and want to be sure that the alert is real. Make your way to a central room and stay there. [2] X Research source If you're planning for a nuclear war weeks or months in advance, make a plan regarding how you'll get yourself to a large, secure building within 5 minutes of a bomb warning."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make your way to an underground basement or ground floor.",
      "content": "Make your way to an underground basement or ground floor. If it's possible, move as low as possible within the building. Preferably, try to find a room without any exterior windows or doors. Stand or sit in the middle of the room and wait for the bomb to hit. [3] X Research source Locating yourself away from exterior windows and walls will decrease the amount of radiation you receive."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remain inside for at least 30 minutes following the blast.",
      "content": "Remain inside for at least 30 minutes following the blast. If the building that you're in remains standing after the bomb blast hits it, don't go outside right away. A large wave of radiation will sweep outward from the bomb location. This radioactive fallout will take several minutes to arrive at your location. So, stay indoors (preferably still underground) where you'll be relatively safe from the radiation. [4] X Research source If you step out within the first few minutes after the blast, the radiation wave is likely to kill you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stay in the shelter for 24 hours to avoid the worst of the fallout.",
      "content": "Stay in the shelter for 24 hours to avoid the worst of the fallout. This may not be practical in some situations (e.g., if the building was partially destroyed and is no longer safe). While you must stay inside for 30 minutes after the blast, after that time has passed, you can quickly relocate yourself to a larger, sturdier building if there's one within 1 ⁄ 4 mile (0.40 km). Again, seek out a central room or basement away from windows. [5] X Research source Once you're in a safe, sturdy building, stay there for up to 24 hours."

    {
      "title": "Listen for official instructions regarding when and how to evacuate.",
      "content": "Listen for official instructions regarding when and how to evacuate . Use a radio set, a television, or your cell phone to check official news sources. Government officials should keep the public posted regarding ways to evacuate the radiated area. You'll also receive information regarding parts of the city that are heavily radiated and should be avoided. [6] X Research source If you don't have a radio or phone with you, try to find a public building that would have a phone or TV."

      "title": "Put together survival kits in anticipation of nuclear war.",
      "content": "Put together survival kits in anticipation of nuclear war. Find a sturdy backpack and fill it with survival items. These should include: 2 litres (0.53 US gal) of water, packaged food, a flashlight, maps, matches, and a battery-operated radio. Also pack any prescription medications that you take, a handful of cash, and a first aid kit. [7] X Research source Having these items already assembled and in a bag will save you time if you need to evacuate your home or workplace quickly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pack pet food and extra water in a survival kit if you have pets.",
      "content": "Pack pet food and extra water in a survival kit if you have pets. If you have dogs or cats, add a month's supply of their food to your survival pack. While tins of canned food will take up less space in a backpack, they'll also weigh 2-3 times as much as a bag of kibble. Also pack an extra 1 litre (0.26 US gal) of water per pet. [8] X Research source Unfortunately, if you have to leave your home during a nuclear war, small pets like fish or larger pets like horses will be impossible to bring with you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include a sleeping bag or warm blanket.",
      "content": "Include a sleeping bag or warm blanket. In the event of an evacuation following a nuclear strike or nuclear war, you may be forced to spend the night in an impromptu shelter or even in the open. Prepare for this situation by packing a warm wool or fleece blanket or a sleeping bag in your survival kit. If you'd like to have a large survival kit, also pack a 2-person tent. [9] X Research source If you live in a chilly northern climate, plan to bring more than 1 sleeping bag or blanket for each person in your family."

    {
      "title": "Bring a full change of clothing and a warm jacket.",
      "content": "Bring a full change of clothing and a warm jacket. If your home is destroyed in a nuclear war or if you're evacuated for a long period, you'll need to have extra clothing with you. Pack 2 pairs of underwear and socks, a pair of heavy-duty pants, a thick shirt, and a hat. Also bring a pair of outdoor shoes, like snow boots or hiking boots depending on your climate. [10] X Research source If you live in a cold climate, pack accordingly. For example, plan to bring 2 sweaters and a heavy parka."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create 2 more survival kits for your car and home.",
      "content": "Create 2 more survival kits for your car and home. For maximum preparedness, prepare 3 identical survival kits. Keep 1 in your home, 1 in your vehicle, and 1 at your workplace. This will allow you to be prepared for a nuclear strike or the outbreak of a nuclear war regardless of your physical location. [11] X Research source For example, if there's a nuclear strike while you're at work, you won't have to travel back to your house to get the survival kit."

      "title": "Stock up on bottled water before a nuclear war.",
      "content": "Stock up on bottled water before a nuclear war. In the case of a large-scale nuclear war, public water reservoirs (and other supplies) would become contaminated with radiation. To avoid drinking radiated water, you'll need to have a large private supply. Over a period of several months, purchase (or bottle at home) at least 300 gallons (1,100 L) of clean water per person in your household. [12] X Research source Depending on how much water you and your family members use for showering and cleaning purposes, this amount should last about 250 days."

      "title": "Purchase several months' worth of packaged food.",
      "content": "Purchase several months' worth of packaged food. Any crops and animals struck by radiation will either die or be completely irradiated, and any food derived from them will be irradiated as well. Even if you're not concerned about irradiated food, there's a good chance that the majority of existing food supplies will be destroyed in a nuclear war. To prepare, visit your local supermarket regularly and stock up on packaged and non-perishable foods. [13] X Research source These include things like: Cans of tuna, soup, and chili Canned vegetables Sealed packages of frozen meat Sealed bags of chips, pretzels, and other snacks"

      "title": "Seal windows and doors by taping plastic up over them.",
      "content": "Seal windows and doors by taping plastic up over them. If you're at home and concerned about nuclear blasts—or if there's already a nuclear war going on—cut apart several large plastic garbage bags. Use masking tape to tape the plastic bags up on the inside of your home's windows. Taping plastic on the inside of the windows will protect you should an air blast from an atomic bomb shatter the glass and send shards flying inward. [14] X Research source Taping up plastic will also provide some limited protection from fallout after a nuclear blast."

      "title": "Turn off your home's AC unit as soon as a nuclear strike occurs.",
      "content": "Turn off your home's AC unit as soon as a nuclear strike occurs. Air conditioning units and other forms of home ventilation bring air into the home from the outside. If a nuclear strike has occurred within 1–2 miles (1.6–3.2 km) of your home, the outside air will be irradiated. To keep this air from being pulled into your home, turn off all forms of air ventilation. [15] X Research source You can also tape a plastic bag over indoor air vents to prevent outside air from leaking in."

      "title": "Plan how your family will find one another and communicate.",
      "content": "Plan how your family will find one another and communicate. Chances are that all of the members of your family won't be in 1 location when a nuclear strike occurs or a nuclear war breaks out. This will be especially true if you have kids. So, plan a communication strategy and family meet-up location well in advance. This will allow everyone to reunite as soon as possible. [16] X Research source For example, you could all agree to meet at a large public building like a courthouse or library. Cell phones may be unreliable after a nuclear blast. Instead, you could give each member of your family a battery-powered walkie-talkie to use for communicating."

    {
      "title": "Stock up on essential medications in preparation for a nuclear war.",
      "content": "Stock up on essential medications in preparation for a nuclear war. If a nuclear war were to break out tomorrow, it would become difficult or impossible to refill medical prescriptions. If you or a family member need any prescription medications to live life on a day-to-day basis, stock up so you have plenty on hand. If war seems imminent, visit a doctor and ask for as large of a prescription as they'll give you. [17] X Research source Necessary prescription meds could include any for mental illness (e.g., depression or bipolar disorder ) or meds for chronic pain or diabetes."

      "title": "Store important family documents in a safe box.",
      "content": "Store important family documents in a safe box. In a secure lockbox, keep important personal and family documents including: birth certificates, copies of health insurance policies, copies of driver's licenses and passports, other ID papers, diplomas, and bank account records. Then, when you're evacuating your home, remember to bring this box with you. [18] X Research source Make sure that the lockbox you use is waterproof. If you happen to forget and leave the box in your house, a sturdy lockbox should survive the war and be accessible when you return home."
