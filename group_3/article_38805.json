      "content": "A septril is a nose piercing located just below the tip of the nose. This piercing is one of the rarest nose piercings, as it requires you to have a stretched septum piercing before you can get it. The septril piercing enters through the opening of the septum piercing, going vertically through the wall of the nose. Then, the piercing exits just below the tip of the nose. [1] X Research source Jewelry type : Septril piercings use flat-back labret studs . You have to take out your septum jewelry when you get a septril piercing and as it heals. So, stretching your septum helps prevent it from closing while the jewelry is removed. Many piercers call the septril a “piercing within a piercing” since you use the hole of the septum piercing to pierce the septril. The septril piercing is not a dermal piercing. This piercing has to be done by going through a stretched septum piercing."

This piercing goes through the wall of cartilage between your nostrils and usually uses circular barbell , captive ring , or clicker hoop jewelry . [2] X Research source Ask your piercer if they’ll pierce your septum with a larger gauge. Since you’re going to stretch out the septum for the septril piercing, this can help speed up the stretching process. Healing time : 2 to 3 months. Aftercare : Clean your piercing twice per day using saline solution and avoid touching and twisting it as it heals. We’ll provide more in-depth aftercare advice in the section below.

      "content": "Stretch your septum to a size 2 gauge (6 mm). Visit your piercing studio to make sure stretching is possible with your piercing. Then, work with your piercer to start the process. Generally, start by inserting a piercing that’s 0.5 mm larger than your initial one. Then, about every 3 months (or when the piercing feels loose), replace the piercing with one that’s 0.5 mm larger until you get to your desired gauge size. For septril piercings, that’s usually between 4g and 0g (5-8 mm). [4] X Research source Your piercing may need more than 3 months to adjust before going up a size, and stretching a septum can take 6 months to several years. Always follow your piercer’s advice, and visit the studio if you have any concerns. Do not wait less than 3 months or use larger gauges to try to speed up the process. This can ultimately overstretch the area, damage the tissue, and cause you to lose your piercing. [5] X Research source While some discomfort is normal, if you experience severe pain after stretching your piercing, go back to the previous size or visit your piercer if the pain persists. Use single-flare circular barbells, plugs , or pinchers to stretch your septum. Make sure the jewelry is made out of safe materials like implant-grade titanium, niobium, 14k+ gold, or platinum.

Septril piercings are anatomy dependent, meaning a piercer has to inspect your nose to ensure you have the right features to safely get one. Your piercer will first check that your septum is properly stretched so they can access the hole and pierce through it. Then, they’ll assess where the septril can be placed and work with you to find a spot that you like and is safe to pierce.

      "content": "Sleep, eat, and hydrate before your piercing appointment. According to body piercing specialist Karissa Sanford, “If you're treating your body really poorly right before you get a piercing, there's a chance that your healing could be compromised.” So, make sure that you get a good night’s rest before the appointment and eat a filling meal and drink plenty of water the day of. For what not to do before your appointment, Sanford advises that you avoid staying up late and drinking alcohol. This can leave you tired and dehydrated for your appointment, impairing your body’s ability to heal."

      "content": "Septril piercings usually take 4 to 6 months to heal. Septril piercings are a bit more involved than the standard nostril and septum piercings. So, they can take up to 9 months to fully heal, though they typically take between 4 and 6 months. [8] X Research source When can I put my septum piercing back in? Consult with your piercer about the best time to put your septum piercing back in. This might be after you’ve downsized the septril piercing 1 to 2 times, or once the piercing is fully healed. Expect your septum piercing to shrink a bit as your septril piercing heals. You’ll likely need to use a smaller gauge than what you were previously at."

This doesn’t include the price of the jewelry (a flat-back labret stud ), which typically costs between $30 and $60. So, the total cost is often around $70 to $160. [9] X Research source Professional body piercer David Wilkins recommends tipping your piercer between 20% and 30% for their service. So, your complete total cost might be closer to $85 to $190.

      "content": "Septril piercings are moderately to severely painful, but quick. Most people who’ve gotten a septril piercing agree that it’s about an 8/10 on the pain scale and feels like a very sharp pinch. The piercing goes through the thick cartilage at the tip of your nose and takes a bit longer to pierce than a nostril or septum piercing, so it can definitely make your eyes water. [10] X Research source However, the process is still pretty quick, so any pain shouldn’t last long at all. Septril piercings are typically more painful than nostril and septum piercings, which are more on the mild side. They might be similar to getting a rook or conch piercing."

Piercing specialist Roger Rodríguez says most piercing studios recommend that you clean your piercing with a sterile saline wound wash. Most of these products come in a spray can that you simply direct at the piercing to keep the area free from bacteria and remove buildup and dirt. Alternatively, Rodríguez says you can clean your nose piercing with fragrance-free, antibacterial soap and water. He suggests creating a soapy lather when you bathe, putting it on your piercing, and simply letting the water rinse it off. Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap before you clean your piercing."

      "content": "Avoid touching or twisting the piercing. According to Anders, “the more you keep your hands away from your [piercing]…the better [it’s] going to heal.” A piercing is essentially an open wound, and touching it exposes it to bacteria that can affect its healing time. Twisting, rotating, or playing with the piercing is like picking at a scab, says Rodríguez, which also prevents the piercing from healing well. Avoid touching your septril piercing until the entire healing period is over. Even if your piercing looks fully healed on the outside, it might be tender and still healing on the inside."

A septum piercing is a nose piercing that goes through the wall between the nostrils and uses circular barbell or hoop jewelry.

      "content": "Can I stretch my septum again after getting a septril piercing? Yes, you can re-stretch your septum piercing after getting a septril. Just wait about 1 year to start the re-stretching process to ensure the septril is fully healed. Like before, go slowly and size up by 0.5 mm at least every 3 months. If your septril piercing feels tender or uncomfortable due to the increased septum size, revert to the septum piercing to the old jewelry size. Putting pressure on your septril can cause irritation or potentially lead to migration, so it’s important to listen to your body and go slowly."

      "content": "What are the most painful nose piercings? Septril, high nostril, nasallang, rhino, and Austin bar piercings are typically considered the most painful nose piercings . Most people put these piercings on the severe side of the pain scale. High nostril piercings sit higher along the nasal bridge than traditional nostril piercings and are generally considered more painful. Nasallang piercings (or tri-nasal piercings) involve placing a single bar through both nostrils and the septum, creating a connected piercing across the bridge of the nose. Rhino piercings (or vertical tip piercings) are similar to septril piercings, as they’re inserted vertically through the tip of the nose. The jewelry is visible between the nostrils and on the tip of the nose. Austin bar piercings are rare piercings that are inserted horizontally through the nasal caps. They do not go through the nostrils or the septum."
