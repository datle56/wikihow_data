      "content": "Say \"om suastiastu\". To say \"hello\" in Balinese you should say \"om suastiastu.\" [1] X Research source The Balinese language has a different alphabet to Western languages, so this transcribing of the phrase for hello is written as it is pronounced in Balinese. This is a kind of pidgin version of Balinese that makes it easier for people to speak certain phrases without learning the Balinese alphabet and script. [2] X Research source Pronounce the phrase as it is spelled. It might help to think of it in three parts \"Om Swasti Astu.\" Place a slight emphasis on the \"Om\" and the repeated \"ast\" sounds. \"Om SwASti AStu.\" You can listen to a recording of someone saying \"om suastiastu\" online to listen for the pronunciation. [3] X Research source The greeting translates as \"peace and greetings from God.\" The person will reply with the same phrase \"om suastiastu.\""

      "content": "Use the right gestures. In Balinese culture you traditionally accompany words of greeting with a gesture. To be as polite and respectful as possible to the person you are greeting, you should hold your hands in front of your chest, in a praying position with the palms together and fingers pointed up. This is a traditional Hindu greeting, which has in recent years become more commonly used. Many people will greet you with a light handshake. Some people may touch their chest afterwards, as part of a greeting ritual."

      "title": "Close a conversation politely.",
      "content": "Close a conversation politely. After greeting the person respectfully, you will want to end the conversation in the same way. People will appreciate you saying goodbye in a more polite way than just saying \"bye\", or \"dah\" in Indonesian slang. The most polite way to say goodbye is to say “Titiang lungsur mapamit dumun,\" which translates to \"I’m taking leave now.\" This is generally used for people who are highly respected or of a high caste. Alternative farewells include “Pamit dumun,” “Pamit,” “Ngiring dumun,” and “Ngiring.” A more informal goodbye to someone you know well could be “Kalihin malu.” Flashcards help in learning a new language. You can use them to memorize the new vocabulary. First, write and learn the general and most essential words. You don't have to memorize every single word you don't know. Try to tackle 20-50 words per lesson, day, or week."
