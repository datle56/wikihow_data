If you are concerned about STDs, the best thing to do is to get tested. Most states have laws that allow anyone over the age of 13 to get tested for STDs without parental consent. To find out more about getting tested for STDs, you can either talk with your family doctor or visit a health clinic, such as Planned Parenthood. [1] X Research source Some common types of STD tests include: Urine test. Your doctor may request a urine sample to determine whether you have chlamydia and gonorrhea, the two most common STDs. You will urinate in a cup and then the doctor will send the cup to the lab for tests. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source .

Pap smear. For individuals with vaginas who do not show symptoms, this is the only way to detect human papillomavirus. If your pap smear shows unusual changes, a DNA test can reveal HPV. This test is only available for those with vaginas. [4] X Research source There is currently no reliable way to test HPV in those without vaginas or in other orifices. Swab test. A swab of an infected area can determine if you have trichomoniasis. Your healthcare provider will take a swab of cotton and rub it on the infected area, and send it to the lab for tests. Since only 30% of people with trichomoniasis develop symptoms, getting tested is often the only way of knowing if you have it.

Only you know your body, but if you think you are experiencing unusual discharge or urination, that could be a sign of: Gonorrhea in females and males with increased discharge from genitals (usually white, yellow, or greenish) or burning sensation during urination. Those with vaginas may also experience menstrual irregularities and swelling of the vulva. Four out of five women and one out of 10 men who have gonorrhea do not have symptoms. [6] X Research source Trichomoniasis may be present in both females and males with burning urination or in females with unusual vaginal odor and discharge (clear, white, or yellowish). However, about 70% of infected people do not have any signs or symptoms.

Painful blisters or sores in genital areas or the mouth may indicate that either and male or female has contracted herpes . These blisters can appear as early as two days after contraction and last one to two weeks.
