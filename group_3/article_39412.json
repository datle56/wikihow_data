If he’s been doing anything inappropriate, he should also apologize right away and make an effort to set things right. If he doesn’t, it may be time to have a serious talk about where your marriage is going. Some major red flags to watch out for include: [8] X Research source Minimizing your feelings—for example, “Lighten up, I was just joking around with her!” Acting defensive —e.g., saying things like, “What, so you need to know about everything I’m saying to my friends now?” Shifting the blame to you—for instance, by saying, “Well, maybe I wouldn’t be talking to other women if you’d go to bed with me more often.” Gaslighting you, e.g., by denying what happened—even if you saw the evidence yourself."

If you suspect your husband is cheating on you over text, you might be tempted to check his phone or even install a spy app so you can watch everything he’s doing.

For instance, you might end up learning some details about her relationship with your husband that you didn’t really want to know, or you might get into a stressful argument that doesn’t actually resolve anything.

Some people find that they’re able to get closure from reaching out to their spouse’s affair partner. If you really think that talking to the woman your husband is texting would help put things in perspective for you—or that letting out your feelings to her would help you feel better—then contacting her may be the right thing to do. If you do reach out, do so at a time when you’re calm and have had time to think things through. Don’t call or message her in the heat of the moment."

For instance, do you want to ask her to stop contacting your husband? Are you trying to get information from her about their relationship? Or do you just want to vent to her about how you feel? You might find it therapeutic just to write out your thoughts and feelings. In fact, once you’ve done that, you may no longer feel the need to actually confront her. You could always write her a message, then destroy it without sending it to her."
