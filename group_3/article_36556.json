      "title": "Loosen the set screws on the bottoms of the towel bar posts.",
      "content": "Loosen the set screws on the bottoms of the towel bar posts. Look for the screw hole on the underside of the post near where it connects to the wall. Use an allen wrench for a hew screw or a Philips-head screwdriver if the towel bar uses standard screws. Turn the screws counter-clockwise until they’re loose and the towel bar easily wiggles on the brackets. [1] X Research source If you don’t see screw holes or screws on the posts, try lightly pulling the bases of the posts away from the wall. They may slide up on the post and expose hidden screws. If not, then the towel bar is held on with adhesives . If there is small slot in the bottoms of the posts but can’t see a screw inside, then the towel bar has tabs that you need to press down to remove it."

      "content": "Lift the towel bar and posts off of the wall brackets. Once you loosen the set screws, the towel bar will easily come off of the wall. Hold onto the posts to support the bar’s weight and gently lift it up and away from your wall. [2] X Research source If the towel bar still sticks to the wall, then loosen the screws more since they’re still catching on the wall brackets."

      "title": "Unscrew the brackets hanging on the wall.",
      "content": "Unscrew the brackets hanging on the wall. You’ll either have small metal brackets or larger cylindrical brackets still attached to your wall. Use a screwdriver to turn the screws counter-clockwise to loosen and remove them completely from the wall. [3] X Research source Some brackets are screwed directly into your wall while others may screw into a wall anchor in your drywall. You can pull out the wall anchor carefully with a pair of needlenose pliers."

      "title": "Push a flat-head screwdriver into the release slot on one of the posts.",
      "content": "Push a flat-head screwdriver into the release slot on one of the posts. Look for a small slot on the bottom of the post near where it connects to the wall. Gently poke the end of the flat-head screwdriver into the slot as far as you can and hold it in place to keep the tab released. [4] X Research source Some towel bars without set screws have a specific way to adjust and remove by twisting the side mounts horizontally away from the bar."

      "title": "Lift the post and bar off of the bracket.",
      "content": "Lift the post and bar off of the bracket. Keep your screwdriver pressed in the slot so the tab doesn’t relatch to the bracket. Slowly lift the bottom of the post up and away from the wall until it comes off of the bracket. The bar should easily pull out from the end of the post still attached to the wall. [5] X Research source If the bar doesn’t come off easily, ask a helper to release the tab on the second post so you can remove both posts and the bar at the same time. Make sure the bar is pushed all the way to the opposite end from the side you are trying to remove."

      "title": "Remove the second post.",
      "content": "Remove the second post. Once you get the first post and bar off, take the second one off the same way. Push your screwdriver into the slot until you feel it press down on the release tab, and then carefully pull it away from your wall. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Take the wall brackets out with a screwdriver. Your towel bar clipped into brackets attached to the wall, so turn the screws counter-clockwise with your screwdriver to loosen them. [7] X Research source If you plan on installing a new towel bar, then you may be able to reuse the brackets."

      "title": "Put painter’s tape on the wall surrounding the posts.",
      "content": "Put painter’s tape on the wall surrounding the posts. Since it takes a little more work to fully remove adhesive towel bars, there’s a slight chance you could ding or dent the surrounding wall. Cut off strips of painter’s tape and place them around the base of each post. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Try prying the posts off with a putty knife and hammer. Put on a pair of safety glasses to protect yourself from any pieces that could break off. Position the blade of the putty knife flat between the towel bar’s post and the wall. Gently tap the end of the knife with a hammer to cut through the adhesive. [9] X Research source Adhesive used to secure towel bars is heavy-duty, so there’s a chance that it could damage the wall underneath when you remove it. You’ll reduce the risk of damage as long as you work slowly and carefully."

Put on a pair of safety glasses and a dust mask , and place the blade flush against the wall near the base of the wall post. Turn the tool on and slowly guide it between the wall and towel bar post to cut through it. Once you remove the first post, then take out the second post the same way. [10] X Research source"
