      "title": "Release the pneumatic closer from the mounts to remove the lock pins.",
      "content": "Release the pneumatic closer from the mounts to remove the lock pins. The pneumatic closer is the cylindrical tube on the inside of your door that pulls it closed. The lock pins are small metal pieces that hold the closer in place so it doesn’t move around. Push up from the bottom of the lock pin so you can pull it out from the top. Remove the pin from each of the mounts to pull the closer off of the door and frame. [1] X Research source You may need to use a screwdriver or a wrench if the lock pins screw into place or have nuts secured to them."

      "content": "Take out the screws holding the closer mount on the door frame. Locate the screws holding the mount on your door frame. Use either a flathead or Phillips-head screwdriver depending on which type of screw it has, and turn the screws counterclockwise to loosen them. Once you loosen the screws, pull the mount off of the frame and throw it away since it won’t work with your new door. [2] X Research source You don’t need to remove the closer mount that’s attached to the old storm door since you’re replacing it anyway."

      "title": "Unscrew the hinges from the storm door’s frame.",
      "content": "Unscrew the hinges from the storm door’s frame. Open the storm door completely so you can access the hinges screwed into the frame. Use an electric or manual screwdriver to take out each of the screws holding the door in place. Start from the bottom screw and work toward the top so the door is less likely to fall off while you’re working on it. Support the bottom of the door with your foot while you remove the top screw so it doesn’t drop down. [3] X Research source You can either save the screws from your old storm door for future projects, or you can throw them away. Your new door will come with the screws and hardware you need to install it."

      "title": "Remove the other frame pieces from the top and side of the door opening.",
      "content": "Remove the other frame pieces from the top and side of the door opening. Your old storm door will have metal frame pieces attached to the sides of the opening. Locate the screws along the side and front of the pieces and turn them counterclockwise to remove them. Take off the frame from the top and side opposite of the hinges so you can easily fit your new door in the space. [4] X Research source The screws may be hidden underneath a plastic or metal cover, so be sure to double check the pieces if you cannot remove them easily."

      "content": "Measure the opening so you know what size storm door you need. Start your tape measure against the threshold and extend it to the top corner of the opening. Check the height measurement from both sides of the door to make sure it's the same. Then extend the tape measure from the left to the right side of the doorway to find the width. When you get your storm door, make sure the door’s dimensions are the same or else it won’t create a tight seal. [5] X Research source If your height measurement is different on both sides of the door, then you may need to install shims on the top or bottom until they’re level. You can buy new storm doors from your local home improvement or hardware store. Choose a style that matches the rest of your home."

Set the hinge plate on a flat work surface and start a tape measure on one end of it. Extend the tape measure so it’s the same length as the height measurement you took and mark it on the hinge plate. Use a hacksaw to cut through your mark so the hinge plate fits into the door frame perfectly. [6] X Research source You can cut the hinge plate from either end. You will usually need to cut the hinge plate unless it already fits into your door frame."

Set the door on its side and line up the hinge plate with the side so it extends about 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.32 cm) past the top. Make sure the weatherstripping on the hinge plate faces the inside of the door so it makes a tight seal. Use an electric screwdriver and the provided screws to attach the hinges along the side of the door. [7] X Research source Sometimes, the storm door will have a screw already in it or have predrilled holes so you can line up the hinge plate easier."

Line up the top corner of the door with the corner of the door frame so it's flush against the top. Use your electric screwdriver to put screws into the frame along the guide holes on the hinge plate. Work from the top screw toward the bottom so you don’t have to support the weight of the door the whole time. [8] X Research source Ask a helper to hold the door in place for you so you don’t have to support the door and screw it in at the same time. Make sure the door doesn’t move around while you’re screwing it in since it may hang crooked otherwise."

Find the shorter top piece and hold it against the top of your storm door so it’s against the door frame and the angled side is on top. Screw the top piece in place using the guide holes and the screws provided with the storm door. [9] X Research source The top piece guides water away from the door so it doesn’t drip inside or cause any internal damage. If there’s more than a 1 in (2.5 cm) gap between the top of your door frame and the top of your storm door, then you need to screw a header board into the top of the frame to close the gap."

Line up the top edge of the side plate with the corner of the door frame and use the provided screws to attach it in place. Test closing the door to see if there is a 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) gap between it and the side piece. If not, then readjust the frame piece or add shims to close the gap. [10] X Research source You may also need to trim the side plate so it fits in your door frame. Make sure the weatherstripping on the side piece faces the inside of your door or else it will still let it in a draft."

Open your storm door and slide the sweep onto the bottom, using the screws and guide holes provided to secure it in place. Close your door to make sure the sweep extends completely down to the threshold so it forms a tight seal.
