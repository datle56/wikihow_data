      "title": "Spray PAM cooking spray on the gum.",
      "content": "Spray PAM cooking spray on the gum. It's similar to WD-40 in that it lubricates areas and erodes sticky substances, but it's a natural alternative. If you don't have PAM or a spray version of a cooking oil, you can use a bottled version of canola oil. Wipe some canola oil on a cloth and rub it on the gum. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Soak the gum in the oil.",
      "content": "Soak the gum in the oil. Apply or spray a generous amount of oil. Then, let it sit so that the gum can absorb it. Letting it soak softens the gum and makes it easier to remove."

      "content": "Wipe the sticky gum area clean with an old sock or rag. If you're not able to remove it by wiping it away, then apply a little elbow grease and scrape it off with a nylon scraper. You can even use your fingernail if you don't mind."

      "title": "Re-apply the cooking oil spray.",
      "content": "Re-apply the cooking oil spray. This is just to make sure you removed everything. Let it soak again. Scrape off any gum residue and wipe clean with a cloth. You're done. The beauty of this method is you don't have to worry about plastic or glass parts scraping off the finish inside your dryer. And, there is no smell."

      "content": "Rub an ice cube over the chewing gum. Put an ice cube in a ziplock bag and rub it over the gum. Or, if you prefer, hold it in your hands. Continue to rub the gum over the ice until it hardens. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Scrape off the chewing gum with a spatula or plastic knife.",
      "content": "Scrape off the chewing gum with a spatula or plastic knife. Apply only the necessary pressure because if you scrape too hard, you could damage the surface of the dryer. This is also the reason why a plastic knife is preferred over a metal knife; the metal knife will scrape the finish off."

      "title": "Wipe the inside of the dryer with vinegar.",
      "content": "Wipe the inside of the dryer with vinegar. Moisten a rag with some water, and then add some white vinegar. Rub it over the remnants of the gum to remove any traces of it. But if you find that there is still gum that needs removing, then repeat steps one and two. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a hair dry to heat up the gum until it gets soft.",
      "content": "Use a hair dry to heat up the gum until it gets soft. Hold the hair dryer about 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) above the gum. Blow warm or hot air onto the gum for 15 seconds at a time. Check the gum between blasts to see if it feels warm and soft. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Scrape the gum off of the dryer drum with a plastic knife or spatula. Push the end of your plastic fork or spatula under the edge of the gum. Wiggle it to lift the gum off of the dryer drum. Continue to work until you've removed all of the gum. [5] X Research source If it's not coming up, apply more heat with your hair dryer to make the gum soft. You may need to heat the gum several times during the removal process."

      "content": "Mix a tablespoon of powdered laundry detergent in a bowl. Use very little water to make the paste. Start with a teaspoon. Then, mix it together with the detergent. Continue to apply water in 1/4 teaspoon increments until it forms a thick paste. The exact amount of water to apply will vary depending on the type of the detergent. This is a good method to use if the ice cube method does not completely remove the gum residue. However, you'll need to let the gum warm back up to room temperature before trying this method though. If you don't have detergent, you can use baking soda instead. Start by applying just the baking soda, then try to scrub off the gum. If that doesn't work, add water to the baking soda to create a paste. Apply the paste to the gum, then scrub until the gum comes off. [7] X Research source"

But if they don't, you'll have to hold the dryer sheet on the affected areas. [8] X Research source If you use liquid fabric softener, dampen a rag with the fabric softener. Then, apply the fabric softener to the gum to moisten it. Once it's moist, use a plastic knife or spatula to scrape off the gum. Wipe the area clean with fabric softener, then wipe it down with white vinegar. Finally, run a load of wet towels to clean the dryer drum. [9] X Research source"

Holding them on the area gives them time to loosen the gum.

Let the chemicals soak in so that it can loosen and eat away at the gum. This should be the last resort if the other methods don't work, since it involves introducing chemicals that could potentially rub off on your clothes."
