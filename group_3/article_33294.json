Only some fat PS3s are backwards compatible, but not all of them are. The \"slim\" and \"super slim\" models are not backwards compatible. The ones with 4 USB ports on the front are. [1] X Research source If you don't have a backwards compatible PS3, the only way to play PS2 games on it without jailbreaking is by purchasing and downloading the games available on the PlayStation Store. You can jailbreak a PS3 to play PS2 games. Doing so will void your warranty and can get you banned from the PlayStation Network."
