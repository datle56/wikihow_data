If you have diabetes, a history of skin cancer, lupus, or another condition that makes your eyes and skin sensitive to light damage, avoid light therapy. Similarly, if you’re on a medication or antibiotic like lithium, melatonin, or isotretinoin that is photosensitizing (making you sensitive to light), you may not be a good candidate for light therapy.

      "content": "Find the right device for your needs and budget. The most common LED light therapy tool for at-home use is a mask, though you can also use a wand, lamp, or hand-held spot-treating device. LED light therapy devices may specify that they’re intended for acne treatment, anti-aging, or hair regeneration. Look for this information on the product page or packaging before purchasing to make sure it meets your needs. Devices range in price. Consider purchasing a cheaper mask and tracking your personal results before splurging on an expensive product. [22] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Look for an FDA-cleared label on the packaging to ensure the device is safe to use. Some devices only emit red or blue light, while others can emit both. Which one you purchase depends on your treatment goals. For example, you may not need blue LED light therapy if you do not suffer from acne."

Treatment is typically applied two times a week, with three to four days between treatments. To see results, you’ll generally need to do repeat treatments for anywhere from four to twelve weeks. [23] X Trustworthy Source DermNet NZ Online clinical resource website written and run by dermatologists providing evidence-based information about dermatology and skin health Go to source Mesbah notes that many devices can touch the skin, but professional lights (1200 to 1500 LED light devices) may need to be five inches away. Mesbah says 20 minutes is usually the maximum treatment time. “You can do more than that, but you’re not really doing anything good to yourself because it’s just too much.” To see if light therapy is working for you, take pictures before and after each treatment. If you don’t see your desired results over time, consider receiving in-office LED light therapy. Professionals have stronger devices that may deliver faster, more effective results."

      "content": "Red light therapy triggers changes in your cells. When you use a mask or wand for LED light therapy, the LEDs (light emitting diodes) emit red light energy at a wavelength around 630 nm. The red light’s energy is absorbed by your cells. This absorption causes cellular-level changes that help treat various skin problems, such as visible signs of aging and conditions like psoriasis.

      "title": "You can do red and blue light therapy at the same time.",
      "content": "You can do red and blue light therapy at the same time. Some at-home LED light therapy devices have settings that turn on red and blue LEDs at the same time. However, such a setting would mean only some areas of your face were receiving each kind of therapy. It’s more common in clinical studies and in practice to do red light therapy and blue light therapy in alternating cycles. [30] X Research source ”Using red and blue light therapy is considered the gold standard for treating acne,” shares Xian. “Red light therapy helps reduce inflammation (since pimples are a form of inflammation) and stimulates collagen production. Blue light therapy targets and kills p. acnes bacteria (the bacteria that cause acne) while calming the skin.” There’s limited research on the effects of doing both kinds of LED light therapy together."
