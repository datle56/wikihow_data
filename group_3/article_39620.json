      "content": "This is a man’s way of telling you he only has eyes for you. Maintaining eye contact with someone isn’t an easy thing to do. When we’re shy or nervous, we tend to look literally anywhere else than directly into the other person’s eyes. If you notice he maintains steady eye contact with you, that’s a pretty big sign that he’s interested in you. He’s focusing all of his attention on you and basically tuning out everything else out.​​ Of course, there’s a difference between intently gazing at you out of interest and just flat out staring. Paying attention to his body language , like if he’s smiling and nodding his head, can help in making this distinction. Some guys might find it even more difficult to make eye contact with you because they’re shy."

This might be his attempt to get closer to you and bridge the distance—both metaphorical and physical—between you two. While you’re talking, he might casually touch your arm or elbow, or lean on you when he’s laughing. He might even go a bit further and touch your back or try to hold your hand when you’re walking, which can be more obvious signs that he has feelings for you. If his touches make you uncomfortable, don’t be afraid to tell him to stop , even if you know he doesn’t mean to cause harm or discomfort."
