      "content": "There are definitely some benefits to sending an anonymous love letter. It’s a sweet, old-school way of expressing your feelings, and can be a touching, different way to communicate. [1] X Research source The anonymity of the letter allows for the focus to be solely on your feelings, leaving many complicated questions such as “am I ready for a relationship?” for later down the road.

Sending the letter will not only share your feelings with your crush, but in planning and writing the letter, will also help you sort through and identify your own feelings."

      "content": "But there are also some downsides you’ll want to keep in mind.
