You could sell clothing, home and office supplies, baked goods, coffee, handmade products, etc. What do you know a lot about? For example, if you are a talented baker and enjoy putting together new and interesting recipes, a bakery is a good choice. Focus on your talents and interests."

      "content": "Find out what is in demand in your city. If you don’t already have aspirations about what kind of shop you want to own, you can take a more practical approach to figuring out what your city or town is missing. Walk or drive around your city. Bring a pen and paper with you to write down the businesses you see. Make a tally mark next to each business as you come across more than one. For example, if you see 5 bakeries, you should have the word “bakery” written with 4 tally marks next to it. Although not the most scientific, it can give you a good idea of what kind of shops are in each area. Visit your local chamber of commerce. Typically, chambers of commerce offer a wealth of information about what businesses are already existent, and lots of additional information for small business owners. They may be able to advise you on potentially good business ventures. Governmental agencies typically offer plenty of information about economic indicators, income and earnings in different parts of the country, as well as statistics about employment. This information can also point you in the direction of good business ideas. Visit trade shows and read business magazines. These provide yet another source of information about business trends in the country and maybe even specifically in your city, depending on where you live. They may also inspire ideas you hadn’t previously considered. Search online. You can search for things such as small businesses, the neighborhood you're interested in and the name of your city to find other databases and potentially even academic information about business trends in your local area."

If your product costs a lot to produce, and the going rates for the product are low, then it will be more difficult to make a profit. As a startup company, calculating your margin is a bit tricky. However, you can get a good idea of what your costs should look like by comparing the margins of the industry averages and competitor companies. For example, you can find out how much your competitor sells their product for, and compare it with your calculations of how much the product costs to create."

[3] X Research source In order to calculate the final number correctly, you have to add a 1 in front of the percentage because when you multiply a percentage, you place a decimal in front of the number (so 10% becomes .10), and when you multiply a decimal number by a whole number you get a smaller number. For the case of calculating product price, you have to add a 1 to make the number bigger, so 10% becomes 110%, which for multiplication purpose becomes 1.10."

If you're up against a giant store with bargain basement prices, you're not going to make a profit.Unfortunately for small business owners, these giant stores operate in most cities. However, if you strive to make your store a special experience, you will attract customers. The Small Business Association of America offers a free tool that allows you to map out all of the businesses in your city that offers similar services. Identify the top competitors by searching the web. For example, if you want to open a beauty salon, search “beauty salons” + the name of your city. Read reviews about each one. Look specifically for what reviewers like and dislike about different salons. Not only will this help you identify competitors, but it will also give you ideas about how to improve your own business. You can also find out about the competition by visiting the stores. Check their prices and chat with their employees. Look at how their store is arranged. You should be looking for some way that you can do better than them. For example, offering an extra service for free or for a minimal charge. Remember that even after your shop is well-established, you should keep up with what the competition is up to! This way you can do your best to keep ahead."

Information about how much money you need and how the money will be used should be present in your business plan. How you find investors depends on your specific situation. For example, maybe you have friends or family members who want to help you get on your feet, or maybe you want to apply for a small business loan.

Search the internet. For example, search for “wholesalers and suppliers” + your industry + your city\". If you have specific requirements you can also include that in your search terms.

Do people seem to do a lot of window shopping on this street, or are most people walking hurriedly?
