      "content": "Mow your lawn between 8:00 am and 10:00 am on a dry day. Mid-morning is the best time to mow because it gives the dew a chance to evaporate, and the grass won’t be limp after midday heat. Limp gras bends under the mower blades instead of being cut, leaving your with an uneven lawn. [1] X Research source Wet grass clogs your mower, causes fungal diseases, and leaves behind clumps of wet grass that kill your lawn. Plus, wet soil is softer and harder to mow. Checking the weather forecast and planning to mow before rain or after your lawn dries out reduces clumping, lawn damage, and heat stress on the grass (and you). [2] X Research source Mowing wet soil may also pull out your lawn by the roots, leaving dead or patchy areas."

      "content": "Wait until your grass is ⅓ longer than the ideal height. Mow your lawn on its schedule, not yours. Some people mow their lawn like clockwork every Saturday afternoon, but it’s better to mow based on the height of the grass. Use the “⅓ rule,” and don’t mow down more than a third of the total height of your grass each mowing. Cutting only ⅓ of the grass height reduces plant stress and water loss. [3] X Research source So, if you keep your lawn at 2 inches (5.1 cm) high, wait until the grass is 3 inches (7.6 cm) high before mowing it. Tall grass is also healthier than short grass and helps control weeds. Plus, leaving more height on your lawn reduces the number of times you have to mow! Wait before mowing new grass the first time. Don’t mow new grass until it’s .75 to 1 inch (1.9 to 2.5 cm) taller than the recommended mowing height for the grass type. [4] X Research source This can take 3-4 weeks for sod and up to 2 months for seeded lawns."

Try a reel mower if your lawn is under a ¼ acre with a turfgrass like Bermudagrass, Kentucky bluegrass, or perennial ryegrass. When choosing a lawnmower, remember that reel mowers are virtually silent and environmentally friendly because you supply all the power by pushing. [5] X Research source They also cut grass more cleanly, which gives a tidier look and a healthier lawn. Reel mowers aren’t a good choice for lawns with sticks and twigs, unraked leaves, or tall grass. Prices for manual reel mowers usually range from $80 to $200. [6] X Research source"

Mulching and non-mulching models are available. A walk-behind mower gives you a better view of the grass as you mow than a riding mower. They’re also quieter than the riding options and tend to have more power than electric models. [9] X Research source A mulching mower chops up the grass blades and scatters them for you. It’s important to keep the blades sharp on a mulching mower so it mulches the grass effectively. These models may not work as well on tall grass. [10] X Research source Regular maintenance is the key to getting the most out of your gas walk-behind mower. This includes regularly replacing engine oil, spark plugs, and air filters. Gas-powered walk-behind mowers range from $230 to $2,300, with self-propelled models generally on the more expensive end of the range. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose a riding mower for flat lawns over ¼ with any grass.",
      "content": "Choose a riding mower for flat lawns over ¼ with any grass. Riding mowers cost more than walk-behind models but save you time. However, riding mowers usually aren't safe for mowing steep hillsides. There are a few different types of riding mowers, including rear-engine riding mowers, lawn tractors, garden tractors, and zero-turn mowers. [12] X Research source Rear-Engine Riding Mowers : These mowers are a good choice for lawns from ½ an acre to 2 acres. They’re the least powerful of the riding mowers, with single-cylinder engines that range from 10 to 11 hp. They cost $1,200 to $2,400. Lawn Tractors : These mowers can handle lawns up to 4.5 acres and are a step up from rear-engine mowers. They feature single-cylinder or V-twin engines that range from 18-25 hp. They range from $1,300 to $3,000. Garden Tractors: Garden tractors are heavier and have more powerful engines (20 to 30+ hp) than lawn tractors. Owners use them (with a range of attachments) for heavy-duty tasks like tilling, plowing, and hauling, along with mowing. They range in price from $3,000 to $7,000. Be aware that these tractors don’t usually come with a mower deck, which can cost from $600 to $1,000. [13] X Research source Zero-Turn Mowers : These mowers are often used by landscaping professionals but are great for homeowners, too. While the engine is usually the same as a lawn tractor, it’s much more maneuverable and has a larger cutting deck. This makes it easier to mow a lawn faster than other options. Zero-turn mowers are good choices for lawns larger than ½ an acre with obstacles like gardens, trees, bushes, and flower beds. They cost from $1,200 to $6,000."

      "title": "Manual Reel Mower",
      "content": "Manual Reel Mower Reel mowers are the simplest type of lawnmower to operate. Simply push the mower in a straight line across the area you’re mowing. Walk at a steady, comfortably brisk pace, or the mower may bind up and skid. When you’re done mowing, carefully rinse away any grass clippings that are stuck to the blades. The taller the grass, the harder it is to push a reel mower. Try to mow your grass once a week to avoid the grass growing too long to mow comfortably at an even pace. Reel mowers tend to roll over tall weeds instead of cutting them. If you have a weedy lawn, get rid of the weeds before you mow."

Push down on the handle to lift the front wheel and pivot on the back wheels when you’re ready to turn. Let go of the safety shut-off lever to stop the mower. [15] X Research source It’s usually located near the top of the handle in easy reach. The prime button is usually a red or black squishy button on the mower's body. Don't push more than 3-5 times, or you risk flooding the engine. The safety shut-off lever is a thin bar that runs parallel to the mower’s handle. If you have a self-propelled mower, push the drive lever forward to engage the wheels. Start an electric push mower by pushing and holding the start button. Then, pull the start handle.

It causes problems if it's been sitting in there for a year or longer. So replace it with fresh gas. And don’t forget to check the oil.” It’s not safe to add fuel to a warm mower engine, so give the fuel tank a fill-up before you start mowing. Check the oil level every 2-3 mows as well, and add oil as needed before firing up the engine. [24] X Research source Occasionally change the oil and clear the fuel lines or have a pro do this routine maintenance. Consider giving your mower a tune-up once a year at the beginning of spring. Don’t forget to check the air pressure in your mower’s tires. Maximum tire pressure is embossed on the side of each tire."

[25] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source Mowing around the perimeter first helps you square off the lawn and gives you room to turn as you mow back and forth in rows.

[26] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source The amount of overlap depends on your mower’s setup. Generally speaking, though, place your wheels (on one side) just over the cut line you created with the previous row. Turning back and forth is easier with a zero-turn-radius mower. Otherwise, pivot on the rear wheel closest to the next row and readjust to get into position."

      "title": "Throw any clippings into the previously cut row.",
      "content": "Throw any clippings into the previously cut row. Wallace says that finely cut clippings help fertilize grass, so leave them scattered thinly throughout your lawn when possible. If you have a side-throwing mower, send the clippings onto the row you just cut. [27] X Research source Don’t leave clumps of cut grass sitting on your lawn, though — this is more likely to happen if you have a dull blade or if the grass is damp, Wallace warns. Either bag your clippings or use a rake to spread the clumps out. Reduce your lawn's thatch by using a bag that attaches to your lawnmower to catch the grass clippings. Add the clippings to your compost pile, use them as mulch, or dispose of them in a curbside trash or composting system."

      "content": "Move across sloped ground with a push mower. Mowing up and down a slope with a push mower may cause you to lose control. Never mow up and down a slope that’s anything more than gentle. Instead, go in straight lines that are perpendicular to the slope. [28] X Research source Take any sloped ground into account when creating your rectangular mowing areas. If you have trouble walking up or down the slope on wet grass without the mower, don't mow up or down it even when the grass is dry. Manual push-reel mowers are less dangerous than larger and heavier powered models on slopes, but injuries still happen if you slip and fall. Driving a riding mower side to side on a steep hill may cause it to tip over. Go up and down gentle slopes. Instead of mowing a steep slope, try using a string trimmer, or consider planting or placing something other than grass in that area."

[30] X Research source However, some people prefer to trim/edge first so that the clippings are chopped up and spread out by the mower. This is a viable option, but you may spend more time trimming and/or edging than necessary. These methods tend to be harsher on your grass than mowing — e.g., it’s easier to cut the grass far too short in spots."

If you have warmer weather year-round, you may mow more often than someone with cold weather for part of the year. Dull mower blades cause jagged cuts in your grass. Jaggedly cut grass develops brown tips and invites grass diseases. A sharp blade makes a cleaner cut, says Wallace. If your lawn looks ragged after a mow, it’s probably time to sharpen your mower blades . [31] X Research source Remove and sharpen the blades yourself with a few tools and some mechanical know-how, or search for \"lawn mower sharpening near me\" to find local pros. Even if your blades don’t seem dull, inspect them for damage every 3-4 mows, and rinse away any built-up grass debris on the blades and underside of the mower with a garden hose.
