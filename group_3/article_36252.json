[1] X Research source Hold the flat edge of the putty knife close to the counter top, apply gentle pressure and push the putty knife’s blade towards the glue. Don’t apply so much pressure that you scrape your counter top, but keep the blade of the putty knife close to the counter. Keep scraping at the glue to remove as much as you can before you try other strategies."

      "content": "Scrub the glue with a little hot water and soap. You can also use a little dish soap and a wet sponge to scrub off the glue. Use the rough side of a sponge or a plastic net sponge to scrub away the glue. Rinse the sponge and reapply soap as needed. Keep scrubbing the spot until the glue comes off."

      "title": "Soak the glue.",
      "content": "Soak the glue. If the glue is dry or if there is a lot of it, then you might need to soften it by soaking the spot. Moisten a wash cloth or paper towel with some hot water. Then, place the wet cloth over the glue on the counter to soften it. Leave the wet cloth on for a few hours and then try to scrub the spot again. You can also try scraping at the glue with a putty knife again. It might be easier to remove after the glue has softened up."

      "content": "Get some nail polish remover that contains acetone. Most fingernail polish removers contain acetone, which is a powerful solvent. You can use nail polish remover to get glue off of your counter tops. [2] X Research source Read the label to make sure the fingernail polish actually has acetone in it. Some nail polish removers don’t contain it. Be careful when working with acetone. Acetone is a volatile chemical that can dry out the skin and cause health effects if you ingest it. Always work with chemicals in a well-ventilated area. [3] X Research source [4] X Research source"

To ensure that the acetone will not discolor or damage your counters, it is a good idea to test a small area first, especially if your countertops are made from a special material, such as marble granite, or stone. Apply a small amount of acetone to an area of your counter that is not too visible and then wipe it away after a few minutes. [5] X Research source If the nail polish remover causes discoloration, then try soap and water instead and repeat the process several times. [6] X Research source Do not use acetone on your counters if it causes damage or discoloration."
