      "content": "Spin each dial to enter 3 numbers if you have a 3-dial lock. Depending on your lock, this might mean that you line up the combination with a marker line on the wide-flat side, or you spin each of the 3 dials so the combination is visible on the narrow side of the lock. Then, pull up on the shackle to open the lock . [1] X Research source Some locks have a red or green stripe running down 1 side. When you enter the combination, line up the digits, so the line passes through them. If your lock doesn't immediately spring up, push down on the metal shackle before you pull it up. If you're opening a 3-digit combination lock on a suitcase or briefcase, you might also have to push down on a button or latch after you enter the combination. [2] X Research source"

Stop at the first number of the combination. Turn the dial left for 1 full turn, so you pass the first number and stop at the second number. Then, turn the dial right and stop at the third number of the combination. Pull up on the shackle to open the lock."

      "content": "Check that you lined up the numbers if the lock doesn't open. Sometimes, you might enter the correct combination, but if each digit doesn't line up with the stripe or marker, the lock won't recognize the combination. Line up the numbers perfectly and try again. If you don't get a spinning lock open on the first try, slow down and try it again. Don't forget to spin the dial to the right to clear the numbers."

This applies pressure, so you'll be able to tell when you're finding the correct numbers of the code. If you don't have a hook, put your index finger through the shackle and pull up to apply pressure on the body."

Keep putting pressure on the body of the lock and spin the top dial until you feel some tension—like the number is sticky. You might hear a faint click, which means you've found the right number. It's a good idea to write down the numbers of the combination as you work. This way, you won't forget them again!"

This takes a little skill—you want just the right amount of pressure, so you can sense when you've caught one of the combination numbers. If you find that the dial doesn't spin easily at all, release some pressure. If it spins too freely, put a bit more pressure on the shackle. [3] X Research source"

Then, release a little pressure and spin the dial back and forth between that number and 0. Stop when the dial catches on a number. This is the second number in your combination. [5] X Research source If it seems like the dial stops between 2 numbers, round up and use the larger one. For instance, if the dial catches between 21 and 22, go with 22."

Repeat this until the shackle opens—when it does, it means the dial is now on the third number of your combination.
