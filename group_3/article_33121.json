Did the gameplay direction get switched around right before you could play a card? Bottom’s up! This can be hard to keep track of when 2 players keep switching back and forth to one another. After each reverse is played, specify which player needs to drink."

      "content": "Take 4 sips if you’re caught not saying “UNO.” Blech—no one likes picking up that 4-card “UNO” penalty when they’re on the brink of victory. In drunk UNO, you have to pick up 4 cards and take 4 sips of your drink as punishment. Variation: Force the player to finish off their drink as an UNO penalty (unless there’s only a couple of sips left)."

[3] X Research source If you run out of cards in the draw pile, shuffle the discard pile and flip it face-down in the center of the play area (this will be your new draw pile).

The object of the game is to get rid of the cards in your hand as quickly as possible by matching the color, number, or symbol of the last played card. [4] X Research source So if the player before you discarded a red 9, you could discard a red 3 or a green 9, for example. And if the last player put down a yellow reverse card, you could put down a blue reverse card afterward. If the previous player put down a green skip card, your turn would be skipped, but the next player could put down their own skip card of any color (or another green card). Reverse cards feature 2 parallel arrows pointing away from each other, while the “skip” symbol resembles a crossed-out circle. A “draw 2” card has 2 overlapping cards on the front, as well as “+2” printed in the corner."

The game also includes reverse, skip, and draw 2 cards, all of which can change the flow and direction of the game. Play these cards accordingly as you go through the round. Wild Card: Play this card on any turn to switch the current color of the round. You can put this card down even if you have other playable cards available. Wild Draw 4: Play this card if none of your other cards match the current card. Use it to switch the round color and force the next player to skip their turn and pick up 4 cards. Other players can “challenge” you if they believe that you do have a matching color card in your hand. If you’re found out, you must pick up 4 cards instead of the next player. If the accuser is wrong, they draw 6 cards in place of the next player. Skip Card: Use this card to jump over the next player in the circle. Reverse Card: Play this card to reverse the direction of the game. If you were playing in a clockwise circle, you’d switch to playing in a counterclockwise direction. Draw 2: Use this card to skip the next player's turn and force them to pick up 2 cards. [5] X Research source"
