      "content": "Use four balls. In Quidditch, you need four balls to play. There is one volleyball, known as the quaffle. There are two dodgeballs, known as the bludgers. There is one small ball, such as a tennis ball, that is strapped to one player. This is the snitch."

      "content": "Learn how to score points. Players attempt to get the quaffle (volleyball) through the hoops on the ends of the field. Getting a quaffle through a hoop means 10 points are scored for that team. The only other way to score points is to catch the snitch by grabbing the ball attached to the player carrying it. The team that catches the snitch gets 30 points. The quaffle can be passed between players on the same team."

      "content": "Call penalties as needed. In Quidditch, there is always one ref. If you're the ref, it's important you stay vigilant and call penalties if players are not following the rules. If you call a penalty, it's up to you to decide how long a player should be removed from the game. The following can result in a penalty: [1] X Research source Not keeping your broomstick in position (i.e., between your legs with one hand on the stick) is a foul. Failing to dismount a broomstick and tag a hoop after being hit with a bludger is a foul. If any player besides the seeker touches the snitch, this is a foul. Any kind of rough playing, such as shoving or hitting, may result in a foul."

      "content": "Find a big enough space. Quidditch requires a field that's at least 36 yards (33 m) by 66 yards (60 m). Although wizard Quidditch is played over an oval field, muggle quidditch is typically played in a rectangular field. You can play in a local park or see if a local field used for sports matches is opened to the public. Keep in mind, this is the length for a regulation Quidditch match and doesn't have to be followed strictly when just playing for fun. If you don't mind less space, you can play Quidditch in a smaller park or even someone's backyard. Goal posts are placed on a line 18 yards (16 m) from the centerline. The keeper zone starts 12 yards (11 m) from the centerline and reaches to the end of the field."

You can find these at a local hardware store, craft store or even some toy stores. You may need to use scissors or a knife to cut down pipes that aren't the right lengths. If you want to stick the posts in the ground, either make them about .25 feet (0.076 m) longer or use a piece of rebar as an anchor."

Each team can only have a maximum of four players who identify as the same gender on the field simultaneously. However, once the person carrying the snitch enters the game, that number increases to five. A person's gender is the gender they identify with, which may not necessarily be the gender they were assigned at birth. Quidditch welcomes players of all genders and gender identities."

Players with experience playing basketball or volleyball may be good chasers, as it involves pursuing, kicking, throwing, and passing a ball. Anyone who's played dodgeball or a similar game would make a good beater, as they'd be able to hit players with bludgers.

These are the easiest targets to hit as a beater."
