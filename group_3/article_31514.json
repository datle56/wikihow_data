      "content": "The meme is a gag headline poking fun at trivial, out-of-touch opinions. It’s an image of a newspaper clip featuring Abe Simpson (from the animated sitcom The Simpsons ) angrily raising his fist under the headline “Old Man Yells at Cloud.” The meme is used as a reaction image to comment on various news topics and opinions—usually when someone is resistant to change or expresses an opinion considered outdated. [1] X Research source For example, you might see someone comment with the “Old Man Yells at Cloud” meme under a social media post about how Gen Z slang is confusing or everyone is too attached to their phones these days. Sometimes the original image is used, while other times it’s altered and used as a template (“X Yells at “Y”), with people changing the headline based on what they’re reacting to."

      "content": "The meme’s image comes from a 2002 episode of The Simpsons . In the 13th episode of The Simpsons season 13, Abe Simpson visits the DMV to get his driver’s license and gets his co-in-law Patty Bouvier (who works there) to use a picture of him from a local newspaper instead of taking a photo for the license. When he gets the new license, he then yells “Who’s laughing now?” at a cloud in the sky. [2] X Research source The episode, called “The Old Man and the Key,” originally aired on March 10th, 2002."

      "content": "Internet users began circulating the meme in 2008 and 2009. September 2008 was the first time “Old Man Yells at Cloud” was used as a meme. Tech blogger Joey deVilla posted it in response to commentary on cloud computing technology, thus using the meme as both a play on words (since the commentary was literally about the “cloud”) and to make fun of someone’s idiosyncratic gripe about technology. [3] X Research source In November 2009, a photoshopped version of the meme was posted featuring Final Fantasy VII protagonist Cloud Strife with Abe Simpson under the headline “Old Man Yells at Cloud.” In December 2009, the meme was again altered to feature Abe Simpson and Lakitu’s Clouds from the Super Mario Brothers video game series."

      "content": "The meme has remained popular throughout the 2010s and 2020s. There are plenty of examples of the “Old Man Yells at Cloud” meme across the internet, with the meme taking off in the early 2010s—and remaining a commonly used meme into the 2020s. [4] X Research source For example: A Facebook page called “Old Man Yells at Cloud” was created in January 2011, posting different photoshopped varieties of the meme. In March 2011, DeviantArt user Amaya-Zorifuki created a mock motivational poster featuring the original “Old Man Yells at Cloud” image with the caption, “To be fair, the cloud started it.” In August 2012, FARK user furiousxgeorge posted a version of the meme featuring a cartoon depiction of Clinton Eastwood (from a different episode of The Simpsons ) and the headline “Old Man Yells at Chair,” reacting to the actor’s empty chair speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention. In November 2015, Manfrenjensenjen posted the meme on Reddit , edited to feature Abe Simpson and a Starbucks holiday coffee cup with the headline “Old Man Yells at Cup” (referring to the backlash about the cup’s design, which was secular rather than Christmas-themed)."

      "content": "Use the meme to joke about someone else’s refusal to accept change. Grandpa Simpson is famously crotchety and out of touch with modern culture on The Simpsons TV show. Thus, the “Old Man Yells at Cloud” meme is a funny way to call someone out when they’re complaining about change or some aspect of modern culture for no reason. [5] X Research source For example, if an older politician complains about younger voters and their beliefs in an article, you might link to the article and post a picture of the “Old Man Yells at Cloud” meme to make fun of them. On the other hand, if a friend (even your age or younger) complains about how they hate making accounts and downloading apps for everything nowadays, you could tease them by sending the meme. In other words, the meme can be genuinely mocking (if you’re making fun of someone you disagree with, like a politician or public figure) or playfully teasing (when sent between friends)."

      "content": "Make fun of your own old-fashioned takes with the meme. Do you have any opinions that you know are a little petty—or sound like the opinion of an elderly person complaining about younger people or modern trends? Plenty of people do, and if you don’t mind making silly, self-aware jokes, you can post the “Old Man Yells at Cloud” meme along with your retro hot takes. For example, you could post, “I might be having an “Old Man Yells at Cloud” moment, but honestly, DVDs are better than streaming. I’m sick of all the ads!” to social media and include the meme image in your post."
