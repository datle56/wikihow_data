After all, any serious buyer is going to see the car eventually anyway, and they will appreciate your honesty. [2] X Research source Play up the car’s strengths in your ad. If you believe it has a strong pickup, a big trunk, or anything else that buyers might want, say so. Include plenty of photographs. Clear photographs of the car will draw buyers’ attention. Include the basic details. Identify the make, model, year, mileage, color, and any special additions that the car may have. Define the terms of the sale - the asking price and whatever forms of payment you will accept. [3] X Research source"

To create the best chance of selling your car for a good price, you should make use of several different forms of advertising: [4] X Research source Spread the word among your friends and colleagues. Post fliers in public places that show positive photographs of your car. Post your advertisement online at sources like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace.

Put a sign in the car’s windows and drive it around town. You may also find some public place to park it and display the window sign. If you do, make sure that you have the permission to park where you put it."

      "content": "Set your asking price. The Blue Book will give you a starting range, but you need to refine it. If you have kept up on the regular maintenance of the car or if your car is still under warranty, you may be able to set a price at the top of the range. If you are aware of flaws, then perhaps you should stick to the bottom of the range. In either case, when you are setting your asking price, you should leave a cushion of approximately 10% to account for negotiating. As an example, if you want to collect $4,000 for the car, you should begin with an asking price of about $4,400-$4,500."

It is common for buyers to expect to test drive the car and even have it examined by a mechanic.

Keep a copy of the completed bill of sale for yourself. A bill of sale identifies the car by year, make, model and vehicle identification number (VIN), and information on both the buyer and the seller. The bill of sale has spaces for both the “Date of Purchase” and the “Date of Release.” These dates are the same. From the buyer’s point of view, the vehicle is being purchased. From the seller’s point of view, ownership is being “released.” Just repeat the same date. It is a good idea to write the exact time as well so that if he gets into an accident shortly after driving off, his victim won't try to claim on your policy. Both the buyer and the seller should keep a copy of the bill of sale. This serves to formalize the deal."

The buyer will be responsible for his registration and insurance on the vehicle. This is not up to you as part of the sale. The buyer will complete an Application for Title and Registration form (Form 735-226), which is available from the Oregon DOT at https://www.oregon.gov/odot/forms/dmv/226fill.pdf . The buyer must submit this form within 30 days after the sale. Some buyers operate as unlicensed dealers called \"curbstoners\". Don't let your buyer be a phantom buyer that stays off the book. If the \"middle man\" gets tickets or gets into incidents before flipping it to someone else who eventually registers the car, any inquiries regarding anything that the vehicle was involved in before it was formally registered will come to you. Therefore, you must obtain accurate information on the person to whom you hand the key over and maintain it for a reasonable length of time so you can provide their information if you receive inquiries or the vehicle is involved in a crime. To avoid complications, it's strongly recommended that you avoid making the sale out to the person's relative or a friend who is not present."

You will continue to hear about it and have to refute any violations in which the vehicle is involved in until the transfer is done, which will not happen if the new owner chooses not to do so. This can be especially troublesome if there is plenty of time left on the existing plates as there's no real incentive for them to do so.
