      "title": "Fill a handheld steamer with distilled water.",
      "content": "Fill a handheld steamer with distilled water. Tap and well water contain minerals, which could clog up the steamer or leave deposits on your upholstery. It’s best to use distilled water when steaming anything, but especially when working with vinyl upholstery. [1] X Research source Though you can use a steamer made for car upholstery, a regular handheld steamer will work just fine. Steamers are super useful tools. Not only can you use them on clothes (say good-bye to ironing!), but you can also use them to remove wrinkles from items that are hard to wash, like curtains."

      "title": "Steam the upholstery in small sections.",
      "content": "Steam the upholstery in small sections. Turn on the steamer and hold it so it’s just barely touching the upholstery. Use long strokes to apply the steam to the vinyl using light pressure. Work on a single panel of the upholstery at a time (or a 1 square foot (0.093 m 2 ) section) and be sure to steam every last inch for a smooth, even result. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pay special attention to the seams.",
      "content": "Pay special attention to the seams. Vinyl is often most wrinkled near the seams. Hold the steamer directly over the seam to force steam into the foam underneath the vinyl. Repeat the process for the length of each seam. This will help plump it up, making your seats look brand new! [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Allow the upholstery to dry completely.",
      "content": "Allow the upholstery to dry completely. Run a clean microfiber cloth over the vinyl to remove excess water. If you’re working on upholstery that’s already in a vehicle, leave the windows down to allow air to flow through the interior. Don’t close up the car until the upholstery is completely dry, or it may develop mildew as well as an unpleasant smell."

      "title": "Fill a bowl with towels and water.",
      "content": "Fill a bowl with towels and water. Select several clean, small towels or cloths. Roll them up and put them in a small microwave-safe bucket or large bowl. Fill the bowl with water so that the towels are completely submerged. [4] X Research source Hand towels, washcloths, or even clean rags will do."
    },
    {
      "title": "Microwave the towels for 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Microwave the towels for 5 minutes. The heat and steam will smooth out the vinyl, removing wrinkles and shrinking it to the seats. Be very careful when you remove the bucket from the microwave—it will be hot! [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Spread the towels over the upholstery.",
      "content": "Spread the towels over the upholstery. Put on a pair of clean heat-resistant gloves, carefully unroll the towels, and lay them on the wrinkled upholstery in a single layer. Be sure to completely cover all the parts you want to shrink or smooth out. Press the towels into the vinyl. [6] X Research source You can use this same process to remove wrinkles from leather upholstery as well."

    {
      "title": "Remove the towels once they’re cool.",
      "content": "Remove the towels once they’re cool. After 10-15 minutes, take the towels off of the vinyl. The wrinkles will have disappeared, leaving you with smooth upholstery! [7] X Research source Let the vinyl dry completely before closing up the car to prevent bad odors and the development of mildew."

      "title": "Obtain a heat gun.",
      "content": "Obtain a heat gun. Heat guns are useful tools with many applications, including drying, softening, and shrinking different types of materials. Pick one up from your local hardware store to easily shrink vinyl upholstery in a matter of minutes. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Heat the vinyl in small sections to remove the wrinkles.",
      "content": "Heat the vinyl in small sections to remove the wrinkles. Turn on the gun and hold it at least 6 inches (15 cm) from the vinyl to keep from melting or otherwise damaging it. Work on a single 1 square foot (0.093 m 2 ) section at a time. Move the heat gun from side to side and work from the top to the bottom of each section to evenly heat the upholstery. [9] X Research source Keep the gun moving at all times so you don't scorch the vinyl."

    {
      "title": "Smooth out the vinyl with your hands, if necessary.",
      "content": "Smooth out the vinyl with your hands, if necessary. As the vinyl heats and shrinks, you’ll be able to see the wrinkles disappear. If you encounter any stubborn spots, smooth them out with your hands, but be careful—the vinyl will be hot! [10] X Research source If you're using the heat gun on a seat, let the vinyl cool completely before sitting in it."
