      "content": "Decide on the winning point for the game. The winning point of the game is the rule that determines how a player can win. The caller will let everyone know before playing the game what the winning point is. A popular winning point for tambola games is full house, which means that the ticket with all of the numbers struck first wins. [1] X Research source Early 5 is another common winning point option. The player who first strikes 5 numbers in any row wins. This is best if you only want to play a short game. First row is another winning point alternative. This means that the player who is first to strike all of the numbers along the top row wins. Corners is another winning point option if you want to play a short game. The player who can strike each number in the 4 corners of the ticket first, wins. This means that the first and last numbers of the top and bottom rows will be crossed out. There are many variations on what the winning point can be for the game. If you are organizing the game, feel free to make up your own winning point, or explore the many ideas available either online or with other tambola players."

[2] X Research source This person will also be responsible for verifying any potential winning tickets to make sure that the numbers are correct. The caller doesn’t have to be the caller for all of the rounds. If you are playing multiple rounds of tambola, pick a different caller for each round so that everyone can have a turn to play."

If you are playing informally with family or friends, hand a ticket out to each person. If you are playing a commercial game, each player will purchase their own ticket before the game begins. [3] X Research source Tambola tickets have 3 horizontal rows and 9 vertical columns, which makes 27 boxes in total. There are 5 numbers in each horizontal row, with the remaining 4 boxes randomly blocked out. The first column has numbers from 1-9, the second from 10-19, and so on, up to the number 90. [4] X Research source You can purchase tambola tickets online, or you can make your own using a random number generator. Make sure that each person has a pen or pencil before the game begins so that they can cross off the numbers as they are called. [5] X Research source"

[9] X Research source Some nicknames for the numbers include “Lone ranger” for the number 1, “Colors of the rainbow” for the number 7, and “Valentine’s Day” for the number 14.

Often you can only win the game if you announce that you have won immediately, rather than waiting until after the next number has been called. If you miss your chance to announce that you have won, you will usually miss out on your entitlement to the prize. More than 1 person may realize that they have the winning point after a number is called. In this case, the first person to announce it goes to the caller to have their ticket verified."

However you can decide to keep playing if you want to draw for second and third prizes. If the player doesn’t have a winning point, keep calling numbers and playing the game until someone wins."
