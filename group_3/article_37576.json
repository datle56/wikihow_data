      "title": "Prune dead foliage or rotted stems.",
      "content": "Prune dead foliage or rotted stems. If your poinsettia is showing signs of stress, you’ll probably notice that the leaves are turning yellow or brown, or they may be shriveling up and falling off. Use your fingers or a pair of garden shears to snip off any leaves that look damaged. If any stems look mushy, shriveled, or rotted, cut them back to about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) below the affected area. In addition to removing dead material that could lead to further rotting, trimming the stems may help stimulate new growth. [1] X Research source If there’s no dead foliage, wait until spring, then cut your poinsettia back to about 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) above the soil line. [2] X Research source Your poinsettia may look like little more than a bare stick by the time you’re finished pruning. This is completely normal—the foliage will return once the plant emerges from dormancy in the spring. [3] X Research source Wear gloves while pruning: The sap that’s in poinsettias contains latex, which can irritate your skin or cause a rash. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Water the plant if the top 1 in (2.5 cm) of soil is dry.",
      "content": "Water the plant if the top 1 in (2.5 cm) of soil is dry. Stick your finger about 1 in (2.5 cm) into the soil. If it feels dry, pour water through the plant until it drains through the holes in the bottom of the planter. Check the soil every 1–2 days, watering each time the top 1 in (2.5 cm) dries out. [5] X Research source Underwatering can cause your poinsettia to look wilted, shriveled, or yellow. [6] X Research source Remove the decorative wrapper from the poinsettia planter before you water—otherwise, the water won’t be able to drain out and the roots could rot. Be careful not to overwater your poinsettia. Soggy soil can lead to root rot and other complications that can easily kill the plant."

      "title": "Repot if the poinsettia is rootbound or has been consistently overwatered.",
      "content": "Repot if the poinsettia is rootbound or has been consistently overwatered. If your poinsettia is wilted and the leaves are falling off, the problem could be with the roots. [7] X Research source Carefully grasp the poinsettia by the stem and slide it out of the pot, soil and all. Take care not to damage the plant. Examine any roots that are visible on the outside of the soil. [8] X Research source If roots are filling up the entire pot: The plant is rootbound, which means the root ball has grown too large for the planter. There won’t be much soil, and the plant will eventually show signs of distress. Replant in a pot about 1 in (2.5 cm) larger than the old one. [9] X Research source If the roots look brown and mushy: The plant has probably been overwatered and the roots are starting to rot. If there’s still some healthy root tissue, carefully snip away any rotted roots and repot the poinsettia in fresh soil. Only water when the top 1 in (2.5 cm) of the soil is dry. If the roots are firm and white and fill about half of the pot: The poinsettia has healthy roots and is in the correct size pot. Carefully slide it back into its original pot."

      "title": "Move the poinsettia into a location with 6 hours of bright, indirect sunlight a day.",
      "content": "Move the poinsettia into a location with 6 hours of bright, indirect sunlight a day. Like most tropical plants, poinsettias prefer plenty of bright, filtered light. Keep them near a sunny window—they do best in windows that face south, east, or west. If your poinsettia doesn’t get enough light, the leaves may look pale and wilted. [10] X Research source Don’t let the leaves of the poinsettia touch the glass, especially if it’s cold outside. The cold temperatures will damage the plant. [11] X Research source Avoid placing your poinsettia in direct sunlight. If the light is too bright, your poinsettia’s leaves will scorch and turn brown."

      "title": "Keep the poinsettia above 60 °F (16 °C).",
      "content": "Keep the poinsettia above 60 °F (16 °C). Poinsettias are a tropical plant, so they prefer warmer temperatures—a good rule of thumb is that they’re comfortable at about the same temperature you are. Fortunately, this means that they’ll be content in almost any room of the house. [12] X Research source Avoid temperature fluctuations—do not place poinsettias near heaters, radiators, vents, or doors with a draft. [13] X Research source Wrap the poinsettia if you need to carry it through cold temperatures, like if you’re bringing it home from the store in winter. Your poinsettia may wilt or drop its leaves if the temperatures are too hot, too cold, or fluctuate abruptly."

      "title": "Use a pebble tray if you live in a dry climate.",
      "content": "Use a pebble tray if you live in a dry climate. Normal household humidity is typically fine for poinsettias. But if you live in a dry climate or your house gets dry when you run the heat in winter, place the poinsettia on a tray filled with pebbles. Add a little water to the tray, but don’t let the water touch the bottom of the planter. [14] X Research source As the water evaporates, it will create humidity in the air for the poinsettia. If you prefer, you can run a humidifier near the poinsettia instead of using a pebble tray. Keeping your poinsettia near other houseplants can also raise the ambient humidity. [15] X Research source If the humidity is too low, your poinsettia’s leaves might look shriveled or crispy."

      "title": "Use pesticides to ward off unwanted insects.",
      "content": "Use pesticides to ward off unwanted insects. Common garden pests like aphids and whiteflies have been known to feed on poinsettia leaves. The best way to minimize the damage they do is to spray the plant periodically with a mild organic pesticide, such as neem oil or insecticidal soap . If there are only a few invaders present, you may be able to simply remove them by hand. [16] X Research source Keep in mind that organic pesticides typically have to be reapplied more frequently than chemical products due to their gentler ingredients. If you don’t like the idea of treating your plant with pesticides, try mixing up your own homemade solution by combining an all-natural liquid soap with warm water in a spray bottle and using it to blast bugs whenever they pop up. [17] X Research source If pests are affecting your poinsettia, you might notice small white, brown, or yellow spots on the leaves."

      "content": "Feed the poinsettia an all-purpose fertilizer once a month from spring through fall. Fertilizers are essential for adding vital nutrients to your growing soil. Use a balanced, water-soluble houseplant fertilizer (like a 20-20-20 fertilizer ) for delicate plants like poinsettias. [18] X Research source Always use the amount specified in the instructions of a particular product. You can also use a natural organic material like garden compost or worm castings to fertilize your poinsettia. Plan on reapplying fertilizer about once a month while the plant is in its most active stages of growth."

      "content": "Your poinsettia may wilt due to pests or receiving or an improper amount of nutrients. Poinsettias are tropical plants, which means they like warm temperatures, plenty of moisture and humidity, and bright, indirect sunlight. If their conditions aren’t right, poinsettias will quickly wilt and drop their leaves. Typically, the green leaves will fall off first, then the colorful leaves (called bracts). If your poinsettia looks wilted, shriveled, brown, or yellow, the problem could be: [19] X Research source Overwatering/underwatering: Too much or too little water can cause the poinsettia to droop and drop its leaves. Lack of light/too much light: Incorrect lighting can cause the poinsettia’s leaves to turn yellow or brown and fall off. Low humidity: Dry air can make the poinsettia look brown and crispy. Temperature stress: Cold temperatures, sudden drafts, or blasts of heat can lead to leaves yellowing or falling off. Lack of nutrition: If your poinsettia needs fertilizer, it may grow slowly or not at all. Pests/diseases: Pests on your poinsettia can leave small white, yellow, or brown dots o n the leaves.."

      "content": "You may not be able to save a poinsettia that’s mushy or black. If the stem or roots of the poinsettia are dark brown or black, slimy, or squishy, the plant may be rotted. If the rot is contained to a small area, like a single stem or only a few roots, you may be able to save the plant by removing the affected area. However, if the roots have rotted completely away or most of the stems need to be removed, there’s probably no saving the plant. [20] X Research source Will a poinsettia come back after losing its leaves? A poinsettia can come back after losing its leaves. In fact, heavy pruning in the spring is recommended to encourage vigorous summer growth. [21] X Research source"

      "title": "Move the plant outside to a spot with indirect sunlight.",
      "content": "Move the plant outside to a spot with indirect sunlight. Let your poinsettia sit outdoors for a few hours on warm afternoons. Place the plant in a partially-shaded area so it doesn’t overheat. Screened-in patios and flower beds protected by tree cover can make great outdoor homes for growing poinsettias. [22] X Research source Introduce your poinsettia to outdoor conditions gradually. It’s usually best to start with a few hours in the early morning, then increase its exposure by an hour or two every day until it’s able to withstand an entire afternoon. Look for a spot in your garden with plenty of morning sun but more shade in the afternoon. It may be necessary to water your poinsettia more frequently if it’s been spending a lot of time in the hot sun. Drooping, wilting, or wrinkled leaves may be a sign that your plant has been outside too long. [23] X Research source"

      "title": "Trim the stems back to 4–6 in (10–15 cm) in the spring.",
      "content": "Trim the stems back to 4–6 in (10–15 cm) in the spring. Once the weather begins to heat up, use garden shears to trim each stem back so it’s only about 4–6 in (10–15 cm) tall. This may seem drastic, but it will actually encourage vigorous growth in the plant. [24] X Research source By removing the stems, you’ll be redirecting more of the plant’s resources into producing new foliage. Every few weeks during the growing season (through about the end of August), pinch the tips off of new shoots to encourage a fuller, bushier plant. [25] X Research source"

      "title": "Bring your poinsettia back indoors when temperatures begin to drop.",
      "content": "Bring your poinsettia back indoors when temperatures begin to drop. By mid-fall, it will be too chilly to keep your poinsettia out during the day. Once temperatures dip down to about 50 °F (10 °C) at night, bring it back in. Find a warm, cozy spot for the plant inside your home where it can enjoy 6–8 hours of indirect sun exposure per day. [26] X Research source It may be alright to leave your poinsettia outdoors throughout the fall and winter if you live in a region where the temperature stays above 50 °F (10 °C) at all times. The important thing is to protect it from frost and prolonged exposure to freezing temperatures."

      "title": "Cover the plant overnight during the fall to promote flowering.",
      "content": "Cover the plant overnight during the fall to promote flowering. In order to produce vibrantly colored bracts (or leaves) after a dormant period, your poinsettia will need to spend 12–14 hours a night in total darkness between September and November. Place a black fabric bag or cardboard box over the plant every evening at about 5:00 PM. Uncover it again around 8:00 AM the following morning. [27] X Research source Consider tucking your poinsettia away in a closet or basement after covering it. Even the faintest ambient light can be enough to prevent it from blooming on time. Poinsettias are photoperiod plants, which means the amount of foliage they produce is determined by the number of hours a day they spend without light."
