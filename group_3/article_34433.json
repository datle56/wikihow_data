If abstinence is not an option, there are many ways to reduce your risk of infection. Note that abstinence-only education is usually less effective than more comprehensive forms of sex education. Even if you plan to be abstinent for a time, it is good to educate yourself about safe sex practices should you find yourself in that situation. [3] X Research source"

Most STDs can be tested for, and many of these can be treated. If your partner tests positive for an STD, refrain from having sex until after their treatment.

[6] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If your partner says they have been tested, ask for which diseases.

They can be purchased at most drug and grocery stores, sex shops, or obtained for free at some hospitals and clinics. Use condoms every time you engage in sexual activity: they only work if used consistently. External condoms fit on the penis and are put on before engaging in penetrative sex. They work for vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Open the package carefully (never with your teeth or a pair of scissors), place it so that the rolled up edges are facing away from the person wearing it, pinch the tip, and carefully roll it on. Inspect it for tears or holes and if you feel it break at any time, pull out immediately. Also, use lubricant to keep it from tearing due to friction. When the act is completed, pull out (while holding the condom on) before the erection is lost and carefully dispose of the condom. Absolutely do not reuse a condomâ€”ever.
