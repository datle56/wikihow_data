There isn’t a bright-line test, but the IRS will look at a variety of factors regarding independence and control of wages and work hours, such as the following: [1] X Trustworthy Source Internal Revenue Service U.S. government agency in charge of managing the Federal Tax Code Go to source An employee is usually subject to the business' instructions about when, where, and how to work. Independent contractors typically choose their own methods. Employees generally are reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses, such as office supplies. Independent contractors typically are not. Employees are usually engaged with the expectation that they will be working indefinitely with the business. Independent contractors, however, are free to seek out different business opportunities and advertise their services openly. Employees are guaranteed a regular wage (hourly, weekly, etc.). By contrast, independent contractors are usually paid a flat fee. An employee may be provided with benefits such as health insurance, a pension plan, sick pay, or vacation pay. Independent contractors aren’t. You should make the determination between employee and independent contractor when you first hire the individual."
