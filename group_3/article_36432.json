      "content": "Wash off your plastic with dish soap and hot water to get it clean. Pour a pea-sized amount of dish soap into your plastic item, then fill it with hot water. Use a sponge or rag to wipe down the entire surface, focusing especially on where the smell is worst. Let the plastic dry for several hours, then smell it to see if the bad odor is gone. [1] X Research source For better results, you can let the soap solution sit for about 15 minutes before rinsing. Washing your plastic normally might get rid of the bad plastic smell."

      "content": "Use bleach and baking soda for an intense cleaning solution. Measure out 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of bleach and pour it into your plastic item. To help deodorize, add in 1 tsp (4.8 g) of baking soda into the mixture. Fill the rest of the container with lukewarm water, then let the cleaning solution soak overnight. The next day, pour out the mixture and see if your plastic smells any better! [2] X Research source This option works well for any bad scent in your plastic, especially reusable water bottles."

      "title": "Clean out your plastic with lemon juice to give it a fresh scent.",
      "content": "Clean out your plastic with lemon juice to give it a fresh scent. Pour several spoonfuls of lemon juice into your plastic item, then scrub the surface with a rag or sponge. For a more direct approach, cut a lemon in half and rub the fruit over the smelly plastic. After you’ve cleaned off the surface, rinse off any leftover lemon juice and let the plastic air out for several hours. [4] X Research source Try using lemon juice to clean your containers, bins, and other storage items! Instead of lemon juice, you can use a bit of lemon or orange zest. Let it sit in the plastic item for 10-15 minutes, then rinse it out."

      "content": "Use coffee grounds to counteract the bad smell. Take a handful of wet or dry coffee grounds and drop them in the bottom of your plastic item. Leave the plastic in an open area for several hours or days, depending on how smelly the container is. Check your plastic periodically to see if it smells any better, then dump out the coffee grounds. [5] X Research source If several days have passed and the plastic smell is still there, you might want to try something else. This is an especially handy trick for plastic containers."
