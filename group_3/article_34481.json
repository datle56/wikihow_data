      "content": "Learn the difference between a good and bad stranger. Good strangers are people you don't know but they are there to help you, such as a police officer or a doctor. However, bad strangers are people whom you don't know, who want to hurt you, do something that will make you feel uncomfortable or might take you away from your parents. Bad strangers are the ones you need to stay away from. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Quickly walk away if a stranger approaches you. If they start following you, then something isn't right and you must tell a trusted adult about this. Walk as fast as you can to your parents, a trusted neighbor, or try to find a police officer. But never go to your home if you are followed! Because the stranger would know where do you live."

      "title": "Start kicking and screaming.",
      "content": "Start kicking and screaming. Fight like your life depends on it. Scream at the top of your lungs, kick the stranger very hard, and even roughly bite their hand if you need to. Do whatever you possibly can to escape. Squirming helps too! The stranger should drop you and scurry since kidnappers hate attention. [2] X Research source The stranger may try covering your mouth. If that does happen, keep screaming, and kick just as hard. Below are some suggestions on what you can scream: \" Let me go! \" \" You're not my mom! \" \" You're not my dad! \" \" Stop! \" \" Somebody, help me! \" \" Call the police! \" Stranger Danger!"

      "content": "Run and tell an adult, for example, your parents, teacher, etc. Tell the adult that you were grabbed by a stranger. The adult should contact emergency services immediately. [3] X Research source Learn the phone number of your parents, siblings, best friends, and the police. If you can't remember things well, make a note and keep it in your pockets. If you suspect a stranger is following you, walk in a loop around a block to be sure. Never choose the lesser crowded lane to run if you see a more crowded place. If you see a group appearing like they are a family, ask them to call your parents. A mall or a shop can be safe to find more people. Run inside one if around and use their phone to make a call to the police by dialing 911 (if you live in USA). Carry some coins with you, just in case."

      "content": "Strangers will use treats or toys to trick children into going somewhere with them. Just say no and never, ever get into a car with a stranger, no matter what they say. Ignore them and run as fast as you can to your parents or someone you know. Beware of candy or anything edible offered by a stranger. Food offered by strangers may not be wrapped, which possibly gives a red flag that toxic ingredients were added."

[4] X Research source If an adult asks you to help them find their dog, carry items to their car, or help them do something, it's okay to say no. Adults should go to other adults for help, not children. Say no and tell an adult right away. Remember, safety is more important than manners."
