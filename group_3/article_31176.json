To make sure you have enough in-pocket to move without relying on credit cards, loans, or other methods that can rack up debt, look up the average cost in the place you’re moving to. Budget enough money for transportation (including gas), your living situation, and food while you’re traveling. [1] X Research source You’ll know you’re ready to move if you have a savings fund with enough money to live off of for at least 3 months, plus a steady income (or a job lined up) to pay your rent and bills. [2] X Research source Try to set aside anything you can spare in case of unexpected costs or emergencies while you’re moving. If you’re moving to a new state with a car, set aside $100 to $125 to re-register it and get a new driver’s license. [3] X Research source Many states require you to register your vehicle 30 to 60 days after moving. [4] X Research source"

There’s no point in packing and moving things that you don’t want or need! [7] X Research source You can also donate some of your old clothes if you don’t feel like selling them.

There’s no easy way to ask a friend or relative for money , but a repayment plan shows that you fully intend to pay them back. Draft up a loan agreement explaining how much money you need, how much and how often you plan on repaying the loan, and how much interest you’ll pay. [10] X Research source To help convince your friend or loved one further, explain what consequences you’ll face if you don’t pay them back in time. Making a loan agreement definitely requires a little extra work, but it will also show how serious you are about what you’re asking. When first bringing up the loan in conversation, say something like, “I’d really like to move out and have a place of my own, but I’ve hit a rough patch financially. Would I be able to borrow $1,500 to help get me on my feet? I plan on paying it all back over the next 6 months with 3% interest.”"
