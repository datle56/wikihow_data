      "content": "Your jealousy might be just what you need to go after what you want. While people often view jealousy as a bad thing, being jealous can actually provide you with a valuable learning opportunity.

This may be a sign telling you to rethink your career path. If you're jealous of the way a coworker dresses, work on developing your own unique style . Instead of envying someone with a lot of money, make your dollars count. Save up your money to buy just a few nice items that will make you feel good about what you have."

      "content": "Look to see if there’s a rational reason for you to be jealous. Jealousy is often a sign that we're afraid of losing a person who's close to us, but that doesn't actually mean they're doing anything wrong or being unfaithful. [5] X Research source Be really honest with yourself about whether your partner or friend has given you a reason to feel jealous. Look for concrete evidence, such as a friend repeatedly canceling plans without any excuse, or flirty messages your partner has sent to someone else. If you come up empty-handed, it might be nothing after all. For example, if you're jealous that your friend is spending time with someone new, but they're still making time for you, you probably don't have anything to worry about. If your partner is frequently dishonest with you or they've broken your trust before, your jealousy could actually be your instincts telling you something's wrong. Consider taking a step back so you can reflect on whether this is really a healthy relationship."

Take a few deep breaths to help yourself feel more in control. Then, start to process what you're feeling and go back once you’ve sorted through your thoughts. If you do decide to talk to the other person about how you're feeling, wait until you've had time to really cool down and sort through your thoughts."
