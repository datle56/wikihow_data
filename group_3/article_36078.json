After about 7 days, it’s okay to send a follow-up email or text since your original message may have gotten lost in their inbox and they didn’t see your request. [1] X Research source If your request is time-sensitive and you need to hit an upcoming due date, it’s okay to reach out a couple of days sooner."

A generic subject line like “Action Required” or “Following Up” sounds vague or may make someone feel bad for taking a long time. Specify exactly what you’re expecting from the person with as few words as possible. You could even include how long the task will take so the person knows how much of a commitment it is.

If you haven’t talked to the person very much, quickly reintroduce yourself so they remember who you are. Include a short personalized sentence to make them feel respected. “Hi Julie, this is Eric from last week’s team meeting. You made some great points when you were leading our discussion.” “Hello Dina, this is Maggie from the company webinar. I hope you’re doing well with everything this week, and I’m excited to hear more about what you’ve been working on.” “Dear Mr. Sherman, thank you so much for being so organized and on top of everything with this marketing project.” “Hello again Mark!
