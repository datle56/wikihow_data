      "title": "The man bun looks good on every face shape.",
      "content": "The man bun looks good on every face shape. The man bun is especially flattering if you have an oval face because it means you can handle a lot of volume on top. It also works well if you have a square face shape, since it’ll add some roundness and help relax the angles of the face. [11] X Research source Just determine your face shape and pick one of the styles below, or ask your barber what would look best with your hair texture, length, and facial features. Oval: Any type of man bun fade will look great on you, but try asking for a high or drop fade for a sharper look. If you want something more natural, stick to a low or taper fade. Square: To soften up your features, request a low or mid fade with a slightly messy man bun. Adding a full beard can also balance out your strong jawline. Round: Since your features are softer, stick with a high fade to add more definition and length to your face. Ask your barber to keep the sides tight to give the illusion of a chiseled jawline. Heart: Request a drop fade to balance out your narrow chin. If possible, grow out a beard and have your barber taper and blend it out—it’ll help fill out the lower part of your face. Diamond: Go for a mid-fade man bun to highlight your cheekbones, without making your face look too harsh or angular. Tie up your hair into a loose, messy bun to help soften your features. Oblong: To balance out the proportions of your face, ask for a low or tapered fade with a loose man bun. This will keep the width on the sides, preventing your face from looking even longer."

Slide your thumbs back through your hair, gathering it at the crown (or slightly lower) to form a ponytail. Wrap the hair tie around the ponytail 1 to 2 times, then twist the tie and pull the ponytail halfway through the tie (so some of the ends of your hair stick out below the bun).

For straight hair, use a smoothing shampoo and conditioner to minimize frizz and add extra shine. For wavy, curly, or textured hair, use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner to hydrate your strands and minimize heat damage."
