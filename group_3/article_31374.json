      "title": "Your life’s journey is about learning to stand out and be bold.",
      "content": "Your life’s journey is about learning to stand out and be bold. Your north node is representative of your higher calling and what your overall lesson is in this lifetime. Since your north node is fueled by the energy of Leo, you’re learning to express yourself freely, fight for what you believe in, show off your creativity, and stop caring about the opinions of others. [1] X Research source While having a north node in Leo makes you mystical and adventurous, you may struggle with vanity and strong emotions, much like a Leo does. Famous people with their north nodes in Leo include Beyoncé, Barack Obama, and Natalie Portman."

      "title": "You draw comfort from intellectual pursuits and detachment.",
      "content": "You draw comfort from intellectual pursuits and detachment. Every north node has a polar opposite south node, and on the opposite of Leo’s axis is Aquarius. Your south node symbolizes who you were in a past life. It represents energies you already possess or have mastered. Having a south node in Aquarius means you’re most comfortable in your more Aquarian pursuits: humanitarianism, innovation, and “the big stuff” (improving society, fulfilling your destiny ). However, you likely struggle to deal with people on a personal level and fear too much attention. [2] X Research source While you’re supportive and confident, having a south node in Aquarius likely means you can be hypercritical and in your own head a little too often. It’s likely in a past life that you were involved with a lot of different organizations and very connected to your loved ones. Therefore, this lifetime is about learning to stand out from the pack."

      "title": "It’s better to stand out than fit in.",
      "content": "It’s better to stand out than fit in. As someone with a north node in Leo, your karmic task is learning to be comfortable in the spotlight. Leo, ruled by the sun (which all our planets revolve around), tends to be happiest as the center of attention, boldly inspiring others. However, with the baggage of an Aquarius south node, straying from the pack is likely tough for you. When in doubt, think of it this way: your Aquarian instincts still want to change the world, but to do that, you need an audience, so embrace the crowd! [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Try, even if you fail.",
      "content": "Try, even if you fail. As an Aquarius south node, you tend to overanalyze everything. You’re rarely the type to do something first. You prefer to hang back and examine others’ attempts to determine if it’s worth it. But to find your own self-expression, you have to blaze your own path. Your journey as a north node Leo includes learning that winging it and failing is often just as fulfilling as meticulously-planned success. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use your heart more than your head.",
      "content": "Use your heart more than your head. Since your south node is in Aquarius, you’re more than capable of intellectual reasoning. Using logic to apply yourself is not an issue for you. However, that’s not what your karmic journey is about. This lifetime is meant to teach you how to connect deeply with others, to get more personal, and out of your own head. Limit the amount of time you process decisions and start acting more passionately and spontaneously."

      "title": "The material world is a good thing.",
      "content": "The material world is a good thing. Your own head is wonderful and brilliant, but you know that already. Remember, as a north node Leo, to truly improve the world, you need to actually experience what’s in it as more than an abstract concept. Learn to embrace small luxuries (delicious foods, attractive clothing) and spoil your body (book a spa day, treat yourself to a fun haircut) as much as your mind. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Get comfortable being alone.",
      "content": "Get comfortable being alone. Being alone doesn’t always mean being lonely. In fact, if you have a south node in Aquarius, you’re likely more lonely in groups than you give yourself credit for. Your overreliance on others leads to constantly being let down or abandoned, which is painful. Being a north node Leo is all about learning to stand on your own two feet; that often means you’ll have to walk the righteous path by yourself, but at the end, you’ll see how rewarding that courage and self-reliance really is.

      "content": "The 12 houses define specific areas of your life. When you were born, the placement of every planet was within the boundaries of a unique astrological house. Each house focuses on a different area of your life. The house that your north node fell under when you were born can give insight into which area of your life can really benefit from the karmic lessons of Leo. [7] X Research source North nodes and south nodes exist on the same axis, so wherever your north node is in the 12 houses, your south node will always be 6 houses away."

With a north node Leo here, your karmic mission focuses heavily on your own identity and autonomy. Stand out from the crowd and learn to love what makes you different. [8] X Research source"

Having a Leo north node here means becoming comfortable with using your money on the things YOU want, not what others make you feel like you should have.

      "content": "If it’s in the 3rd house, connect with people more personally. The 3rd house is all about communication. Your Aquarius south node is likely compelling you to connect with people using logic and abstraction. Instead, get comfortable connecting with others over more personal subjects: their passions, their loves, their wants."

If you have a Leo north node in the 4th house of the family, you’re likely already comfortable as a team member in your family dynamic (chosen or otherwise). But sometimes you need to be the star. Show off your heritage to the rest of the world. Be the champion of your family name and let your family back you, rather than you backing them."

If your Leo north node is here, that means your Aquarius south node in the 1st house is likely compelling you to stay in your head, to be detached and self-involved where it’s comfortable. Try your best to let your more Leo ways of loving shine through; use your warmth and generosity to give more of yourself to your partner. Lead them by example into your light.

Your Aquarius south node, despite its innovation, often compels you to find comfort in groupthink. You want to choose a belief system that’s safe and supported by a crowd. But your destiny is to find your own philosophy. Discover your own way of looking at the world and discuss your ideas with as many people as you can. Leos are natural leaders; be the champion of your own insights."

You’re probably more compelled than ever to fall into the safety of the crowd and use your logic to connect. But try to focus on how each friendship makes you feel.
