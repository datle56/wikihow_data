Because this method doesn't require you to tamper with your CD player in any way, it's smart to start here - you have nothing to lose if it doesn't work. First, turn your car off if it isn't already.

      "content": "Consult the player's manual. The power + eject button combination is one common \"force eject\" command, but many CD players may require different button inputs to eject a stuck CD. If you still have it, consult your CD player's owner's manual, which should include information on this and other functions that can help you retrieve your CD."

      "content": "Grab a blank or useless CD. This method involves inserting a second CD into the player, so, to prevent damage to a beloved album, try to procure a blank CD or one that you otherwise don't care about. Turn the CD player on before proceeding. If this requires you to start the car, then start the car and turn the CD player on. Note: This method, like several others in this article, carries the risk of damage to the stuck CD or the player itself. Use caution when inserting any foreign objects into your CD player. If you're ever worried about damaging your CD player, stop and take your problem to a professional."

[2] X Research source If you feel the stuck CD start to eject, to care to ensure that it doesn't become sandwiched between the second CD and the edge of the CD slot. If this doesn't work, repeat, but try to get the blank CD below the jammed CD, then gently pry it upwards. CD players can differ in their precise ejection mechanism, so sometimes upward pressure can be more successful in giving the ejection mechanism traction on a stuck CD than downward pressure."

      "content": "Apply pressure to the unit. Sometimes, applying pressure to the unit itself can help the stuck CD gain traction. If the player is mounted in such a way that it's near the upper surface of the dashboard, you may have success repeating the steps in this method while pressing or gently but firmly smacking the area of the dashboard above the player. Note that, while some have had success by banging on the dash, this can damage delicate components of the center console, so it is not recommended if your car has a GPS, etc. between the CD player and the top surface of the dashboard."

      "content": "Write down your radio presets and audio settings. This method is useful when you can't remove a CD because your CD player will no longer turn on. This method involves disconnecting, then reconnecting the electrical supply to the CD player. For most CD players, this means that any radio presets you've set will be erased and your personal audio settings will be reset to their defaults. If you're an avid listener of music in your car, make sure you record your personal settings so they can easily be restored afterward."

Knives made from metal conduct electricity, so, if you have an object made from wood or plastic that will work (like, for instance, a popsicle stick), use it. If not, be sure to disconnect all power supplies from the CD player and make sure any electrical charge has been removed. Turn the car and the CD player off and disconnect the negative terminal of your car's battery.

Putty knives are typically tapered so that if you wrap the tape tight enough, it will not slide off the end. If you're using another object, like a popsicle stick, which doesn't taper, you may need to stick the tape to the object, wrap it around several times, then put a twist in the tape and wrap it around several more times to make sure the tape is adequately secured to the object."

Use an expired credit card or a similar object - preferably, one that's not important, in case you lose it or it breaks.
