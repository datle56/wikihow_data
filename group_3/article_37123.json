Look carefully at nearby areas to see if you find more mold that you didn’t originally see. This may help you determine the cause of the mold. Be polite but firm that you are concerned about potential health problems that could result from you and those living with you being exposed to the mold. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Review your lease to determine who is responsible for mold removal. You should still have a copy of your lease agreement in your possession; take this out and review the details about mold and about who is responsible for certain types of repairs. [3] X Research source If you don’t still have a copy of your lease, you may request one free copy from your landlord. If you have found mold on furniture, shower tiles or the bathtub, or window sills you will most likely be held responsible for cleaning this mold and keeping the areas dry enough to prevent future mold. If you have found mold on the ceiling, seeping through basement walls, or on walls near leaky pipes, your landlord is most likely responsible for cleaning this mold and for fixing the problems causing it."
