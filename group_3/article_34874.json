      "content": "Scoop the contact gently out of the case with the edge of your nail. Try not to physically touch the center of the contact with your nail, or you may scratch it by accident. Instead, focus on coaxing and sliding the lens out of the package or case and then pinching it with your fingertips. [1] X Research source Try not to touch or handle your contacts with your nails directly, if you can."

Check that the lens is a dome shape, so it can fit easily over your eye. Since your 1 hand is busy holding your eyelids open, you’ll be using your opposite hand and fingertip to insert your lens.

      "content": "Wash your hands before touching your contacts. Resist the temptation to toss your contacts in with dirty or otherwise unwashed hands. Clean your hands with water and mild soap for 20 seconds before handling your contacts. Since you’ll be touching your eyelids with your bare hands, you don’t want to introduce any unwanted germs to your body. [8] X Research source Dry your hands off with a lint-free towel so your fingers won’t transfer lint to your contacts. [9] X Research source Don’t forget about your nails, too! Take some time wash beneath your long nails to get rid of the germs hiding there. [10] X Research source"

Be gentle as you apply the makeup, and don’t get any cosmetics inside your eye. Before you remove your makeup, pull out your contacts first. [11] X Research source Choose an oil-free, hypoallergenic makeup remover that’ll be easy on your eyes. Remove your lenses and clean them with contact solution immediately if you get any makeup on them. It’s easy to tear up when you’re putting in contacts, so you don’t want your makeup to run!

It’s perfectly understandable if you lose your grip on your lens, especially if you’re not used to handling your contacts with your long nails. Grab a contact solution that’s designed specifically for contacts, and not just labeled as a saline solution. Rinse off the lens thoroughly before putting it back into your eye.
