Even if you're just signed in as your regular user account, you can open a root terminal from the GUI to avoid having to use sudo to enter a bunch of commands. To open a root terminal, click the menu at the upper-left corner, type root , and then click Root Terminal Emulator in the search results. The root user account is not enabled by default in Kali Linux. While you can enable it if need be, it is not recommended and is usually not needed. [2] X Research source You can also open a terminal in Kali by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T , then use the command sudo -i to make it a root terminal. If you just need to run a few commands as root, just type sudo before them to run them with superuser rights. For example, sudo apt upgrade upgrades all installed packages on the system."
