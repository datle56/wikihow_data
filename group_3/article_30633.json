      "content": "Fit a serving of spaghetti through a quarter-sized hole in your fingers. Make a circle with your thumb and pointer finger. Adjust the size of the circle until it’s about the size of a bottle cap or U.S. quarter. Place the dry spaghetti noodles through your fingers until the circle is filled. Whatever fits is a single serving of spaghetti! [1] X Research source Repeat this process for however many servings of spaghetti you’d like to cook."

      "content": "Compare the size of a small bunch of noodles to a U.S. quarter. A single serving of spaghetti, when bunched into a circle, has a diameter of 7 ⁄ 8 inch (22 mm)—same as a U.S. quarter. [2] X Research source If you have one of those coins around, gather a small bunch of spaghetti and line it up on top of a quarter. Add noodles until the quarter is completely blocked by the spaghetti, but not more than fits on top. Place this measured pasta in a pot and repeat the process for any additional servings."

      "content": "Fit a serving of noodles through the top of a 1-liter soda bottle. Stand the bottle upright on a table and place a small amount of noodles into the bottle. You should continue to hold the noodles so they don't spread out and mess up the measurement. Add more spaghetti until the bottle's opening is filled in. [3] X Research source One bottle-cap’s worth of spaghetti is approximately equal to one serving. Repeat this process if you want to make multiple servings. If you like this method but don't want to have an empty soda bottle taking up your counter space, cut off the top of the bottle and keep it in a drawer."

Note what the initial measurement is, then add or remove pasta to reach the amount of servings you want—which should be 2 ounces (57 g) of spaghetti per person.

Add more noodles until the pasta spoon’s hole is completely filled. Once filled, release the spaghetti into the pot. Repeat as necessary to make more than one serving of spaghetti.

Take a small amount of dry spaghetti out of the box and put it through the hole that matches the number of servings you want to make. Add spaghetti noodles to fill the hole completely and find your spaghetti portion size for any number of people. [6] X Research source Spaghetti measure tools are small devices with various-sized holes cut into them. Each hole equals a different number of servings (typically from 1-4), which makes it easy to measure spaghetti per person!"

      "content": "Freeze leftover spaghetti in a sealed bag for up to a month. If you ended up cooking more servings of spaghetti than you needed, place the extra portions of pasta (with or without sauce) into a freezer bag. Make sure the cooked pasta has completely cooled to room temperature before placing it into the bag. Eat the pasta within one month of freezing it. [7] X Research source When you’re ready to eat the pasta, place the freezer bag into a bowl of warm water to thaw. Once it’s thawed enough to remove it from the bag, place the defrosted pasta into a pan and warm it over gentle heat. After a few minutes, your spaghetti will be ready to eat!"

To make frittata di spaghetti , a popular southern Italian dish, mix every 8 ounces (230 g) of leftover spaghetti with about 4 eggs and ½ cup (50g) of your preferred grated cheese. Pour the mixture evenly into a nonstick skillet. Cook for about 8 minutes or until the bottom of your frittata is set, then flip it onto a plate. [8] X Research source Slide the frittata back into the pan and cook the other side for about 5-10 minutes until it begins to brown. Place the spaghetti frittata onto a serving plate, and enjoy!"
