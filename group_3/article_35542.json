If you can't stop thinking about things you want to say, reach out to a close friend with whom you can talk. Or, try writing them down. Unfollow, unfriend, and otherwise avoid interacting with her on social media. Do not allow yourself to even view her social media profiles.

In particular, do not repeatedly contact her to question her righteousness or morality.

Go to source When you're feeling betrayed you will likely catch yourself thinking one-dimensionally in terms of who is in the wrong. Do not allow your initial thoughts and feelings to guide your behavior. Avoid making a scene or acting hysterical. This may mean avoiding your ex if seeing her will lead to strong emotional responses. If you're struggling to keep it together, commit to a regular daily routine. Structure and repetitiveness are comforting, especially when you may be stressed. Avoid using alcohol or drugs to cope. Not only are these unhealthy behaviors, they may lead you to behave in ways that you will regret. Instead, try calming yourself with deep breathing , meditation , going for a run, or doing anything else that helps you center yourself."

Again, this won't immediately remove the pain that you're feeling; however, it may help you start to get in the mindset that will be necessary to move on.

You must move on, and you know you will eventually, even if it may not feel possible in this moment. Take pride in moments of resilience.

In the course of dating, many people see their social networks shrink. This may be even worse if you shared in most of your friendships with your girlfriend. Don't hesitate to reach out to those who interest you, and make plans to do something simple and see if you hit it off. Don't hesitate to ask for help explicitly. Say something along the lines of, \"Hey, can I tell you about some of the thoughts I've been having? I think it'll help to get them off my chest, and I'd appreciate your advice.\""

Even when the other person has moved on, you may find yourself imagining a whole slew of “what if” scenarios; however, remind yourself that there are likely also many reasons that it didn't work out. [6] X Research source Reflect on how you felt when you were dating. Often, we look back on past relationships through rose-colored glasses. You may have even been questioning the relationship yourself. Accept that she has moved on. You may have been holding out hope that things would work out between the two of you and you might have another shot at love with your ex. It may be painful to let go of that dream, but you can take her marriage as a definitive answer to any of your lingering questions: your romantic relationship is over. Even if you weren't convinced it was meant to be, it still hurts to be the one who is left behind. Remind yourself, however, that you're likely feeling drawn to her in part because of her sudden increased distance."

      "content": "Follow your interests. Everyone always has a list of things they want to spend more time on, try out, or grow more familiar with. Choose one or two activities you want to try or do more frequently. For instance, start hitting the gym three times a week instead of just once. Alternatively, pick up a new hobby altogether. Try to choose something active and something creative. You can interpret these as broadly as you wish. The point is, staying active will literally help your body and mind feel better, and having a creative outlet can provide a powerful way to express your emotions. For example, yoga or guided meditation can not only make you feel great, it will also likely lead you to meet new people. Simple, weekly activities can open up door to whole new friend groups and lifestyles! Maybe you've always wanted to play guitar. Here's your chance! You can probably even find people to learn and practice with by contacting local music stores or searching online."

      "content": "Plan something you can look forward to. The classic example is a vacation. Start and email or group text thread with a group of your friends and pitch some ideas for a weekend trip. Choose somewhere relatively nearby so it will be easier and less expensive for people to commit. Pick a weekend a month or so ahead of time. This ensures you and others can prepare for the trip, and will give you something to look forward to for the next month! If you can't escape for a trip, make plans to have friends over next weekend, just to hang out. There's nothing like a video game marathon to distract you for a while and help you relax."

Choose a goal you want to achieve, and whenever she comes to mind, think of something you can do to help achieve that goal and get to work. If you're looking for a new goal, consider meeting someone new. Instead of just waiting to meet someone, start introducing yourself to people you're attracted to more frequently.

      "title": "Process negative thoughts.",
      "content": "Process negative thoughts. You may feel some pretty heavy emotions for a while. You may even feel used, shamed, or betrayed. Many people enduring an unexpected separation feel inadequate, or even expendable. You may even start to feel less interesting, or less attractive. You may feel betrayed, shocked, and angry. These negative thoughts are normal under the circumstances — try to avoid stuffing them down and not addressing them. Processing these emotions may be difficult, but working through your feelings will help you move on and start feeling better about yourself. First, allow yourself to sit with your emotions and identify what you're feeling. Instead of distracting yourself from what you're feeling, ask yourself: What feelings or sensations do I have? What thoughts am I having? What am I feeling in my body (tight chest, upset stomach, headache, etc.)? Do I have any judgements toward what I'm feeling? Do I have the urge to fight those feelings? Allow yourself to feel your emotions. Though it might be painful, remember this — your emotions are not going to kill you. Breathe through the feeling and ask yourself: What do I think will happen if I sit with this emotion? Is it really intolerable? How can I make it more tolerable (deep breathing, meditating, relaxing, etc.)? Address the emotions. Acknowledge that you are likely feeling these emotions as a direct result of your former girlfriend getting married — you may feel unlovable, but it's not because that is true, it's because you are reacting to a painful experience. Teach yourself how to challenge negative thoughts by reframing them and using evidence to refute them. For instance, maybe you keep thinking you will never meet another woman. Write down all the evidence that shows this isn't true — You met other women you liked and even loved before you met her; going to a coffee shop and looking around, you see dozens of women who look interesting and attractive; there are billions of people on the planet, and chances are pretty good at least one of them is someone you would like to date."

Sometimes, you can distract yourself, or even convince yourself to put a positive spin on everything. But sometimes, the negativity seems to just grab onto your brain and hold it in a vice grip. This is entirely natural — feelings are feelings, and they come up when you least expect it. [12] X Research source Even if the scenario wasn't outrageous, and you and your ex have mostly parted ways on good terms, the fact that she's potentially happier with someone else won't stay out of your mind. Understandably, this bums you out. This is natural, and it's okay to feel bummed out about it — in fact, it healthier to allow yourself to feel that instead of pushing it away or pretending everything is fine. Go through the steps of processing the emotion and take an action that will help you feel better, like talk to a friend or shooting some hoops. Watch out for worsening or recurring negativity. If you're suffering most of the time, consider meeting with a therapist."

      "content": "See a mental health professional. The pain of separation is in many ways biologically significant. People are programmed to have strong feelings of attachment to those they are romantically involved with. This, in part, explains the potency of love. When an ex publicly declares her love for another, it's going to hurt. Consider meeting with a therapist if you can't move on, or if you start to have any thoughts that persistently bother you. Therapists have talked to all sorts of people about all sorts of relationships, and will know how to help you address certain types of thoughts as they arise. A therapist can also help you start to conceptualize your life in more healthy, forward-thinking, and happiness-inducing ways."
