    {
      "title": "Submerge the mask:",
      "content": "Submerge the mask: Place your mask into a container that is large enough to hold it and enough water to submerge it completely. Fill the container with just enough cool or warm water to cover the mask completely. [1] X Research source This applies to masks that are made out of latex or rubber. If your mask has hair or fur attached, you can wipe the latex or rubber parts of the mask clean with a damp, soapy cloth instead of submerging it to avoid soaking the non-rubber materials."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add soap:",
      "content": "Add soap: Add a few drops of liquid dish soap to the water. The amount doesn’t need to be exact. [2] X Research source There is no exact measurement for the amount of soap to add. The goal is just to get the water nice and soapy. If you’re cleaning your mask with a cloth instead because it has hair or other materials on it, just get the cloth fully wet and squeeze 3-4 drops of dish detergent onto the cloth."
    },
    {
      "title": "Scrub the mask:",
      "content": "Scrub the mask: Use a clean brush or sponge to scrub the soapy mixture over the mask. Be gentle, especially if there’s paint or intricate designs. [3] X Research source You can use any kind of cleaning brush for this. For example, a dish scrubbing brush or even an old toothbrush would work well. If your mask has delicate paint on it, it’s probably best to use a sponge to avoid scraping any of the paint off. If you’re using a soapy cloth to clean your mask, just scrub it all over both sides of the mask."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix in apple cider vinegar:",
      "content": "Mix in apple cider vinegar: Add approximately 1 cup (236.5 mL) of apple cider vinegar to the water, mixing well. [4] X Research source You don’t have to be exact with the measurements here. You won’t hurt the mask by pouring in too much vinegar. If you’re cleaning your mask with a cloth instead, just pour the vinegar onto the cloth and wipe the mask all over again on both sides."
    },
    {
      "title": "Soak the mask:",
      "content": "Soak the mask: Let it soak for 30-45 minutes. This will give the soap and vinegar time to work and remove the rubber smell. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse thoroughly:",
      "content": "Rinse thoroughly: Once done soaking, rinse the mask with cool or warm water until all soap and vinegar are removed. [6] X Research source Make sure to rinse the mask very well. If you don’t, the soap and vinegar solution can dry on it and leave soapy residue or a vinegar smell on the mask. If your mask has hair or other materials on it, be careful not to get these parts wet. Alternatively, you can use a clean cloth soaked in nothing but plain water to wipe off the soap and vinegar."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dry the mask:",
      "content": "Dry the mask: Pat the mask dry with a towel, then allow it to air dry in a well-ventilated area. [7] X Research source If you’re not going to use your mask right away, you can sprinkle some corn starch onto the inside of the mask before you put it away. This will keep it from sticking to itself in storage."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prepare a paste:",
      "content": "Prepare a paste: Mix equal parts baking soda and water to make a paste. Pour some baking soda into a cup, bowl, or other container of some kind. Add an equal amount of water and stir it in with a spoon until the mixture turns into a paste. [8] X Research source If the mixture is too dry, add a little more water until you get the right consistency. If it is too wet, mix in a bit more baking soda."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply the paste:",
      "content": "Apply the paste: Coat the inside of the mask with the paste. Scoop the baking soda and water paste onto the inside of the mask with your hands. Rub it all over the inside of the mask in an even coat. [9] X Research source If possible, turn your mask inside out to make this easier. This method will work for any kind of rubber or latex mask. If your mask has hair or fur, you only need to apply the baking soda paste to the rubber or latex parts of the mask."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add dish detergent:",
      "content": "Add dish detergent: Rub 1-2 drops of liquid dish detergent into the paste inside the mask. Squeeze 1-2 drops of dish detergent into the mask. Use your fingers to rub it around and mix it in with the baking soda paste. [10] X Research source You can add more detergent if 1-2 drops doesn’t seem like enough to get the job done. The soap will help deodorize and sterilize the inside of the mask."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let it sit:",
      "content": "Let it sit: Let the mask sit undisturbed for 15-30 minutes. Place the mask on a clean, dry surface. This will give the cleaning paste time to work and deodorize the mask. [11] X Research source You can leave it longer if your mask is super stinky. It won’t hurt the mask."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse off the paste:",
      "content": "Rinse off the paste: Rinse the paste off the mask completely. Rinse the mask thoroughly under cool or warm running water. Keep rinsing it until you remove all traces of the baking soda paste. [12] X Research source If you can still smell rubber at this point, you can start over and repeat the whole process."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dry the mask:",
      "content": "Dry the mask: Set the mask in a dry, well-ventilated area to dry. Place the mask somewhere out of the way and let it air dry. Wear it or store it after it’s completely dry. [13] X Research source You can set the mask on an improvised stand like a jar of some kind to help it sit upright and get good airflow."
