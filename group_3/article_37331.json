You can also use the drop-down menu to change it to pixels per centimeter instead. If you plan to print your image or simply want it to retain as much of its quality as possible, consider raising the resolution. If your image is for the web or for use in an app like Facebook, the default (72) is fine. If you start with a higher resolution, reducing it will give you a smaller file size. If you plan to print your image in a high-quality format, such as for advertisements or other business communications, set it to at least 600. Note: this will raise the size of the file significantly. To print glossy photos, 300 will suffice. The file size will be much larger than that of a default 72 dpi image, but the final quality will be worth it."

If you want a free app that can do most of the things Photoshop can do, download GIMP . The right way to scale an image varies from one app to another, but the basics are usually pretty similar. For instance, in GIMP: [5] X Research source Open your image and select Image > Scale Image… . Enter your desired dimensions in the Width and Height boxes. You can also change the scale with the dropdown on the right. Type your desired resolution into the X resolution and Y resolution boxes. Click the chains between the size and resolution boxes if you want to constrain the proportions of your image. When you’re done, click Scale . These apps also allow you to export certain file types (such as JPEG) at different quality levels, so you can create a larger or smaller file size without changing the image's dimensions."
