      "title": "Plan a big attack from the closet.",
      "content": "Plan a big attack from the closet. This is an absolutely brilliant plan. First, pick a time when your brother doesn't think you're home and nobody else is there. Then, hide in a closet far away from he is, maybe your own. Then, quietly call the house from your cell phone. When your brother answers the phone, tell him that you need him to go to your closet (or whatever closet you're in) to check on something for you. Then, when he opens the closet, spring out at him and say, \"boo!\" He'll never expect to see you there and will freak out! You'll be able to hold this one against him for years."

      "title": "Ring the doorbell and then hide in a box outside the front door.",
      "content": "Ring the doorbell and then hide in a box outside the front door. The first sentence says it all. Find a big cardboard box that you can climb inside that closes up top, place it on your front porch, and then ring the doorbell and jump inside the box, making sure to quickly close it over yourself. When your brother opens the door and approaches the box, you can jump out! [1] X Research source This is guaranteed to make him scream. It works best if you ring the doorbell when he's a bit away from the door, so he doesn't answer it too soon and see you climbing into the box. If you can't find any big cardboard boxes around the house, then you can get some at your local grocery store. Just ask one of the employees -- many grocery stores often give away their extra boxes."

      "title": "Give him a good scare.",
      "content": "Give him a good scare. Wait until he's so obsessed with what's going on with his computer that he completely doesn't notice who else is in the room. If you can do this at night, when most of the lights in his room are out, then even better. Put on a creepy clown , Scream, or Jason mask and slowly creep up to him until you're practically breathing down his neck. Then, release a guttural, terrifying howl , and watch him jump five feet in the air. If you have another friend or sibling who is as quiet as a mouse, he or she can film the whole thing for effect, and you can use it as blackmail."

    {
      "title": "Make him put whipped cream on his face in his sleep.",
      "content": "Make him put whipped cream on his face in his sleep. This is another classic. Wait until your brother is sound asleep. This works best if he's on his back, with both of his arms out. Then, carefully squeeze a bunch of whipped cream in one of the palms of his hands. (If you really have no mercy, then you can use shaving cream, instead!) Then, use a feather or something small and light to gently brush against his face. He'll reach the hand with the whipped cream out, quickly getting the stuff all over his face! If you want to make sure this works every time, you can put whipped cream in both his hands!"

    {
      "title": "Place a bucket of water over a door.",
      "content": "Place a bucket of water over a door. This is an oldie but a goodie. Simply open a door part of the way and place a bucket filled with water above it so it rests between the wall and the top of the door. When your brother opens it, he'll be taking a little impromptu bath! [2] X Research source This works best in the kitchen or another part of your house where it won't matter if you get water everywhere. And hey, if you can do it somewhere else, even better!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Put tape",
      "content": "Put tape over all the light switches. Put some clear tape on the light switches early in the morning. Your brother will still be nice and groggy, wondering why none of the lights in the house work! When he sees you, tell him your house has no power. Wait for him to figure out that you're lying on his own. You can even tell him that the water in the house doesn't work, either, and see if he falls for it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give him a wedgie.",
      "content": "Give him a wedgie. Wait until your brother has turned away from you, and then sneak up on him as quietly as you can. Reach down to grab his underwear and pull it up as high as you can. This is guaranteed to make him scream and squirm! If you're really feeling up for it, you can try to give him an atomic wedgie, trying to pull his underwear up so high that you can wrap it over his head. This works best if your brother is a lot smaller than you are!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Switch up the contents of his drawers.",
      "content": "Switch up the contents of his drawers. Go into his room and either switch up his drawers, if that's possible, or just work to move the contents of one drawer into another until you've switched up all of his drawers. He will be completely confused and this is a perfect and unexpected prank. Plus, you can have the bonus of snooping through his things while you're at it! If he asks you if you've gone into his room, then just act completely oblivious."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stuff cotton in your brother's shoes.",
      "content": "Stuff cotton in your brother's shoes. This one is especially fun if your brother is still growing. Just stuff a little bit of cotton in your brother's shoes. The next time he'll put them on, he'll think something funny is going on, like maybe that he's outgrown his shoes. He may even walk around like that all day if he's not smart enough to think some funny business is going on! This is perfect for boots or sneakers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stick paper on his butt.",
      "content": "Stick paper on his butt. This is another quick and easy prank. Get a piece of paper that's a similar color to a surface like a couch or a chair, or just get whatever color you want if your brother doesn't really pay attention to where he sits. Place some glue or double-sided tape on the piece of paper, and wait until he sits down. When he gets up, he'll be walking around with a piece of paper on his butt! This is an updated version of the always-effective \"kick me\" sign!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Do the \"palms down\" prank.",
      "content": "Do the \"palms down\" prank. This is a fun one. Show your brother that you've gotten really good at balancing a glass of water on your hand when your palm is down on a table. Bet him that he can't do it with both hands; he'll likely be up for the challenge. Then, have him put both of his palms down on a table while you place two full glasses of water over his hands. Then, say \"Bye!\" or \"Good luck!\" and casually walk out of the room. He'll be trapped -- he'll have to dump water all over himself before he can be set free!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Put clear nail polish over his soap.",
      "content": "Put clear nail polish over his soap. This is another classic. Take some clear nail polish and cover his soap with it. After it dries, the soap won't be able to work! Make sure that there's no other soap in the shower and that he has nothing to use after he gets in there. When he comes out of the shower and says his soap doesn't work, look completely confused. You can even sneakily replace it with a clean bar of soap so it works fine if he tries to demonstrate what happened."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put food coloring on a bar of soap.",
      "content": "Put food coloring on a bar of soap. Place a bit of yellow or light-colored food coloring on the bottom of a bar of soap. When your brother goes into the bathroom next, he'll start washing his hands and will wonder why they're only getting more and more dirty! And if he comes out without any tell-tale signs on his hands, then you can laugh at him for not properly washing his hands! Just make sure to warn everyone else about the prank so your unsuspecting mother or grandparent doesn't come out of the bathroom with yellow hands."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put red food coloring in his toothbrush.",
      "content": "Put red food coloring in his toothbrush. Just one drop of red food coloring on the bottom of your brother's toothbrush will go completely unnoticed. He'll start brushing his teeth and will look in the mirror in horror, thinking he has the world's most sensitive gums. Soon, he'll start to look like a vampire, and he may suspect that you've been up to something! This works best in the morning, when he's rushing around and has no time for your jokes!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Decorate a sponge as a piece of cake.",
      "content": "Decorate a sponge as a piece of cake. Take a sponge and cover it with frosting, chocolate, sprinkles, or any of your brother's favorite treats. Leave it in an inconspicuous place in the kitchen, maybe on top of the microwave or even in the fridge, kind of making it seem like it's your piece of cake and you really don't want anyone to touch it. If you bring it up to him, then he'll have less of a chance of eating it. Then, sit back, relax, and wait for him to howl in confusion when he bites into an ordinary kitchen sponge."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pretend to eat flies.",
      "content": "Pretend to eat flies. This is another fun one. Squish a raisin into a napkin and then tell your brother you just caught a fly. Then, get a maniacal look on your face and start to laugh like you're off your rocker. Reach into the napkin and eat the fly, delightedly smacking your lips as you chew the whole thing. Then, just shrug and walk away like nothing out of the ordinary happened. Don't tell him what you really did -- he'll never figure it out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Serve him tasty \"toothpaste Oreos.\"",
      "content": "Serve him tasty \"toothpaste Oreos.\" This is another gourmet-level prank. If your brother is really into Oreos, then all you have to do is carefully separate an Oreo, fill the inside with white toothpaste, and put it back together again. You can even do this to a handful of Oreos if you don't know which one he'll take. Wait for your brother to take a bite of his favorite treat, looking utterly confused and grossed out in the process."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make him drink vinegar milk.",
      "content": "Make him drink vinegar milk. Wait until your brother pours himself a glass of milk. If he drinks a bit of it and then leaves it unattended, then quickly run in and drop just a bit of vinegar into the glass and stir it around. Wait until he returns to the glass and takes a confused and icky sip. Have a trash can close because he might vomit. Just make sure the glass isn't left unattended for too long or an unsuspecting family member may drink the sour liquid!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Make salt and pepper drinks.",
      "content": "Make salt and pepper drinks. Take a drink that your brother has been drinking (other than water). Put salt and pepper in it––the more salt and pepper, the better. Ugh!"
    },
    {
      "title": "\"Break\" his remote.",
      "content": "\"Break\" his remote. If he loves to channel surf as much as the average brother, then this will be the perfect prank for him. Just take a tiny piece of clear tape and cover the light on the remote just enough so that it no longer works. He'll be completely confused when he tries to watch his favorite show, and may even try to put in new batteries before he figures out your trick (if he figures it out at all!). This works best when you have his least favorite TV show playing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put his video game controller in jello.",
      "content": "Put his video game controller in jello. Make a box of jello and pour a layer into a container large enough to hold the game controller. Use food wrap to completely cover the game controller, then for added security, place it into an airtight bag and seal tightly. When the layer of jello has hardened, place the controller on top and cover it with a layer of liquid jello. Let it harden. Take out the jello. Place the controller back and watch him freak out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Change his desktop picture.",
      "content": "Change his desktop picture . If he actually manages to step away from his computer for five minutes, change his desktop picture to something completely ridiculous as quickly as you can. Pick My Little Ponies , Teletubbies , or pictures of the cutest cats you've ever seen. This works best if he has a laptop that he'll be taking out in public later, so he can surprise a room full of people with the desktop filled with flowers and puppies."

      "title": "Make a fake love letter signed from a girl in his class that also has the same name in your class and place it in his book bag.",
      "content": "Make a fake love letter signed from a girl in his class that also has the same name in your class and place it in his book bag. He'll find the love letter and either confront the girl or tell his friends! Sooner or later he'll tell you guys. Tell him that you have a girl that has the same exact name and likes a boy with his name! He'll feel so embarrassed because the girl said she didn't and he told his friends!"
