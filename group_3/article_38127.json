      "content": "This is the standard translation of “stupid.” It has a similar level of offensiveness as its English counterpart, meaning you should be careful when using it to describe people who aren’t close friends that can take a joke. [1] X Research source “Estúpido” is an adjective, which in Spanish means that it changes form depending on the gender of the noun it’s describing. When describing a male noun, use “estúpido,” and for female nouns, use “estúpida.” “No me importa ese estúpido trofeo.” (no may eem-POR-ta ESS-eh ess-TOO-pee-doh tro-FAY-oh): “That stupid trophy doesn’t matter to me.” “Ana no es estúpida como aparenta.” (AN-a no ess ess-TOO-pee-dah COH-mo ap-ah-REN-tah): “Anna isn’t as stupid as she seems.”"

Calling someone an “idiota” can be quite offensive, so use it carefully. [2] X Research source As a noun, “idiota” can refer to either a male or female. Adjectives and articles describing this noun can give a clue as to its gender: “un idiota” (oon eed-ee-OH-tah) means “an idiot (male)” and “una idiota” (OON-ah eed-ee-OH-tah) means “an idiot (female).” “Debes suponer que soy una idiota.” (DEH-bess soo-PON-ehr kay soy OON-ah eed-ee-OH-tah): “You must be betting I’m an idiot.” “Ese doctor es un idiota” (ESS-eh doc-TOR ess oon eed-ee-OH-tah): “That doctor is an idiot.”"

Although you might be able to get away with using it in an affectionate way, this would likely only work if you’re very close to the person you’re talking to. [3] X Research source “Eres un imbécil, pero también simpático.” (ER-ess oon eem-BAY-seel, PEH-ro tam-bee-EN seem-PAH-tee-co): “You’re a moron, but also pretty nice.” “Llevo tres horas esperando como un imbécil.” (YE-vo tray-ss OR-ahs CO-mo oon eem-BAY-seel): “I’ve been waiting three hours like a moron.”"
