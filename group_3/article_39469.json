She may find it irritating if you zone out and forget things that she has told you – whether these are things that she wants you to do, or just details from her life. Remember the little things she says; things that are just comments or sayings. For instance: if she just at some point mentioned that she has always wanted to go to the lighthouse, plan a surprise trip and take her there.

Draw her a picture, if you're artistic. Write her a poem, if you're good with words. Make her a piece of jewelry, if you're crafty. Use what you have, and make it personal. If she's been talking about something for a while, consider buying it for her to show her that you've been listening.
