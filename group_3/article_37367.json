      "content": "This is a great response if you don’t know what to say. A “😂” often means they’re laughing so hard they’re crying, and can be a quick reaction to shorter messages. Perhaps you sent them a joke or a quick text about something absurd that just happened. Reply with a chain of your own emojis so they know you saw their reaction. Maybe that’s a few “😂” of your own, or a “😉” if you’re feeling flirty. [1] X Research source If you’re texting your girlfriend or boyfriend , reply with a “🤗” or “😜” for a not-so-subtle flirt. [2] X Research source If you’re texting a friend , try sending them some “😝” or “😋” to be silly back. Emojis can be a great way to keep your message lighthearted and fun.

      "content": "Send a light-hearted reply that acknowledges their laughter but brushes past your ego. A “😂” could mean they’re cry-laughing IRL, but don’t let the praise go to your head. A modest reply is a great way to respond to a friend or crush, especially if you want them to see the best in you. Try out one of these replies if they send a laughing emoji after a joke or witty comment: “Wow, didn’t think I was that funny lol” “I’m glad someone finds me funny.” “You’d be the first to laugh at that!”"

      "content": "If you told a hilarious joke, they may react with a “😂” to show they’re laughing. Respond like you would in real life. Would you pretend to bow as they laughed or jokingly pat yourself on the back claiming to be the best comedian? If so, show that in your reply! Try out one of these playful and witty responses on your girlfriend, boyfriend, or friend: “I know. I’m a comedic genius.” “*takes a bow*” “Thank you. Thank you. I’m here all night.”"

Either way, let them know just how much you love their laugh. One of these cute and endearing texts is sure to make them smile: “How are you cute AND find me funny?” “Bet you have the cutest laugh😉” “You must be an alien because no one as hot as you would ever find me funny.” Try not over-use emojis as you flirt—you don't want to seem too eager!

      "content": "Tell them even more things that'll make them laugh IRL. There’s nothing better than making someone laugh, and using the “😂” emoji could be a sign that they’re truly laughing. Maybe you sent them a joke, funny article, or hilarious meme. If anything, they’re definitely amused! Start by opening with one of these responses, and then send another funny thing their way: “There’s more where that came from!” “I can do this all night😉” “Wanna hear another joke?”"

      "content": "This is a nice way to keep the conversation going. A “😂” doesn’t always mean they’re cry-laughing in real life as it can be used ironically. For example, maybe you sent a link to an article you said was hilarious, but they didn’t find hilarious. Not wanting to hurt your feelings, they may just send a bunch of “😂” to be polite. Try changing the subject to keep the conversation going. [5] X Research source Here are some questions you could ask: “So, how was the rest of your day?” “Wishing I could hear that laugh in person😉 What’d you do today?” “And on that note…how was your day?”"

      "content": "Try this if you’re at a loss for words. A “😂” could mean that they don’t know exactly what to say either, so send them something else they can react to. Maybe that’s a gif from their favorite show, or you can be bold and send a meme articulating your annoyance that they only sent you emojis. Who knows? This could turn into an epic gif and meme battle—which, might we add, is a perfect texting activity for girlfriend, boyfriend, or friend!"

      "content": "If there’s more to the story, give them a quick ring. This is a great way to keep the conversation going with your girlfriend, boyfriend, or friend and hear their voice. Maybe you texted them a wildly funny story, but their lonely “😂” response leads you to think they didn’t really get it. Hit that call button to tell them the story in full, and try starting with one of these openings when they pick up: “I wanted to hear your laugh.” “There’s more to the story. Just you wait.” “If you thought that was funny, wait till you hear this.” When texting, it’s always best to assume everyone has good intentions. Texts often get lost in translation, so don’t be afraid to ask what their message meant.

Some “😂” could be their way of saying they want to wrap things up, especially if they didn’t send anything else. Take this as a sign that your conversation is over for now, but don’t sweat it! Whether it’s your girlfriend, boyfriend, or friend, you can text them again tomorrow or the next time you think of them. [7] X Research source A text conversation may be ending if they’re sending shorter responses and have stopped asking you questions. Remember, one conversation ending doesn’t mean the whole text chain is broken!"
