It’s always a good idea to lay down material to work over so don’t get any paint somewhere you don’t want it and so you can reduce any mess you might make.

      "content": "Work in an open or well-ventilated area. Spray paint vapors are toxic, so it’s very important that you work in an open or well-ventilated area while you are using it. Spray paint can also burn your eyes and skin, so it’s best to wear gloves or wash your hands immediately after using it. If you’re spray painting outside, be mindful of the wind direction so the paint goes on the frame and not somewhere else! Cover your nose and mouth with a mask to prevent inhalation of the paint fumes."
