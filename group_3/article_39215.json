Then go to Advanced > Developer Mode in the mobile or desktop app. Make sure the toggle switch next to \"Developer Mode\" is turned on. The Gear/Settings icon is in the lower-left corner next to your username on the desktop application. On mobile, tap your profile icon in the lower-right corner and then tap the Gear icon in the upper-right corner. This method can come in handy if you want to link to your Discord profile on a website, message board, social media profile, or even in your email signature. However, it's not the easiest way to share your Discord profile, which is to share your username instead. You can use this method on any device, including on your Android, iPhone, or iPad."
