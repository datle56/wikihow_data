      "content": "Keep the stovetop clean. Cooking on a regular basis leads to build-up from substances like leftover food and grease, which can easily catch fire. Wipe up spills and clean the area regularly with white vinegar or any surface cleaner. Before events when you know you'll be cooking a lot, such as parties and holidays, give the stovetop and oven a thorough cleaning to prevent any disasters that could ruin the day. Different types of stovetops require different deep-cleaning techniques. On a glass stovetop, use baking soda and a damp towel to soak and loosen the build-up before scraping it off. [1] X Research source For coil burners, remove and scrub the coils as well as the drip pans, or replace the drip pan liners. With gas burner cooktops, soak and scrub the grate in soapy water and use a vinegar and water mixture to scrub the cooktop. Use dish soap and a toothbrush to remove any stubborn grease build-up.

      "content": "Keep appliances clean. Just as with the counters, check for grease or food build-up on your kitchen appliances, such as toasters, toaster ovens, electric griddles, and deep fryers. After many uses, appliances can develop build-up of flammable substances. Use an oil-based cleaner or a mixture of concentrated liquid dish soap and baking soda to scrub away the grease and food."

      "content": "Regularly inspect and service your appliances. Regular inspections of your appliances, whether you do it yourself or hire a professional, are also important to determine whether the items need servicing. Completing an inspection yourself may save you some money, but it is a lengthy and involved process, and if you are not an expert you may miss some important details. One quick inspection you can easily do yourself is to examine electrical cords occasionally to make sure they're not broken or frayed. If the cords are compromised, replace them."

      "title": "Check your smoke detectors.",
      "content": "Check your smoke detectors. Make sure you have working smoke detectors on all floors of your home. You should have a smoke detector either inside or just outside of your kitchen. [3] X Research source Sometimes harmless incidents in the kitchen can set off the alarm, leading people to turn off the detector or remove it. If this happens, be sure to re-attach the detector and turn it back on to be prepared for any future incidents. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Unplug electric appliances when you’re not using them.",
      "content": "Unplug electric appliances when you’re not using them. Even when appliances are turned off, they still draw an electrical current. If the product is faulty or defective, leaving it plugged in can start an electrical fire. [5] X Research source Develop a habit of unplugging all appliances before you go to bed or leave for long trips. When you do use the appliances, plug them straight into the electrical outlet. Never use an extension cord or power strips, as these may overheat and start a fire. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Don’t leave cooking food unattended. If you’re frying, broiling, boiling, or grilling any food, you must stay in the kitchen. If you need to leave, turn off the burner first. If you’re baking, broiling, or simmering food, set a timer and check it regularly. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Turn pot and pan handles toward the back of the stove.",
      "content": "Turn pot and pan handles toward the back of the stove. Handles hanging over the edge of the stove are a major hazard as they are easily bumped, spilling the contents of the pot or pan and potentially causing burns or fire. Turning the handles ensures that people are less likely to bump or run into them."

      "content": "Keep children away from the stovetop. Make a rule that they must stay at least 3 feet (0.91 m) away from the cooking area, or any area where hot food and drink is being prepared. [9] X Research source If you have children, consider purchasing a stove guard, a barrier that prevents children from touching hot surfaces and protects from burns. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Don’t wear long, loose sleeves while cooking.",
      "content": "Don’t wear long, loose sleeves while cooking. Loose clothing can easily drag through food, touch open flame, or catch on pot handles. Roll up long sleeves or wear close-fit clothing to avoid this hazard. Before you start cooking, remove any other loose articles of clothing like scarves or ties. Long hair can cause a similar hazard. Be sure to tie up long hair to keep it out of the way when cooking."

      "content": "Keep any flammable objects away from the stovetop. It’s common to set a towel or potholder next to the stove and forget about it, but these objects can easily get too close to a heating element and catch fire. Any flammable objects, such as oven mitts, curtains, wooden utensils, and packaging, should be kept away from the stove and clear of danger.

      "content": "Keep an oven mitt and metal pot lid nearby while cooking. Having these items on hand can help you to smother small stovetop fires. In the event of a fire, turn off the burner and then slide the lid over the fire and hold it there until it feels cool. If you lift the lid too early, the fire could start again. [12] X Research source With grease fires, remember to never fight the fire with water, as that will only make it spread. Use the lid technique to suffocate the fire instead."
