Then, the Psychic opens the screen and looks at the target area that‚Äôs marked by the colored wedges with numbers. Once they memorize its location, the Psychic closes the screen again. If there‚Äôs ever the odd time where numbers and scoring areas are visible on both the left and right side of the wheel, the target area is wherever the 4-point wedge is located."

The clue should fit on the spectrum between the 2 concepts listed on the wavelength card and only convey a single thought. After giving the clue, the Psychic cannot speak for the rest of the round. [3] X Research source Example: If the wavelength card is ‚ÄúHot - Cold‚Äù and the target area is all the way to the left side, the Psychic may give a clue like ‚ÄúLava‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Sun.‚Äù Avoid using multi-part clues, such as ‚ÄúConcrete on a summer day.‚Äù Example: For the card ‚ÄúSandwich - Not a Sandwich‚Äù and the target area is perfectly centered on the wheel, the Psychic could give a clue like ‚ÄúHot dog.‚Äù Clues must be on topic, and may not include any words on the wavelength card or their synonyms.
