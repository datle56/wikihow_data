      "content": "Speak to Farengar Secret-Fire. He is the Jarl's wizard inside Dragonsreach castle in Whiterun. He can usually be found in the room to the right of the throne room when you enter the castle. After you warn Jarl Balgruuf of Whiterun of the dragons, the Jarl will instruct you to talk to Farengar Secret-Fire. Farengar will explain that he is looking for the Dragonstone, and he will direct you to go to Bleak Falls Barrow. This will result in a quest marker leading to Bleak Falls Barrow popping up on your map. [1] X Research source If you have completed the quest “The Golden Claw,” chances are you might already have the Dragonstone in your inventory. This is because the quest will take you through the exact same path required for the “Bleak Falls Barrow” quest. You will also be unable to sell or transfer the Dragonstone out of your inventory, ensuring that it will stay on your person until you give it to Farengar at the end of the “Bleak Falls Barrow” quest."

      "content": "Travel to Bleak Falls Barrow. It's is southwest from Whiterun, south of the Western Tower at the top of the mountains There are a couple routes you can take to get there. Be careful as you approach the barrow, as you will encounter around a half-dozen bandits near its entrance. The wide-open space of this area will give their archers plenty of opportunities to stick you with arrows. The paths to Bleak Falls Barrow are as follows: Find a footpath from the base of the northern wall of the mountain south of the Western Tower. Follow it all the way up to the top of the mountain. This route presents the fewest threats along the way. Cross the bridge north of the Riverwood. Then turn northwest along a winding path leading up to the barrow. This route is the most commonly used route. However, it will pit you against hostile forest animals (usually wolves) and a few bandits near an abandoned tower along the way."

The spider will not be able to pass through the door. Heal up, and use magic or ranged weapons to wear the spider down from afar. Just remember that the spider can still spit poison at you though. Dodge to the sides when it rears up, as this is the sign that it will spit a glob of poison at you."

Some of those dead bodies will come to life when you pass through. Spiked Door Trap: The first room where you fight draugrs that come to life also has a spiked door trap. Make sure you don't step on the pressure plate that's on the floor or it will activate spiked door trap that will swing out and impale you. Draugrs can also activate this trap, so be careful. Swinging axes: Eventually you will come to a narrow corridor with swinging axes. Watch for the timing of the axes and pass through as quickly as possible in between swings. Frost troll: Eventually you will come to some running water. Follow the running water. Pull the chain next to the gate to open it. Eventually, you will come to a ledge. Look down from the ledge to see a frost troll down below. Use a ranged weapon, such as a bow and arrow to kill the frost troll from above.
