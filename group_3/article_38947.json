Routers and wireless routers enable you to share your broadband internet connection with multiple devices. If your internet provider didn't give you a router/modem combo device, you'll need to connect the router to the modem. For best results, place your router near your modem. Connect one end of an ethernet cable to the modem's LAN port, and the other end into your router's WAN port. Most routers come packaged with a short Ethernet cable that you can use for this. Routers come in all shapes and sizes, so make sure you get what you need by comparing features. If you have more area that you need to cover or have lots of walls in your home, you’ll need a router that offers the option of upgrading antenna(s) with high gain types - if not supplied in the box. If more than one wireless device will be connecting at the same time at different speeds, a MiMo-type router is recommended, otherwise, the speed for all devices will drop to the highest supported by all at that time."

For the purpose of setup, you'll need to connect one end of an ethernet cable to your router's LAN port, and the other end to your computer's LAN/ethernet port. The router will assign a local or \"private\" IP address to any device connected to its LAN Ports or WiFi signal from a pool of private addresses (listed further below). [2] X Research source WAN stands for \"Wide Area Network\" which is what the internet actually is. LAN stands for \"Local Area Network\". All modern routers should support 802.11n, or Wireless-N. This is the most stable, offers the fastest speeds, and is backward compatible with older standards such as 802.11g."

      "content": "Find the IP address of the router. If this is a new installation or new router, find the default IP address that may be printed on a label on the router or in the documentation. [3] X Expert Source Luigi Oppido Computer & Tech Specialist Expert Interview. 31 July 2019. If you can’t find the router’s IP address anywhere, you can do a web search for the router model to see what the default address is. IP addresses are formatted as four groups of up to three digits, separated by periods. Commonly found \"default\" Local IP addresses for routers are 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1, and 10.0.0.1. [4] X Research source"

Your browser will attempt to connect to the router’s configuration menu. [5] X Research source If you can’t figure out the correct IP address, username, or password, search for your router model online to see what the default login is. If it has been changed, press the Reset button on the back of the router for 10 (to 30+ seconds as dictated in the instructions for the router model) to restore factory defaults and try again."

      "title": "Enter your username and password.",
      "content": "Enter your username and password. Most routers have a basic account set up that you will need to use to log on. This varies from model to model but should be printed on the router or in the documentation. [6] X Research source The most typical username is “admin”. The most typical passwords are “admin” and “password”. Many routers will only require a username and a blank password, and some allow you to leave all fields blank."

      "content": "Open Wireless Settings . When you log in to your router, you will be taken to the router’s main menu or status screen, which may look different depending on your router's manufacturer. The \"Internet\" section can usually be left at default settings unless you received specific instructions from your internet service provider. The \"Wireless\" section will allow you to set up your wireless network, so navigate there."

      "content": "Enter a name for your wireless network. In the \"Wireless\" section, you should see a field labeled \"SSID\" or \"Name.\" Enter a unique name for your wireless network. This is what other devices will see when scanning for networks. [7] X Research source Check the box to enable SSID broadcast. This will essentially “turn on” the wireless network so that it may be readily seen by anyone in range of the signal. Leave this unchecked to make your network invisible . Only those who know your network name and password will be able to join."

The changes will be applied to your router, which may take a few moments. Once the router has finished resetting, your wireless network will be enabled. To connect to the wireless network on your phone, tablet, or computer, click your network and enter the password. You can also install a wireless printer so anyone on the network can use it. Connect a PlayStation 3 to a wireless network so you can access the online features. Connect an Xbox 360 to a wireless network so you can access the internet. Connect Apple TV to the wireless network so any network-related features are easier to use."
