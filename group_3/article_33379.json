[1] X Research source Then, Skip-Bo requires a large play surface to hold all the piles of cards, so find a large, round table to play at, or even play on the floor. Shuffle all 162 of the cards together. Split the deck into 2-3 piles, and shuffle those independently to make it easier. Then, swap half of each pile and shuffle those. Finally, combine the piles to create the deck."

If you’re playing with 2-4 players, deal 30 cards to each player, starting with the person on your left and continuing counter-clockwise. If you’re playing with 5-6 people, deal each player 20 cards. Tell everyone to keep their cards face-down. No peeking in Skip-Bo!"

These are the stockpiles. Then, everyone turns over the top card of their pile, placing it face-up on top of the stockpile. [2] X Research source Place the cards that didn’t get dealt face-down in a pile in the center of the table to create a draw pile."

If your starting hand contains either of these 2 cards, or if your face-up card on your stockpile is a Skip-Bo card (which is wild) or a 1, place them in the center of the table to begin the “building” piles. Each building pile must begin with either a Skip-Bo card or a 1, and players share 4 building piles in the center of the table. At the start, there aren’t any building piles. Imagine 4 blank slots in the center of the table, onto which you’ll place your starting cards. If you have neither a Skip-Bo card nor a 1, your turn ends. Discard a card onto the space next to your stockpile to make a discard pile."

In order to play a card onto the pile, the card must be 1 value higher than the top card of the pile. For example, if you started a building pile with a 1, you may only place a 2 on top of it, then a 3, 4, etc. [4] X Research source After you play the top card of the stockpile, flip over the next card and play that one, too, if you can, continuing until you can’t play the topmost card. If you play all 5 cards in your hand, draw 5 more from the draw pile and keep playing your turn."

Place this card next to your stockpile. Each player can have up to 4 of their own discard piles. On your next turn, use the face-up cards in your discard piles to also add onto the building piles. [5] X Research source Place your discarded card onto any of your 4 discard piles you like. These don’t have to follow any particular order. If you discard the last card in your hand, your turn ends, rather than picking up 5 more cards like you would if you simply played your entire hand. Take full advantage of your discard pile.

Skip these if you like, to make your game a bit more laid-back and friendly. But if you’re looking for more of a challenge, incorporate the following into your game: If you accidentally draw too many cards, shuffle all the cards in your hand into your stockpile. Then draw 5 more cards. If you accidentally start your turn when it’s someone else’s turn, that person may let you complete the turn. If they do, and you don’t realize your mistake, you can’t draw new cards on your next turn. In a team game, keep playing until both players on a team have used all of the cards in both of their stockpiles."
