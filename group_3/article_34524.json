      "content": "Know where blueberry bushes produce fruit. Blueberries grow on the side-shoots, off of the main branches of the bushes. [1] X Research source Blueberries only grow on branches that are at least one year old. Branches over four years may have a smaller crop. You must prune the bushes so that they provide enough new growth for blueberry production next year."

      "title": "Understand the importance of pruning.",
      "content": "Understand the importance of pruning. If blueberry bushes are not pruned back every year, they can overproduce in one year. That can lead to the bushes only producing fruit every other year. [2] X Research source You also prune to keep the bush under control, as you don't want it to be too tall. If it's too tall, it will be difficult to harvest the blueberries. [3] X Research source Additionally, you need to thin out the middle so that it can get proper airflow, discouraging disease. Pruning also opens up the middle to sunlight, providing nutrients and ripening the fruit."

      "content": "Train young blueberry bushes. For the first two years of life, you must train your blueberry bushes so that they grow properly. [4] X Research source Remove crossed branches. In the first two years, you need to cut any branches that cross each other. By doing so, you're allow the bush to focus its resources on canes growing straight up, which will be stronger and help you create a better-shaped bush. It will also keep the fruit off the ground.

In the second year, cut away any branches that didn't grow much in the last season. Leave the ones that have grown taller, though you may prune them back some in the next step."

      "content": "Cut away fruit buds. Any time you see a fat fruit bud in the first 2 years, as opposed to the flat buds of the leaves, you need to remove the bud. Cut away any of these buds you see with sharp shears. The bush needs to focus on growing, not producing fruit. [7] X Research source Sometimes flowers might grow from fruit buds that you missed previously. Cut these away as well if you find them."

[8] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source This time of year is best because you can see which new buds will produce fruit (fat buds) and which ones will produce leaves (flat buds).

Dull shears can cause you to use too much pressure, which can lead to injury. It will also make cutting more difficult and may damage your plant. Wear the gloves while pruning to protect your hands."

      "content": "Cut out soft lower twig growth or any growth that looks spindly. That is, cut out growth that doesn't look strong. [12] X Research source Look for growth near the bottom that started late in the previous season, as it will not have had enough time to develop fully. [13] X Research source Remove this late growth near the bottom of the plant, preserving resources for the top of the plant. These twigs are the ones that didn't grow enough in the last season, so they are too small to produce any fruit this year. Additionally, cut out any lower branch that will produce fruit that touches the ground. Fruit should not touch the ground while growing. These will branches that go out at an angle rather than straight up or branches that are bending towards the ground."

[14] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source You can recognize the twiggy growth because it will have an abundance of smaller twigs, more than other branches. Also, the wood that produces this type of growth will not be as shiny as newer wood growth. When cutting, take it back to a place where the branch looks stronger, one that is growing upwards rather than sideways.
