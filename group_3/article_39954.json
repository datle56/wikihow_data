      "content": "Browse pipes. Part of the pleasure of smoking pipes is the ability to create your own perfect experience. Take your time browsing a tobacconist's shop for aesthetically pleasing options. Heft each pipe in your hand — a lightweight pipe is almost always more comfortable. [1] X Research source If you're at a complete loss, ask the employees for recommendations. Even an attractive wooden pipe can have hidden flaws — and probably does if it comes with a low price tag. A corncob pipe is a safer bet if price is your main concern. A metal filter in the stem can absorb moisture and alter flavor. This is a matter of personal preference, and the filter should be removable if you change your mind."

      "title": "Check for mechanical flaws.",
      "content": "Check for mechanical flaws. Nothing disrupts a smoke like a malfunctioning pipe. Avoid frustration with a quick inspection before you buy: [2] X Research source Avoid pipes with walls thinner than ¼ inch (6mm), about the width of a pencil. The base should be at least this thick as well; to measure this, put a straight pipe cleaner down the chamber, pinch it at the top, and then compare this height to the outside wall. Stick a pipe cleaner down the stem. It should run smoothly through and emerge very close to the base of the chamber. Although there are exceptions, thick varnishes may flake and bubble from heat after heavy use."

      "title": "Gather accessories.",
      "content": "Gather accessories. You'll need more than a pipe to start smoking. If you visit a pipe shop, get everything simultaneously to avoid multiple trips and hassle. You'll also need: A lighter or matches. Plastic butane lighters are cheap and plentiful, but some smokers dislike the smell and taste. Pipe lighters are available for various prices, but starting with a good supply of wooden matches might be a good idea. You can always invest in a pipe lighter later. A bundle of pipe cleaners to keep your pipe clean and functioning properly. Pipe tamper. This is used to pack the tobacco in the bowl."

      "title": "Choose a pipe tobacco.",
      "content": "Choose a pipe tobacco. Walking into a tobacco store can be overwhelming at first. Cyprian Latakia? Dutch Cavendish? Fortunately, a quick lesson should be enough for your first purchase. Aromatic blends (sometimes called American) have added flavors. Most beginners prefer these milder, sweeter options. Non-aromatic blends are pure tobacco, typically with a strong, spicy taste. \"English blends\" are non-aromatic blends that include Latakia, a powerful, smoky variety. Any tobacco can go through a \"Cavendish\" process to make it sweeter and lighter. If possible, purchase two or three small sample tins to try various options."

      "content": "Choose a cut of tobacco. Tobacco is sold in various shapes and sizes. There are many cuts and many ways to prepare them, but these are good beginner options: Ribbon-cut tobacco comes in long, thin ribbons, which can be placed directly in the bowl. Flake-cut tobacco comes in thick strips or irregular, broken pieces. Either way, rub it between your fingers until it breaks into small pieces."

      "title": "Set aside 20–40 minutes.",
      "content": "Set aside 20–40 minutes. Pipe smoking is a leisurely activity. Take some time for yourself in a comfortable spot where you won't be disturbed and your smoke won't disturb anyone else. If you're smoking a new briar pipe, smoke indoors away from drafts. Even gentle wind will cause the pipe to burn hotter, which can damage a briar pipe before it's \"broken in.\" [3] X Research source This is unnecessary for most other pipes, including corncob pipes."

      "title": "Bring along a glass of water.",
      "content": "Bring along a glass of water. A drink on hand keeps your mouth and throat from drying out and may prevent a sore tongue. Some people enjoy pairing pipes with coffee or tea instead, but wait on that until you are more experienced and can choose a good pairing. Drinking alcohol before or during smoking is not recommended, since it greatly increases smoke-related cancer risk."

      "title": "Fill the pipe in three pinches.",
      "content": "Fill the pipe in three pinches. Correct packing takes practice and has a major impact on your enjoyment. The tobacco should be loose enough to draw air through it easily, and springy to the touch. Have an experienced smoker show you what to do, or use this beginner-friendly method: Drop a tiny pinch of tobacco in the chamber. Tamp this lightly or not at all, leaving plenty of air between the leaves. Add a slightly larger pinch, tamping lightly until the bowl is half-filled. Finish with a third pinch, tamping with more pressure until a gap of ¼ inch (0.6mm) above the tobacco. Note — when breaking in a new briar pipe, many people fill to ⅓ or ½ the depth described here, the first few smokes. This helps form a protective cake of charcoal, although not all smokers agree with this approach. [5] X Research source [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Light the pipe with a wooden match or a pipe lighter.",
      "content": "Light the pipe with a wooden match or a pipe lighter. If using a match, let the sulfur burn off for a few seconds first to avoid getting a mouthful of match taste. Move the flame around the surface of the tobacco while drawing on the mouthpiece with long, even draws. Many pipe smokers prefer to light the pipe once, then tamp down the ash, extinguishing the embers to give the tobacco a flat surface. This is called a \"false light\" - it's an optional step, but tends to help the tobacco burn more evenly and require fewer relights later. After tamping, relight the pipe as described above. If the pipe goes out immediately, which is common, tamp it down gently and light it the same way."

      "title": "Smoke with small, occasional draws.",
      "content": "Smoke with small, occasional draws. Most pipe smokers draw smoke into their mouth by sucking gently, or moving their tongue back along the palate. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Some beginners and cigarette smokers inhale instead, but it's best to keep the smoke in your mouth, not your lungs. Hold the pipe bowl in your hand as you smoke for the first time. Draw often enough to keep the pipe lit, without making the pipe too hot to hold. A minority of pipe smokers do enjoy the occasional inhale, which gives more of a nicotine buzz. Pipe smoke is much stronger and thicker than a cigarette, so stick with a gentle pull and limit yourself to one or two inhales per bowl. Avoiding inhalation does make lung cancer less likely, but there is still a high risk of oral cancers from long-term use. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Tamp and relight as necessary.",
      "content": "Tamp and relight as necessary. If the pipe goes out, tamp again and relight. The ash surface is beneficial, and there's no need to dump it until it's thick enough to prevent lighting. Tap about half of the ash when this happens by knocking the pipe against a cork knocker, your hand, or another soft object."

      "title": "Maintain the bowl.",
      "content": "Maintain the bowl. There are two different approaches for this, based on the type of pipe: Briar pipes need a charcoal buildup (a \"cake\") to protect the wood. Cover the bowl and shake the ash around to loosen it and distribute it around the pipe's bowl. With your finger, rub the ash into the walls of the bowl. Dump the remnants out. [9] X Research source Most smokers prefer that other pipes be kept clean. Shake out the ash, then wipe the bowl with a paper towel or pipe cleaner. (Meerschaum pipes especially should never be allowed to cake heavily.)"

      "content": "Leave the pipe alone for a day or two. This gives time for the moisture in the pipe to evaporate, preventing difficult draws and gurgling noises. If you want to smoke more often, add a second pipe to your collection. You can leave a pipe cleaner in the pipe to absorb any remaining moisture as it rests."

    {
      "title": "Swab with alcohol after a few smokes.",
      "content": "Swab with alcohol after a few smokes. A pipe cleaner or cotton swab dipped in alcohol will remove gunk that can block airflow or affect flavor. If using a kind of alcohol that's poisonous to drink, such as rubbing alcohol, be sure to let the pipe rest for 24 hours to allow the alcohol to evaporate fully. Any high-percentage spirit can be used, but neutral tasting spirits such as grain alcohol or vodka are best. Follow it with a dry pipe cleaner to remove the moisture. Be careful not to get any alcohol on the finished surfaces of the pipe, as it can remove the finish. Some pipe cleaners do this after each smoke, and others don't bother with it. If you stick with the habit, ask a fellow smoker for help identifying the signs of a dirty pipe."
