      "content": "Henna powder Henna is a natural dye that can darken your hair with a reddish hue. Depending on your natural hair color, you can turn your hair a rich brown or copper with this method. Henna is a great way to conceal gray hair or add richness to dull hair. [4] X Research source How to use : Follow the powder’s instructions to create a henna paste. Some powders require the paste to sit for several hours before applying, so plan ahead. Divide your hair into sections. Aim to have at least 6: 2 at the nape of your neck, 2 near the center of your head, and 2 at the top. Apply the henna paste to your hair section by section with gloved hands or a hair dye brush. Wrap your head in plastic wrap or a shower cap. Let the henna sit in your hair as long as the product instructs. Wash out the henna until the water runs clear. Repeat the process when the color fades, giving yourself 1 to 2 weeks of time between treatments. [5] X Research source Pro tip: Consider using indigo powder dye after a henna treatment to add more black into your hair. Simply follow the instructions on the back of the natural dye, similar to the henna. Safety: Ritzman advises to check the ingredients list on henna products, as some manufacturers combine the natural powder with harmful chemicals. Beware that henna is very potent and can stain your skin, shower, and sheets."

      "content": "Mustard oil While there’s little scientific evidence to back up this claim, mustard oil is believed to help hair grow and darken hair naturally. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This is because mustard oil is a natural stimulant that improves blood circulation. When used on the scalp, it could strengthen hair follicles and potentially darken them. How to use: Warm up the mustard oil in the microwave or on the stovetop to be slightly warmer than room temperature. Apply the oil to your hair using your fingers or a hair dye brush , starting at the ends and working your way up. Massage the oil into your scalp, and ensure it’s evenly distributed. Wrap your hair in a shower cap and wait at least 2 hours. Wash your hair with a mild shampoo until it no longer feels oily. Repeat this process up to 3 times a week for the best results. Safety: Be sure to purchase the cooking oil, not the essential oil; essential mustard oil can irritate the skin. Stop using the oil immediately if you experience any skin irritation. Note that mustard oil is for external use only.
