      "title": "Choose a solid reason for wanting some alone time in your room.",
      "content": "Choose a solid reason for wanting some alone time in your room. The whole point here is to wear your birthday suit without anyone knowing, but if someone bangs on your door or calls your name, what are you going to say? If you don’t have a good excuse ready to fire off immediately, people may think you’re up to something. You could say that you’ve got a tough school assignment to work on and you want to focus. Keep a few books open on your bed or desk if you go this route to prove you’re learning. You might explain that you had a rough day and want some alone time. Walk into your home pouting and a little sad if you really want to sell this one. Maybe you’re just super tired and need a nap! Tell everyone you’re going to catch some Zs when you walk in the door."

      "title": "Don’t let parents, roommates, or neighbors peep on you.",
      "content": "Don’t let parents, roommates, or neighbors peep on you. Shut the door to your room quietly. Draw the curtains or close the blinds so that no peeping Toms can peer in through the window. Doing this in the privacy of your room is the best way to be respectful and safe. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Prevent people from busting in randomly without knocking.",
      "content": "Prevent people from busting in randomly without knocking. Even if your housemates don’t have a reputation for bursting in unannounced, it’s always better to be safe than sorry. Lock your bedroom door. If you don’t have a lock, stuff a sturdy chair underneath the knob at an angle or place a heavy item in front of the door. [2] X Research source If you have a doorstop, you can use that to pin the door in place. However, you can see doorstops from the other side of your room, so it may make people suspicious."

      "title": "An emergency outfit will make it easy to get dressed if necessary.",
      "content": "An emergency outfit will make it easy to get dressed if necessary. Keep some shorts and a T-shirt nearby just in case your family or roommates decide that they’re going to show up announced and insist on talking right now . If you get a loud knock or hear your name, toss the clothes on quickly to open the door. Nobody will be the wiser. Choose clothes that are super loose and easy to throw on. You may not have the time to throw on those super tight jeans or that button-up shirt."

      "title": "Do whatever you’d normally do in your room when you’re clothed.",
      "content": "Do whatever you’d normally do in your room when you’re clothed. The fact that you’re in the nude shouldn’t automatically mean you need to change anything about who you are or what you do. Many naturists and nudists find the lack of clothing simply enhances the way they feel about their normal daily chores. Put laundry away, do your homework, clean your room, listen to music, and treat this like any other normal day. [3] X Research source If you’re new to naturalism/nudism, check in with yourself periodically to see how you’re feeling. Does the lack of clothing change anything? Are you happier? More comfortable? All of these questions are a part of growing closer to your body and learning more about how you feel about your body."

      "title": "Nudity is an opportunity to explore your relationship to your body.",
      "content": "Nudity is an opportunity to explore your relationship to your body. This is an opportunity to challenge any shame or embarrassment you feel about the way you look. Part of what makes naturism so attractive to people is that it removes all of the judgement from the way you look! Appreciate your body and take it all in. Love who you are and what your body does for you as you go about your day. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Clothing is all about covering up. Naturism is all about trying to shake off all of the secondary emotions that come with that covering up. Take note of how you feel when you shed your clothes and ask yourself what’s driving those feelings!"

      "title": "Shedding your clothes may make you more productive.",
      "content": "Shedding your clothes may make you more productive. There’s some evidence that taking your clothes off can make you more energetic and focused. By losing your clothing, you’re shedding the inhibitions that could be keeping you from being your best. Try getting some schoolwork done, or tackle that big work project you’ve been putting off. You may find it a lot easier to get something done. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Alone time is always a great opportunity for some self-care. Read a book, meditate, do some yoga, or play some video games. Whatever it is that helps you decompress after a long week, do that. You may find it even more relaxing than you normally do with your clothing off. [6] X Research source Let go of any expectations or requirements for yourself. Simply enjoy being you in your natural state! Relish in the freedom and open feeling of being clothing-free."

      "title": "Nothing’s better than sleeping in the nude if you need rest.",
      "content": "Nothing’s better than sleeping in the nude if you need rest. There’s a reason so many people sleep naked. Shedding the clothes makes it a lot easier for your body to cool off while you snooze, so any sleep you get is likely going to be way more restorative than it normally is. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Just make sure you set an alarm if your parents or roommates might need you soon. You don’t want to fall into a deep sleep naked only for someone to bang on your door looking for you!"
