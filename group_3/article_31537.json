      "content": "Feats are special talents that give D&D characters extra abilities. The basic concept for feats is that a character can gain new powers and mechanical perks based on their specialized skills. Over time, as characters gain more experience, they also gain new capabilities—allowing them to pick additional feats as they level up. The 2024 rule update splits feats into four distinct categories: [1] X Research source Origin feats . Origin feats are automatically given to characters when they’re first created based on background. General feats . General feats can be taken starting at level 4. Some have prerequisites, while others can be taken by any character. Epic boon feats . Epic boons are especially powerful feats given to level 19 characters, designed to boost their ability scores and grant unique abilities. Fighting style feats . These are specialized feats only available to characters with the Fighting Style trait (which is given to the fighter, paladin, and ranger classes)."

      "content": "Feats are now part of the official D&D rules (rather than optional). Although many 5e players used feats as though they were official, the 2014 rules classified them as totally optional mechanics. The 2024 D&D rules make feats an official part of gaining levels (meaning all players using this ruleset will use them). [2] X Research source Beyond that, feats in the 2024 rules work very similarly to the original 2014 rules, granting player characters (PCs) special new abilities and perks upon leveling up. Many feats and their benefits have also been revised in the D&D 2024 rules (and are described below)."

      "content": "All general feats grant an ability score increase. Under the old 2014 rules, some feats offered minor ability score improvements, and others didn’t, focusing instead on granting characters unique extra abilities and mechanical features. The 2024 rules standardize general feats a bit more; they’re all available starting at level 4 and offer both a mechanical perk and a +1 bonus to one ability score. [3] X Research source However, ability score increases are locked based on your chosen feat. In other words, each feat dictates which ability score will increase (or which ability scores you can choose to increase). The new 2024 rules also allow you to pick certain feats twice as long as you meet their original requirements."

In the new 2024 rules, epic boons are now an official rule and categorized as a type of feat—meaning all players can use them at level 19. They’re stronger than general feats, but that’s by design since they represent PCs reaching nearly the highest level possible (level 20). [4] X Research source"
