      "title": "Place a paper in landscape orientation, then fold it in half horizontally.",
      "content": "Place a paper in landscape orientation, then fold it in half horizontally. Use US Letter size paper (11 x 8.5”) or A5 (21 x 29.7 cm) printer paper. Set the piece of paper on a flat surface in front of you so the long edges are on the sides. Fold the paper in half lengthwise so it looks like a hot dog bun. Make sure the edges and corners line up before you crease your fold. [1] X Research source As you make each fold, run your fingernail or a creasing tool, such as a bone folder, along the crease. This will make each fold sharp and crisp, giving a clean, professional-finished shape."

    {
      "title": "Bring to top right corner toward the left side of the paper.",
      "content": "Bring to top right corner toward the left side of the paper. Make sure your piece of paper is vertical before moving on. Grab the top right corner and fold it toward you. Line up the top edge with the left side of the paper underneath. Press along the folded edge to crease it. Your piece of paper should look like a rectangle with a triangle on top. [2] X Research source Take your time to make sure the edges are lined up when you fold your paper. If you crease the paper and the edges are misaligned, your spaceship may not fold together as easily."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the point on the top left toward the top right corner.",
      "content": "Fold the point on the top left toward the top right corner. Take the top corner of the triangle and fold it over onto the piece of paper. Line up the folded corner with the top right corner to make a smaller triangle. Press down along the fold to make a crease. [3] X Research source The edge that you folded over should form a straight line on the bottom of the triangle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn your paper and repeat the folds on the other side.",
      "content": "Turn your paper and repeat the folds on the other side. Rotate the paper 180-degrees so the triangle you just made points toward you. Fold the top right corner so the edge lines up with the left side of the paper. Then, fold the point of the triangle down so it’s lined up with the top right corner. Make sure to press along the folds to crease them. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Unfold the paper to reveal the creases.",
      "content": "Unfold the paper to reveal the creases. Undo the triangles you just made and flatten the paper out again. You should see creases forming an X-shape on each side of the paper. [5] X Research source If the creases aren’t visible, try folding the paper again and press down harder along the edges."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pinch the sides of each X to form triangle bases.",
      "content": "Pinch the sides of each X to form triangle bases. With the piece of paper vertical, grab the left and right sides of the creases with your thumb and index finger. Pinch your fingers together and pull the top edge of the paper over them. As you fold, the sides will collapse inside and a triangle. Turn the paper around and do the same to the other side. [6] X Research source If you have trouble pinching the sides in, fold the top edge of the paper so the crease goes through the center of the X. Unfold the paper and try pinching it again."

    {
      "title": "Fold the 2 sides on one triangle toward the center.",
      "content": "Fold the 2 sides on one triangle toward the center. Position the paper on your table so the triangle on the bottom is pointing toward you. Take the left corner of the top triangle and fold it over so the edge lines up with the point in the middle. Repeat the process with the right corner of the triangle to make a diamond shape. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Flip the paper over and fold the long sides onto the center.",
      "content": "Flip the paper over and fold the long sides onto the center. Turn your paper over so your folds are face down. Grab the long edge of the paper and fold it so it lines up with the top point of the triangle. Press the fold firmly to form a crease. Take the opposite side of the paper and fold the edge so it lines up in the center. Each fold should look like a long trapezoid. [8] X Research source Don’t fold over the corners of the other triangle."

    {
      "title": "Turn over the paper and bring the triangle base toward the diamond shape.",
      "content": "Turn over the paper and bring the triangle base toward the diamond shape. When you’re finished folding the bottom of the paper, flip it over so the triangles are face up. Bend the triangle over the top until the point of the triangle is about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) from the bottom of the diamond. Crease the fold so it stays in place. [9] X Research source If the fold doesn’t want to stay after you press with your finger, try going over it again with your thumbnail or the side of a pen to flatten it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tuck the folds of the diamond shape in between the triangle base.",
      "content": "Tuck the folds of the diamond shape in between the triangle base. There should be a fold between the top and bottom triangle you just folded over. Lift open the flaps of the diamond shape and put their corners into the fold between your triangles. This will help hold your origami spaceship together and adds a cool angular design.

      "title": "Fold the edges of the top-most piece to make the windows of your spaceship.",
      "content": "Fold the edges of the top-most piece to make the windows of your spaceship. Take one of the edges of the triangle that’s on top of the spaceship and fold it so it lines up with the point. Crease the paper slightly so it comes up at a slight angle. Fold the other side of the top triangle so the center edges are aligned. [11] X Research source These folds will look like windows on your spaceship’s cockpit."

      "title": "Bend the tips of the wings up.",
      "content": "Bend the tips of the wings up. Locate the 2 wings on the back of the ship. Grab the end of the wing and fold it back about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm). Make sure the back edge stays lined up so the folds form triangles. Repeat the process on the other side to add points to your wings and make your spaceship look faster. [12] X Research source You can also keep the wings straight if you want."
