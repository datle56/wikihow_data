      "content": "Unplug the dishwasher from the outlet for 1 to 5 minutes. Just like turning a computer on and off can work out bugs, disconnecting your dishwasher from power can fix it if it’s not responding to your controls. Just unplug the dishwasher from the outlet and leave it for 1 to 5 minutes to reset. [1] X Research source It won’t hurt anything if you leave the dishwasher unplugged for a longer amount of time."

      "content": "Reconnect the dishwasher and check the control panel for errors. When the 1 to 5 minutes are up, plug the dishwasher back into the outlet or turn the breaker back on. Then, look at the display panel to see if there are any flashing lights or error codes. This tells you if there is a larger problem with your dishwasher. [2] X Research source It might take your dishwasher 5 to 10 minutes to reset and run its diagnostics test. If an error code is on the display, look it up in your dishwasher’s user manual to see how to fix it. If there are no flashing lights or error codes, skip to the next step to give your dishwasher a test run."

      "title": "Run a test cycle to see if the problem is fixed.",
      "content": "Run a test cycle to see if the problem is fixed. Press “Heat dry,” “Normal,” “Heat dry,” “Normal.” When the lights on the display illuminate, press “Start.” This takes your dishwasher through a test cycle so you can make sure everything is working as it should. [3] X Research source If your dishwasher still isn’t working, reset the control panel using the instructions below. For some dishwashers, you press the first 3 buttons starting on the left side of the panel in a 1-2-3 sequence to start the test cycle. Repeat the 1-2-3 sequence 3 times and then press “Start” to trigger the cycle."

    {
      "title": "Press the “Hi-temp” and “Dry” buttons 5 times.",
      "content": "Press the “Hi-temp” and “Dry” buttons 5 times. If disconnecting the dishwasher from power doesn’t fix your issue, reset the control panel. Just make sure the dishwasher’s door is completely closed and latched. Then, press the “Hi-temp scrub” and “Energy saver dry” buttons one after the other until you push each button 5 times. [4] X Research source On some machines, the buttons are called “Hi-temp,” “Heated dry,” or another similar name. Just press the buttons that have the most similar functions. Some models reset after each button has been pushed 4 times instead of 5, but just go ahead and press each one 5 times. Note : Resetting the control panel gives the dishwasher’s computer a reboot, which often clears away any programming or user errors. If the problem is related to an actual broken part in the machine, though, it might not fix your dishwasher."
