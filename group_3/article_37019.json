Press T to switch to the text tool, then click on the text in the image to rewrite it. Single color background — If the text is on a background that’s one solid color, you can use the Eyedropper tool to select the background color, then use the Brush tool to paint over the text. Complex background — If the text is on a complicated, busy background, you’ll need to use a more advanced Photoshop tool. The rest of this tutorial focuses on complex backgrounds.
