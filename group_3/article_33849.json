      "content": "Know the context of the Lord’s prayer. This prayer is directed toward God; however, Jesus in John 10:30 says “I and my Father are one”. The Lord’s prayer is found in Matthew 5-7. These passages also contain the Sermon on the Mount and Beatitudes (blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted). The sermon on the mount is about the importance of God’s place in the inner life as opposed to doing religion for appearances. Jesus condemns the religious officials who have been showing off their righteousness in public. Jesus says true righteousness belongs to those who are the lowest: those who mourn, those who are poor, those who are meek, even though they do not give the appearance of righteousness. [2] X Research source For example, Jesus says in Matthew 6:5 “Whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray while standing in synagogues and on street corners so that people can see them.\""

      "content": "Try praying in your room with the door shut. This is one of Jesus’ instructions in Matthew 6:6 on how to pray. Jesus goes on to say, “And your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.” Find a room or a private space where you can be alone, and pray to God there. Feel comforted by the presence of God \"who sees in secret.” This is not the only place you can pray. You can also “pray without ceasing” (wherever you may be you can be prayerful) as Paul writes in 1 Thessalonians. [3] X Expert Source Zachary Rainey Ordained Minister Expert Interview. 19 May 2019. Paul also described speaking in tongues as a good way to pray. He said, \"I thank God that I speak in tongues more than you all\" 1 Corinthians 14:18.(See also 1 Corinthians 14:2,4-5, and14-15) [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep the recitation of the Lord's prayer concise. Jesus in Matthew 6:7 says “When you pray, do not babble repetitiously like the Gentiles, because they think that that by their many words they will be heard.” During this time people may have been praying using certain rituals, recitations, and incantations, but you do not need these to pray to Jesus. Additionally, you do not need to talk about your problems when you recite the Lord’s prayer. When you pray in general, or at a different time, you can talk to Jesus about your problems. Jesus follows up the previous verse with this warning in verse 8, “Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.\""

      "title": "Meditate on the Lord’s prayer.",
      "content": "Meditate on the Lord’s prayer. [5] X Expert Source Zachary Rainey Ordained Minister Expert Interview. 19 May 2019. You can read the Lord’s prayer out loud or to yourself. Read it slowly so that the meaning of each verse can sink in. Jesus said in Matthew 6:9-13, Pray, then in this way: Our Father who is in heaven, hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil. [For yours is the kingdom and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.] [6] X Research source “Our Father who is in heaven, Hallowed be thy name” helps you direct your attention to God who is beyond your ability to see or comprehend. ”Your kingdom come; your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven” helps you form an attitude of willingness toward taking part in what is being done on earth and engaging with the world around you. ”Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors” means that you rely on the goodness of God to provide for you the things you need. You also let go of the things that needy people owe to you, thus you should not demand to receive payment. Not forgiving debts of the poor displeases God, for you were forgiven a debt of sin you could never pay. “Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil” could mean different things for different people. Not everyone shares the same things they do that they wish they would not do. However, whatever things you struggle with, ask for God’s help to overcome those things. “For yours is the kingdom and power and glory forever” is not found in early manuscripts; however, it can give closure to your prayer and refocus you on the awe inspiring nature of God."

For example, in Psalm 4 the Psalmist asks that God to give him relief for his distress."

      "content": "Assure yourself that Jesus loves you. Remember that God made you in His image, and Jesus loves and His Spirit accompanies you on your journey. He wanted you to choose to repent, to seek to please God and acknowledge Him in all you do, just the way you are: Free to choose to follow His plan to be saved. When you are having a hard time loving yourself, remind yourself that Jesus came to this earth and died, in part, because of His great love for you.

      "content": "Understand the difficult things that have happened to you in a new light. In your prayers to Jesus, you have an opportunity to reconsider why things have happened to you. Perhaps when you reconsider your circumstances you will be better able to understand how God could be using something bad in your life for good. [11] X Research source For example, although you have lost your job, you have been able to spend a lot more time with your kids. Consider the beatitudes. Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:1-12) says that “Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth”."

      "content": "Concentrate on your connection to Jesus in tough moments. Going to Jesus in prayer when you are going through a hard moment can help shield you from the negative emotions that you are experiencing. For example, if someone you love is sick or in surgery, you may need to take a moment and refocus on Jesus and take comfort in his presence and strength. [12] X Research source Although you should use Jesus as a support, continue to support others and allow other people you are with to support you as well. Continue to stay present with your loved ones and share with them the routine, the joy and pain of what they or you are experiencing."

      "content": "Think about how Jesus would handle the situation you are in. [13] X Research source It can be helpful to use the model of Jesus and his practices of love and compassionate to help give you the understanding you need to face your life. While you pray about the situations in your life, consider the ways Jesus would respond. If you are having difficulty at work with someone who interrupted your career (such as by receiving the promotion you desired/deserved), you can think about Jesus-like responses to the situation. For example, in Luke 6:27, Jesus says “But I say to you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you .”"

      "content": "Try letting your thumb and each of your fingers of either hand represent an important part of life that needs attention in prayer. Pray for your family, your teachers, your government officials, the poor, and yourself. [20] X Research source The thumb can represent your family and the close relationships that are your supports. It is the most sturdy finger, and that is why it represents the family. The index finger, as a pointing finger, can be the finger that represents guidance in your life, or it might stand for those who show you the way and help you. For example, this could be bosses, pastors, teachers, mentors, friends, and even those who provide you health care like your doctors and nurses.. The middle finger is the tallest finger on your hand, and it can be used to remind you to pray for the people in power in your country and in the world: government officials, world leaders, politicians, etc. The ring finger is the weakest finger and therefore may remind you to pray for those who are people who are suffering from poverty and any ailments they do not wish to have. The last, smallest finger represents yourself. Don't forget to pray for yourself."

      "content": "Experiment with ways to pray that work the best for you. Use objects or play music to help focus you on your prayer. For example, pray while looking at a beautiful painting, if you are a visual person. You can also read a book on prayer or write in a journal. Don’t try to fit yourself into any container of what you think a prayer should be. Perhaps you need to be doing something with your hands while you pray. You can use rosary beads and repeat prayers for each bead, or you can doodle flowers in your notebook as you pray. [21] X Research source You can also sing your prayers. Doing this is joyful and helps you express your feelings outwardly."
