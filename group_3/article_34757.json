      "title": "Turn off the engine and open the hood to find your AC compressor.",
      "content": "Turn off the engine and open the hood to find your AC compressor. Open the hood and look on the left side near the front of the vehicle for your AC compressor. Look for a silver metal cylinder with belts, tubes, and wiring connected to it. Check behind the large hoses that may be obstructing your view of the compressor. [1] X Research source If you can’t find your AC compressor, check your owner’s manual or look up the make and model of your vehicle online to identify its location. Park the vehicle on level ground and make sure the parking brake is engaged. You could potentially shock yourself if the engine is active while you’re removing the compressor."

      "content": "Jack up your vehicle and remove the tire near the compressor. Use a vehicle jack and place it beneath a jack point on the vehicle’s frame, near the front tire. Remove the tire with a tire iron and set it aside to expose the AC compressor. [2] X Research source You should be able to see the protective covering of the compressor in the engine above the tire well."

      "title": "Take off the protective covering by removing the mounting bolts.",
      "content": "Take off the protective covering by removing the mounting bolts. Use a socket wrench to unscrew the mounting bolts on the protective covering over the AC compressor. Take the covering off of the vehicle and set it aside so you can reinstall it later. [3] X Research source Keep the bolts together in a plastic bag so you don’t lose any of them."

      "title": "Loosen the nut on the belt and slide the belt off of the compressor.",
      "content": "Loosen the nut on the belt and slide the belt off of the compressor. On the compressor, you’ll see a belt and pulley system. Use a wrench to loosen the nut on the outside of the pulley so you can loosen the belt. Slide the belt off of the side of the pulley so you can easily replace it later. [4] X Research source Don’t remove the nut from the pulley. Loosen it just enough to loosen the belt."

      "title": "Disconnect the wire connector from the compressor.",
      "content": "Disconnect the wire connector from the compressor. The compressor will have a plastic wire connected to it as a power supply. Grip the connection point where the wire is plugged into the compressor and pull it off to disconnect it. [5] X Research source Allow the wire to hang loosely from the vehicle so you can reconnect it later. You may need to press on a plastic tab at the connection point to separate the wire."

      "title": "Remove the pressure lines by unscrewing the bolts holding them.",
      "content": "Remove the pressure lines by unscrewing the bolts holding them. The high- and low-pressure lines are the 2 lines coming out of the back of the compressor. The larger line is the low-pressure line and the thin line is the high-pressure line. Remove the bolts that connect the pressure lines to your compressor and separate them from the valves on the compressor. [6] X Research source The pressure lines will remain sealed until you open them, but the freon must be captured in order to prevent it from being released when you remove the compressor."

      "title": "Connect a reclaimer machine to the valves on the compressor.",
      "content": "Connect a reclaimer machine to the valves on the compressor. A reclaimer machine is a device used to release the pressure in the compressor and capture the freon so it doesn’t escape into the atmosphere. Connect the 2 valves from the reclaimer machine to the high and low-pressure valves on the compressor by raising the tab on the machine’s valves, sliding them onto the pressure valves, then pushing them closed. [7] X Research source The high-pressure valve will be larger than the low-pressure valve. The pressure valves on the compressor are sealed until you open them with the valve of the reclaimer machine. You can find reclaimer machines at auto repair shops. Reclaimer machines can cost between $400-$1,000."

Then, turn on the machine to capture the freon from the compressor. Allow the machine to run until the pressure gauges read that the compressor is empty. Turn off the machine, close the valves, and disconnect them from the compressor. [8] X Research source The freon will be stored in an internal tank on the reclaimer machine so you can refill your compressor later."

With all of the lines, wires, and belts disconnected, use a wrench to unscrew the 4 mounting bolts that connect the compressor to the vehicle. Pull out the compressor from either the top of the engine or from beneath it, depending on your vehicle’s design. [9] X Research source Keep the bolts organized together so you don’t lose them and can easily replace them later."

Make sure absolutely all of the oil is drained from the compressor. [11] X Research source Adding new oil to a compressor that still contains oil can cause an overflow, which may damage the compressor or cause it to malfunction when you reinstall it."

Make sure you purchase the oil specified by the manufacturers. For example, your AC compressor may require R134a refrigerant oil rather than PAG 46 oil. Putting the wrong oil in your compressor will damage it. If you don’t have the owner’s manual, look up the make and model of your vehicle online to find information about your AC compressor."

Insert a funnel that fits into the opening and slowly pour the recommended amount and type of oil. Then, screw the rear cap on tightly and use a wrench to tighten it further so it’s secure. [13] X Research source Pour the oil slowly to reduce the chances of spilling it. Don’t add any extra oil, even if the compressor doesn’t seem full."
