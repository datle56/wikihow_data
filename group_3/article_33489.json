      "title": "Use monster cards.",
      "content": "Use monster cards. Monster cards are summoned to attack your opponent’s Life Points and defend your own. They are usually orange (effect) or yellow (normal) in color, but there are many other colors as well. Monsters have levels, ranging from 1-12, which are indicated by the stars along the top, and a symbol in the top right corner indicating Attribute. Above the card text, the Type, the kind of monster, and monster abilities such as Tuner or Flip are written in bold. The Attack and Defense stats are listed as ATK and DEF along the bottom. [1] X Research source Effect monsters have effects which affect the game, but normal monsters only have lore. Effect Monsters are the most commonly used type of monster, as their effects can be quite powerful. Normal monsters are not as useful, but have some good support and are used in certain types of decks. Extra Deck monsters without an effect are Non-Effect Monsters, neither Normal nor Effect monsters. Tokens are a type of monster summoned by an effect. They can be represented by anything small that can indicate attack and defense position. Token cards cannot be in either deck, and can only exist face-up on the field. Therefore they can't be sent to Graveyard or banished for cost, flipped face-down, or become Xyz Material. They are treated as Normal monsters, and are given their name, attack, defense, level, attribute, and type by the card used to summon them. Official Token cards are gray. Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and Link monsters cannot exist in the hand or deck, and must go in the Extra Deck. Xyz monsters have black backgrounds, and Ranks instead of Levels. Synchro monsters are white, Fusion monsters are violet, and Link monsters are blue with a hex background. They each have their own specific summoning methods and must first be Special Summoned using that method before they can be summoned any other way (revived from the Graveyard, etc.). Some of these monsters have special requirements for the monsters used to summon them (known as the materials), which are written on the first line of the text. Ritual monsters are blue, and also cannot be summoned unless they are first Ritual Summoned. Most of them are summoned with a specific Spell. Pendulum monsters can be any type of monster, and their background color fades to the green color of spell cards on the bottom half of the card. Above the card text, there is a box which contains that card's Pendulum Effects and has the Pendulum Scales on each side. A Pendulum monster can be activated from the hand as a spell card in the left- and right-most Spell/Trap Zones, which become Pendulum Zones while a Pendulum card is placed in them. Unlike Field Spells, Pendulum cards cannot be replaced by putting another Pendulum monster in the same zone. When a Pendulum monster would be sent from the field to the graveyard, it is placed face-up on top of the Extra Deck instead, where it can be resummoned to the field. If you have a Pendulum monster in both Pendulum Zones, you can perform a Pendulum Summon (more on that later). Possible monster abilities are Tuner, Spirit, Gemini, Flip, Union, and Toon. Tuner monsters are necessary for Synchro Summons. The other types are self-explanatory."

      "title": "Summon your monster to the field.",
      "content": "Summon your monster to the field. A summons is a way to place a monster onto your field. There are three main types of summons: Normal, Special, and Flip. A Normal Summon can be done once per turn, and there is no limit on Special Summons. You can Normal Summon a monster from your hand in face-up Attack Position or face-down Defense Position (called a Normal Set). Level 4 or lower monsters do not require tributes, but for higher level monsters, you will need to send monsters from your field to the graveyard. Levels 5 and 6 require one tribute, and Levels 7 and higher require two. A Normal Summon involving tributes is also called a Tribute Summon. A face-down monster is not revealed to your opponent. While face-down, it has no name, attribute, stats, etc. It can be flipped face up by manually changing it to Attack Position (called a Flip Summon), by an effect, or when it is attacked. A face-up monster cannot be flipped face-down, except by effect."

      "title": "Use special summoning:",
      "content": "Use special summoning: Special summons are done by card effect or as a game mechanic. A monster cannot normally be special summoned face-down, but can be summoned in either attack or defense position. The following are types of special summons. A Fusion summon is usually done by using a Fusion Spell card (like Polymerization) and sending the monsters listed on the Fusion monster to the graveyard. Certain Fusion monsters do not require Fusion spell cards (unofficially called Contact Fusion monsters). Fusion Materials are usually quite specific. A Synchro summon is done by sending a Tuner monster and 1 or more non-tuner monsters from your field to the Graveyard, and special summoning a Synchro monster from your Extra Deck whose level exactly matches the combined levels of the material monsters. An Xyz summon is done by taking two or more monsters on your field with the same level and stacking them on top of each other, then stacking an Xyz monster with the same Rank on top. The monsters on the bottom are now called Xyz Materials, and are not treated as being on the field. Most Xyz monsters have effects that are activated by detaching Xyz Materials (sending them to the Graveyard). If an Xyz monster leaves the field or ceases being treated as a monster, its Xyz Materials go to the Graveyard. A Ritual summon is usually done by using the specific Ritual Spell card, tributing a number of monsters whose levels equal the Ritual monster’s level, and special summoning the Ritual monster from your hand. There are exceptions - read your Ritual Spells. A Pendulum summon can be done if you have a Pendulum monster in both of your Pendulum Zones. You can Special summon any number of monsters in your hand and face-up on top of your Extra Deck, if their levels are between the Pendulum Scales of the two Pendulum monsters (they cannot equal the Pendulum Scales). You can only perform a Pendulum Summon once per turn. A Link summon is done by sending material monsters from your field to the Graveyard which fulfill the Link's requirements. You must use a number of materials equal to the Link monster's Link Rating - the number on the bottom right corner. If a Link monster is used as Link material, it can be treated as a single monster, or as a number of materials equal to its Link Rating. Link monsters have no Level or DEF, and cannot be changed to Defense Position by any means. It has orange arrows surrounding the card art, the number of arrows being equal to the Link Rating, which point to Monster Zones around it. Extra Deck monsters can be summoned to zones a Link Monster points to."

Any Summon from the Extra Deck must go to an Extra Monster Zone. Anything that is not a Summon from the Extra Deck - this includes temporary banishing, control change, and returning from control change - must go to a Main Monster Zone. Once you summon to one of the two Extra Monster Zones, it's yours for the rest of the Duel, and the other one automatically belongs to your opponent."

There are six different types of spells, and spells other than normal spells will have an icon at the top right near the bold text indicating their type. Normal Spell cards are played from the hand onto a S/T zone on the field, and after their effect is applied, they are sent to the graveyard. Continuous spell cards have a ∞ symbol. After they are played onto the field, they stay there unless removed in some way, and their effects are applied as long as they are on the field. Quick-Play Spells have a lightning bolt symbol. They can be played during any part of your turn, and, if set, during your opponent's turn. Field spells have a four-pointed star, and go in the Field Spell Zone when activated or set. Field spells affect the whole field, and stay there unless removed. If you activate a new Field Spell while you already control one in your Field Spell Zone, the previous one is destroyed. Both players can control a Field Spell at the same time. Equip spells have a plus symbol. When activated, they are equipped onto a face-up monster on the field, and remain on the field unless removed. An Equip Spell Card is destroyed if the monster is no longer face-up on the field or is no longer a valid target. Ritual Spell cards are indicated by a flame, and are used in the Ritual Summoning of a Ritual Monster. They work like Normal Spells, and usually require tributes from the field to summon the specified monster from the hand."

Normal Traps can be flipped face-up when you want to use them, and when any activation requirements are met. After they resolve, they go to the graveyard. Continuous Traps are indicated by the same ∞ symbol as Continuous Spells and function the same way. Counter Trap Cards are indicated by an arrow.

Also, if one of your opponent’s monsters has a higher attack than all of yours, your monsters should be in defense position to protect you from taking damage. Battle position can be changed manually once per turn for each monster, during your Main Phase. You cannot change its battle position if it was summoned, was set, or had attacked during that turn."

The activation of a card or effect will start a Chain Link. After it is activated, the other player can choose to chain a card to it, which will then become Chain Link 2. This continues until neither player responds to the chain, after which it resolves, starting with the most recent Chain Link. While a Chain is resolving, cards and effects cannot be activated. For example: Player A activates “Torrential Tribute”, which becomes Chain Link 1. Player B responds by activating \"Seven Tools of the Bandit\" to negate it by paying 1000 Life Points. He pays the LP now because that is a cost to activate the card, and happens during the activation and not the resolution. Player A passes on chaining more cards, and so does Player B, so now the chain resolves. Resolution begins with the most recent Chain Link - \"Seven Tools\". Seven Tools negates “Torrential Tribute”, so it does not destroy any monsters."

An effect must be either Spell Speed 2 or higher or a Trigger effect in order to activate outside of your Main Phase.

In order to do this, you need Link monsters that are co-linked to each other (both point to each other) leading from your Extra Monster Zone to the opponent's. Once you have that, you can summon the final Link monster in your opponent's Extra Monster Zone, co-linked to your monster, and that zone's yours while the Link monster sits there. The Links can be summoned in a 'u-shape' or diagonally, in a v-shape. You can also use monsters your opponent controls to complete an Extra Link - if your opponent has 3 co-linked monsters in a row in their Main Monster Zones, summoning 2 Links to the Extra Monster Zones co-linked to those 3 will allow you to complete the Extra Link."

      "title": "Build a deck.",
      "content": "Build a deck. To play Yu-Gi-Oh!, you must have a deck. The number of cards in a deck must be greater than or equal to 40 cards and less than or equal to 60 cards. It is usually better to have closer to 40 cards in your deck. Your deck should have a good balance of spells, traps, and monsters. A good ratio is 15-20 monsters, around 9-12 spells, and around 5-8 traps. This ratio is not a requirement and does not need to be followed if you already know about deckbuilding. It actually means nothing in practical play. Most of the monsters should be below Level 4, with only about 1-4 (if any) of the higher levels that can’t be summoned any other way. The spells and trap cards should cover for the weaknesses of your deck, and you should have a handful of each of the following: attack protection, effect negation, summon negation, spell/trap destruction. Of course, these numbers are not absolute and will vary depending on your deck, so use what works for you. Your deck will be more consistent if it focuses around a single central archetype or theme. An Extra Deck is not necessary for a duel, but is recommended for most decks. Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz monsters are placed in the Extra Deck instead of the Main Deck. You can look through your Extra Deck at any time during the duel, and you can special summon monsters from it during your turn. There is a maximum of 15 cards that can be in the Extra Deck. Your opponent cannot view your Extra Deck, except with an effect. The Side Deck is also limited to 15 cards. It is optional, and is good for matches in tournaments. A match is a set of three duels, in which the player who wins two out of three is the winner. A Side Deck contains cards to be used against specific decks that are common or pose a major threat to your deck, but are too situational to put into your main deck. It is not to be used during a duel, but you can swap cards between it and the main and/or extra deck between the duels in a match. After siding, the number of cards in your Side deck must be the same as what you started with. You can only have three copies of a single card in your Main, Extra, and Side decks combined. Certain cards are banned or limited for use in tournaments, so make sure your deck is legal if you are going to participate in them."
