      "title": "Define your personal values",
      "content": "Define your personal values . If you have a desire to reboot your life, it may be because you don't feel like you are living according to your principles. Values are the beliefs, opinions, and ideas that drive your decision-making and serve as a foundation for your life. To ensure that your life reset gets off on the right foot, figure out your values. Perform a self-assessment in order to pinpoint your personal values. Ask yourself: What kind of things get you fired up talking about? What would you be willing to sacrifice your life for? If your home was on fire, assuming all living beings had been rescued, what three items would you want to take with you? What aspects of your community or the world would you like to change?"

      "content": "Envision your best possible self. To further direct your path, do a visualization exercise. Visualization can be a powerful tool to clarify our desires and move us closer to obtaining them. Spend some time imagining who you would like to be in 5, 10, or 15 years. [1] X Research source Go someplace quiet where you can sit without distractions. Close your eyes. Picture in your mind's eye yourself at a specific point in the future (e.g. 1 year or 5 years). Imagine that you are at the peak of success during this time. You have realized all your goals. What are you doing in this vision? What is your career? What kind of lifestyle do you have? Who are you surrounded by? What do you do for fun? Absorb this image fully. Then, grab some paper and write out some details about it. What skills or strengths do you need to make this vision a reality? How can you gain these skills?"

      "title": "Take a look at your daily choices.",
      "content": "Take a look at your daily choices. It's often said that most people overestimate what they can do in a year, but underestimate what they can do in a day. True enough, life consists of weeks, months, and years. However, you get there day by day. Think about the kinds of things you do daily. Do these actions or habits line up with your ultimate goals?"

      "title": "Set realistic goals.",
      "content": "Set realistic goals. After you have spent time envisioning your dreams and assessing what you are doing daily, you can develop an action plan to bring you closer to where you want to be. What can you do today to get you closer where you want to be tomorrow? Set SMART goals that you can break down into smaller steps. That way, you can take some positive action towards reaching your goals every day. For example, perhaps in the visualization exercise you saw yourself running your own business. Your ultimate goal may be to “Be an entrepreneur,” but that's a lofty goal to take on all at once. Break your goals down. You might need to “Develop a business idea/plan,” “Secure investors,” or “Rent a location” to house your business. These steps may serve as starting places to move you closer to the larger goal."

      "content": "Learn something new. If your daily life feels uninspiring, you may need to invigorate your brain cells with a challenge. A pick-me-up in the form of a new skill or hobby could be just what you need to refresh your schedule. Sign up for an evening class to learn a new language, ballroom dancing, master French cuisine, or train in martial arts. Maybe you once enjoyed running or sewing, but stopped. Reflect on passions you used to enjoy and pick them back up. Whatever you do, find some way to challenge yourself and jazz up your routine."

      "content": "Play. Life can start to feel colorless if you spend all your time working or attending to responsibilities. Burnout from work or caregiving can cause chronic stress that threatens not only your mindset, but your health, too. Assess your daily schedule to see what tasks you can cut out or cut down to make more room for fun. Include some time each day for play. This may translate to throwing a ball to your dog, tickling your kids, playing a video or board game, or watching a comedy film.

      "content": "Clean up your diet. Indulging on processed or fast foods, sodas, caffeinated beverages, or alcohol can worsen your mood and outlook on life. These foods and beverages make you cranky and affect your sleep quality—two things that contribute to how you feel in day-to-day life. Counteract the negative effects of poor dietary choices by making a commitment to eat cleaner. This small change could have resounding benefits on your health and well-being. Cut out salty, sugary, and caffeinated foods for a plant-based diet. Make fruits, veggies, legumes, and whole grains the foundation of your diet. Also, drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water each day to properly hydrate your body."

      "title": "Read more.",
      "content": "Read more. Technology is the top choice for entertainment these days. Too much TV, web-browsing, or social media can jeopardize your health if you are sedentary. Plus, making comparisons on social media often leave people feeling depressed about their own lives. Take a detox from these sources of information. Visit a library or bookstore and select a book in your favorite genre. Or, if you prefer, download a book on your tablet or ereader. Make a vow to read for at least 30 minutes each night before bed."

      "title": "Compliment yourself.",
      "content": "Compliment yourself. If you view your life as dull, there's a chance you've been engaging in self-defeating thought patterns. When you feel uninspired by your life, instead of looking outward to the possibilities, you may beat yourself up for not being where you want to be. You can instantly feel better about yourself by taking time to acknowledge the positives. Take a few minutes each day—whether in the morning or at night—to compliment yourself. You might say things like “You are such a caring person” or “I love my smile.” For extra points, do it in front of a mirror."

Seek out opportunities in your community where you can be of service to others. Volunteerism can equate to many different actions. It could mean starting a regular commitment with a non-profit organization, or it could simply be doing kind things for others when you have spare time. Read for children at the library. Offer to walk your neighbor's dog. Help your disabled family member keep their home tidy. Think of ways you can help those around you."

      "content": "Drop unhealthy or unproductive habits. If you are in the market for a major life overhaul, you may want to start with some of your habits. Habit change is a serious undertaking. However, when you replace negative habits with positive ones, you will notice your life starting to change for the better. Pick out a habit that has been holding you back from reaching your goals or being the best version of yourself. Poor habits may include swearing, lying, cheating, smoking, watching too much TV, drinking too much alcohol, being late, or procrastinating. The best way to break a bad habit is to find a positive one to replace it. For instance, if you want to stop watching so much TV, you might find another activity you could do during this time like reading, coloring, or working on a puzzle. Create a reward system so that you reinforce you choosing the other activity over TV.

If you are surrounded by unsupportive people who mistreat you or fail to appreciate you, it's time to nix those relationships. A spouse that verbally abuses you, a friend who always cancels at the last minute, or a boss who fails to recognize your contributions can all affect your life satisfaction. Think carefully about how each person in your life makes you feel. Cut out negative influences and expand your circle to include positive people. If you aren't able to completely terminate certain relationships, get as much distance as you can. Meet new people by joining clubs or organizations, taking a class, or connecting with people at work."
