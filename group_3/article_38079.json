      "title": "Save often.",
      "content": "Save often. Programs crash, and often at the worst time. Protect yourself from losing hours of work by saving your files regularly. If you are making changes to a file but don't want to overwrite the original, use the \"Save as\" function to create a copy with a new file name. Many programs have an autosave function that will automatically save your file after a set amount of time. This can save you in a pinch, but should not replace actively saving often."

      "content": "Name your saved files with useful names. When you first save a new file, you will be asked to create a name for the file.

      "title": "Check the format when you save your file.",
      "content": "Check the format when you save your file.

Checking for the file format is especially important when transferring files to someone who may not have the same version of the program that you do."

      "title": "Organize your save folders.",
      "content": "Organize your save folders. Most operating systems will create a Documents folder that your saved files will be automatically placed in by default. While this can be good to have a general idea of where your files are, taking the time to create a system of folders can help keep you afloat in a sea of files. Use folders to sort by file type, project, date, or any other criteria you want. Most modern versions of Windows use Libraries, which allow you to keep files of the same general type in one area. These libraries are not actually locations but are instead collections of files from across multiple locations."
