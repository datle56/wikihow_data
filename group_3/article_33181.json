      "content": "Study the chord progression before you start playing. If you already know how to read chord progressions, simply read this step and skip the rest of this section as the chords to \"Happy Birthday\" are very simple. Below is the chord progression to \"Happy Birthday\". Happy Birthday Hap-py | (C) birth - day to | (G) you. Hap-py | birth - day to | (C) you. Hap-py | birth-day dear | (F) (na-ame). Hap-py | (C) birth - day (G) to | (C) you. A few important things to note about \"Happy Birthday\": The song uses a 3/4 (waltz) beat. This means that there are three beats per measure and that the quarter note gets one count. This is easy to observe in the first measure: if you follow the lyrics, \" birth - day - to \", each syllable gets one beat. The song starts with two pickup eighth notes . In other words, the \" Hap-py \" at the start of the song occurs before the first beat as the chords don't kick in until \" Birth-day \". You can use any strumming pattern that's comfortable for you. A simple one that works well is to simply use a down strum for each quarter note (three per measure)."

You don't have to play any chords on \"Happy\", since these are pickup notes to the first measure. An open C major chord is played like this: Open C High E string: Open (0) B string: First fret (1) G string: Open (0) D string: Second fret (2) A string: Third fret (3) Low E string: Not played (X) You can keep from playing the low E string by muting it with one of your fretting fingers or simply avoiding hitting it with your strumming hand."

This means that it uses the side of your index finger to fret all of the strings on the first fret. Beginners can find this difficult to do, so, if you can't quite get it to sound right, try this alternative instead: \"Easy\" F Major High E string: First fret (1) B string: First fret (1) G string: Second fret (2) D string: Third fret (3) A string: Not played (X) Low E string: Not played (X)"

You may have trouble switching between these two chords so quickly if you're a beginner. Practice this measure by itself and don't give up as you want your finger motions to eventually become second-nature."

Above, we've used straight eighth notes for each of the \"Hap - py\"s in the song — that is, eighth notes where each note is played for the same amount of time. However, if you pay attention while you sing the song, you'll probably notice that the eighth notes aren't actually played straight. Rather, they're swung, which means that the first eighth note is a little longer than the second. To play the song more accurately, the \"hap\" syllable should be played for a little more time and the \"py\" syllable should be played for a little less time than if you were using straight eighths. In musical terms, we'd say that the first eighth note in each \"Hap - py\" is a dotted eighth note and the second is a sixteenth note."

If you're not already doing this when you play the song on guitar, try adding it to your playing and it should come easily. In musical terminology, holding a note at the end of a piece or phrase in this way is called a fermata ."

Hap-py | birth - day to | (G) you. Hap-py | birth-day dear | (C) (na-ame). Hap-py | (G) birth - day (D) to | (G) you."

In reality, you can also add chords called 7 chords to this song to give it a slightly more complex, almost bluesy feel. If you want to do this, simply change the chord in the third measure and the second chord in the seventh measure to the 7 version of that chord so that a D becomes a D7, a G becomes a G7, and so on. For example, here is the original chord progression for \"Happy Birthday\" from the top of this article with 7 chords substituted in: Happy Birthday Hap-py |(C) birth - day to |(G) you. Hap-py | (G7) birth - day to |(C) you. Hap-py | birth-day dear |(F) (na-ame). Hap-py |(C) birth - day (G7) to |(C) you. For reference, a G7 chord is played like this: Open G7 High E string: First fret (1) B string: Open (0) G string: Open (0) D string: Open (0) A string: Second fret (2) Low E string: Third fret (3)"
