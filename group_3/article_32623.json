      "content": "Some believers hold that period sex automatically creates a soul tie. Others believe that it can create a more intense soul tie than regular sex. While there's not necessarily any scientific research on that specific point, there are some science-backed reasons you might feel more intensely connected to someone you have period sex with: Being on your period can lead to more intense emotions and emotional experiences. [1] X Research source Being on your period can make you more physically and emotionally sensitive. [2] X Trustworthy Source US Office on Women's Health U.S. government agency providing resources for women's health Go to source Shame or embarrassment due to cultural stigma about menstruation might make you feel especially vulnerable, which makes you more open to deeper emotional connection.

Neither tampons nor menstrual cups are safe to leave in while you're having sex—you could push them too far up into the vaginal canal and cause a medical emergency.

      "content": "Lie on your back to reduce leakage. A lot of people feel as though there is less blood when they're on their back and penetrated from above. Lying on your back can also help if you have lower back pain associated with PMS. [8] X Research source If you find a different position that feels better for you, go for it! Generally, the less moving around the better. Keep it simple and stick to one, maybe two positions tops for the entire encounter. The average person only loses about 6-8 teaspoons (30-39 mLs) of blood over the course of their entire period, so it's really not going to be as much as you think it might be. [9] X Research source"

Things that used to be fine might be painful or uncomfortable. At the same time, you might find you enjoy other types of touch that normally don't do much for you. [10] X Research source Expect to be a little more tender and a little more sensitive. It's best if your partner is gentle, especially if this is your first time trying period sex. Talk to your partner openly every step of the way so that they know how things feel for you."

These soul ties are formed in various ways, most commonly through sex . [21] X Research source Many of these ways correspond with the scientific understanding of how people develop deep emotional bonds. A lot of soul ties theory generally is a modern understanding of psychology and interpersonal relationships with a spiritual gloss. You can choose to look at these experiences from a spiritual perspective, a scientific perspective, or both—the underlying truth is the same, for the most part."

      "content": "Are soul ties good or bad? When you're asking this, you're essentially asking if it's good or bad to have a deep emotional connection with someone else. If that other person is a good person who cares about you and the two of you have a healthy relationship, you might say you have a good soul tie. Soul ties can also be characterized as \"ungodly\" or \"bad.\" [22] X Research source Ungodly soul ties are similar to the popular psychology understanding of toxic relationships. [23] X Research source For example, unhealthy or nonexistent boundaries is a sign of ungodly soul ties. Toxic relationships are those where boundaries are blurred or erased. [24] X Research source Some believe that the soul ties formed through period sex are bad. This might be tied to religious traditions that view period sex as unclean or inappropriate. [25] X Research source Some also believe that the ungodly soul tie formed by period sex causes the man to become obsessed with the woman. Science recognizes obsessions as intrusive thoughts that are often associated with psychological conditions—and generally not enjoyable for the person having them.

Despite historical and religious views, there's nothing dirty or inappropriate about having sex on your period. The vulnerability that comes from being on your period can produce intense emotional bonds following a pleasurable sexual experience. Being on your period can also make the whole experience feel more intimate, which also brings you emotionally closer."
