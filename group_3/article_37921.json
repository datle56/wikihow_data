Being sincere will help you stand out from other fans and showcase your unique personality! [3] X Research source For example, instead of saying, “You're so amazing,” you could say, “I grew up watching you on Girl Meets World and it inspired me to audition for TV shows.” To make your letter stand out (and increase the likelihood of it being read), put it in a brightly-colored envelope or decorate the outside with stamps, stickers, or lipstick kisses."
