      "content": "Arrange to wake up after midnight. After praying the Isha prayer and before going to sleep, make arrangements to wake up during the night before the Fajr prayer (for instance, you may want to set an alarm clock or have a family member agree to wake you). Though the Tahajjud can be prayed at any part of the night, if possible, it is best to pray it after midnight, especially during the last third of the night. This is because Allah descends to the lowest heaven during the last third of the night, asking, \"Who is asking me, so I can give to him? Who is calling upon me, so I can answer him? Who is seeking my forgiveness, so I can forgive him?'\" [1] X Research source If you make an honest effort to wake up and perform the Tahajjud but accidentally sleep through the night, don't feel guilty. According to a hadeeth, Allah records your genuine intention to perform the Tahajjud and grants you sleep as an act of mercy. You will be rewarded as if your intention had been fulfilled. However, if you make a conscious decision to abandon your intention to pray Tahajjud without good reason, for example through laziness, then it may not be overlooked and a sin may be recorded.

      "content": "Wake up and perform Wudu . Wake up during the night at the time you've chosen. Once you wake, perform Wudu, the ritual ablution Muslims use to cleanse themselves before they pray or handle the Holy Quran. Traditionally, performing Wudu means using clean water to wash oneself in the following four ways: Washing the face Washing the arms and hands up to and including the elbows Wiping the head (Masah) Washing the feet up to the ankles Note that many Muslims (including the Prophet Muhammad [pbuh]) also choose to wash their mouth and teeth with a miswak before the Tahajjud. [3] X Research source If you have discharged mani earlier in the night, whether during sexual intercourse, a wet dream, or haram means, then the Ghusl full-body ritual cleansing must be performed. It is highly recommended to pray two rakats immediately after completing wudu. This will help you enter the right frame of mind for the upcoming prayer."

      "content": "Go somewhere clean, quiet, and dignified to conduct your prayer . This is done because Allah's names are pure, so, whenever possible, Muslims are encouraged to speak of Him in clean, holy places as a form of reverence. Put on your normal prayer clothes (for example a prayer khimar for women), lay down your prayer mat facing the Holy Kabah in Mecca as you would for your obligatory prayers. To be clear, you don't need to be anywhere special, like a mosque or a lavishly-decorated room in your house, to pray the Tahajjud. All that's needed is a spot that's clean, which can even be in your bedroom."

      "content": "Remove all worldly worries from your heart. At the time of prayer, calmly focus and reflect on the glory of Allah. Do not worry about fleeting worldly problems that are ultimately meaningless in comparison to the infinite wisdom and mercy of Allah. Calm yourself and ignore any negative or distracting thoughts or feelings. Close your eyes and focus your attention on your heart as you begin to achieve a heightened state of spiritual awareness and a feeling of closeness to Allah. Be aware that Allah does not actually need your Tahajjud. Rather, He has prescribed Tahajjud because it is good for Muslims. Thus, it is a gift that all should embrace and be grateful for."

      "title": "Make your intention (niyyah) to pray.",
      "content": "Make your intention (niyyah) to pray. As you start your prayer, make a definitive mental declaration to yourself that you are about to perform the Tahajjud. Decide that you are going to complete the Tahajjud in the specific way you have chosen, including how many rakats you will recite. Also decide why you are saying the Tahajjud — for instance, to glorify Allah, praise Allah, thank Allah or ask for His forgiveness for any sins you have committed. You shouldn't make this declaration out loud — Allah knows your thoughts, so your intentions will be clear to him as long as they are clear to you. For example, say in your heart \"I will to perform 8 rakats Tahajjud to seek the forgiveness of Allah\". The Tahajjud is performed by repeating pairs of rakats (cycles) of Salah , the ritual that Muslims use for their obligatory daily prayer. You must stick with your intended number of rakats."

      "title": "Perform two rakats.",
      "content": "Perform two rakats. To begin your Tahajjud, start by performing two quick rakats (cycles) of Salah . Salah begins by standing and reciting verses from the Holy Quran. Then, the person praying continues by bowing low with his hands on his knees, then prostrating on the ground with his forehead, nose, and palms on the floor and his elbows raised, sitting on his knees with his feet folded under him, and finally standing and reciting \"Allahu Akbar.\" This description of Salah is a generalization — if you're not sure how to perform Salah properly, learn this fundamental Muslim skill before attempting the Tahajjud. Emulate the practices of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) who used to recite the following surahs during each rakat in Tahajjud: [4] X Research source After reciting the Al-Fatihah the first rakat, recite the surah \"Al-Kafirun\" . After reciting the Al-Fatihah for the second rakat, recite the surah \"Al-Ikhlas\" ."

      "title": "Perform more rakats in pairs according to your niyyah.",
      "content": "Perform more rakats in pairs according to your niyyah. Generally, two rakats is seen as the minimum necessary for a proper Tahajjud. However, it's possible to repeat many more if you wish. For instance, according to the Hadiths, the Prophet Muhammad frequently prayed up to thirteen rakats including Witr. [5] X Research source Tahajjud is always performed in pairs of rakats and eight is seen as a good number by many Muslims. Most people will say two, four, six, eight or twelve rakats, though more is not discouraged and the more you pray the more rewards are available. If you are able to, then long recitations from surahs such as Al-Baqarah, An-Nisā’ or Al-‘Imran are highly commended in the subsequent rakats, even if you can manage them only from time to time. One of the benefits of praying at night is that there is no time pressure. Following in the example of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), if you notice dawn approaching while you say your Tahajjud, you may end by performing one rakat as Witr (an optional pre-dawn prayer said before the required Fajr).

      "title": "Add your own prayers (dua) after you've completed the number of rakats you set out to pray.",
      "content": "Add your own prayers (dua) after you've completed the number of rakats you set out to pray. Make sure that they are sincere, respectful, and done in complete devotion to Allah. These may be offered in extended prostration in your own words and language. You may want to offer additional thanks and praise to Allah, pray for strength and guidance, or make a special request for help. For instance, you may ask for blessings for a friend who is suffering through difficult times or help to strengthen your faith or simply spend a few moments thanking Allah for a blessing that He granted you the previous day. Prayers should be offered with humbleness, fear, hope, and patience. This is an ideal time to ask for forgiveness for your mistakes and sins as Allah is especially open to our repentance at night according to many hadeeth. Acknowledge each of your wrongdoings, however big or small - you may feel that some are insignificant, but Allah surely will have seen them and will await your repentance. Ask Allah for forgiveness, sincerely promise not to repeat your sins and make a commitment to obey Allah in the future. Study the verses of the Qur'an describing the Hellfire and use the fear of incurring Allah's punishment to drive yourself to become a better Muslim . Never lose hope of Allah's mercy for the Qur'an tells us more than 70 times that Allah is the Most Forgiving. Any prayer you offer will be heard, and, if Allah wills, your prayer will be answered in kind. Making dua after Tahajjud should not be hurried. It is the time when Allah is in His lowest heaven, so many Muslims take the opportunity to make extended dua perhaps for 30 minutes or more if they are able to."

      "content": "Go back to bed if you become too tired to complete the Tahajjud. Because the Tahajjud interrupts your normal sleep, it's not unlikely that you may be somewhat tired when you first attempt the prayer. If, however, you're so tired that you find yourself forgetting what you're saying as you recite your prayers or you doze off in the middle of your Tahajjud, don't attempt to complete the prayer. In this case, according to several ahadith, Allah notes your sincere willingness to complete the Tahajjud. You may go back to sleep without any need to be embarrassed or ashamed, but try to better prepare yourself next time, perhaps by going to bed earlier."

      "content": "Read scriptural passages about Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)'s observance of the Tahajjud. To gain a greater understanding of the unique importance of the Tahajjud prayer, consult any of the numerous references to the prayer in Islamic scripture. Most notably, the Tahajjud is mentioned in the Quran and discussed at great length in numerous ahadith. However, it is also discussed in the work of Islamic scholars throughout the history of the religion. To start, try reading Book 21 (Prayer at Night) from Sahih Bukhari. No less than 70 a hadeeth in this book describe the habits of the Prophet (pbuh) regarding the Tahajjud, which gives a clear indication of its significance in the life of a good Muslim. [7] X Research source Commentary on the Tahajjud is also offered at multiple points in the Quran, including Surat 17:79 and Surat 39:9."

      "title": "Consider saying the Tahajjud with your family.",
      "content": "Consider saying the Tahajjud with your family. Muslim families are encouraged to pray the Tahajjud in communion with each other because both Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and his wife Aisha recommended that husbands and wives should say the Tahajjud together. [8] X Research source Performing the Tahajjud as a family allows you to come closer to each other in devotion to Allah and to show solidarity in your worship. If you're interested in trying this, ask your spouse and children to join you before the first night you plan to say the Tahajjud together, then, if they need your help to do so, wake them up and celebrate Allah's infinite greatness and mercy in quiet prayer together. Children over the age of ten should be encouraged to develop the habit of praying Tahajjud when they are ready, but if it is too difficult for them to wake in the night then no blame should be apportioned and they should not be admonished, as long as they are up for Fajr and complete all their obligatory prayers correctly. Encourage your children by teaching them about the rewards available for completing voluntary acts of worship like Tahajjud. When they get older remind them of the consequences in this life and the next of not continually striving to improve their worship. Generally, families that pray the Tahajjud together make exceptions for members that need their sleep, like small children, the sick, and the elderly."

      "content": "Emulate the practices of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). All Muslims are encouraged to live in emulation of the life of Muhammad (pbuh), Allah's Messenger and the Seal of the Prophets. If you're looking for guidance in performing the Tahajjud, study the ways Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) performed the Tahajjud and try to work these habits into your daily life. By striving to emulate the Prophet (pbuh)'s Tahajjud practices, Muslims can work towards the perfect ideal represented by him and, in doing so, become closer to Allah . As noted above, Book 21 from Sahih Bukhari is a great place to start if you're looking for information on Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)'s Tahajjud habits and practices."

      "title": "Make the Tahajjud part of your routine.",
      "content": "Make the Tahajjud part of your routine. As an optional prayer, the Tahajjud isn't something that any Muslim should feel compelled to do and there is no Shariah punishment for missing it. However, many Muslims choose to practice the Tahajjud on a regular basis (if not every night) when they are able. Like all forms of prayer, saying the Tahajjud brings you closer to Allah and brings comfort to the heart of the Muslim. In addition, the Tahajjud is often associated with Allah's gift of mercy, making it a great opportunity to seek forgiveness for minor failures, sins and imperfect actions. Remember that Allah appreciates regular acts of worship, so if you start praying Tahajjud, resolve not to give it up. If you intend to make the Tahajjud a regular part of your life, set a recurring alarm to wake you up during the night and set aside a space in your house for performing it. If you are unable at this stage to commit to praying Tahajjud every single night, then try build up slowly by establishing the habit of saying just two or four rakats two or three times a week, whatever you can manage, with the aim of building up over time. Allah loves it when His servants strive to develop their worship. Once you establish Tahajjud as part of your daily routine, look for ways of enhancing it, for example by praying thirteen rakats including one of Witr, and follow the sunnah of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) by reciting extended passages from the Qur'an. Remember that Allah never tires of giving rewards as long as His servant does not tire of doing good deeds."
