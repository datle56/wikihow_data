      "content": "Keep in mind that there are cases in which the restore option of system recovery is disabled. In such cases, you can use a desktop search program. There are many desktop search programs available like Yahoo desktop search, Google desktop search, etc. If you remember a few keywords of what you want to search for in the Internet history, you can type it there in the search box and get it recovered."

      "content": "Perform this procedure if the history was deleted a long time ago. Using System Restore would be pointless, as you'd end up losing too much recent data in the process. If you have intentionally deleted the Internet history and are now in a desperate need to get it back, then this is what can help you. A desktop search will also not be of much help in such cases. The log files are where all the operations that you perform in your system are stored. A look into the log files can also let you recover deleted Internet history. All Windows computers have this file extension that stores arbitrary data, the .DAT extension. In our scenario, the system uses a file called 'index.dat', that stores all the information of the operations you have performed."

To read a .dat file, we need to know the software that created the file. Sometimes, .jpg, .avi, .doc, etc. file extensions get renamed to .dat. In our case, we need to get the software that programmers used to create the index.dat files to read them. Try using Notepad through the Open With option, but more than half the information displayed will be garbage that you won't understand."

Install professional recovery software, which may cost a bit, but stands a better chance of recovering any lost data. Opt for professional data recovery services. Not only does this option cost a lot, it also means that you will have to send your hard disk to them."
