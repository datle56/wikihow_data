Direct the players to keep their cards face down. [1] X Research source You can play Uno with 2 to 10 players. Players should be at least 7 years old.

The player to the left of the dealer should lay down a card from their hand if it matches the color, number, word, or symbol on the card that's lying face up in the center of the table. Direct them to put their card on top of the discard pile. The next player then looks for a card from their hand that they can play. [4] X Research source For example, if the top card in the discard pile is a red number 8, you could play any red card you have or a card of any color that has an 8 on it. The game is usually played going clockwise from the dealer."

      "content": "Pay attention to action and Wild cards. In addition to basic Uno cards that have numbers on them, there are 4 types of action cards. If you play a Wild card, you choose the color for the next play. If you put down a Draw 2, the player next to you must take 2 cards, and their turn is skipped. If you play Skip, then the next playerâ€™s turn is skipped. If you play Reverse, you change the direction of play, so the person who went before you will then have another turn. [6] X Research source A Reverse card has 2 arrows that are going in opposite directions. If you get a Skip card, which is a card that has a circle with a slash through it, the player next to you must skip their turn. According to Uno rules for 2 players , Reverse works like Skip if you're playing with just 2 people. That means your opponent has to skip a turn and you get to immediately play another card. For 2 players, if you play a Draw 2 or Wild Draw 4 card, the other person has to draw the number of cards and then you resume play on your turn again."

[8] X Research source If you can't play your last card, draw another card and continue until someone's hand is empty. Try to save a Wild card as your last card, if you have one.

To score a hand, give the winner of the round: [10] X Research source 20 points for each Draw 2, Reverse, or Skip card in an opponent's hand 50 points for Wild and Wild Draw 4 cards The face value for number cards (for example, an 8 card equals 8 points) You can also count the number of cards a player has after each round and have the player that reaches 100 points first win, though this isn't in the official game rules."

This means everyone will go through cards quicker. For example, if there's a yellow 3 on the table, a player could put down a yellow 7 and a red 3. If you don't want the game to end faster, you can have the players draw 2 cards instead of 1 each time they don't have a card to play."

For example, a customizable rule could be: [12] X Research source Everyone must draw 2 cards. The next player must sing a song or draw a card. Swap 1 card with the player next to you."
