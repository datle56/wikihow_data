Using a dress that is already the length that you would like to shorten your dress to is an easy way to ensure that you will get a good result. Check your closet for dresses that are the ideal length to use as a guide. [1] X Research source Try to find a dress with a similar cut to your dress as well. For example, if your dress has an A-line skirt, then try to find another dress with an A-line skirt that you can use as a guide."

      "content": "Measure the length if you do not have a dress to use as a guide. If you do not have a dress that is the length you want, then you can also try on the dress and use a measuring tape to find the length you want. Do this while you are standing up. Extend the measuring tape from your natural waist to the place you want the hem to end and mark the length using a piece of chalk. Then, repeat this all the way around using the same measurement. If you have a friend who can help you, then you might also ask them to do this for you. It can be difficult to get the measurements while you are also wearing the dress."

      "content": "Trace the hemline. When you have identified the length you want, you will need to trace the new hemline onto your dress. If you are using a dress as a guide, then lay it over the top of your longer dress and use a piece of chalk to trace the hemline of the shorter dress. [2] X Research source If you are using the chalk marks you made while wearing the dress, then you can just connect these marks. If you are using another dress as a guide, then make sure that the two dresses are lined up at the shoulders. This will help to ensure that your new hem will be the same length as the one on your other dress."

      "content": "Measure 1” (2.5cm) from the line for seam allowance. You will need to cut your new hem a little lower than the chalk line you made on your dress.

      "content": "Consider the difficulty of the project. You can probably hem most dresses on your own as long as the dress is a simple design with fabric that is easy to work with. However, some dresses may be difficult to hem on your own. Dresses that are made from delicate fabrics, include beaded embellishments, flare out significantly, or have multiple layers may be difficult to hem. For dresses that pose these kinds of challenges, consider hiring a seamstress. [10] X Research source You may also consider using a rolled hem for delicate fabrics or flared skirts."
