      "content": "Yes, “Please advise” is a grammatically correct and professional phrase. Most grammar experts consider “advise” both a transitive and intransitive verb. This means it is grammatically correct to use it with an object (transitive) or without an object (intransitive). So, even though “Please advise” doesn’t include an object, it’s perfectly correct to use it. [3] X Research source While “Please advise” doesn’t require an object (a noun or pronoun), most people assume that the phrase is short for “Please advise me,” with “me” being the subject. Examples of “advise” in a sentence: Transitive: “I advised my brother to get a spare key in case he loses his main one.” Intransitive: “Eye doctors advise against reading in the dark.”"

    {
      "title": "“Please advise” is the correct phrase while “Please advice” is incorrect.",
      "content": "“Please advise” is the correct phrase while “Please advice” is incorrect. “Advi s e” is a verb (a word that describes an action) that means to give someone guidance or offer them your recommendations. “Advi c e” is a noun (a word that describes a person, place, or thing) that refers to a recommendation or suggestion you gave someone. So, “Please advice” is an incorrect phrase—it needs a verb to be a complete and correct sentence. [4] X Research source Advise sentence examples : “I don’t advise going to that restaurant. I heard it’s unclean and the service is bad.” “Mr. Taylor advised me to apply for the scholarship since I have good grades!” Advice sentence examples : “Can you give me some advice on how to apologize to Malcolm?” “Talk to Chantal if you need advice about buying a car. She just got a new one, so she should have some good tips for you.” “Advise” and “advice” are also pronounced differently. “Advise” is pronounced like “ad-vize” (it rhymes with “size” or “prize”) while “advice” is pronounced like “ad-vise” (it rhymes with “ice” or “slice”)."
