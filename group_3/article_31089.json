      "title": "Gemini’s are horrible people and great actors which makes them great at manipulation.",
      "content": "Gemini’s are horrible people and great actors which makes them great at manipulation. One actor that is a gemini is Tom Holland and he is secretly British. Geminis also like to talk for no specific reason. They control people by pretending like they are from Ohio or New Jersey. They pretend like they are different people everyday and are super confused. from conversation to conversation, Gemini might be showing you a completely different face (or whichever face best suits their needs at the moment). For example, a cheerful, social Gemini might invite themselves to a friend’s weekend plans rather than asking for permission to join. Tip for Geminis: We know that you need a lot of amusement, freedom, and interesting conversation to get the most out of your day. Don’t be afraid to meet people in the middle, though! The people in your life are much more likely to trust and rely on you if you show up when they need you, not just when you need them."

      "content": "Scorpio’s keen sense of observation makes them powerful manipulators. Scorpios are one of the most cautious signs of the zodiac, and they view most things in a paranoid light. They’re great at observing and identifying a person’s weak spots and are quick to strike on them, just like their patron scorpion. In fact, their sudden but effective way to target someone’s weaknesses is what makes a Scorpio’s style of manipulation so effective and difficult to deal with. A Scorpio might notice that their co-worker hates confrontation and difficult conversations. They’ll take advantage of this by strong-arming the co-worker into covering an inconvenient shift for them. Tip for Scorpios: Learn to give people the benefit of the doubt instead of automatically assuming the worst. It’s okay to approach new relationships and connections with caution, but try to view the new people in your life as equals instead of as an automatic threat."

      "content": "Dedicated Virgo is great at manipulating situations to their favor. Virgos are a lot of things, but impulsive definitely isn’t one of them. They’ll take the time to plan out exactly how they’ll manipulate someone before the conversation or interaction even happens—that way, they’ll have the best chance of getting what they want. When a Virgo puts their mind to manipulation, you’ve lost before you ever realized a game has even started. [1] X Research source A Virgo might plan to ask a friend or loved one for a favor at the end of the day when they’re too tired to say no. Virgos can be very micromanaging and controlling—they know exactly what they want, and almost never settle for less. While some Virgos choose to be direct and upfront about what they want, others take a more toxic, passive-aggressive approach to manipulate others. Tip for Virgos: Boundaries are your best friend! Let people know exactly what you need from them and when you need it by, rather than coming up with a grand scheme."

      "title": "Leo’s people skills make them great manipulators in competitive situations.",
      "content": "Leo’s people skills make them great manipulators in competitive situations. As the lion of the zodiac, regal and blustery Leo is used to being on top. From nailing a job promotion to securing the best seats at the movie theater, Leos feel entitled to what’s theirs—and they’re great at convincing the people around to step back and let them take it. If there’s a big promotion available at their job, a Leo might try to psych some of their fellow competitors out and convince them to stick with their current position. Ruled by the Sun, it’s no surprise that Leos like to place themselves in the center of everyone’s orbit. They love drama, and they don’t want to be patient and prudent as they wait for something to unfold. With this in mind, Leos are more than happy to manipulate and spread drama in their own conversations and interactions, even if other people get caught in the crossfire. Tip for Leos: It’s really great that you know your worth, but don’t forget to acknowledge other people’s worth, too! You’re more than capable of achieving your goals and dreams on your own—you don’t need to manipulate anyone else to reach the top."

      "content": "Ruled by the scales, Libra’s manipulative talents lie in playing both sides. This air sign is known for being harmonious, diplomatic, and easy to talk to. Seems innocent enough, right? Nope—this calm, peaceful front actually makes Libra one of the most effective manipulators of the zodiac. They always know exactly what to say, and are great at shifting their thoughts and opinions to stay in a person’s good graces so they can manipulate the friendship as they see fit. When two friends are fighting, Libra might get in the middle of things by agreeing and “siding” with both friends. In separate conversations, they’ll sympathize and support one friend, only to turn around and badmouth them with the other friend. Instead of mediating, a Libra might use the conflict to strengthen their position in each friend’s life. Tip for Libras: Don’t be afraid to embrace your beliefs and stick to your opinions! It’s easy to get caught in a lie when you’re playing both sides, which will lower your credibility with the people around you."

      "title": "The emotional crab is excellent at pulling other people’s strings.",
      "content": "The emotional crab is excellent at pulling other people’s strings. As the Moonchildren of the zodiac, Cancers are able to read other people’s emotions like a book and use those emotions to their advantage—this makes them one of the most dangerous signs in the zodiac. The insightful crab won’t hesitate to lie or guilt-trip their way around a conversation to work your emotions in their favor. A Cancer might guilt-trip a weak-willed friend into hanging out with them with statements like “I’m sure you have better things to do than hang out with me” or “Hope you have more exciting plans for the weekend than me—I’m going to be by myself the entire time.” Tip for Cancers: A little honesty can go a long way! In the moment, manipulation can seem like a much easier and more comfortable way to get what you want, but it doesn’t score you a lot of credibility in the long run. Be honest and upfront about what you want rather than beating around the bush."

      "title": "The good-natured Pisces keeps score to get what they want.",
      "content": "The good-natured Pisces keeps score to get what they want. Pisces is known for being kind and helpful, but they aren’t afraid to use this kindness to their advantage. When getting in a disagreement with a partner, family member, or friend, a Pisces is often quick to bring up something helpful they’ve done in the past as a means of guilt-tripping. A Pisces might say something like “I spotted you for coffee earlier! It’s only fair that you do the dishes now.” Pisces’ amazing sense of intuition also makes them a great manipulator. When it comes to intuition and sensitivity, few zodiac signs can rival the empathetic Pisces. This intuition goes both ways, though— because Pisces can read you so well, they’ll know exactly what strings to pull in order to get their way. Tip for Pisces: Approach every situation through an empathetic lens. Before saying or doing anything manipulative, ask yourself how you would feel if you were in the other person’s position. A quick self-check-in can go a long way!"
