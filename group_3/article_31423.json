This can help calm you down during homework, your test, or even right this second! [2] X Research source Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. If it helps, place a hand on your stomach and feel its rise and fall. Really focus on your breaths as you go. Know that the best thing you can do right now is take a moment for yourself. If you’re having trouble calming down, remind yourself that this feeling will pass. A lot of the time, our biggest stresses work themselves out over time. If you can, visualize a time when that was the case for you."

Focus on engaging your five sense—for example: [3] X Research source By the beach, the sound of waves, the deep blue sea, the feel of the sand on your feet, and the smell of sea spray. By the bonfire, the sound of cackling flames, the taste of s'mores, the warmth of the fire, the smell of smoke."

[4] X Research source Native American, Celtic, and Indian music have been proven to be especially successful in reducing stress.

Try blocking out time in your schedule for the things that make you feel amazing. That could be time with friends, skateboarding, or watching reality TV. Take yourself out for a relaxing solo date.
