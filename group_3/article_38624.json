      "content": "In a relationship, self-sabotaging is when someone avoids connecting with a partner. This behavior can be conscious or subconscious, but the self-sabotager often has no idea they’re pushing their partner away. Perhaps they inwardly want to breakup or are insecure about where they stand with their partner. Either way, their closed off behavior can cause the relationship to end prematurely. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Self-sabotaging relationships usually stem from poor communication skills, past experiences, and/or trust issues. This behavior can look like avoiding texts from your partner, canceling dates repeatedly, or being overly critical of their appearance or behavior. More often than not, self-sabotaging is a form of protection. Those who self-sabotage are scared of vulnerability or loss, so they’ll put up a critical wall to avoid heartache. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Childhood trauma",
      "content": "Childhood trauma One of the leading causes of self-sabotaging behavior in relationships is past experiences or trauma. If you were raised in a toxic household or were emotionally or physically abused, you’re more prone to self-sabotaging behaviors. You may struggle to trust others (even those closest to you) because of your past, and because of this, you could subconsciously push a partner away. Talk to a therapist or counselor about past traumas to move forward. They’ll be able to help you work through your emotions and find peace."

      "content": "Fear of abandonment Do you fear losing your loved ones or relationships? Is being alone a constant worry? If so, you may have a fear of abandonment or rejection. Fear of abandonment stems from the worry that you’ll be left alone when you’re the most vulnerable.

      "title": "Poor self-esteem",
      "content": "Poor self-esteem If you think negatively about yourself, you’re more likely to practice self-sabotaging behavior. In your mind, you’re not worthy of love, so why should your partner want you? This mindset not only hurts your self-image, but it can also lead to conscious sabotaging behavior, such as purposefully forgetting a date because you believe your partner shouldn’t want to be seen with someone like you. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Improve your self-esteem by reframing negative thoughts. For instance, change the thought, “I’m just not good enough for them,” to “I’m not perfect, but no one is. They chose me for a reason.”"

      "title": "Learned behavior",
      "content": "Learned behavior More often than not, people mimic the behavior they’ve learned throughout their lives. You may unintentionally mirror the same behavior if you’ve only ever experienced hostile or toxic relationships (whether through your family or personal relationships). This isn’t your fault—you’re simply practicing what you know; it’s familiar—but it can be harmful to you and your partner. [6] X Research source Identify the behavior you want to change in yourself to work on reversing it. What are you doing that you’ve seen or disapproved of in your past?"

      "content": "Gaslighting Do you often question your partner’s feelings? If so, you may be unintentionally gaslighting them and self-sabotaging. Gaslighting is a type of emotional abuse that makes someone question their reality. [7] X Research source Let’s say your partner says, “I’m upset you can’t come to the banquet tonight,” you respond with, “You’re not really upset. It’s your fault you told me last minute, so now you’re blaming me.” With this response, you’re invalidating your partner’s feelings, which could result in an argument. Stop gaslighting behavior by actively listening to your partner and doing your best to understand their position."

      "content": "Excessive criticism Do you always make a point to tell your partner when you disapprove of their outfit, behavior, or attitude? If so, you could be self-sabotaging the relationship. Criticism isn’t abnormal in relationships, but excessive criticism is. No matter what your partner does, it just doesn’t seem good enough for you. [8] X Research source Rather than noting everything wrong with your partner, note what’s right. Don’t forget to compliment them every once and a while!"

Poor communication and avoiding decisive discussions could be a sign that you’re self-sabotaging. You don’t want to talk about anything that could divide you as a couple. You’d rather pretend you’re in sync to live out your perfect relationship fantasies.

If so, you may be inadvertently sabotaging your relationship. Low self-esteem can cause you to question the strength of your relationship and yourself. If you don’t believe in yourself, how can you believe in the relationship? Replace self-deprecating thoughts with positive ones to boost your self-esteem . For instance, instead of thinking, “I’m an idiot. What are they with me?” think, “I may not be as smart as others, but I am strong in other ways.

Perhaps you’ve experienced infidelity or other toxic relationship behavior in the past. Either way, past relationships have made it difficult to trust.

Jealousy is normal in relationships—it happens—but being excessively jealous and controlling isn’t. Chances are that if you fret over every person your partner texts, hangs out with, or looks at, you’re self-sabotaging. [15] X Research source Set boundaries with your partner to establish trust.

Identifying your attachment style you have can help you understand why you self-sabotage your relationships.

While past experiences and traumas can affect how you act, the behavior is ultimately your own doing. We know it’s hard, but recognizing, acknowledging, accepting, and taking responsibility for your actions is the first step toward healing. [18] X Research source Try journaling to process your emotions. Write whatever comes to mind—you may be surprised by what you learn about yourself. Be open and honest with your partner about your past (as long as you’re comfortable doing so), or talk to a therapist to help you come to terms with past traumatic experiences."

Answer these questions to identify your triggers: [19] X Research source Are there certain places I feel on edge? Do I lash out when my partner expresses a specific need or emotion?

      "content": "Consider ending the relationship. Sometimes the best way to avoid self-sabotaging is to let go of the relationship. If you’ve minimized your destructive habits, acknowledged your behavior, come to terms with your past, and still aren’t happy, it may be time to end things . Self-sabotaging behavior is a sign that you’re subconsciously unhappy or dissatisfied in the relationship, so don’t be afraid to close this chapter and start the next. Knowing when to end a relationship is never easy, so carefully weigh your options. Make a pros and cons list if you’re feeling stuck to visualize your thought process."
