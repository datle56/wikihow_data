      "content": "Toast whole flax seeds for 5 to 7 minutes for a nuttier flavor. Pour whole flax seeds into a dry skillet and turn the burner to medium heat. Stir the flax seeds occasionally as they toast and give off a nutty smell. If you'd rather toast them in the oven, spread them on a dry sheet and roast them at 375 °F (191 °C) for 5 to 10 minutes. [1] X Research source Toast the seeds in small batches, since toasted flax seeds won't keep as long as raw flax seeds. Try to use the toasted flax seeds immediately."

      "title": "Sprinkle flax seeds over yogurt, oatmeal, or salad.",
      "content": "Sprinkle flax seeds over yogurt, oatmeal, or salad. To give your morning yogurt, oatmeal, or parfait a little crunch, scatter 1 to 2 tablespoons (14.8 to 29.6 ml) (15 to 30 g) of whole flax seeds over the top. This can add an interesting texture to creamy foods while also upping their nutritional value. Flax seeds also make a great topping for salads or avocado toast. [2] X Research source If you like to prep your oatmeal the night before, go ahead and place the seeds on top. They may soften slightly, but they'll still be good to eat in the morning. Flax seeds also work wonderfully as a substitute for sesame seeds in stir-fry dishes."

      "title": "Replace some of the flour in baked goods with whole flax seeds.",
      "content": "Replace some of the flour in baked goods with whole flax seeds. If you're making muffins or pancakes, replace 8% of the flour in the recipe with whole flax seeds. To use whole seeds in bread, replace 10 to 15% of the flour. Keep in mind that using whole seeds reduces the amount of gluten in the baked goods. [3] X Research source Note: Since your baked goods don't have as much gluten, they won't have as much volume."

      "title": "Garnish baked goods with whole flax seeds for a rustic look.",
      "content": "Garnish baked goods with whole flax seeds for a rustic look. Bread and muffins topped with flax seeds look hearty and unique. Sprinkle whole seeds over muffin batter before you bake them, or add them to the top of a loaf of bread before adding it to the oven. Just remember to brush the top of the dough with water or beaten egg before you sprinkle the seeds on top to help them stick. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Store whole flax seeds in the fridge for up to 1 year.",
      "content": "Store whole flax seeds in the fridge for up to 1 year. Whole flax seeds last much longer than ground seeds, but you should still put them in an airtight container. Refrigerate them for up to 1 year, or until the expiration date printed on their packaging. [5] X Research source If your flax seeds came in a sealable bag, press the air out of the bag before sealing it, or transfer the seeds to an airtight container to prolong their shelf life."

      "title": "Place your desired amount of flax seeds into a bowl.",
      "content": "Place your desired amount of flax seeds into a bowl. If you're replacing an egg in a recipe, for example, you’ll only need to soak 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (15 g) of ground flax seeds to equal roughly one “egg.” [6] X Research source To make bread or crackers with flax seed, you might use up to 1 cup (170 g). Since soaked flax seeds will become softer and slimier the longer they're stored, you might want to prepare only as much as you plan on using right away."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stir 3 times as much warm water into the bowl.",
      "content": "Stir 3 times as much warm water into the bowl. The flax seeds absorb a lot of liquid, which is why you need to put so much water into the bowl. For example, if you only put 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (15 g) of flax seeds in the bowl to make a flax egg replacer, pour 3 tablespoons (44 ml) of water into it. [7] X Research source Avoid using hot water, which could make the flax seeds gummy."

      "title": "Leave the flax seeds to soak for 2 to 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Leave the flax seeds to soak for 2 to 10 minutes. Stir them every few minutes and let them absorb water until they're as gel-like as you want. Keep in mind that if you're soaking a small amount of flax seeds, you'll only need to soak them for a few minutes, while larger amounts will take closer to 10 minutes. Keep the bowl of soaking flax seeds at room temperature while they hydrate."

      "title": "Use the soaked flax seeds in baked goods and smoothies.",
      "content": "Use the soaked flax seeds in baked goods and smoothies. If your recipe calls for 1 egg, you can replace it with 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (15 g) of soaked flax seeds. Double this for 2 eggs, triple it for 3, and so on. If you'd like to give a batch of smoothies a nutritional boost, pour a larger serving of soaked flax seeds in with your smoothie ingredients. Try adding soaked flax seeds to pancakes, muffins, or cookies. Store leftover soaked flax seeds in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."

      "title": "Use a grinder to reduce seeds to a powder for more nutritional benefits.",
      "content": "Use a grinder to reduce seeds to a powder for more nutritional benefits. Although you can eat the seeds whole, grinding them allows your body to absorb more of the omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and antioxidants. Put a few spoonfuls of whole seeds into a mortar , blender, food processor, or spice grinder. Then, grind them until they're a finer consistency, like breadcrumbs. [8] X Research source You can also grind the seeds in a clean coffee grinder."

      "title": "Use ground flax seeds as filler for burgers, patties, or meatloaf.",
      "content": "Use ground flax seeds as filler for burgers, patties, or meatloaf. If your recipe calls for breadcrumbs, consider replacing them with ground flax seeds. The ground seeds bind the mixture together so your burgers, patties, or meatloaf hold their shape. [9] X Research source This works for regular ground beef recipes, as well as vegetarian versions! This is a great option to make your recipes gluten-free while also adding some extra nutrients."

      "title": "Blend ground flax seeds into salad dressings, soups, and smoothies.",
      "content": "Blend ground flax seeds into salad dressings, soups, and smoothies. The next time you're mixing up a tasty smoothie or dressing for salad, add a few spoonfuls of ground flax seeds. You can also mix them into stew, chili, or soup to make them even heartier. [10] X Research source This is a great option if you want added nutritional benefits, but you aren’t a fan of the texture of whole flax seeds."

      "title": "Use ground flax seed to replace flour or fat when you bake.",
      "content": "Use ground flax seed to replace flour or fat when you bake. If you'd like a low-gluten baked good, replace 10 to 15% of the flour with ground flax seeds. To cut some of the fat, use 3 parts of ground flax seed for every 1 part of butter or oil. [11] X Research source For example, if you're making muffins that call for 1/2 cup (113g) of butter, use 1 1/2 cups (375 g) of ground flaxseed instead."

      "title": "Store ground flax seeds in an airtight container for up to 10 months.",
      "content": "Store ground flax seeds in an airtight container for up to 10 months. If you ground more flax seeds than you need, put the rest in an airtight container. They should keep well in the refrigerator for up to 10 months. If you'd like to increase the shelf-life of ground flax seeds, keep them in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 12 months."
