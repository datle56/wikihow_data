      "content": "Clean the rifle thoroughly , including the barrel. Rifles that have been sitting in storage for a long time, or rifles that are frequently used for hunting, can become covered with dust and grime. A clean rifle will shoot more accurately than a dirty one. There is no set time when your gun should be cleaned, but the general consensus is to clean it after you are done firing for the day, and before and after you put the gun in storage."

      "content": "Decide between a dedicated rest or sandbags. The decision comes down to your budget and what you're comfortable working with. There are professionally made rests available for purchase that will secure your rifle, or you can use sandbags to create a firm rest. [2] X Research source It is essential that the rifle does not move during the sighting process. Whichever rest method you use is fine as long as there is no movement. Depending on the rest you use, you may need to prop the front or the rear of the rifle with sandbags."

      "title": "Determine where you want to set the rest up.",
      "content": "Determine where you want to set the rest up. Depending on the location that you're shooting, you may have access to different options. Comfort is not especially necessary since you won't be firing much from this position. If you are using a firing range, you may be able to use a bench at the facility. If you are shooting in the wild, you can either set a bench or table up yourself, or assemble the rest on the hood of a car. If you are prepared to lie down, you can set your rest up on the ground, provided that there is enough clearance to safely shoot."

      "content": "Place the rifle securely in the rest. If you are using a gun vise as a rest, make sure that it is fastened securely. Wedge the butt securely into sandbags and rest the stock on another. Make sure that the rifle is as stable and secure as possible.

      "content": "Set up a target with a bull's-eye at 25 yards (22.9 m). This technique alone will not accurately sight-in a rifle, but it may help get your rifle shooting much closer to the intended target than before. Most rifle sighting is done first at 25 yards (22.9 m), then at 100 yards (91.4 m). This will give you a more accurate sighting over long distances. A quick way to measure yardage is to grab a tape measure and see how many paces it take you to travel 30 feet (9.1 m). Do this a couple times and average the results. Once you know how many paces 30 feet (10 yards) is, you can measure out 25 yards (22.9 m)."

If you are not using a bolt-action rifle, you can insert a collimator, which is a bore-sighting instrument, into the end of the barrel to continue bore-sighting the rifle. Make absolutely sure to remove the collimator before firing your rifle."

If they are not, adjust the settings on the scope in the opposite direction you want the scope to move, until the crosshairs go through the center of the bull's-eye. In other words, if you want the crosshairs to move up, you will have to turn the scope adjustment knob in the downward direction."

You will need to be able to make adjustments to the sight without moving the rifle. This method will sight your rifle about 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) above the target at 100 yards (91.4 m). This is a standard height for longer-distance shooting. At 200 and 300 yards, the bullet will drop towards the center of the target. This method will not result in pin-point accuracy, but will be sufficient for deer-sized targets. You can bore-sight before performing this method for increased accuracy and ease of sighting."

Using the knobs on the scope, adjust it so that the crosshairs are directly over the bullet hole created by your first shot. [7] X Research source Most scopes move the crosshair in the opposite direction of the knob. For example, to move the crosshair down, you would twist the knob up. You can make the bullet hole easier to see by placing a brightly-colored sticker over the hole on the target."

Once the crosshair is lined up directly on the bullet hole, lower the crosshair so that it is pointing at a spot about half an inch below the bullet hole. This will make your gun shoot about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) above the target at 25 yards (22.9 m). Being 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) above the target at 25 yards (22.9 m) generally translates to 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) above at 100 yards (91.4 m), dead-on at 200 yards (182.9 m), and 8–12 inches (20.3–30.5 cm) below the target at 300 yards (274.3 m). This will vary based on the caliber, but is generally similar. [8] X Research source"
