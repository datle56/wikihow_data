Each player board in Azul has a score track on top, a set of empty spaces on the left, and a 5 x 5 grid called a “wall” on the right. Take a player board and set it in front of you so the multicolored wall is face-up. Place a black scoring cube in the 0 slot of the score track. [1] X Research source For a more advanced and strategic game, use the side of the player board with the gray wall instead."

The Factory displays are the circular cardboard pieces in the box, and the starting tile is white with the number “1” printed on it. Arrange the Factory displays in a circle in the middle of the table and set the starting tile in the center. The number of factory displays in your game depends on how many players you have.

For each Factory display, draw 4 tiles at random and set them on top. These tiles are the ones available for the current round. Now you’re ready to start the game. [3] X Research source There are 20 tiles in each of the 5 colors. Keep the bag and game box within reach because you’ll use them again at the end of the round."

Otherwise, choose a player at random. On your turn, you may choose any one of the Factory displays to take tiles from, but you may only take all the tiles of a single color. Alternatively, if there are tiles in the center of the Factory displays on a later turn, you may choose to take all the pieces of a single color from there as well. [4] X Research source This is called the “ Factory offer ” phase. If you’re the first person to take tiles from the middle of the table, take the starting tile as well and place it into the leftmost slot of the “floor line” at the bottom of your board. Picking this tile lets you go first during the next round. Strategy Tip : Pay attention to how many open spaces you have available on each of your pattern lines. Try to pick from Factory displays that have enough tiles to fill up the available spaces in a single line."

When you select the tiles, choose one of the 5 pattern lines that have between 1 and 5 open spaces on the left side of your board. Set the tiles you took from the Factory display or center of the table into the spaces on the pattern line from right to left. [5] X Research source If you took more tiles than the available spaces in the pattern row, put the extra tiles into the spaces of the floor line at the bottom of your board from left to right. The tiles in the floor line are worth negative points at the end of the round, so be careful to only take as many tiles as you need for the pattern lines. Even if you can place the chosen tiles in a pattern line, you may choose to place the tiles in the floor line instead. If it’s a later turn and you already have tiles in a pattern row, you may not add tiles of a different color to the same row. So if you have 2 dark blue tiles in the third pattern row, you may only play an additional dark blue tile there on a later turn."

If you don’t have room for your tiles on any of your pattern lines because you already started lines of a different color or because the spaces are filled, immediately place the tiles in your floor line. Strategy Tip : Pay attention to what other players are taking and what they have on their board. Try to take tiles that they need to complete pattern lines so they have fewer options to pick from."

Check the pattern lines on your board, starting from the top and moving toward the bottom. If you filled all the spaces in a pattern line with matching tiles, take the rightmost tile and place it onto the unfilled matching colored space of the wall on the right side of your board. Take the remaining tiles of the completed pattern line (that is now missing the rightmost tile) and empty them into the game box. [7] X Research source Every time you move a tile from a pattern line to the wall, score points. If the matching colored space of the wall is already filled, all tiles from the completed pattern line must be moved to the floor line. This is called the “ Wall-tiling ” phase."

If there are, count the number of tiles that are touching each other in the horizontal row. Then, count the number of tiles that connect in the same vertical column as the one you just placed. Move the total points you earned on the score track immediately after placing the tile. Example : If there are 2 adjacent tiles in a horizontal row and you place a third one next to it, you earn 3 points for it. Example : If the tile you placed has 1 tile adjacent above it and 1 tile adjacent to the left, you earn a total of 4 points (2 points for the linked tiles in the row, and 2 points for the linked tiles in the column)."

Put any colored tiles from the floor line into the game box. [11] X Research source If you fill your floor line during the round, you’ll lose 14 points total.

[13] X Research source The shortest game of Azul will be 5 rounds, but it usually takes longer so players can earn additional points.
