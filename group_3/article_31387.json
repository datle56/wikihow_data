For instance, it’s totally okay to comment on the cool shirt they’re wearing, or to let them know how much you appreciate the meal they cooked last time you came over. However, keep it chill and be careful not to make it too personal—especially if you’re still getting to know them. [1] X Research source If you’re worried about overdoing it, try to stick to just giving them 1 or 2 compliments a day. [2] X Research source Keep compliments genuine and specific. For instance, you might say something like, “That dress really looks great on you. Blue is totally your color!” Be careful of anything that sounds over-the-top, especially if you don’t know each other that well yet. For instance, your crush might feel a little awkward if it’s a first date and you come out with something like, “You’re the most gorgeous creature I’ve ever seen. I could spend my life getting lost in your eyes.” In general, when you’re first getting to know someone, avoid commenting on their body or physical appearance. This could make them uncomfortable."

Pay close attention to how your crush reacts and back off if they seem uncomfortable or ask you to stop. [3] X Research source For instance, don’t try to go in for a kiss unless you’re pretty sure they’re cool with it. Be careful about getting too touchy-feely in public unless your SO is okay with it.

If it’s been a couple of days, feel free to casually follow up and ask how they’re doing. But if they still don’t respond, that could be a signal that you need to back off and give them some space for a while. Don’t push for information about where they are or what they’re doing if they don’t seem comfortable talking about it! “Checking in” too much can definitely make you seem clingy or even controlling.

      "content": "Avoid demanding too much of their time and attention. Instead of being a “taker”—for example, by constantly asking for reassurance, or dumping all your problems on them—find ways to nurture and support your potential partner. This way, the relationship will feel more balanced, and they’ll feel refreshed instead of drained after spending time with you. [9] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 10 June 2021. For example, you might treat them to dinner, give them a small gift, offer positive feedback on a project they’re working on, or help them with something they’re struggling with. This doesn’t mean it’s never okay to ask for help or express your wants and needs! But be mindful of how often you’re doing it, and make sure you reciprocate when they’re supportive of you."

Avoid pressuring your crush or your new SO into saying “I love you,” putting a name to your relationship, getting intimate, or making big steps like moving in with you before they’re ready. [11] X Research source It’s okay to open up about your own feelings, or to have a conversation about both of your expectations about the relationship. Just make it clear that you’re not trying to push them into anything they aren’t ready for. When you talk about your relationship, focus on expressing your own feelings instead of interrogating them about how they feel. For instance, after you’ve been dating for a few weeks, you might say something like, “Hey, I just want you to know that I’m really enjoying my time with you, and that you’ve become very important to me. These last few weeks have been amazing.” Avoid saying things like, “When are you going to tell me that you love me?” Or, “I want you to promise me that we’ll be together forever.”"

Before spending time with your special someone, check in with yourself about how you’re feeling. Do you notice any negative or insecure thoughts or feelings about the relationship? If so, think about what you can do to help reassure yourself—instead of expecting them to validate you or solve your problems. [12] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 10 June 2021. For instance, you might find yourself thinking things like, “Why aren’t they calling me more often? They must be losing interest in me already.” Stop and ask yourself if that thought is realistic. Have they given you other reasons to think they’re not interested? Is it possible that they aren’t calling because they’re busy or shy about talking on the phone? It can be helpful to identify where your insecurities are coming from. For instance, did you have a bad experience in a previous relationship? If so, do you see any real evidence that your current relationship is going the same way? Reader Poll: We asked 1087 wikiHow readers what they were most nervous about when building a friendship with their special someone, and only 10% of them said letting them know more about me.
