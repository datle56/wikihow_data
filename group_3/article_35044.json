In fact, this was the first time in US history that paper money was issued! This makes the 1861 demand note especially rare. So rare, in fact, that only 22 specimens are known to exist. [1] X Research source Value: $300,000-500,000. Around $50,000 for lower-quality bills."

[2] X Research source The 1869 print run, known as the “Rainbow Series” for its vibrant colors, is among the most in-demand bills. Value: $3,700-15,000.

      "content": "For older collectible bills, rarity and condition are king. For $20 bills from before 1980 or so, there are a handful of factors that play into the value of the bill. The two most important factors are undoubtedly rarity and quality, but all kinds of variables play into the demand for the note. [11] X Research source Rarity: How many other specimens exist of a given print run contributes greatly to the bill’s overall value. Condition: The better the condition of the bill, the higher value it will fetch at an auction. Errors: Printing errors and mistakes normally increase the value of a bill. Historical relevance: If the bill was printed for a unique historical reason or it was printed during an especially historical year, it’s likely worth more. Unique serial numbers: For bills printed after 1863, the $20 note has a serial number. If the serial number is unique, interesting, symmetrical, or funny for some reason, the bill is worth more than other bills from that print run. What are they worth? $20 bills produced from (very roughly) 1940-1980 are worth slightly more than face value (usually $21-25) if they’re not in mint condition. The really expensive bills before that were typically produced before 1934—the year the US dropped the gold standard and $20 bills became much more common. [12] X Research source"

For most collectors, they’re looking for notable serial numbers—the unique character set of letters and numbers on the bill.

Selling rare coins or paper money on your own can be difficult, since laypeople don’t have any way to prove the authenticity of a piece.

If you don’t have a shop near you, you can always reach out to an online rare money shop, like Heritage Auctions, Stack’s Bowers, or APMEX.
