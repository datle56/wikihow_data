      "content": "OMEGALUL is a Twitch emote that expresses extreme laughter. Typing OMEGALUL in a Twitch chat is a popular way to show that you find something super funny—it’s similar to saying “ROFL” or “LMAO.” You might use it genuinely to laugh with the chat or a Twitch streamer you’re watching, or teasingly to laugh at a streamer for doing something embarrassing. [1] X Research source For instance, you might mockingly send the OMEGALUL emote in the chat when a Twitch streamer misses something obvious while they’re playing a game. Or, you might send the OMEGALUL emote to laugh along with something funny they said."

      "content": "OMEGALUL is a distorted image of the TotalBiscuit LUL emote. John Bain, who was better known as TotalBiscuit on YouTube and Twitch, was a popular video game critic. In 2013, fans turned an image of him laughing into the popular emote LUL. Later, in 2016, the user DourGent distorted the image of Bain laughing and uploaded it to the Twitch emote website FrankerFaceZ . [2] X Research source The OMEGALUL emote expresses more intense laughter than the LUL emote. The first LUL emote was banned from Twitch because the photo of Bain received a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown. However, a Reddit user found a similar image replacement. In 2017, Twitch made the LUL emote an official emote on the site."
