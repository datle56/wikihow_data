    {
      "title": "Be specific with your order instead of saying \"coffee regular.\"",
      "content": "Be specific with your order instead of saying \"coffee regular.\" “Coffee regular” is a term you should avoid using since regular means something different to every coffee drinker. Tell the person taking your order which blend you want, such as original, decaf, or dark roast. Then mention how much cream and sugar you want. [1] X Research source The amount of cream and sugar is standardized by cup size. If you don’t specify how much you want, you will get 2 of each for a small, 3 for a medium, and 4 for a large."

    {
      "title": "Order coffee \"light and sweet\" for extra cream and sugar.",
      "content": "Order coffee \"light and sweet\" for extra cream and sugar. Ordering a “coffee light and sweet” will get you a slightly weaker but sweeter cup of coffee. This is the standard cup of coffee served at Dunkin Donuts, but with 1 extra serving of cream and sugar. For example, a small cup will include 3 servings of cream and sugar instead of the normal 2."
    },
    {
      "title": "Say \"easy sugar\" to get less sugar than normal.",
      "content": "Say \"easy sugar\" to get less sugar than normal. Saying “easy sugar” shows that you want your coffee with a little less sweetness than the standard cup. It will still have some sugar unless you say you want none. It will also have the usual serving of cream. A small cup easy on the sugar will have 1 serving of sugar instead of 2."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose dark coffee for less cream.",
      "content": "Choose dark coffee for less cream. Dark coffee still has sugar, but comes with less cream than regular coffee. Remember that it will still have some cream in it, so if you don’t want cream at all, tell the employee so they can adjust your order properly. For instance, a small cup will have 1 serving of cream instead of the normal 2. Ordering your coffee with “light sugar” can also mean this. State exactly what you want to ensure that the employees understand your order."
    },
    {
      "title": "Order \"coffee black\" to get no cream or sugar.",
      "content": "Order \"coffee black\" to get no cream or sugar. “Coffee black” is very strong, so be careful! It is coffee without anything added to it. Dunkin Donuts doesn’t provide spare cream or sugar packets, so you won’t be able to adjust your coffee at the restaurant."

    {
      "title": "Specify iced when you want to order cold coffee.",
      "content": "Specify iced when you want to order cold coffee. The employees assume you want hot coffee when you say “regular” or “coffee.” Be sure to say that you want iced coffee so that there is no confusion. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Ask for sugar if you want it with your latte.",
      "content": "Ask for sugar if you want it with your latte. Lattes do not come with cream or sugar. They’re made with either skim milk or whole milk, depending on your preference. If you want sugar added in, ask the employee before they make it. [3] X Research source Lattes can be ordered regular or decaf. The employee will ask you which one you want."

      "title": "Request whipped cream when you want it in your drink.",
      "content": "Request whipped cream when you want it in your drink. Whipped cream is never added to an order unless you ask. When you’re ordering a coolata or an iced latte, specify that you would like whipped cream in order to have it included for no charge. [4] X Research source"
