Wait until about half the buds are swollen before you prune. [1] X Research source A prune just before springtime can actually encourage growth and blooms, so you might get larger flowers."

      "content": "Prune your mini rose bush for maintenance in the winter. Wait until the threat of frost is over. If you trim your roses too early, you could cause them to die back prematurely. Depending on where you live, this could be in mid-February or late March. [2] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source Mini roses don’t need any pruning before winter comes; in fact, cutting them down before the cold weather comes could cause them to die."

      "content": "Shape your rose bush by cutting branches back to the outermost bud. If you’re looking to make your mini rose a little smaller or shrubbier, grab your pruners and hold them at a 45-degree angle to the bush. Cut each branch about 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) above the outermost bud until all the branches are even. [3] X Research source You’ll probably trim off about 1/3 of your rose bush in total. Shaping your rose bush will help prevent “leggy” roses, or branches that grow tall and spindly. Since mini rose bushes are so small, you don’t need to cut them to the ground like typical rose bushes. Try to keep about 2/3 of the plant intact for the best growth and bloom season.

      "content": "Remove any dead or crossing branches. If you see any branches that look weak, brittle, or gray, cut them out near the base of your rose bush. If any of the branches are crossing each other, cut back the weaker one to prevent friction. Branches rubbing together can create friction and lead to weak or dead roses."

      "content": "Cut back older growth to the roots. If you notice any branches that look old or weak, use your pruners to trim them back as close to the roots as you can. This will focus the plant’s energy on creating fresh, new buds instead of keeping the old ones alive.

[9] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source If any blooms give you trouble, use pruners to lop them off instead. The faded blooms may also fall off on their own, in which case there’s no need to deadhead. Deadheading your roses will help focus their energy on new growth instead of old, dead blooms."

Fill your pot or container with well-draining, loamy potting soil, then put the containers outside. [10] X Research source You can place your mini roses near other plants as long as they don’t get shaded out. Most mini roses only grow to be between 6 and 24 inches (15 and 61 cm) tall, so they can easily get lost behind tall grasses and shrubs."

Mix a spray bottle full of hot water with 10 drops of peppermint essential oil, then spray it liberally over your roses for a natural pest repellent."
