      "content": "Purchase colloidal oatmeal. Colloidal oats are a special type of oats. They are not edible like regular oats but are finely ground into a powder, and are used in products like shampoo, shaving gel, and moisturizing cream. Colloidal oats have high levels of starch that moisturize in addition to antioxidants and anti-inflammatories, meaning they work great as a soothing and protective skin agent.

Grind them in a food processor or other grinding mill until they are a fine powder, eliminating any larger flakes. You make as much in advance as you'd like, from a small amount or an entire container."

Then, while the tub is filling, pour the oat powder into the running water stream. This will better disperse the oats into a colloidal solution, meaning that they will be suspended in the water and not sink to the bottom of the tub. Make double sure that they are properly dissolved by stirring the water to break up clumps."
