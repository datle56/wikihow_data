      "content": "Sew the shoulder seams closed. The shoulder seams on your body piece need to be closed before you can sew a sleeve into place. Line up the correct sides of your body pieces so that the shoulder seams are even with each other. Then, pin the edges to secure them and sew along each of the pinned areas. Use your sewing machine to sew a straight stitch about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the raw edges of the fabric. [1] X Research source Do not sew past the shoulder areas. Avoid sewing along the neckline or along the armhole openings. Otherwise, your garment will not function properly."

      "content": "Identify the center of your sleeve. Before pinning and sewing your sleeve to the body piece, it is helpful to identify the central point of the shoulder. This will help to ensure an even fit between your sleeve and shoulder point. Fold your sleeve in half lengthwise and use a piece of chalk to mark the center point (the folded area) of the sleeve at the shoulder. [2] X Research source"

Then, take 1 of your sleeves and turn it so that the correct side of the fabric is facing down towards the body piece. Line up the edges of the shoulder part of your sleeve with the shoulder of your body piece. [3] X Research source"

Make sure that the correct side of the sleeve’s fabric is facing the correct side of the body piece’s fabric. To ensure that the sleeve will be evenly distributed on the armhole opening, start pinning from the center of the shoulder. Identify the central point of your shoulder piece and pin this point to the shoulder seam on your body piece. Then, pin the rest of the sleeve to the armhole opening one side at a time.
