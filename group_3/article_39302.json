      "title": "Trim your ball hair close to the skin with an electric trimmer.",
      "content": "Trim your ball hair close to the skin with an electric trimmer. Situate yourself in front of your bathroom mirror with some good lighting and stand with your legs wider than your shoulders. (If you want to spare yourself some nasty cleanup later, lay something down on the floor to catch the loose hairs). Then, put a short guard on your electric trimmer and start buzzing your ball hair into a short and even layer. [1] X Research source The Lawn Mower® 5.0 Ultra is perfect for this—just pop on the guard on the trimmer blade and keep the flat head flush against your balls, moving against the direction your hair grows in. Use your non-trimmer hand to gently pull your skin taut to get rid of folds and wrinkles that can get caught in the blades. Trim in small sections and take your time . Pull your boys to the left, right, up, down, and any direction you need to get a close trim all over. This is also a great time to tackle your pubic hair and any hair around your shaft, too. Use your non-trimmer hand to hold your penis upward, then trim downward (toward your balls) in short strokes to tackle that under-the-shaft hair. Some guys feel clean and groomed after this step and don’t feel the need to get 100% down to the skin. Short, neatly trimmed ball hair is totally hygienic as long as you wash down there regularly, so if this is you, you’re ready to shower, put on some moisturizer, and be done!"

      "content": "Take a warm shower or bath and wash your groin like normal. Hop in the shower and do your normal routine—wash your face, hair, and body (including your groin). The idea is to wash away loose hairs, sweat, or anything else that makes for an unhygienic shave. After a few minutes, the warm water will also soften your ball hair and make the skin on your scrotum loose and hanging. This makes for an easier, less-likely-to-cut-yourself shave. [2] X Research source Some veteran ball shavers swear by using cold water to firm up the skin before shaving. This might work, but the risk for nicks and cuts is definitely higher."

      "title": "Apply a thin layer of shaving cream, shaving oil, or conditioner.",
      "content": "Apply a thin layer of shaving cream, shaving oil, or conditioner. Choose something gentle with soothing ingredients (like a product with aloe, or an alcohol-free shaving cream or gel for sensitive skin). [3] X Research source You could even use soap or conditioner from the shower—anything that keeps the razor gliding smoothly will work! If possible, use a product that’s clear so you can see what you’re doing down under. If you’re using something opaque, like classic shaving cream, use thin layers so you can still see some of the skin underneath. Reapply as needed while you’re shaving to keep things smooth and prevent irritation."

      "title": "Pull the skin taut and smooth to get rid of wrinkles.",
      "content": "Pull the skin taut and smooth to get rid of wrinkles. Just like you did earlier, spread your legs wide (or put one foot up on the edge of the tub) to give yourself some room. With your non-razor hand, hold your scrotum skin taut and flat to get rid of wrinkles that could catch on a razor or trimmer. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Shave with a safety razor in short strokes away from the penis.",
      "content": "Shave with a safety razor in short strokes away from the penis. Now it’s time to get down to the skin. Start by tackling the under-the-shaft hair (like before, hold your penis up against your abdomen with your non-razor hand and shave downward in short, gentle strokes). Then, move on to the boys. Pull the skin taut in all directions—left, right, up, down, diagonal—and lightly drag the razor across the skin to shave off all the hair . [5] X Research source When you think you’re done, feel around for any remaining patches of hair you missed. Apply more shaving cream and go back for stragglers if needed. Rinse your blade off after every couple of strokes to keep the razor from clogging or tugging at hair. Some guys prefer a 3- or 5-blade razor rather than a single-blade safety razor. This will work too, but your risk of clogging the blade or cutting yourself is higher. Don’t want to use a razor at all? Switch to the SkinSafe® Foil Blade on The Lawn Mower® 5.0 Ultra from MANSCAPED® instead. This attachment shaves all the way down to the skin for an extra smooth, razor-like cut that feels like heaven."

      "content": "Rinse off and gently pat yourself dry. Once you’re satisfied with your handiwork, rinse off your manly bits and gently pat yourself dry with a clean towel. [6] X Research source Remember to pat, not rub yourself dry. You just took a blade to some of the most sensitive skin on your body, and an aggressive rub from a coarse towel could lead to irritation or redness—not what you want to feature after a fresh shave!"

      "content": "Apply a moisturizing aftershave oil, balm, or lotion. Once you’re dry, it’s time to protect against razor burn, dryness, and irritation. Slather on a gentle moisturizer (preferably one that’s fragrance-free and doesn’t contain stinging ingredients like alcohol or menthol) to add a layer of protection to your balls so you only feel that fresh-shaved feeling (and not any itching or discomfort).

      "content": "Wash beforehand and shave with the grain to avoid irritation . Razor burn is irritation caused by shaving and looks like red, itchy, or tender patches on your skin (definitely not something you want down below!). Razor bumps, on the other hand, happen when freshly shaved hairs curl and start growing back into the skin, resulting in irritating red bumps (ingrown hairs). Follow these tips to avoid suffering this fate: [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Shave in the direction of hair growth to avoid potential razor bumps , which are more likely to form when you shave against the grain. Use short, gentle strokes and try not to shave the same area over and over again. Rinse off your blade after every couple of strokes. Moisturize your balls once they’re dry to counteract any irritation that occurred while you were shaving. Store your razor blades in a dry place and replace them frequently to prevent bacterial growth. Don’t wear tight underwear immediately after shaving down there."

Keep the area moisturized with lotion for sensitive skin or aloe and soak in a warm bath every now and then to open up your pores and potentially release the trapped hair. A cool compress or even cucumber slices can soothe irritation and itchiness. [10] X Research source See your doctor if the bumps don’t improve after a few days or start to look worse.

      "title": "Cuts",
      "content": "Cuts Cuts on your scrotum bleed a lot because it’s a sensitive area, but thankfully this also means the cut will heal pretty quickly. To treat razor cuts , hold a clean cloth or gauze pad to the cut for about 10 minutes or until it stops bleeding. Rinse and wash the cut with water and mild soap, then apply an antibiotic ointment twice a day to prevent infection. The cut will probably heal in just 3 to 4 days. If the cut doesn’t heal in a few days, keeps bleeding, or becomes painful or infected, see your doctor."
