The Bible presents this idea in the Book of Revelation: “This calls for wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.” The idea is that the beast is of human origin but might not receive his power from man but from the “dragon” which is another name for Satan.” (Revelation 13:18)"
