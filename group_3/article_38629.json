      "title": "Craft a detailed listing of each item.",
      "content": "Craft a detailed listing of each item. Be sure to include the following information: What is it? Be specific here; there are several different types of baseball gloves, so rather than say “glove,” indicate whether it is a catcher’s mitt, an outfielder’s glove, a batting glove, or some other type. Who owned it? A baseball bat from the 1920s is valuable enough. A baseball bat from the 1920s that once belonged to Babe Ruth is a real treasure. If you have a piece of baseball memorabilia that was once the property of a well-known player, you need to make sure it’s high in your listing. What era is it from? If you don’t know the exact year your item is from, do your best to identify the era. A 1930s baseball has a different value than a 1950s baseball, and the more information you can provide for prospective buyers, the more likely you are to generate a sale. Is it autographed? Autographed memorabilia tends to hold its value better than non-autographed items. If you took the step to have your autograph authenticated, make sure you mention that in the listing. Most collectors prefer authenticated material, and some won’t even bother with any signed item that hasn’t been authenticated. What condition is it in? Condition is everything for memorabilia collectors. Take multiple pictures of each item, detailing any flaws or imperfections that buyers should know about. Failing to disclose nicks, scratches, or scuffs can earn you a bad reputation in the memorabilia industry and make it difficult for you to sell anything. How can interested parties contact you? Try to leave two ways in which buyers can get in touch with you. Some people prefer email to the phone, while others feel the opposite. More contact options will appeal to a larger cross-section of buyers."

      "content": "Set up your auction(s). Use the item description(s) you wrote earlier, and be sure to include as many pictures as you can. You’ll need to decide on a number of settings: [6] X Research source Auction length : How long you want it to run. The top sites allow for short (1 to 3 day) or long (7 to 10 day) auctions, depending on how much of a hurry you’re in to sell your baseball items. The longer the auction, the greater the number of bids you’ll receive. Starting price : The minimum bid for your item. Keeping the starting price low usually encourages a frenzy of early bids, since people see what they perceive to be a great deal and jump on it. Higher starting prices occasionally come with extra fees, so be wary. “Buy it Now” : Bigger auction sites offer sellers the chance to set a price at which buyers can simply purchase the item outright. If a buyer selects “Buy it Now,” the auction ends automatically, and no more bids are accepted. This is a good option if you have a value in mind for your item and you suspect you can get someone to pay the set price. Shipping price and options : How much will it cost to send your item? Do you plan to charge extra for insurance? Are there countries where you will not ship your item? Research your shipping options and include them with the item so bidders know how much more it will cost them to have it delivered."

Ask vendors if they’re interested in what you have, and don’t be insulted if they decline. Many are looking for specific collectibles, and your items might not fit the bill."

If you walk into a show with little room for flexibility, it could be a long day for you. At the same time, do not settle for a vendor’s “best offer” just for the sake of coming away with something. Be courteous but firm. In most cases, you can find middle ground if you work at it.
