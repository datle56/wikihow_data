[7] X Research source Unscrew all 4 screws (they are different sizes, so keep track of which goes where) from the top and bottom of the grated metal plate (which is part of the antenna). Gently pull the grated plate away from the case. Don't pull too hard, as the plate is connected with a cable. Gently pry the antennae connector away from the motherboard.

Here's how to disconnect those pieces: First, remove the Airport wireless antenna. This is a pentagonal-shaped plastic piece that sits against the corner of the optical drive. To remove it, place your pointer finger on top of it to steady it, and pinch the tubular base between your thumb and middle finger. Apply gentle pressure to the base and lift the antenna up and out of the assembly. Next, remove the hard drive sensor cable. This cable is made from 2 small black wires, and is located on the same side of the assembly as the optical drive opening. To disconnect it, grab the small gray plug at the end of the wires and pull it gently from its port. Do not attempt to remove the plug by pulling the wires themselves. Finally, disconnect the flexible cable running between the audio board and the interconnect board. This cable is located on the side of the computer with the external ports, and looks like a wide, thin orange band. To disconnect it, pinch it between your fingers on the side nearest to the optical drive, and pull it out."
