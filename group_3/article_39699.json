      "title": "Tiny beetles climbing on walls or windows",
      "content": "Tiny beetles climbing on walls or windows One of the easiest ways to tell if you have carpet beetles is seeing beetle activity. Adult carpet beetles can be tan, yellow, black, or have a mottled pattern, and they’re frequently seen around windows or climbing walls and doors. If you notice beetles crawling around your windows, it’s a strong sign you have an infestation. [1] X Research source Carpet beetles are more active at night, so you may not notice them during the day. If you only see one beetle, you may not have an infestation. Keep an eye out for more activity or for other signs of infestation."

      "title": "Thinned areas on carpets or rugs",
      "content": "Thinned areas on carpets or rugs Carpet beetles eat many fabrics, but they’re particularly attracted to animal-based fabrics like wool, leather, and fur. When you have an infestation, you may notice bald or fraying patches on your carpets and rugs, which is a result of the larvae’s grazing patterns. They may also damage fabric furniture and other materials. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Clusters of holes in clothes, fabrics, and blankets",
      "content": "Clusters of holes in clothes, fabrics, and blankets Carpet beetles eat animal-based fabrics and textiles, so a common sign of infestation is finding holes in your clothes and other household fabrics. Carpet beetles typically leave behind large groupings of holes, unlike other fabric-eating pests (like moths), which leave smaller, more sporadic holes. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Shed larval skins",
      "content": "Shed larval skins Carpet beetles and their larvae shed their skin several times throughout their life. These skins are typically translucent with a yellow or brown hue, are dry and hollow, and resemble the shape of sunflower seeds. The size varies depending on the species of beetle and the stage of their molting process. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Tiny black or brown fecal pellets",
      "content": "Tiny black or brown fecal pellets Carpet beetle larvae leave behind small fecal pellets that resemble small specks of sand. The color is usually black or brown but can fluctuate depending on what the larvae consume. These pellets are typically found in areas the beetles feed, such as on the floor, at the base of wardrobes, and beneath clothing. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Minor skin rashes",
      "content": "Minor skin rashes Carpet beetles aren’t known to bite humans, but they can cause skin irritation, known as carpet beetle dermatitis. This skin irritation may occur in individuals who are allergic to the small hairs found on carpet beetle larvae. Symptoms include skin irritation, rashes, and welts. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Vacuum all carpets, furniture, and other fabrics.",
      "content": "Vacuum all carpets, furniture, and other fabrics. Regularly vacuum any areas and fabrics that carpet beetles are likely to frequent, such as carpets, rugs, and fabric furniture. Vacuuming will both suck up the bugs themselves and help to remove debris like hair, pet fur, and other organic materials that may attract carpet beetles. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Wash clothes, linens, and fabrics in hot water.",
      "content": "Wash clothes, linens, and fabrics in hot water. Carpet beetles don’t just feast on carpets—they eat other fabrics, too. Regularly launder clothes, linens, and other washable fabrics on the hottest setting possible. The heated laundering will eliminate any bugs or larvae that may be hiding on them and will help prevent future infestations. [9] X Research source Carrillo says if clothes are “laundered or dry cleaned, [it’s] going to be sufficient to get any potential insects out of it. Then, you want to [keep those items contained] until you make sure there are no other carpet beetles left in your home.”"

      "title": "Spread boric acid on carpets and fabrics.",
      "content": "Spread boric acid on carpets and fabrics. If vacuuming alone doesn’t do the trick, spread boric acid on your carpet, fabric furniture, and anywhere else you’ve noticed carpet beetle activity. Boric acid is non-toxic to humans but is lethal to bugs when ingested. It can also help eliminate larvae to prevent future infestations. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Call a pest control specialist. If you can’t seem to get rid of carpet beetles on your own, it may be time to hire a professional pest control specialist. Pest control teams often have access to insecticides and other tools unavailable to the public to get rid of carpet beetle infestations quickly and effectively. [11] X Research source Carrillo says, “If you've done laundering, dry cleaning, carpet cleaning, [and] vacuuming for a couple of weeks and you're still seeing a large population of [carpet beetles], then you really need to contact a pest control professional. At that point, you will need a chemical intervention of some kind.” Want to know what real readers do if they find carpet beetles?

Tuck them away in drawers or hang them up in your closet when you’re done washing them. If you have garments made from animal-based fabrics like wool or fur, store them in an airtight bag or in a cedar closet, as cedar oil naturally repels carpet beetles. [15] X Research source If you’re putting clothes away for the season, consider storing them in a box with mothballs."

      "content": "Carpet beetles are small insects that feast on animal-based fabrics. Carpet beetles are small, oval-shaped beetles that consume fabrics and textiles like wool, silk, fur, and leather. Adults are about the size of a rice kernel. Carpet beetles can be tan, yellow, or black, or they may have a creamy mottled pattern. Their larvae’s bodies are covered in small hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. [17] X Research source Carpet beetles are mostly outdoor pests, but because of their diet, they may come inside and feast on furniture and fabrics around the house. They do not bite."

      "content": "Carpet beetles can damage furniture, carpet, and other fabrics. If an infestation isn’t taken care of quickly, carpet beetles and their larvae can cause extensive damage to many household items. They feed on fabrics like leather, wool, silk, and linen, and therefore create holes in furniture, carpets, bedding, and clothing. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Carpet beetles can sometimes cause health problems. While carpet beetles are not inherently toxic, they may contaminate food sources with their feces and saliva, which contain harmful material. When this food is consumed, it can lead to allergic reactions, respiratory tract irritation, and even a skin condition called carpet beetle dermatitis. [19] X Research source"

      "content": "Do carpet beetles bite? No, carpet beetles do not bite. However, some people may have an allergic reaction to the spiked hairs on carpet beetle larvae, which can cause a minor rash. The beetles can also contaminate food, which, if consumed, can cause respiratory tract irritation and a skin condition called carpet beetle dermatitis. This is why it’s important to remove carpet beetle infestations as soon as possible. [20] X Research source"

      "title": "What is the difference between carpet beetles and bed bugs?",
      "content": "What is the difference between carpet beetles and bed bugs? Carpet beetles are often mistaken for bed bugs because they both leave behind shed skins and fecal pellets. However, bed bugs are flat, red, or tan and do not have wings. Carpet beetles fly and tend to have longer bodies. [21] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Bed bugs are also nocturnal and hide during the day. Because they need blood to produce eggs, they bite, while carpet beetles do not. Carpet beetles also aren’t as likely to be found in beds, as they aren’t attracted to humans and prefer to stay in quiet, secluded areas."

      "content": "Does seeing a carpet beetle mean you have an infestation? Seeing a carpet beetle doesn’t necessarily mean you have an infestation, as it could’ve entered your house on its own. However, be on the lookout for continued activity or other signs of infestation, like molted skins or carpet beetle feces. [22] X Research source Carrillo says, “You can buy regular flat glue boards from your local hardware store to try to pick up the occasional crawler.”"
