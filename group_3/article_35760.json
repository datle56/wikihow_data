      "content": "Gather proof of ownership and proof of insurance. Before you can register a vehicle, you must demonstrate that you own the vehicle and that you have valid insurance to drive it. Typically, your insurance company will file your proof of insurance with the state's database directly after you add the new car to your policy. [2] X Research source You can also print off your insurance cards or policy statement to serve as proof of insurance. It's a good idea to bring these documents with you anyway, just in case. Proof of ownership typically consists of a bill of sale or a Manufacturer's Certificate of Origin. Car dealers typically will point out the paperwork you need to use to establish proof of ownership. If you bought the vehicle from an individual, you'll likely have the title to the vehicle, which the seller has signed over to you."

Check the insert for information on finding the nearest testing location and determining whether your vehicle is exempt. Emissions inspection reports are valid for 12 months.
