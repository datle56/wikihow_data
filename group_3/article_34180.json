      "content": "Have your feet measured to ensure proper fit. There's a lot more to the size of your feet than one simple size number.Go to a shoe store and have your feet measured accurately for all of the following: Length: Get an exact measurement of the length of both of your feet. Getting an exact measurement will help you find the exact right boots since exact sizing can vary. Also, in some cases, your feet may be two different lengths and you will need to adjust for that when buying boots. Width: Width comes into play around the balls of your feet. If your boots are too wide, you've probably suffered from rubbing on the sides of your heels. Many people who get heel blisters have narrow heels due to the heel area of the boot being too big to snugly hold the heel in place. Volume: This is described in terms of whether you have a low, medium, or high volume foot. This measurement describes how bulky or skinny your feet are. Two people can have the same exact shoe size and width and still have a totally different fit in the same pair of boots. Having low volume feet can contribute to heel blisters because your foot will slide up into the extra room in your boot and let your heel lift from the sole."

      "content": "Research brands and models that favor your foot type. Some manufacturers tend to make boots that fit certain criteria. For example, if your feet are narrow, search out brands that cater to narrow feet. [1] X Research source Talk to a sales associate at a local shoe store that specializes in hiking boots. Tell them your needs and ask for brand and style suggestions. Search the web for the specifics of your feet. Try searches such as: \"hiking boot brands narrow heel wide toes,\" \"best hiking boots low volume feet,\"hiking boots narrow feet heels.\""

      "content": "Try on boots before buying them. You may be able to get a good deal for boots online, but you can't guarantee that they will fit your feet correctly. It's very important to know how the boot hits you on every part of your feet before committing to wearing them. Wear the socks you’ll be wearing while hiking when you try on boots. This way, you’ll know how everything feels before you hit the trail. If you do need to buy boots online, get them from a retailer with a flexible return policy. Try them out by wearing them around your house and if they are not a good fit return them."

      "content": "Avoid getting boots that are too small. People tend to buy shoes that are too small for them rather than too big. However, feet swell throughout the day, and more so during a hike, so you do need a bit of extra space in your boots to account for this. Consider trying on hiking boots in the evening, as your feet will be more swollen than in the morning."

Give them a chance to conform to your feet and give your feet a chance to conform to the boots. Start by wearing them around your house. Then wear them on errands and short trips around town. Once you have done that for a week or so, wear them on an easy, short hike. [2] X Research source Be patient and hike in small increments, gradually increasing distance and elevation gain, for the first 15–30 miles (24–48 km) you spend in your new boots."

      "title": "Cinch down the area where your ankle meets your foot.",
      "content": "Cinch down the area where your ankle meets your foot. As you tighten your laces, be sure that the boot is especially snug at the top of the foot because movement in this area is a big cause of heel lift. If that area of the boot is close fitting, there is no room for your heel to pull out of the bottom of the boot. [3] X Research source Tighten the laces so that they are snug but not so much that the pressure hurts or cuts off your circulation."

      "content": "Use a surgeon's knot to create enough tension in the laces of your boots. This technique is great if you want to keep the toe box loose and wide but you want to tighten the boot around your ankle. Start by lacing loosely around the top of your foot and then use a surgeon's knot, also known as a double overhand knot, to allow you to lace more tightly the rest of the way. To make a surgeon's knot: [4] X Research source Cross both of the laces over the top of the foot. Bring one lace over and under the other lace. This is the simple knot everyone makes when starting to tie their shoes. Bring that same lace over and under the other lace again. This extra loop creates extra friction that locks in the tension. Tighten by pulling the laces apart."

      "content": "Use the heel lock technique to keep the lacing tight on short boots. Lace your shoes normally through the lower lacing holes. Stop before you get to the hooks. There are usually two hooks on each side of a hiking boot at the ankle. Instead of diagonally crossing the laces, have them go straight up to the hooks. From the hooks, cross the laces and bring each underneath the opposite section of lace that went straight from the lacing hole to the lacing hook. Then bring the laces back together and tie them tightly. [5] X Research source This technique will create a pulley system that will lock your heel into place."

      "content": "Lace the boots so the tie off point is at the top of the foot. Lace the boot normally until you get to the center point where the boot transitions from eyelets to hooks. At that point cross each lace over the foot and loop one under the other to cinch the boot at the top of the foot. Then cross the foot again with both laces but pull them up and hook them on the very top hook on both sides of the boot. Finally, lace them down until they get back to the top of the foot. [6] X Research source This technique will allow you to have a strong cinch at the top of the foot where your foot flexes and heel slippage can be created."

      "content": "Double up your socks when hiking. If your feet move around a little bit when hiking, another layer of socks can fill up the empty space that allows your to move. The extra socks will also give your feet more cushion as you hike. [7] X Research source However, double socks can make your feet hotter, which can make them sweat more."

      "content": "Buy insoles to help your feet fill out your boots. If your feet are low volume and can't fill up your boots, your heels will easily lift up and down as you hike. However, there are many insoles made specifically for hiking that will raise up your feet and reduce their ability to rub against the boot. Go to your local outdoor store or specialty shoe store and talk to them about what insoles might be right for you. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Make tongue depressors for your boots.",
      "content": "Make tongue depressors for your boots. This is a piece of foam that goes either between your foot and the tongue of your boot, or between the tongue and the laces, to fill out extra space that can't be reduced during lacing. Buy a piece of foam that is about 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) thick from an online retailer or at your local craft store. Cut out two pieces with a pair of scissors to fit the space under or on top of the tongue of your boot that needs to be filled. This is most helpful if you have low volume feet that push up into the tongue area and let the heel come up as you climb."

      "content": "Apply an anti-chafing product to your heels before putting on your socks. Balms made to reduce friction on the body can work really well if you are dealing with heel lift. Simply rub the product all over your heels before you put on your socks to protect the heels from chaffing and blisters. [9] X Research source Choose a product that is a balm, similar to the consistency of stick deodorant, and not a creme or gel. A creme or gel will absorb into your socks and will not be as effective. Follow the directions on the packaging, including how to apply the product and how often to apply it. There are a variety of products available at pharmacies and big box stores that are made to reduce friction."

      "content": "Wear a liner sock to wick moisture away and provide a barrier for friction. Put on a thin pair of natural-fiber socks under your thick hiking socks so that your feet don't rub as much. The idea is that when your feet move in your boots, the liner sock will stay in place and absorb the friction. [10] X Research source This can also be very helpful for people with narrow feet who need to fill up space in their boots."

      "title": "Use wool hiking socks.",
      "content": "Use wool hiking socks. Wool socks manage moisture better under hiking boots because they pull moisture away from the feet instead of holding it in like cotton socks do. Wool socks are available from a wide variety of retailers, both in person and online. [11] X Research source If you have narrow feet, thick wool socks can also help fill up the foot beds of your hiking boots. If you have wide feet, there are thin wool socks that will not add unnecessary bulk. Outdoor stores typically carry a wide variety of wool socks, including thin and thick styles."

If you still feel a blister coming on in spite of your prevention methods, take care of it as soon as possible. Cover it with a protective layer to cushion it from further friction. [12] X Research source The best product to use is moleskin because it is made specifically to cushion your heels in this way. It is a good idea to always carry one of these products when going on a long hike. They can save you from a long painful walk."

This will reduce the amount of moisture in your boots, which will reduce the friction and the chance of blisters forming on your heels. [13] X Research source Even better, switch out your socks for a fresh, dry pair if you have them."
