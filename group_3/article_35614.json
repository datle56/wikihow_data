      "content": "Discuss treatment options for high cortisol with your doctor. High cortisol may result from pituitary or adrenal tumors or long-term use of corticosteroid medications, which can also worsen existing high cortisol levels. Surgery may be the recommended treatment for tumors, and it’s about 80 to 90% successful. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If surgery isn’t an option or effective, talk to your doctor about adrenal-blocking medications that stop your body from producing too much cortisol. [3] X Expert Source Mohammad Dar, MD Board Certified Internist & Health Policy Director Expert Interview. Friday, September 3, 2021. If you're having a tumor removed, you may also take adrenal-blocking drugs for a few weeks before surgery. For those with serious symptoms, such as severe high blood pressure or a weakened immune system, taking medication before surgery can lower the risk for complications. If you have a tumor that's in a hard to reach location or the risks of surgery outweigh the benefits, your doctor may not recommend surgery for you. If they decide surgery isn't an option, they'll usually recommend a long-term medication regimen to help manage your cortisol levels."

This makes it a good option for managing severe symptoms in the short-term. A typical starting dose is 250 mg 3 times per day, but doses of up to 8,000 mg per day are sometimes required.

Side effects may include stomach pain, weight loss, and nausea. Tell your doctor if you experience side effects, as they may be a sign that your dose is too high. Metyrapone usually isn't prescribed for long-term management of high cortisol levels. Long-term use of this medication can lead to acne, potassium deficiency, high blood pressure, and unusual hair growth in women. [6] X Research source"

[11] X Expert Source Mohammad Dar, MD Board Certified Internist & Health Policy Director Expert Interview. Friday, September 3, 2021. If a non-steroid alternative isn’t available, ask your doctor about delayed-release corticosteroids, which may lower the risk for harmful side effects. For instance, a delayed-release form of prednisone is now available for the management of rheumatoid arthritis. Even if you're able to switch medications, your doctor will need to gradually decrease your dosage amount to wean you off of the corticosteroid. Stopping a corticosteroid abruptly is not recommended."
