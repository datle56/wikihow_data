      "content": "Mewing is a beauty technique meant to change the shape of your jawline. Named after Dr. John Mew, a British orthodontist, the facial reconstruction technique involves pushing your tongue against the roof of your mouth with the intention of giving your jaw a more defined look. It’s meant to be an at-home alternative to orthognathic surgery and other orthopedics. However, there is no scientific evidence to support this. [1] X Research source Mewing has gone viral across social media platforms, with over 2 billion views on TikTok alone. The technique’s popularity grew when John Mew’s son, Michael Mew, started posting videos about it on his YouTube channel. Viewers hoped and believed mewing would give them jawlines similar to influencers and models like Bella Hadid. [2] X Research source Please note that Dr. John Mew was stripped of his dental license by the General Dental Council for publicly criticizing traditional orthodontics and running false advertisements suggesting the GDC supported mewing. [3] X Research source His son, Michael Mew, was also expelled from the British Orthodontic Society for advocating his father’s theories."

      "content": "Position your tongue against the roof of your mouth. Sit up straight and make sure your neck is in a straight, comfortable position. Close your mouth and press your tongue against the roof of your mouth, keeping it flat and engaged. Keep your mouth closed throughout the entire process. [4] X Research source Before mewing, seek professional guidance from a medical expert to determine if the technique is safe for you to do. If your doctor approves, go ahead and give it a try. If they don’t, it’s better to try a different method for your safety."

      "content": "Push your tongue as hard as you can. Allow your teeth to touch lightly, like you’re just biting down, and forcefully press your tongue against the roof of your mouth. Make sure you’re not clenching or grinding your teeth. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Hold the position for a few minutes. Keep pushing your tongue as hard as you can for 2 or 3 minutes. Then, relax slightly to where you’re only using half the force. Keep this position for another couple of minutes, then halve the force again. Repeat this process several times until the action is very light. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Mewing temporarily makes your jawline look more defined.",
      "content": "Mewing temporarily makes your jawline look more defined. When you’re actively holding the pose, your jaw may appear tighter and more defined. This works well if you want to look a certain way for a photo, but there is no scientific evidence that mewing permanently tightens your jawline. [7] X Research source Despite the lack of scientific evidence, many social media influencers have shared positive results from the method, claiming mewing slimmed down their cheeks and increased cheekbone definition. Some supporters also claim mewing benefits include helping with jaw pain, breathing, and orthodontic issues. Some even say it helps with sleep apnea. Again, however, there is no credible research to prove these claims. [8] X Research source Many doctors advise against mewing, especially for long periods of time, because it can cause harm to your mouth and jaw. Keeping your teeth pressed together may cause them to wear down and lead to cracks in the enamel, and the unnatural positions of your tongue and jaw may lead to neck and mouth pain and the misalignment of your teeth."

      "content": "Try gua sha. Gua sha is a traditional Chinese technique in which you scrape your skin with a stone tool to improve circulation, reduce inflammation, and relieve pain. Slowly drag your gua sha tool upward across your jawline, cheeks, forehead, and eyes to promote lymphatic drainage and tighten your skin. [9] X Research source Typically, people use gua sha tools made of jade or rose quartz . The term gua sha translates to “to scrape away illness.” While gua sha is an important traditional practice and is still used by many today, know that its benefits currently have little scientific evidence."

      "content": "Get a lifting and firming facial massage. Give yourself a facial massage or get one from a professional. Start by moisturizing your face , then sweep your fingers down the bridge of your nose and under your eyes. Use the same process for your cheeks, forehead, and chin, moving your fingers upward and outward in a circular motion. The process is similar to that of gua sha, just without a tool. [10] X Research source Since you’re trying to lift and sculpt your face, never pull your skin downward while massaging."

      "title": "Wear a “jaw bra” face mask.",
      "content": "Wear a “jaw bra” face mask. Also known as face bras, jaw bras are trendy beauty products that are worn like face masks—they go under your chin and hook around your ears. They’re meant to tighten your skin and sculpt your jaw, and they work by compressing the chin and decreasing the amount of lymphatic fluid in the area. [11] X Research source Jaw bras are typically made of a woven cotton material similar to that of athletic tape and are infused with skin-soothing ingredients like niacinamide and peppermint. In addition to sculpting your chin, they may also hydrate your skin. Like mewing, jaw bras only temporarily sculpt your jaw, and results usually fade after 3 hours or so. Wearing a jaw bra occasionally is mostly harmless, but using one frequently can reduce muscle tone, which in turn will make your skin sag more."

      "content": "Consult your dermatologist or orthodontist for a permanent solution. Since mewing only temporarily tightens your jaw and shouldn’t be done for long periods, it’s best to see a professional if you want permanent results. Ask your dermatologist about in-office skin-tightening treatments, or visit your orthodontist to correct jaw positioning or teeth alignment. [12] X Research source"
