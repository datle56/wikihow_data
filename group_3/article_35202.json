      "content": "She holds eye contact with you. While she might glance from time to time to check you out, a longer stare is a better signal that you’ve captured her attention. When you see her peering your way, match her gaze to see how she reacts. If she holds eye contact for a few seconds before looking away, it’s a really good cue that she wants to get to know you better.

      "content": "She does a head toss or hair flip. When you’re checking her out, see if the woman tilts her face up and tosses her head back. Alternatively, she may run her fingers through her hair and flip it to the side of her head. Either way, there’s a good chance that she’s trying to get your attention with her exaggerated movements.

      "title": "She exposes her neck or inner wrist.",
      "content": "She exposes her neck or inner wrist. A woman may push her hair behind her ear to show you her neck, or turn her hands toward you so you can see the insides of her wrists. Both of these moves are sensual signals that she’s vulnerable and wants you to come chat with her. [6] X Research source A woman might do this from across the room or when she's having a conversation with you. If she brushes her hair away from her ear when you’re talking, it may just mean she’s trying to hear you better."

      "content": "She fidgets with her hair or outfit. A woman may “preen” herself once you’ve seen her to make sure she’s looking her best.

If you keep catching each other’s eye, she may switch to a bigger flirtatious smile to signal that she’s really interested and excited by thought of chatting with you. [8] X Research source A half smile without showing teeth might mean that a woman is just being friendly. Watch her other body language to see if she’s really interested in you."

      "title": "She moves closer to you.",
      "content": "She moves closer to you. You see the woman from across the room and then the next time you see her, she’s a few steps closer.

      "title": "She has an open and relaxed posture.",
      "content": "She has an open and relaxed posture. When a woman keeps her arms at her sides and turns toward you, she’s telling you that she feels at ease and comfortable around you.

      "title": "She stops smiling or frowns.",
      "content": "She stops smiling or frowns. When a woman quickly changes her expression when she sees you or as she’s talking, she’s probably not interested in anything at the moment.

      "content": "She crosses her arms. When a woman crosses her arms in front of her chest, her body language says she’s closed off toward conversations.
