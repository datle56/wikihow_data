      "content": "Hang curtains or drapes to block light during the hottest hours. Curtains cover the window only and drapes go all the way down to the floor. Both are effective, but drapes are better at blocking light. Go with closed-weave, heavy fabrics in light, opaque colors, and hang the drapery as close to the window as possible. Drapes and curtains with white plastic backings may reflect even more light.

      "content": "Try vertical or horizontal blinds for a cost-efficient way to reduce heat. Slat-type window blinds are an affordable solution and allow you to control glare, light, and heat by simply adjusting the slats. Look for highly reflective blinds in a style you like and keep them tightly closed during the hottest part of the day. [3] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Department of Energy Official site for the U.S. Department of Energy, which provides resources related to energy safety, conservation, and efficiency Go to source If you have horizontal blinds, consider painting your interior walls a light color. Horizontal slats reflect sunlight onto the ceiling and light colors diffuse that light effectively without creating a lot of heat or glare. Blinds aren't as effective as drapery at blocking light and heat, but being able to adjust them is a nice plus. Blinds with reflective finishes on the outward-facing side are the best choice."

      "content": "Install roller or roman shades indoors for an inexpensive option. These shades are easy to install and won’t put a huge dent in your wallet. Typically, you attach a roller bar at the top of the window and lower the shades with an attached cord. Roman shades are fairly similar but they’re made of fabric. Heavier fabrics are the most effective, so look for tight, thick weaves.

      "content": "Apply window film or tint to the glass to block out UV rays and heat. Window film is translucent—it blocks UV rays and greatly reduces heat, but still allows light to come through. Just stick the adhesive film to the exterior glass and you’re all set! If you want more shade and privacy, go with adhesive window tint instead. You can choose from a variety of tint shades and thicknesses.

Anchor the shade frames to your home's exterior for a permanent solution, or try low-cost temporary attachments like suction cups, hook-and-loop fastener, or snaps. Exterior roller shutters: These interlocking aluminum or plastic slats create a protective barrier over windows and roll up neatly at the top when you’re not using them. They're operated from indoors with a crank or remote control. Exterior hinged shutters: These shutters are usually made of wood or vinyl, and they must have the hinge to be operable and adjustable. Since they’re commonly sold as decorative elements only, make sure you buy the hinged type. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Attach awnings above windows to block heat and glare. Awnings are roof-like shelters made of fabric or metal. You install them above the window and they extend down and out to create shade. Light-colored awnings reflect the most light. Choose fixed awnings if you live in a hot climate with long summers. Go with retractable awnings if you want to control when the awnings are visible. Place awnings above south-facing or eastern windows for peak efficiency. If the afternoons are blazing hot, awnings above western windows are also helpful. If you live in the Southern Hemisphere, attach awnings over north-facing and western windows instead. [9] X Research source Awnings must be ventilated so they don’t trap heat around windows. Make sure yours have grommets, eyelets, or some other form of ventilation.

If you want window shade the first year, buy a 6–8 ft (1.8–2.4 m) deciduous tree at a local nursery. Plant the tree on the south side of your home at least 10–15 ft (3.0–4.6 m) away from the nearest wall.

      "content": "Use insulation, weatherstripping, and caulk to seal your home. Apply weatherstripping under the doors and seal off cracks and crevices with caulk to keep your home insulated. If you have an attic, it’s a good idea to install additional insulation there since heat tends to get trapped in attics. [17] X Expert Source Alberto DeJesus Construction Specialist Expert Interview. 15 December 2021. If you have a two-story house, consider adding more insulation to the second story, as well. The type of insulation you use depends on your climate and home heating system. In most cases, use a minimum of R-30. If your climate has extremely cold winters, go with R-49."

      "content": "Apply a reflective coating to your roof for a simple option. About one-third of unwanted heat comes into your home through the roof. One way to block some of that heat is to apply a reflective coating on your existing rooftop. In most cases, you just brush the coating right over the shingles or other roof material. There are two types: A white latex coating that applies easily over common roof materials like shingles, tar paper, and metal. The coating needs to be reapplied every 5 years. An asphalt-based coating for metal or asphalt roofs. It’s long-lasting but has a tacky surface that tends to collect dust, making the surface less reflective over time. If applied correctly, reflective coatings can dramatically reduce how often you run your air conditioner."

A single piece of radiant barrier can reduce ceiling heat by 25%. You can apply multiple layers to increase the heat-busting properties. If you need more insulation, look for the vented, multi-layer radiant barriers. They have insulating fiber-reinforced backing (rather than paper)."

      "content": "Pave the driveway with a mix of asphalt and concrete to reflect heat. Traditional pavement materials heat up quickly and increase heat around your home. If you’re pouring new pavement or thinking about repaving your current driveway, use a mixture of asphalt and concrete. This mixture reflects more light and evaporates water fast. There are also reflective coatings you can apply to pavement to make them more reflective. If you want to go green, consider using good old grass instead of traditional pavement materials."
