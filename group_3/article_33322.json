So, four players are ideal for this game. The dealer shuffles and then deals out six cards to each player. The dealer should hand out the cards in the pattern of 1, then 2, then 3 cards per deal.

The bidding starts with the person to the left of the dealer, and goes in a circle. You can bid 2, 3, or 4 cards. The bid represents the number of points that you think you will get in this hand. If you aren't confident at all, you may pass, unless you are the last to bid (i.e. the dealer) and everyone else has passed, in which case you have to bid at least 2. [3] X Research source"

The point of bidding is to figure out who is the most confident in their hand, because that is the person who is going to get to choose the trump suit. [4] X Research source"

The first card that they throw down becomes the trump suit. Therefore, if you have the ace of spades, the two of spades, and the jack of spades, you probably want to bid four, because then you will get to make \"spades\" the trump suit and you will probably be able to get four points.

If not, he gets negative of those points. Meanwhile, anyone else who scores points gets them free of charge (i.e., if the bidder bid 3, and he got high low and game, he gets 3 points). The person who got jack gets 1 point. If the bidder bid 3, and got high and low, he gets negative three points. Whoever got jack gets a point, whoever got game gets a point. Points are assigned as follows: [9] X Research source 1 point to the lowest trump card played. 1 point to the highest trump card played. 1 point to the jack of trump. 1 point to \"game.\" This is the person with the highest number, if you count the 10 card of any suit as 10 and each jack as 1, queen as 2, king as 3, ace as 4."
