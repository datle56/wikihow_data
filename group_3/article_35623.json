Whichever activity you choose, make sure it makes you sweat, elevates your heart rate, and leaves you thinking, “Wow, this is tough!” Aim to work out for a minimum of 30 minutes at least 3 times per week. Studies show that vigorous exercise significantly reduces inflammation.

It helps to relax you both mentally and physically. In at least 1 study, researchers found that this type of yoga significantly reduced elevated ESR. To do yoga nidra : [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Lie flat on your back on a mat or other comfortable surface. Listen to the voice of your yoga instructor. If you don’t have a yoga studio that offers nidra, download a yoga app or find an audio recording or video online.
