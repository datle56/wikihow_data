      "content": "Choose a slightly larger pot. If you’re repotting your plant into a new pot, choose a pot that is 1 to 2 inches larger in diameter and 1 to 2 inches deeper than the plant’s current pot. If you choose a pot that has dimensions larger than this, the roots will need to grow into the pot before the plant itself can begin to grow. In other words, the plant has to grow all the way down before it can grow upward. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a pot with drainage holes. When you’re selecting a new pot, make sure it has drainage holes to allow excess water to drain. Even if you select a pot that is the correct size, you still don’t want water sitting in the bottom of it and causing root rot. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Clean and disinfect the pot. It’s important to disinfect old pots before reusing them, as they can accumulate minerals or other debris that are detrimental to plant growth. Mineral salts, for example, can dehydrate your plant and keep it from flourishing. Other debris can harbor disease-causing organisms. [3] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source To disinfect your pot, soak it in a solution containing one part bleach and nine parts water for at least ten minutes. Place it in a solution of water and dish detergent and then rinse. To clean mineral deposits and debris from a steel pot, use steel wool or a wire-bristle brush to scrub them away. Plastic pots only need a scrubbing pad. You can scrape off any remaining deposits with a knife. Once you’ve cleaned the pot, rinse it with water and then soak it until ready for use."

Terra cotta is pretty porous, which means it soaks up water easily. You don’t want your pot stealing your plant’s water.

Cover the drainage holes with something that will allow water to pass through, like paper towel or a coffee filter. Using a porous material like paper towel or a coffee filter over the drainage holes will allow water to pass through so your plant doesn't drown, but it slows down the process so the water can actually soak into the soil and help your plant.

Don’t overfill the pot before you put the new plant in – the roots need something to grow into, but you also want them to be down far enough into the pot that they don’t stick out of the top.

[7] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source The rootball is the part of the plant that extends into the actual pot.

Clip off roots that hang below the rootball and make three or four slits in the bottom of the rootball about a third of the way up. [11] X Research source If the rootball is black or smells, your plant might have some kind of fungal disease. You might not be able to save this plant or repot it.

You might need to add more soil to fill in empty spots once you water the new plant and the soil settles. [17] X Research source It’s also best to keep the plant out of the sun and high humidity after repotting. Don’t fertilize it immediately, either."
