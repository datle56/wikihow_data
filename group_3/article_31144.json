Whether you’re dealing with anger, resentment, shame, or heartbreak, allow yourself to grieve the loss of your relationship for as long as you need to; embracing your emotions is the fastest way to get over someone.

It’s okay to hold onto those feelings for a little while, but try to convince yourself that they aren’t your soulmate.

      "content": "Going no contact, at least for a little while, can help you heal.

Set healthy boundaries to give yourself time and space, and don’t be afraid to be as specific as possible. [4] X Research source For instance, you might ask them to stop texting you for the next 2 weeks, or tell them that you need a significant break until you’re ready to resume the friendship. Remember, it’s up to you to decide how long you stay away; some people might only need a few weeks, while other people might need a few years. Prioritize your well-being, and let your emotions guide your decision."

      "content": "Keeping yourself busy can help you move forward more quickly.

Instead, make time to do the things that you love, such as drawing, singing, or cooking. Filling your time with fun activities can help you take your mind off of the situation and overcome any negative emotions. [6] X Research source Exercising is a great way to distract yourself, and the flow of endorphins can help boost your mood. Whether it’s dancing, pilates, or HIIT, sign up for a fun workout class to make you feel (and look) your best. Try to get out of the house as much as possible, even if it’s just going out for a 20-minute walk around your neighborhood. Spending time outside can help clear your mind and make you feel better.

      "content": "Silence negative thoughts to help you rebuild your self confidence. While it’s normal to think badly about your situation or how you handled the one-sided love, talking down to yourself can make it harder to move forward. Instead, try to reframe a negative thought into something positive or remind yourself that your thoughts aren’t reality. [12] X Research source For example, you might think, “No one loves me the way I love them.” But you can challenge that negative thought by saying, “That’s not true, I’ve had many fulfilling relationships in the past. This just wasn’t one of them.” Or, you might think, “I’ll always be alone.” You can challenge this by asking yourself, “How do I know that’s true? I can’t see the future. I might not be in a relationship now, but I have friends and family members that I love. Plus, I might meet someone new in the future.”"
