If you do this method with the wrong battery, the battery will likely be destroyed. All Macs have lithium batteries, and many modern Windows computers also use lithium batteries . [1] X Research source You shouldn't perform this process on a computer with a non-removable battery pack, as doing so will either require you to remove the battery (which can void your computer's warranty) or freeze the whole computer (which will ruin your computer)."

Discharging your laptop's battery all the way can cause the battery's life to drop by 30% after between 300 and 500 discharges, while discharging to 50% requires well over 1000 discharges before the battery will lose a comparable amount of its lifespan. [4] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source Ideally, you'll only ever discharge your laptop's battery to around 20%. This will allow for over 2000 discharges before you hit the 70% battery life mark. To keep your battery in good working order, let it discharge down to about 20% battery once a month or so. That allows the chemicals inside the battery to get mixed up, so it will actually last longer than if you leave your laptop plugged in all the time.
