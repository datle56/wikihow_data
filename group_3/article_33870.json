Some appliances will also have a convection bake or roast setting. Use the setting that applies to the food you plan on cooking. [2] X Research source If you're making cookies, cakes, or pies, you should set the oven to convection bake. If you're cooking a pot roast or turkey, you should set the oven to convection roast."

      "content": "Preheat to 25°F (14°C) below the conventional oven temperature. Since convection ovens cook your food more evenly than a traditional oven, you should reduce the temperature. Look at the recipe that you’re cooking and reduce the temperature to 25°F (14°C) less than what the recipe calls for. Input your cooking temperature into the keypad or turn the dial to the appropriate temperature. [3] X Research source Some appliances will automatically adjust the temperature for convection cooking. Refer to the user's manual to see if your oven automatically adjusts the temperature."

Take a look at your recipe and check on your food once 75% of the cooking time has passed. If the sides are burning but the center is still cold, you may want to reduce the heat.

To maintain the preheated temperature, don't open the microwave door or turn the microwave off. Instead, place your food in the microwave as soon as possible and start cooking it. If you had to turn off the microwave or wait to cook your food, you'll have to preheat the convection microwave again. [10] X Research source"

If you notice that the outside of the food is burning but the center is uncooked, it's a sign that your convection oven temperature is too high. Reduce the temperature and cook the food for a longer period of time to compensate for the lower temperature. Check the food frequently to determine when it's done."
