      "content": "An otter is a hairy, lean gay man. An otter is a subtype in the LGBTQ+ community that refers to someone who’s lean and skinny, like a twink, but hairy, like a bear. Otters are typically gay men, but the term can be used by anyone to self-describe their hairy, lean body, including bisexual and pansexual men. There’s lots of range in the otter subtype too, as they can be skinny and slim or lean and athletic, with the only requirement being that they have adequate amounts of body hair. [1] X Research source Since otters tend to be gay men, their pronouns are usually he/him/his, but always ask instead of assuming!"

Unlike twinks or hunks, who are always either skinny or well-built and athletic, otters range from slim or lean to athletic and stocky. They never get as big as bears (or else they’d be bears, not otters), but they always sport a hairy body like them. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "The origin of otters is unknown, but it’s a subset of the bear, which emerged in 1979. When the term bear was first coined in George Mazzei’s article Who’s Who at the Zoo, it was used to describe all hairy gay guys. But larger gay people began to use it to describe themselves, making way for the otter subtype, as slimmer bears needed a way to describe themselves. Mazzei’s subtypes paved the way for other gay subtypes, with his other six being as follows: [4] X Research source Owls: Owls are older gays who are beloved by everyone. They’re slightly sarcastic and wear outlandish clothes and jewelry. Cygnet Swans: Elegant, beautiful gays who dedicate their lives to looking beautiful. They tend to be snobby and have a great fashion sense. Pekes and Afghans: Well-postured, even-mannered gays who tend to go overboard with the people they like. Gazelles: Warm gays with hearts of gold who take a business-esque approach to love, life, and happiness. Pussycats: Chatty, dry-witted gay guys who are independent, clean, and return exactly as much affection as they receive. Marmosets: Attractive, smaller, manicured bears with good taste and cold, unfeeling personalities. While many of the subtypes outlined by Mazzei aren’t as popular today, the bear has stuck around."
