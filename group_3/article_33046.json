      "content": "Choose which brawler you want to use. Currently, there are over 80 brawlers which all have a unique offensive and defensive kit. Each brawler has different attacks, so make sure you choose the right one! We'll show you how to obtain more brawlers later."

      "title": "Choose which game mode to play.",
      "content": "Choose which game mode to play. There are 7 main game modes, Gem Grab, Brawl Ball, Heist, Hot Zone, Siege, Bounty, and Showdown. Sometimes there are special game modes, including Robo Rumble, Super City Rampage, Boss Fight, and Big Game. Each special game mode has levels from Normal to Insane. In Gem Grab, the objective is to get to 10 gems the fastest. Avoid dying because you will leave any gems you're carrying on the ground. Get gems from the Gem Mine, or collect them from other opponents when they are defeated. At the end of the game, the team with the most gems wins, even below 10 gems. In Bounty, kill your opponents to get stars for your team. If your team has more stars at the end, you will win. There's a blue star in each game, which counts as an extra star. In Brawl Ball, try to throw the ball into the other team's goal. You can also kill them to give your side a brief advantage. In Siege, try to collect bolts to build your team's Siege Bot, so the Siege Bot can attack the other team's IKE turret. Win by doing more damage to the other team's turret, or by destroying it completely. In Heist, your goal is to destroy the enemy safe and defend your own. In Hot Zone, your goal is to stay in a hot zone. A hot zone is an area that players can enter to gain points for their team. But be careful! When you die, the other team can enter the hot zone and gain more points than your team! The first team to get to 100 points wins! In Showdown, you want to be the last brawler alive. Break open crates to collect power cubes. Power cubes increase the damage you deal and increase your health."
