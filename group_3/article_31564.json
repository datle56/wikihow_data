Essentially, they allow Windows and other programs to gain functionality without having to have that functionality built-in. [1] X Research source DLL files are an essential part of Windows programming, and lead to sleeker, more efficient programs."

Sometimes you may be asked during the installation of community-made programs to place DLL files in specific locations. Make sure that you trust the program before following these instructions, as DLL files can be malicious. If you're interested in learning how DLL files are constructed, see the next section."

      "content": "Register a new DLL . If you have had to manually copy a DLL file into a folder for a program to use, you may need to register it in the Windows Registry before it can be used. Refer to the program's documentation to determine if you'll need to perform this step (it is extremely uncommon for most Windows programs). [3] X Research source Open the Command Prompt . You can find this in the Start menu or by pressing the Windows key + R and typing cmd . Navigate to the location of the new DLL file. If you are using Windows 7 or newer, open the folder containing the new DLL file, hold the Shift key and right-click in the folder, and select \"Open command window here\". The Command Prompt will open directly to that folder. Type regsvr32 dllname .dll and press Enter. This will add the DLL file to Windows Registry.

In order to see the code that makes a DLL file work, you will need to use a decompiler to revert it back into readable code. Opening a DLL file without a decompiler (such as opening it with Notepad ) will result in a jumbled mess of unreadable characters. dotPeek is one of the more popular free decompilers.
