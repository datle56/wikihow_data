      "content": "Avoid letting your hair air-dry to prevent it from quickly falling flat. If you’re used to letting your hair dry naturally, add in some time after each wash to dry your locks. The weight of your wet hair will pull your roots flatter against your scalp, and it’s hard to combat that look, even with the best styling techniques. [1] X Research source Especially in humid conditions, it’s important to completely dry your hair before you leave the house. Otherwise, more and more moisture will get into your hair, causing it to lay flat on your head. If you hate the idea of using heat on your hair, try using the lowest-heat setting on your dryer. It will take a little longer to dry, but it’ll be less damaging to your hair."

Use a brush to lift your hair along the roots and dry the underside of the hair with the concentrator nozzle. Drying the underside of the roots while they’re pulled up helps them hold a more voluminous shape than if you pulled them flat against your scalp and dried them that way. If you’re dealing with curly hair, try drying your roots with the concentrator nozzle and then using a diffuser for the rest of your hair. The diffuser will help dry your curls with minimum frizz."

      "content": "Use a round brush and blow-dry your hair in sections for maximum volume. Pin the top half of your hair up so you can dry the bottom layer first; if you have thick hair, you may even want to separate your hair into three layers.

[5] X Research source This is especially easy to do if you’re rocking a wavy, messy style, as you can repeatedly flip your hair from side to side without having to check that your part is perfectly straight."
