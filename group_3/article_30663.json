If you need to, you can convert your measurement afterwards! [2] X Research source You can use a ruler as an alternative to the tape measure. If you’re looking for more screen space, try connecting your laptop to a monitor . Or, you can always hook it up to a projector ."

      "content": "Find your starting measuring point. Screens are typically measured diagonally , so your starting point will be one corner of the screen. Screen size only measures the actual screen, not the enclosure or bezels, so start your measurement where the visible part of the screen starts."

      "content": "Extend your tape measure to the opposite corner. Remember that you are measuring just the visible portion of the screen, not any of the enclosure. Warning: Make sure not to scratch your screen with the tape measure. You can hold the tape measure a couple centimeters away from the screen while measuring. Screens were originally measured diagonally to make the size sound more impressive."

      "content": "Convert your measurements to tenths of an inch. Most retailers advertise screens in tenths of inches (15.3\", 17.1\", etc.), but most tape measures are marked in 16ths of an inch. To convert to a decimal form, divide the number of 16th marks by 16. For example, if you measure your screen as 14 and 4/16th inches, divide 4 by 16 to get 0.25 inches. Add that to 14 for a total of 14.25 inches."
