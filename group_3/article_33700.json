      "title": "Heat some oil in a frying pan.",
      "content": "Heat some oil in a frying pan. Use a steel pot or a pan with steep sides. The exact amount of oil you need depends on the volume of sorghum you’ll be popping. Typically, you’ll need two tablespoons of cooking oil for every ¼ cup (32 grams) sorghum kernels. Heat the oil on high until it appears shiny. [1] X Research source Coconut oil is the most common type of oil for popping sorghum. It adds a buttery flavor and is very healthy."

    {
      "title": "Add your kernels.",
      "content": "Add your kernels. The amount of kernels you’ll need to add to the oil depends on how much oil you’ve put in the pan. If you’ve used only two tablespoons of oil, you’ll only be able to pop about ¼ cup (32 grams) sorghum kernels. [2] X Research source ¼ cup (32 grams) sorghum kernels makes about two cups of popped sorghum."
    },
    {
      "title": "Reduce the heat.",
      "content": "Reduce the heat. When you add the kernels, the range should be set to high heat. After adding the kernels, reduce the heat to medium-high. Do not cover the pan as you would when making popcorn. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Stir the kernels constantly.",
      "content": "Stir the kernels constantly. Use a wooden spoon to move the kernels around the pan. Continue stirring until the time between pops is about 10 seconds. Do not leave your sorghum alone while popping on the range. Failing to stir the kernels – and failing to stop stirring when most kernels have popped – will result in burning. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Bag your sorghum kernels.",
      "content": "Bag your sorghum kernels. Place ¼ cup (32 grams) sorghum kernels in a small paper bag. Roll the open end of the bag up tightly and fold it so it stays closed. Do not use a plastic bag, as it will melt. [5] X Research source If you wish to encourage popping, toss the kernels in a small bowl with a bit of melted butter or oil. Place the bag on a plate if you do this so you don’t end up with a greasy mess in your microwave."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place your bag in the microwave.",
      "content": "Place your bag in the microwave. With your bag of sorghum closed, place the closed fold face-down in the microwave. Set the heat for two minutes. Check the sorghum after the timer expires. If a significant amount of sorghum remains unpopped, microwave it for another minute. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the sorghum from the microwave.",
      "content": "Remove the sorghum from the microwave. As your sorghum pops, it will make an audible sound. When the sound of popping sorghum falls to a frequency of less than once every few seconds, take your sorghum out and pour it into a bowl. [7] X Research source Your sorghum should not need more than three minutes to pop. If it does, consider increasing the strength setting on your microwave."

    {
      "title": "Choose the right popper.",
      "content": "Choose the right popper. Because sorghum is lighter than popcorn, hot air poppers will generally not work for popping sorghum. Some hot air poppers, however, are acceptable. If your hot air popper blows air up and out of the machine, do not attempt to pop sorghum with it. If your hot air popper blows hot air in a circular pattern within the machine, use it to pop sorghum. [8] X Research source Check your hot air popper’s user manual to determine if popping sorghum is possible. Alternately, you could cover your hot air popper with a mesh net of the sort used when steaming vegetables. This will prevent your sorghum kernels from escaping the hot air popper, even if it is of the variety that blows hot air up and out from the center."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the hot air popper run for two minutes.",
      "content": "Let the hot air popper run for two minutes. This will give the hot air popper time to warm up. If you add sorghum kernels to the hot air popper before it’s warm, the kernels will dry out and be unable to pop properly. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Add your sorghum kernels.",
      "content": "Add your sorghum kernels. Turn your hot air popper off and sorghum kernels in a volume that is appropriate for your hot air popper. Turn the hot air popper on and listen for the sorghum to start popping. When popping slows to once every five seconds or so, turn the machine off and dump the popped sorghum into a bowl. [10] X Research source Different hot air poppers have different limits. Check your user manual for information regarding what an appropriate weight or volume of sorghum kernels might be in your device. You may see a bit of smoke even when your sorghum is popping within the prescribed times. Monitor the sorghum and remove it from the hot air popper after popping slows."

      "content": "Top with sea salt. Sea salt is a common topping for popped sorghum. Transfer popped sorghum to a large mixing bowl and add about one teaspoon sea salt per four cups (32 grams) of popped sorghum. [11] X Research source Sea salt has the same basic nutritional profile as regular salt, but it is less heavily processed.

      "content": "Use nutritional yeast. Nutritional yeast is a yellow powder with a nutty flavor. It contains vitamin B12 and other B-complex vitamins. Don’t apply nutritional yeast too liberally, though, since unlike salt and most other sorghum toppings, it adds calories. [13] X Research source"
