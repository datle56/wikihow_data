Order the words in your sentence the same way you would in English, putting the pronoun that signifies you first, then the verb, then the pronoun for the person you're speaking to. [6] X Research source For example, if you are male and you want to say \"I love you\" in Vietnamese to your younger significant other who is also male, you would say \"Anh yêu em.\" If they're older, you would say \"em yêu anh.\""

Use the same pronoun rules as you would for \"I love you,\" but instead of using the verb \"yêu,\" you'll use the verb \"thích.\" Say your pronoun first, followed by the verb, then the pronoun that refers to the person you're speaking to. [7] X Research source For example, if you're female and wanted to tell your younger female friend that you like her (maybe as more than just a friend), you could say \"Chi thích em.\""

[8] X Research source For example, if you're female and want to express your affection to your older female partner, you might say \"em thương chi.\" Even after you've said \"yêu,\" this word is more frequently used in social contexts or casual settings, like when you would say \"I love you\" in English before ending a phone call or leaving the house."

[11] X Research source For example, if you want to get your significant other's attention and they're female, you would say \"em ơi.\" If they're male, you would say \"anh ơi.\" Their age doesn't matter for this particular phrase.
