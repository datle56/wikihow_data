      "content": "Wash your car as soon as possible. The longer tree sap or any substances like sap (and bird droppings or insect remains for that matter) are left on the surface of the vehicle, the more difficult they are to remove. Acting fast will require the least amount of effort and the most success at getting a sparkling car exterior."

      "content": "Spray off your car with clean water. Giving your car this initial rinse will get all the large debris off but it will also help you to see where you need to focus further cleaning. Take the time to wash your whole car, even if it's not all covered in sap. You will be more satisfied when you get the sap off if your whole car is nice and clean. Besides, you already have all the supplies out and ready to go."

      "content": "Rub the surface with a microfiber rag covered in hot, soapy water. Use the hottest water you can, as the sap will be weakened most effectively by really hot water. Before using other methods of sap removal, try cleaning your car with really hot water. If the sap gets removed, then great, you are done. If the sap remains, at least you have a clean surface on which to try other methods. Be sure that your rag is clean and that you rinse it often to get any debris and sap out. Using a dirty rag will only spread this across the surface of your car."

[2] X Research source Be sure to use them sparingly and test them on a hidden area of your paint job before applying to any sap, as none of them are made specifically for the surface of a car. Try mineral spirits or alcohol wipes. Mineral spirits applied lightly with a soft cloth will break down the sap and remove it but it has the potential of damaging your car's surface. Do not rub too vigorously or for too long so that the paint job is not damaged. Mineral spirits and alcohol wipes should be tried separately. Use the previous directions and try with mineral spirits. If that fails, use readily available 91% isopropyl alcohol instead of mineral spirits. Alcohol evaporates quickly and although your cloth will seem wet, it is the water that is left after the alcohol evaporates. Keep your cloth wet with fresh alcohol and move quickly with light pressure. This will easily remove hard dried as well as fresh pine tree sap. Spray WD-40 on the tree sap. [3] X Research source The sap will begin to absorb the solvent. Let it sit for a few minutes. You can use your rag to lift the loosened sap from the car. Rub hand sanitizer on the tree sap. Place a small amount of hand sanitizer on the sap and let it set for a few minutes. Rub with a clean cloth and the sap dissolves right off. [4] X Research source"
