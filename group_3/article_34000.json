If a cavity has progressed terribly, it is possible that you will need a tooth extraction or a root canal. Most likely, however, your dentist will decide that you require a filling and will ask you to come back in the coming days or weeks to get a filling."

      "title": "Ask the right questions.",
      "content": "Ask the right questions. As you prepare to schedule your filling, you will likely need to know how long the appointment is expected to last, whether or not you will have restrictions immediately following your appointment, whether you are permitted to take medications, whether you will need a ride home, any side effects you should know about, and how you should follow up. Having this information on hand well before your filling will allow you to make the necessary preparations at home. For example, you might need to: Ask a friend or a taxi service to set up a ride home, depending on what anesthetic will be used. Purchase soft, lukewarm foods that won't aggravate your filling in the days immediately following your appointment. Arrange for time off of work to go to your appointment and recover. Note that it might be hard for you to talk normally for a few hours after you get your cavity filled. If your job requires that you speak publicly, you might want to take an extra few hours off. Consult with your physician about whether your medications might interact with your dental anesthetic."

Your dentist will have to know about any chronic health problems you have, your medical history, your current medications, allergies to medicines and metals, and whether or not you are pregnant. This information is essential for your dentist to make the right decisions about your dental care. Be sure to answer all questions honestly, and tell your dentist all the relevant details about your dental and physical health."

There are pros and cons to each kind of filling, and the most appropriate option might depend on which tooth requires a filling and how deep your cavity is. [3] X Research source An amalgam filling is made up of metals, is silver in color, is usually the cheaper option, is strong and flexible, and sometimes requires the removal of healthy tooth material. [4] X Research source Amalgam fillings are more common on the back teeth. [5] X Research source A composite filling is made up of a hardened resin, is often tooth-colored, is usually the more expensive option, is not quite as strong or long-lasting as an amalgam filling, and is a bit fussier to do correctly.

Sometimes there are restrictions about what kind of filling you can get--some plans might cover an amalgam filling but not a composite filling, for example. Make extra sure that the dentist performing your filling is in-network so that you aren't surprised by out-of-network surcharges. Be prepared for possible co-pays, however."

Some ways that dentists can soothe an anxious patient include: Using water-based tools that minimize feelings of heat or vibration. Using oral or rub-on anesthetics before to provide pain relief before you receive a numbing shot. Having the option of nitrous oxide (laughing gas) available. Creating a spa-like environment, with relaxing music, aromatherapy, and a calm space. Providing noise-canceling headphones so that you do not have to hear the noise of the drill.
