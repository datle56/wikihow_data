      "content": "Rice bucket training is a grip strength and hand rehab exercise. It’s pretty simple: fill a large bucket with uncooked rice, stick your hands in, and start moving them around. The resistance of the rice provides a great, low-impact workout that many physical trainers use to test or build grip strength , forearm strength, and prevent elbow injuries. [1] X Research source Some say rice bucket training dates back to Shaolin monks. It’s possible, but hard to verify. Mostly, it’s used by physical therapists and athletes, though not many studies have been done to pinpoint how effective it is, exactly."

      "title": "Rice bucket training strengthens your fingers, forearms, and elbows.",
      "content": "Rice bucket training strengthens your fingers, forearms, and elbows. If you vary your rice bucket workout and perform several techniques, this exercise can target your entire forearm, from your elbow to your individual fingers. This makes you less prone to injury and gives you a much better grip on things like balls, bats, sticks, and climbing grips. [2] X Research source Rice bucket training is primarily used for people in physical rehab, helping them regain motor function and ability in their hands and arms. In terms of grip training and strength exercises, there are more effective alternatives. That said, many athletes, like baseball and football players, or climbers, use regular rice bucket training to improve their grip and forearm strength."

Then, slowly open and close your hands, from a closed fist to splayed fingers. Repeat this 50 times per workout. [3] X Research source Benefits: This exercise is foundational for basic grip and forearm strength. As with every exercise on this wrist, the deeper your hands go into the rice, the more resistance they’ll meet, and the more intense the workout will be."

[16] X Research source Feel free to do it more often, or for longer, as your grip strength increases and the exercises become easier. Mix and match the exercises above to create your own routine. As a basic routine, though, cycle through Open & Closes, Splayed Fingers, and Scoop ‘n’ Drops."

      "content": "Use a squeezy grip ball or spring-loaded grip trainer. Some products are made exclusively to help you train your grip strength, including your hand and forearm muscles. A basic stress ball is a great way to get a low-impact grip workout in throughout your day. A spring-loaded grip trainer is similar but offers added resistance for an even more intense workout. [18] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Both these products often come in varying levels of resistance, so start at a low level and move up to the next once it feels too easy. These are both techniques you can do on the go, but try to get 30-60 minutes of training in each day."
