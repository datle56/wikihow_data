      "content": "Chrome hides the parallel download feature under the browser’s experimental Flags, which are settings being tested by developers. Parallel downloading is available on desktop version of Chrome, and on the Chrome app for Android. It is not currently available for iPhone users. [1] X Research source Open a new tab on Chrome. Type chrome://flags into the address bar and hit Enter. Enter “parallel downloading” into the search bar at the top of the screen. Switch the setting to Enabled to turn parallel downloading on or Disabled to turn it off."

      "content": "While Firefox doesn’t call the setting “parallel downloading,” there’s still a way to increase the number of download connections in the browser. To turn on parallel downloads for Firefox, use the following steps for desktop or the beta build of the mobile app: [2] X Research source Open a new Firefox tab. Enter about://config into the address bar and hit Enter. Click Accept the Risk and Continue on the window. Type in network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-server into the search bar. Click on the pencil icon on the right side of the screen. Enter a higher number into the text box, such as 10. Restart Firefox."

The feature is available for the desktop version as well as the Android app. [3] X Research source Open a new Microsoft Edge tab. Type in edge://flags into the address bar. Search for “parallel downloading” in the search bar at the top of the window. Switch the setting to Enabled to turn on parallel downloads or change it to Disabled to turn it off. Restart Edge to confirm the setting."

      "title": "Parallel downloading splits large files into smaller segments.",
      "content": "Parallel downloading splits large files into smaller segments. Normal downloads use a single connection to a server, so larger files may take more time to finish, especially if other programs use the same connection. When you turn on parallel downloading, files are broken apart into pieces and your device uses multiple server connections to download them at the same time. [4] X Research source Once the download finishes, the pieces are put back in order so you can properly open the file."

      "title": "Parallel downloading is faster for larger files, but doesn’t increase your Internet speed.",
      "content": "Parallel downloading is faster for larger files, but doesn’t increase your Internet speed. Parallel downloads can be faster and more efficient because they bypass network bandwidth limits and split the work between different server connections. However, if you already have a slow connection due to limits on your Internet plan or devices on the network, your download speeds may stay the same. Parallel downloading increases your speed if: [5] X Research source Other apps or programs are congesting a server Your server doesn’t use all of the available bandwidth Your connection has frequent packet loss The server has bandwidth limits on single connections You have high latency to the download server"

      "title": "Advantages",
      "content": "Advantages Parallel downloads use your server connections more efficiently, so there are many times when it can improve your download speeds. [6] X Research source Multiple connections prevent slowdowns compared to a single one. One of your connections has a higher chance of being first if there’s a download queue. Downloads use all available bandwidth. Your download won’t be impacted by bandwidth limits per connection. Other connections will continue downloading even if packet loss occurs."

      "title": "Disadvantages",
      "content": "Disadvantages Even though parallel downloads can sometimes increase speeds, there are some instances where there’s no change in speed. Sometimes, parallel downloading may be slower or affect how other programs perform. [7] X Research source Files under 5 MB may download more slowly because splitting and reassembling the file takes longer than downloading it. Other apps and programs may respond more slowly because downloads are taking up multiple server connections. Higher download speeds may cause phones to overheat. Some websites may block parallel downloads, so download speeds may remain the same."

      "title": "Turn on parallel downloads to see if it improves speeds.",
      "content": "Turn on parallel downloads to see if it improves speeds. There’s no harm in trying out parallel downloading to check if it makes major improvements. If you don’t really notice a change in your download speeds, you can always just disable the setting again. Try turning the setting on right before you download large files and turning it off once they finish."

      "content": "Close other programs and processes. Oppido mentions that your computer doing other things in the background, like cloud backups and other online programs, can cause your download speeds to slow down. He also mentions that viruses and malware may unknowingly be taking up bandwidth. Exit any programs that connect to the Internet. Check for malware on your device and remove it if found."

      "content": "Move closer to your router. “Another thing could be signal,” says Oppido. He goes into detail: “You've got a huge antenna sticking off the top of your router, and your computer doesn't. So it's a bidirectional communication…if you can get that signal, but you can't send the signal back, you're gonna get a degraded speed.” Bring your device closer to your router or plug your device in with an Ethernet cable if you’re able to."

      "title": "Restart the router and modem.",
      "content": "Restart the router and modem. “A lot of times…it's either the modem or router has old stuff in it, and needs to be restarted,” explains Oppido. He says that file packets can sometimes “go into a recursive loop that…doesn't allow the process to come through.” His solution is restarting the modem and router to clear out the old packets. How you reset your modem and router depends on the individual hardware. If you’re having trouble, contact your Internet provider to help walk you through how to restart or reset your devices."

      "title": "Replace old routers and modems.",
      "content": "Replace old routers and modems. Oppido suggests older hardware may be to blame if you’re consistently getting slow speeds. “Routers are on 24 hours a day, seven days a week, constantly passing packets…which gives them a shelf life of about three years.” If your router is already a few years old, then it might be time to get a replacement."
