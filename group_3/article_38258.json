      "content": "Understand the roots of Yiddish. It is no coincidence that \"a dank\" and \"a sheynem dank\" sound like the German \"danke\" and \"danke schoen.\" Yiddish is the traditional tongue of the Ashkenazi Jews. The language came about in 9th century Central Europe, drawing its influences from a rich cultural context of languages and peoples. Yiddish took elements from German, Hebrew, and Aramaic, as well as certain Slavic and Romance languages. [6] X Research source Many Yiddish words (including אַ דאַנק, or \"a dank\") are written in the original Hebrew or Aramaic. Words of European origin are written out using the phonetic pronunciation."
