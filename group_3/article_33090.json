      "content": "Get the Swap Magic 3.6 software suite. [1] X Research source Swap Magic 3.6 is software that allows you to play copied PlayStation 2 (PS2) games on a regular PS2 or a Slimline without having to install a modchip. Swap Magic is commonly found at independent gaming or computer repair shops. You can also purchase it online, but make sure you buy it from a reputable place, such as Amazon. You’ll need to buy CD/DVD copies of the software, as burning your own copy will not work. Any site that demands payment for a download of Swap Magic is likely a scam. Only buy software from sites you trust. Swap Magic 3.8 also allows you to play games that are not rated for your country. Make sure you know the laws before playing games that aren’t designed for use in your area."

      "content": "Get a Slide Card. Swap Magic removes the need for modchips by working in tandem with a Slide Card. The Slide Card, a small plastic device, is designed to open your PS2 while a disc is spinning so you can swap out games. Swap Magic 3.6 and up almost always comes with a Slide Card (and Slide Cards are universally compatible), however, if you find a copy that doesn’t include one, you can almost always order one from the same place you found Swap Magic."

Using a small flathead screwdriver or a pin, gently separate the cover from each clip while pulling the cover toward you. Don’t use too much force or else you’ll break the plastic. But if you do break the plastic, you can repair it with super glue."

      "content": "Slide the Slide Card back beneath the tray facing the same direction as before. The next few motions are slightly different than the removal of the Swap Magic disc: Slide the Slide Card to the right once more, but this time, when the tray ejects slightly, release some of the pressure on the Slide Card, then continue sliding it to the right. This slight break in the sliding motion will allow the Slide Card to move around the locking mechanism to ‘catch” properly. Slide the Slide Card back to the left, as far left as it will go. This will close the tray. You can remove the Slider Tool once the tray has closed."
