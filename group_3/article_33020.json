      "content": "Purchase a capo to make it easier to sing or adjust pitch. A capo clamps down on all six strings, allowing you to play these chords anywhere on the neck. Basically, wherever the capo goes becomes the new \"0\" in your chords. This allows you to keep the same shape and play songs in any key. The following songs have a capo in them, but you can still play them without one. Note, however, that the songs will sound off-key from recorded versions."

To get the intro riff, you use all the same notes in your normal chords. When transitioning chords, simply keep the last three strings in place for 1 measure. So, going from the D to the Em, leave the bottom three strings as a D for the first strum of Em, then lift them.
