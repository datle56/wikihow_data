      "content": "Keep readability in mind at all times. Your project needs to look pleasing to the eye. This means you do not want line after line to end with hyphens. Newsletters and brochures have a combination of wording and graphics or pictures. You will run into the question on hyphenation often. Some instances will need it, and some will not. You just have to make a decision at that time. Proper names, pricing and words that are awkwardly broken should not be hyphenated. Long words that leave large white spaces in a line of text should be hyphenated."
