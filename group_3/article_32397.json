      "title": "Suck sour candies to make your saliva more acidic.",
      "content": "Suck sour candies to make your saliva more acidic. The more acidic and sugary your saliva becomes, the more difficult it is for drugs to be detected in it. So, if you only have 5–10 minutes before you'll be given a mandatory drug swab test, pop in 2 or 3 sour citrus candies. Suck them (rather than chewing) to get as much of the acidic citrus flavoring out of the candies as you can!

      "title": "Chew a couple of pieces of gum to increase your saliva production.",
      "content": "Chew a couple of pieces of gum to increase your saliva production. Chewing on a piece of gum stimulates your saliva production, which will dilute the concentration of any drugs in your saliva. Chewing gum will also change the chemical makeup of your oral fluids, which can make the mouth swab test less effective. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you have a choice between different flavors, opt for a cinnamon or strong citrus flavors. It wouldn't be a bad idea to carry a pack of gum with you to work on a daily basis if you're concerned about surprise swab tests."

      "title": "Rinse your mouth with hydrogen peroxide 5 minutes before the test.",
      "content": "Rinse your mouth with hydrogen peroxide 5 minutes before the test. Peroxide is what's known as an “adulterant”: a chemical that interferes with the swab test's ability to accurately detect drugs in your saliva. Take a gulp of peroxide just before your test, and swish it around inside your mouth for 30 seconds. Then spit it out into the sink. [3] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Be careful not to accidentally swallow any of the peroxide. It's can cause internal harm if ingested. Avoid using alcohol-based mouthwashes, though, as they can lead to a false positive result for alcohol abuse."

      "title": "Avoid taking any drugs for 72 hours before the test.",
      "content": "Avoid taking any drugs for 72 hours before the test. The mouth swab test can only reliably detect drugs ingested in the last 48–72 hours. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Most oral swab tests are administered to check for marijuana use, as the THC compounds in marijuana are easily detectable in saliva. To be on the safe side, though, also lay off of whatever other drugs you may be using for 72 hours. Spending at least 72 hours drug-free is recommended to be on the safe side, especially if you are a heavy user. Also avoid taking cough suppressant medication that contains codeine."

      "title": "Add high-fat foods to your meals for 48 hours before the test.",
      "content": "Add high-fat foods to your meals for 48 hours before the test. The THC molecules in your bloodstream (and saliva) bind easily to fat. Then, when the fat is eliminated from your body, it takes the THC with it, making your drug use much more difficult to detect. So, for 2 days before the oral swab test, eat high-fat foods as part of every meal to flush the THC out of your body.

      "title": "Sip water throughout the day to keep up saliva production.",
      "content": "Sip water throughout the day to keep up saliva production. In theory, new saliva will have lower concentrations of drug-related chemicals than older saliva. Stay hydrated by sipping water, herbal tea, or fruit juice frequently, so you can produce more saliva. Also avoid liquids that dehydrate your body, including coffee, black tea, and alcohol. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Chemicals get into your saliva from your bloodstream, which can't be “flushed out” the same way. Still, there's no harm in upping your hydration and saliva output for 48–72 hours before the test."

      "title": "Brush your teeth",
      "content": "Brush your teeth twice daily to remove lingering old saliva. This isn't a very effective method, but it might slightly decrease the amount of THC (or chemicals from other drugs) lingering in your mouth. Use a new toothbrush and a reputable brand of toothpaste, and scrub your teeth for at least 2 minutes after breakfast and dinner. Make sure to scrub your tongue and cheeks as well as your teeth. Rinse and spit at the end. [7] X Research source Brushing your teeth thoroughly and consistently won't work any miracles, but it will ensure that old oral fluids aren't built up in your mouth."

      "title": "Gargle",
      "content": "Gargle every 15 minutes for 4–5 hours before the test. If you get to work and find out that you have a swab test in 4 or 5 hours, don't panic! Step into the bathroom, take a big mouthful of water, and gargle with it for 20–30 seconds. Repeat this every quarter hour before your swab test. Rinsing with water will dilute the concentration of THC (or other drug chemicals) in your saliva and will make the drugs slightly harder to detect.
