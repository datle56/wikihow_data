You can take your cat’s temperature rectally or in its ear. [5] X Research source Gather your supplies. You will need a thermometer, lubricant (e.g., petroleum jelly or K-Y), alcohol and paper towels, and a cat treat. If using a glass thermometer , shake it until the mercury is below the 96F (35C) line. Simply switch on a digital thermometer. Use a special thermometer designed for pets to measure temperature in the ear. If measuring your cat’s temperature rectally, lubricate the thermometer. Cradle your cat under one arm, or ask someone else to hold them. Raise their tail. Insert the thermometer into your cat’s anus about one inch. Hold a glass thermometer in place for 2 minutes. Remove a digital thermometer when it beeps. Clean the thermometer with rubbing alcohol and paper towels. Give your cat a treat to comfort them. If your cat’s fever is over 102F (39C), take them to see a vet immediately. High fevers can cause organ damage.

[8] X Research source Determine whether you can feel any injuries like bone fracture, swollen lymph nodes , abscess, wound infection or tumors. All of these instances can cause fever. [9] X Research source You may or may not be able to feel a bone fracture in your cat. Fractures or breaks in bones can cause swelling or bruising in the break area. If you apply pressure to the injured area your cat will respond with pain . Be gentle as you examine your cat. [10] X Research source You should be able to feel swollen lymph nodes under your cat’s jaw area and around their shoulders. Swelling at the back of the legs or near the groin is also possible. [11] X Research source Immediately take your cat to the vet if you notice any of these symptoms. These conditions require prompt medical attention. If you do not notice any of these symptoms, the fever is likely a normal immune response. If possible get your cat examined by a vet who will try to identify the source of the infection. Follow the steps below as directed unless your cat's fever has been present for over 24 hours. If your cat has had a fever for more than 24 hours, seek veterinary advice and treatment as soon as possible."

      "content": "Help your cat cool down. Cats lose heat through sweat glands in their paws and by panting. Help your feverish cat cool off so you can reduce their body temperature. Find a cool, dark, room, preferably with a slate or tile floor so that they can stretch out and transfer their body heat to the tiles. You can also try these ways to help your cat cool off: Position a fan on the floor so that it blows cool air over their body. If your cat will tolerate it, gently wet their coat with water. You can use a damp cloth or a spray bottle to dampen their coat. The evaporation will help to cool their body."

[12] X Expert Source Brian Bourquin, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 20 December 2019. It is important that you provide fresh water at all times to your cat. If your cat is having trouble drinking, provide your cat with water via syringe ( without a needle). [13] X Research source Rehydrating your cat can reduce fever. This is the reason why cats are given IV fluids at the vet. [14] X Research source A feverish cat will not want to get up and walk around, so make sure they have drinking water within reach. You can sponge their gums with tepid water. In addition to water, you can also give Gatorade or children’s electrolyte solutions to cats with fever. These may help restore your cat’s electrolyte balance, especially if they have been vomiting or had diarrhea. [15] X Research source [16] X Research source You can use a syringe to get your cat to drink Gatorade. If your cat is resistant to syringe hydration, try freezing some water or Gatorade into cubes. Your cat may be more interested in licking an ice cube than drinking (and the cold will help them cool down). Never give your cat milk! Cats are very sensitive to lactose. Milk can make your cat ill and cause nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "Make sure your cat is eating.",
      "content": "Make sure your cat is eating. Fever requires huge amounts of energy and can leave your cat very weak. Your cat may not feel up to eating solid food. You can supplement their diet by providing soft foods. Soft scrambled eggs [18] X Research source or canned tuna run through a food processor [19] X Research source can be good options. If your cat refuses solid or soft food, try using a syringe to feed your cat milk replacer (sold at pet stores). This is a food designed for feeding sick cats or nursing orphaned kittens. Use a syringe (no needle) with 5cc to 10 cc capacity. Insert the tip of the syringe on the insides of corners of the mouth, closest to the cheek. Cats and dogs will reflexively swallow anything that has passed in this area inside the mouth. If your cat cannot eat, ask your vet about high-calorie liquid supplements. Your cat can consume these until they are well enough to eat solid food again."

Vitamin B-complex and energy supplements added to their diet can accomplish this. [20] X Research source A vitamin and energy supplement like Nutri-Plus Gel (at 5ml daily for 5 days) can be given to battle fatigue and a lack of nutrients. An example of a very good B-complex vitamin is Coforta. It has a high concentration of cyanocoblamin (3), which is needed in energy metabolism. It is injected at 0.5ml to 2.5 ml per cat once a day for 5 days Subcutaneously (SQ) or Intramuscularly (IM): For small cats less than or equal to 1 kg (2.2 lb), 0.5 ml For cats 2 to 6 kg (4.4 to 13.2 lb), 1 ml For large cats, 7 to 9 kg (15.4 to 19.8 lb), 2.5 ml For cats between these weight ranges, estimate a dose between these or follow vet advice, erring toward a lower dose.

      "content": "Use antibiotics if vet-recommended. If your cat’s fever is caused by a bacterial infection, the underlying infection must be treated. Usually giving antibiotics would be enough to reduce a fever. While antibiotics are generally safe for a cat with a fever, do not self medicate. Always ensure that the vet has checked and prescribed antibiotics for your cat. Antibiotics are often specific to one strain of bacteria and may not be effective for others. Your vet can recommend the best treatment for your cat. The most common and safe antibiotics usually prescribed by vets are: [26] X Research source Ampicillin and Amoxicillin (20mg/kg body weight). Both are available in suspension form and can be bought in human pharmacies. Marbofloxacin (2 mg/kg) is available in tablet form; however, it can be very hard to dose because of its small tablet size. Doxycycline (5 mg/kg) is available in paste form, and a preparation made for pets can be bought upon prescription of a veterinarian. This preparation is Vibravet, and it comes with a plastic syringe doser to ensure correct administration. In giving antibiotics the duration of medication should always be one week (seven days). Always give the full course of antibiotics, even if your cat appears to be feeling better. Shortening it may cause re-infection and antibiotic resistance."

It should not be used except under veterinary direction. The recommended maintenance dose 0.05 mg/kg daily of feline meloxicam oral suspension, with or after food. A 5 kg (11 lb) cat will need 0.25 ml of cat Metacam. It should be noted that meloxicam is formulated in two strengths: for dogs (1.5 mg/ml) and for cats (0.5 mg/ml). It's imperative you give your cat the proper form of this medication to avoid an overdose. Meloxicam should only be used in well-hydrated cats. Dehydrated cats may well have impaired renal function. The additional decrease in blood supply to the kidney may cause kidney failure."

      "content": "Use aspirin only with vet supervision. Aspirin is not the anti-fever drug of choice for cats. It can cause dehydration, vomiting, and other severe symptoms. Aspirin can be used in a cat with extreme caution if recommended by your vet. Give only the recommended dosage. [27] X Research source The recommended dose for a cat is 2.5 mg/kg (5 mg/lb) every 48 – 72 hours. Use pediatric aspirin, which usually is available in 50mg or 75mg tablets. This will facilitate smaller doses. Give your cat food and water with aspirin. Giving your cat aspirin on an empty stomach may make your cat feel ill. Once absorbed across the stomach lining, aspirin is broken down to salicylic acid. However, cats lack the enzyme necessary to break down salicylic acid. Salicylic acid levels in your cat’s body will remain high for prolonged periods. High and/or additional doses rapidly lead to toxicity. Thus it is incredibly important to monitor the dosages you're administering."
