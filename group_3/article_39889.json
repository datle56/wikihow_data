      "content": "Sleep on your back with a pillow under your knees if that’s more comfortable. Sleeping on your back with your knees slightly bent and supported by a firm pillow is a good position if you have a herniated disk in the lumbar region. This position takes pressure off of your lower spine, which will allow the maximum amount of healing to take place while you sleep. Place a pillow under your knees to support them. [4] X Research source You can also place a pillow under your lower back to reduce the amount of pressure on your spine."
