If you have ruled out bad weather or traffic delays as reasons for your mail person to have been unable to reach your location, it’s possible that your address has not been entered into the USPS system yet. This is often because it is a newly created address or it was registered as a different address.

USPS will automatically try to deliver the package again the next business day, but don't worry—USPS is still in possession of your parcel. [4] X Research source To ensure the mail carrier has no further issues accessing your mailbox or porch the next day, go out and check to see that there is nothing blocking their way. If there’s not, simply wait for tomorrow."

If it’s been more than 24 hours since you received your “No Access to Delivery Location” notice and you still haven't received your package, you can submit a service request online here or call your local post office. [6] X Research source Once you submit a service request, USPS will take steps to help you locate and receive your package. Important information that might be helpful to your case includes tracking numbers, receipts, photographs, and delivery dates. If it's been more than 24 hours and your package still hasn't been delivered, this doesn't mean your package is lost, as a package is not considered \"lost\" until 7 days after the expected delivery date. [7] X Research source This could simply mean there was another issue with trying to access the delivery location, or it could mean you need to update or add your address to the database. The USPS will work with you regarding your specific case after the Service Request has been submitted, and there is still a good chance you will receive your package."
