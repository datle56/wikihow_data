      "title": "Check for a history of criminal activity or arrests.",
      "content": "Check for a history of criminal activity or arrests. Someone with antisocial personality disorder will have a history of repeatedly being arrested for crimes, major or petty. These crimes often begin in adolescence and continue on into adulthood. People with antisocial personality disorder also tend to have drug and alcohol abuse problems, meaning that they may be arrested for possession or use of drugs or have a DUI. You may want to run a background check yourself if the individual does not disclose his past history to you."

    {
      "title": "Identify compulsive lying or conning behavior.",
      "content": "Identify compulsive lying or conning behavior. Sufferers of the disorder will show lifelong habits of compulsive lying, even about mundane or irrelevant things. As they grow older, this pattern of lying may turn into a form of con artistry, in which they manipulate others for their own gain using their lies. As a related symptom, they may develop aliases to hide behind, either for the purpose of conning people, or just as another form of lying."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch out for a reckless disregard for safety.",
      "content": "Watch out for a reckless disregard for safety. People with antisocial personality disorder tend to disregard safety of both themselves and others altogether. They may either ignore a potentially dangerous situation or put themselves or someone else intentionally into danger. On a small scale, this might include driving at high speeds or starting fights with strangers, while on a more extreme scale it might mean physically injuring, torturing, or altogether neglecting another person."
    },
    {
      "title": "Identify impulsive behavior or a failure to plan ahead.",
      "content": "Identify impulsive behavior or a failure to plan ahead. It is common for a sufferer of the disorder to show a lack of planning ability, for either near-to-date or future plans. They may not sense a correlation between their current behaviors and long-term outcomes, such as how doing drugs now and going to jail might affect their future plans. They may do things quickly without judgment, or make rash decisions without thinking."
    },
    {
      "title": "Beware of repeated physical assaults on others.",
      "content": "Beware of repeated physical assaults on others. Physical assaults by individuals with ASPD can vary greatly, from a bar fight to kidnapping and torture. However, someone with antisocial personality disorder will have a background of physically abusing others, which they may or may not have been arrested for. If they had Conduct Disorder earlier in life, this pattern would extend into their childhood when they abused other children or possibly their own parents or caretakers."

      "title": "Watch for poor work and financial ethics.",
      "content": "Watch for poor work and financial ethics. Those with antisocial personality disorder traditionally have a hard time keeping jobs, have multiple complaints from their bosses or coworkers, and may have overdue bills and debt. In general, the sufferer will not be financially or work stable, and will spend his money unwisely."

    {
      "title": "Look for a lack of empathy and rationalization of inflicted pain.",
      "content": "Look for a lack of empathy and rationalization of inflicted pain. This is often one of the most commonly associated symptoms of the disorder; someone who has ASPD will not be able to empathize with someone to whom he has caused pain. If he is arrested for a personal crime, he will rationalize his motive/actions and find little or no reason to be bothered or feel guilty for his behavior. He will have a hard time understanding someone who is upset as a result of his own behavior."

      "content": "Avoid contact when possible. Though it can be difficult to cut ties with a close friend or family member, you may need to give yourself some distance from a person suffering from antisocial personality disorder. This can be for your own emotional or even physical safety."

      "content": "Set appropriate boundaries. Maintaining a relationship with an individual suffering from antisocial personality disorder can be quite difficult. If you cannot avoid an individual with ASPD, you should set clear boundaries for what you consider to be acceptable interaction with the individual.

      "content": "Seek a diagnosis from a qualified psychologist or psychiatrist. Antisocial personality disorder can be difficult to spot, because there are so many possible symptoms and variations that can occur. As a result, it may seem like someone has the disorder when he does not meet all of the necessary symptomatic requirements. Only a qualified mental health professional can offer an official diagnosis. However, you can recognize signs of the disorder by looking for a combination of symptoms, occurring over a lifetime. [9] X Research source Antisocial personality disorder is similar in many ways to narcissistic personality disorder; someone may be diagnosed with symptoms of both. Individuals who suffer from antisocial personality disorder tend to display a lack of empathy; they also present manipulation and deceit.

      "content": "Avoid offering an amateur diagnosis. It is one thing to suspect someone has a personality disorder, but quite another to seek to \"diagnose\" the person unless you're a qualified psychiatrist or psychologist. If the person you're worried about is a family member or a friend, seek to get him supported through professional help.Treatment may include psychotherapy and rehabilitation. Antisocial behavior may not always be related to a disorder. Some people are just comfortable with living recklessly and form bad habits of living carelessly and irresponsibly. Be aware that people suffering from antisocial personality disorder rarely want treatment because they often do not believe that there is anything wrong with them. [10] X Research source You may have to be persistent to get the person help and try to keep him out of jail."

      "content": "Look for signs of antisocial personality disorder across a personâ€™s lifetime. Antisocial personality disorder is caused by a unique combination of biological and social factors, which manifest over a personâ€™s entire life. Someone with antisocial personality disorder will display symptoms from the time he is a child, but he cannot be clinically diagnosed until he turns at least 18. On the other hand, the symptoms of antisocial personality disorder tend to dissipate beyond the age of 40-50; they do not disappear entirely, but they often lessen either as a result of biological factors or social conditioning.

      "content": "Watch for substance abuse along with ASPD. People with this disorder frequently have an underlying substance abuse problem such as drug addiction or drug dependence. An epidemiological survey found that individuals with antisocial personality disorder were 21 times more likely than the general public to exhibit alcohol abuse and dependence.

      "content": "Identify a history of abuse in those with ASPD. Because the illness is thought to be biological only in part, a serious risk factor for triggering it is extensive childhood abuse. People with antisocial personality disorder are typically abused physically and emotionally by someone close to them in their lives for many years. They may also have suffered extensive periods of neglect as children. The abusers are often parents who also have anti-social tendencies, which they pass along to their children."
