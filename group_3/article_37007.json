      "content": "Flip your scooter over so the wheels face upwards. Set your scooter on a flat surface. Turn it upside down and balance it on the back wheel and the handlebars so that the wheels face you. This will make it much easier to work on your scooter. [1] X Research source You can also have a friend hold up your scooter for you or attach it to a scooter stand."

[4] X Research source If your old wheels are noticeably damaged or broken, don’t try to use them on another scooter. You can throw the wheel away in the trash or keep it as a souvenir to look back on how much you roughed up your first wheels."

      "content": "Take the bearings out of the old wheel if your new one doesn't have them. The bearings are the hollow circles of metal on the inside of the wheel. If your new wheel has them, you don’t need to use the ones from your old wheel. If your new wheel doesn't have them, gently tap them out with your allen wrench. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Add your wheel bearings to your new wheel if it doesn’t have them.",
      "content": "Add your wheel bearings to your new wheel if it doesn’t have them. Align the wheel bearing with the hole in the center of your new wheel. Gently tap the bearing in with your allen wrench until it is flush with the surrounding metal. Then, tap the other bearing into the other side of the wheel with your allen wrench. [6] X Research source If your new wheel already has bearings in it, you don’t need to worry about this."
