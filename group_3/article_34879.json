      "content": "Choose the right size of tights. [1] X Research source The most important step in putting on tights is to start with the correct size. Otherwise, you're going to have trouble no matter how you try to get them on. Tights are often sized according to weight and height. Check the packaging that comes with the tights to determine what size matches your weight and height range. If you are uncomfortable when your tights are too tight, go ahead and move up one size. Your tights usually will fit well enough still to stay around your waist. If you are taller than average or have longer-than-average legs, choose a size marked \"tall.\" If your measurements fall in between sizes, always choose the larger of the two."

      "title": "Ease the foot of the tights over your foot, from toe to heel.",
      "content": "Ease the foot of the tights over your foot, from toe to heel. Point your toe and slip your foot inside the tights. Put your whole foot inside and arrange the bottom of the tights' foot so that the seam at the toe runs across the tip of your toes. Make sure the foot of the tights fits nicely around your toe and heel. Keep your thumbs inside, pointed downward and the nail-side against you to avoid senselessly snagging your tights. You might need to stretch the opening a bit to make sure your foot slides inside without catching on the fabric. Pointing your toe will help prevent your toenail from snagging the tights. If either the toe or heel of the tights is crooked, you'll want to make sure it's straightened or you'll have trouble with later steps."

If the fabric is twisted or bunched at the knees, straighten it before proceeding. Repeat these steps to pull the tights up your other leg. Gather the waist and toe of the other leg to create an easy pathway for your foot. Point your toe and insert your foot, lining up the toe of the hose so that the seam runs across your toes. Gently pull the tights leg up over your calf and knee to your mid-thigh. Make sure the leg of your tights isn't bunched or twisted."

Continue to pull up the tights further, until the waist band is positioned around your natural waistline. You'll have the best luck if you pull the material up on one side, then the other, before finishing with the hips and waist. If there are areas left rumpled or baggy, or if the legs don’t seem to be long enough, roll the tights down to the knees again. Just sit down, gently stretch them out and roll them back up. Be careful not to yank them back up from the top or they will likely tear."

      "content": "Make necessary adjustments. Check for areas where the tights are bunched or places where your skin feels pinched. Your tights should feel snug, but not uncomfortable. If you see a place where your tights are twisted, your best bet is to take them off and repeat the process more carefully. Use the flats of your hands to adjust any wrinkles."
