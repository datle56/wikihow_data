      "content": "It helps to wash the knobs before sanding and painting them. This keeps small particles of dust and debris from mixing in with the paint and marring the finish. You can wash the knobs with water and any mild soap. Wipe the knobs completely dry with a clean cloth before sanding them. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Once the knobs are dry, go over each of them lightly with medium-grit sandpaper. This will prepare the surface for priming, and will also help to remove any loose or flaked paint from the knob. Wipe the knobs with a tack cloth after sanding to remove any particles of paint or metal left by the sanding. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "You will not be able to handle the knobs while applying the primer or paint. This would create fingerprints in the finish. The simplest way to set the knobs up for painting is to lay them out on a sheet of plastic with their tops facing up. However, a more elegant solution can be prepared using a sheet of cardboard. Obtain a large sheet of sturdy corrugated cardboard; you can easily cut one out from a shipping box. Fold the sheet down the middle so that it holds a 45 degree angle. Place the folded cardboard on top of a flat surface so that it forms a \"tent\" shape. Poke the screw of each knob through the underside of the cardboard and secure the knobs just as you would when installing them in your drawers. You can now prime and paint the knobs in place on the cardboard support. The cardboard will keep the knobs from rolling and touching each other, and the angle will keep paint from pooling around the knobs. Make sure to lay down newspaper or another disposable material underneath the cardboard tent."

      "content": "Purchase and apply a clean metal primer to improve the paint's adhesion. Clean metal primer is available in spray cans and can be purchased from nearly any hardware store. To apply it, shake the can as indicated in the directions, and spray the entire cardboard support in long, smooth passes. A thin layer is all that is needed, and will dry faster than a thick layer. Allow the primer to dry as per the can's directions; the primer should no longer be tacky to the touch before applying paint. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "For painting metal knobs or other hardware, you should use a metal spray paint. This paint is designed to adhere well to metal. For a glossy and durable finish, use a spray paint that is designated as \"enamel.\" This paint should be applied just as you applied the primer. Shake the can and spray the knobs in long, smooth passes. Keep the spray can moving at all times to avoid creating thick patches that may lead to drips. One coat of paint will usually be sufficient.
