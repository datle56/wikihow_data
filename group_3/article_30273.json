      "title": "Grind a cup of plain oatmeal into a fine powder.",
      "content": "Grind a cup of plain oatmeal into a fine powder. Grab some plain, raw oatmeal without sugar, fruit, or other flavoring additives. Use a food processor or coffee grinder to blend a cup (240 mL) of it until you’ve created a fine powder. [1] X Research source The powder will dissolve in water better."

      "title": "Place a non-slip mat in your tub.",
      "content": "Place a non-slip mat in your tub. Before filling the tub, be sure to lay down a bath mat. Slipping is a hazard whenever you give your dog a bath. Adding oatmeal will make things extra slick, so your dog will probably have a hard time keeping its balance. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill your tub with warm water and add the oatmeal.",
      "content": "Fill your tub with warm water and add the oatmeal. Fill your tub up to your dog’s chest level. Just estimate - don’t stick your dog in the tub yet. Then, use your hand and arm or a large spoon to stir in the oatmeal until it’s fully dissolved. For cases of severe itchiness, make the water cooler. Don’t run a cold bath, but just make it a little cooler to the touch."

      "title": "Place your dog in the bath and encourage it with praise.",
      "content": "Place your dog in the bath and encourage it with praise. Carefully lift your dog into the tub, and give it a moment to adjust. Offer it lots of verbal praise and pet it to help it stay calm. You can also use treats and toys to keep it distracted. [3] X Research source Your dog will probably find immediate relief, so it might like the oatmeal bath even if it doesn’t usually tolerate tub time."

      "title": "Massage its coat and let it soak for 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Massage its coat and let it soak for 15 minutes. Scoop up water to get your dog’s head, back, and shoulders wet, but avoid wetting its face and ears. Using circular motions, gently massage the oatmeal deep into its fur to reach the skin. For the best results, keep your dog in the oatmeal bath for 15 minutes. Don’t use shampoo when giving your dog an oatmeal bath."

    {
      "title": "Drain the tub and rinse your dog.",
      "content": "Drain the tub and rinse your dog. You don't need to wash your dog after the bath, but you should give it a light rinse to remove any lingering bits of oatmeal, which could irritate the dog after they dry or create a mess in your home. Use a cup to pour warm, clean water over your dog. If you have a detachable shower sprayer, you could use it to rinse the dog if it's set on a low setting."

    {
      "title": "Towel dry your dog.",
      "content": "Towel dry your dog. Thoroughly dry the dog with a warm towel, making sure that it isn't shivering. Monitor your dog until it is fully dry to ensure that it isn't too cold. [4] X Research source Repeat the process once a day while your dog has symptoms."

    {
      "title": "Mix a half cup of oatmeal with a half cup of warm water.",
      "content": "Mix a half cup of oatmeal with a half cup of warm water. Mix a half cup (120 mL) each of raw, plain oatmeal and water until you’ve created a thick, gooey paste. Depending on the size of the affected area, you can make more or less paste. Just use equal amounts of oatmeal and water. [5] X Research source Since you’re making a paste instead of dissolving the oatmeal in a bath, you don’t have to grind it into a powder."

    {
      "title": "Wet the itchy areas.",
      "content": "Wet the itchy areas. The spots where you’ll apply the paste need to be wet. If your dog tolerates being in a tub, lay down a bath mat, place it in the tub, and wet its fur down to the skin. If your dog doesn’t like tubs, try wetting the area with a towel soaked in warm water."

    {
      "title": "Spread the oatmeal with circular motions.",
      "content": "Spread the oatmeal with circular motions. Massage the paste thoroughly into the affected area. Massaging with circular motions will help stimulate blood flow and work the paste down onto the skin. [6] X Research source You could also place the paste into cheesecloth or a clean stocking, then cover the area with it. However, rubbing it in with your fingers instead will help you ensure you get down to the skin. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Cover the area with a warm, damp towel.",
      "content": "Cover the area with a warm, damp towel. Once you’ve spread the paste, keep it covered with a warm towel for 5 to 10 minutes, or as long as you can keep your dog calm. Try using praise, treats, and toys to keep it distracted while you hold the towel on the itchy patch. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Rinse away bits of oatmeal then towel dry your dog. You don’t have to give your dog a thorough rinse. Just rinse or wipe away bits of oatmeal, then towel dry your pup. [9] X Research source You can apply the oatmeal paste up to three times a day while your dog shows symptoms."
