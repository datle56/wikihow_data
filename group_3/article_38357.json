      "content": "Breathe from your diaphragm, not your chest. [1] X Expert Source Tanisha Hall Vocal Coach Expert Interview. 27 March 2020. Your diaphragm is the muscle located below your lungs. When you take a deep breath to scream sing, move your stomach out while keeping your chest still. [2] X Research source If you feel your chest lift a lot when you take in a breath, you’re breathing from your chest and not your diaphragm. Breathing properly through your diaphragm prevents unnecessary wear on your vocal cords."

      "title": "Start with breathing techniques.",
      "content": "Start with breathing techniques. Take a deep breath into your diaphragm until you feel your lungs filled with air–this should feel like your stomach and sides are expanding, not your chest. Exhale sharply making an “h” sound to clear your throat and open up your throat. [3] X Research source Repeat this process but make an “ee” sound as you exhale, slowly letting out air. Remember the way it feels to support and control your breath when you’re scream singing so you can produce a more powerful and healthy scream."

      "title": "Layer your screams over the notes you sing.",
      "content": "Layer your screams over the notes you sing. Remember that you still want to be singing in tune when scream singing. You're not just screaming the words of a song; you're singing the words and adding screams to your singing. Think of it as two layers: your regular singing voice, then your screaming voice. Combine the two layers to create the scream-singing sound. [4] X Research source Practice layering your screams over your singing voice by singing normally and gradually transitioning into scream singing. Choose a note and sing it in your regular voice. After holding the note for a few seconds, start to layer a scream over the note until you're scream singing the note."

      "title": "Sing high screams in your head voice and low screams in your chest voice.",
      "content": "Sing high screams in your head voice and low screams in your chest voice. These different types of screams come from various places in the body. Similar to regular singing, high-pitched screams come from the nasal cavity, and low-pitched screams come from the chest. [5] X Research source Listen to a song that has scream singing in it and try to copy the placement of each scream. Don't copy the full screaming noise. Try a soft whisper scream so you can feel where each type of scream should be coming from in the body. The song \"Painkiller\" by Death features scream singing in the high vocal range. Listen to \"Feed the Machine\" by Red to hear low-note screams coming from the chest."

      "content": "Use vocal fry to fry scream. Open your mouth and slowly let out a low \"ah.\" Don't project your voice or breathe out as you're doing it. This low-pitched, cracking effect you hear in your voice is vocal fry. Choose a song you like and sing the words with vocal fry. Try getting louder with your vocal fry until it sounds like a scream. [6] X Research source Singing using vocal fry can create a distorted, screaming-like effect that won’t hurt your voice. This vocal fry technique is known as fry screaming, which is the most common type of scream singing. Fry screaming is done by breathing deeply into the diaphragm and pushing that air through the vocal cords. Matt Shadows of the band Avenged Sevenfold uses vocal fry to scream sing. Listen to the song \"Critical Acclaim\" to hear him using vocal fry. [7] X Research source Vocal fry is generated from the ventricular folds, which are different from vocal folds.

      "content": "Warm up your voice before you scream sing. [10] X Expert Source Tanisha Hall Vocal Coach Expert Interview. 27 March 2020. Warm-ups prepare your voice for scream singing so it’s not as vulnerable to damage. Try to do a few different singing warm-ups before every practice session or performance. Start your warm-up with a simple lip buzz. Close your lips and then vibrate them so they’re rapidly hitting against each other. Hold your pitch for a few seconds and then go up or down a pitch. Keep vibrating your lips and trying different pitches. [11] X Research source You can also warm up by singing “mah-may-me-mo-moo.” Using one note, sing “mah-may-me-mo-moo” slowly but all in one breath. Once you finish, sing it again, going one note higher. Continue until you’ve gone all the way up the scale. Sometimes, your voice might seem like it's not warmed up, but you're actually struggling because of something unrelated to your voice like nerves. Work on resolving the emotions that are interfering with your voice rather than focusing on technique. [12] X Expert Source Jonathan Stancato Voice Coach Expert Interview. 31 March 2020. Cooling down your voice is as important as warming it up: try descending scales or slides on a lip trill or gentle vowel like “oo.”"

      "title": "Use proper posture that supports your voice.",
      "content": "Use proper posture that supports your voice. Engage your back muscles for more power by making a pulling motion with your arms as you scream sing. Bend your legs to center your body before a powerful scream. [14] X Research source Stabilize your neck and chin by pressing your fist against your forehead while scream singing. Your chin should not lift or lower while singing. Eventually this posture will become second-nature to you, so you won’t have to repeat these motions every time you scream sing."

      "title": "Use less air.",
      "content": "Use less air. Blow out most of your air right before your scream. It’s natural to want to take a big breath before a powerful note. However, more air in our lungs will want to rush out faster, which can lead to vocal strain. [15] X Research source Singers can find it difficult to produce the same sounds with less air, but developing good breath control can help. Try this breath control exercise: Breathe in and fill your diaphragm, then push the air out on a whispered “ah.” Repeat the exercise and slightly increase the force of your breath. Narrow your vocal cords to control the sound and pitch. [16] X Research source"
