      "title": "Use an escort directory site to search for an escort.",
      "content": "Use an escort directory site to search for an escort. There are plenty of escort sites you can use to find a service you’re looking for. Simply search “escorts near me” online, or scroll through sites like Tryst , Slixa , Eros , or Escort Directory . Try narrowing your search to the type of escort you’re looking for. Pair your search with terms like “mature,” “blond,” or “VIP” to find a specific type of service or escort. [2] X Research source Remember, escorting is legal as long as you’re paying for companionship, not sex. The moment you pay someone for illicit or promiscuous acts, you’re participating in the illegal activity of prostitution. Before making contact with an escort or agency, use FindLaw.com ’s database to look into your country, state, and county’s laws on prostitution and escorts."

      "title": "Look for ads about escort agencies online or in magazines.",
      "content": "Look for ads about escort agencies online or in magazines. Escorts and their agencies often advertise their services on adult websites or in the back of explicit magazines. Agencies can help pair you with an escort that’ll fit your needs. Seek out these agencies if you’re looking for recommendations or assistance when it comes to selecting an escort. [3] X Research source Agencies may cost a bit more than independent escorts because you’re paying for their customer service on top of the escort’s time."

      "title": "Set a budget",
      "content": "Set a budget for what you’re willing to pay. When you hire an escort, you’re paying them to spend time with you. Most escorts charge by the hour, but this depends on their services and whether they work for an agency. Prices also vary based on location, so you could be spending $1,000 for one night or between $100 and $300 an hour. Knowing your budget can help you pick an escort that fits within your means. If you find an escort you like, contact them to ask about their prices, especially since it can vary depending on where you are and what the appointment entails. Keep in mind that escorting services are legal until sexual activity is paid for. Consider factoring a tip for the escort into your budget."

      "title": "Look your escort up online before booking an appointment.",
      "content": "Look your escort up online before booking an appointment. Even when you hire through an agency, it’s always best to learn about who you’re meeting up with first. Escort scams are real, so search their name online and reverse search their photos to make sure they’re the real deal. [4] X Research source Read reviews of the escort’s services on sites like The Erotic Review . Confirm the age of your escort, as there are many sex trafficking operations of minors under 18 disguised as escort services. [5] X Research source Most agencies do quick searches of clients to protect their escorts, so don’t feel bad about looking them up too!"

      "title": "Make an appointment with your escort.",
      "content": "Make an appointment with your escort. Once you’ve found the perfect escort, schedule an appointment with them. Discuss a date, time, and meeting place. Tell your escort what you want to do during the appointment (watch a movie, go to a restaurant, etc.), so they know what to expect. If the escort is comfortable with everything and all the logistics are worked out, set the date. Keep your meeting friendly and platonic to avoid accusations of prostitution and stay within the means of the law."

      "title": "Prepare for meeting your escort like you would any other date.",
      "content": "Prepare for meeting your escort like you would any other date. You probably wouldn’t show up to a first date all smelly, so don’t with your escort! Take a shower, brush your teeth, put on deodorant , and pick out a nice outfit . Even though you’re paying them for their services, cleaning up and looking put together is a thoughtful and polite way to say, “I respect you and your time.”"

      "title": "Be cautious when first meeting an escort.",
      "content": "Be cautious when first meeting an escort. When you arrive at your meeting location, look around. If you see anything suspicious or don’t feel safe, walk away. You should feel excited and comfortable hanging out with your hired companion, so don’t be ashamed to take a step back if things don’t feel right. Things may not feel right if you’re planning on participating in something illegal, so reconsider your choices before doing something that might get you or your escort in trouble."

    {
      "title": "Confirm your escort's identity, and move forward if you’re both comfortable.",
      "content": "Confirm your escort's identity, and move forward if you’re both comfortable. When you first see the escort, notice if they’re who you agreed to meet. Do they appear to be as old as they say they are? If something seems amiss, don’t be afraid to deny their services and walk away. Consider asking to see their escorting license (if their agency provides one) or their ID to confirm their age. Notice their body language . If they seem uncomfortable in any way, they may be escorting against their will."

    {
      "title": "Show your escort the money before your time together starts.",
      "content": "Show your escort the money before your time together starts. Once you meet up with your escort, take a moment to acknowledge that you have the money to pay them. Pull the cash out of your pocket, or place larger amounts in an envelope and set it on a table or counter. This is your way of letting them know you’re aware their time is part of a transaction, and you have the agreed amount to pay them afterward. Some escorts and agencies may require payment before services start. If this is the case, make sure you pay them the allotted amount to gain their trust. Avoid paying an escort for sex, as this is illegal in many countries and states."
