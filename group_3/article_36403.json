If you’re cleaning fixtures, use a screwdriver to remove the fixtures from the walls or doors. Carefully set aside the screws for each fixture. [1] X Research source You can use individual plastic bags to keep track of which screws go with which fixtures. Label the bags with permanent marker."

      "content": "Find a large pot that you don’t plan to cook in again. Because many brass fixtures are quite old, they may be covered in lead-based paint. You’ll need a pot you do not plan on cooking in ever again to remove this paint. You can save the pot, however, for your future cleaning needs. [2] X Research source If you don’t have an old pot, you can likely buy one at a thrift store for under $5. Alternatively, you can use an old crockpot, but only if you can commit to not cooking in it again. You can also use an old crockpot, but only if you can commit to not cooking in it again."

      "title": "Add water and dish detergent to the pot.",
      "content": "Add water and dish detergent to the pot. Fill the pot with enough water that all of your brass is completely submerged. Add about 4–5 tablespoons (59–74 mL) of soap and give the pot a good mix with an implement you don’t mind throwing away."

      "title": "Simmer the mixture for 6-8 hours.",
      "content": "Simmer the mixture for 6-8 hours. Set your stove to low heat to get the water simmering rather than boiling. This will allow the brass to slowly heat up. You’ll need to give the brass plenty of time to soak in this simmering water so that the paint can fully loosen. [4] X Research source If you’re using a crockpot, set to the low setting and leave it on for a minimum of 8 hours and up to overnight."

      "title": "Use tongs to remove the brass from the hot water.",
      "content": "Use tongs to remove the brass from the hot water. The paint should have started to separate from the brass. Your brass will now be very hot, so exercise caution when removing it from the pot. You may want to put on a pair of gardening gloves when removing the brass. This should still allow you to have the necessary mobility you need to handle the tongs, while also allowing you to protect yourself from the heat."

      "title": "Set the brass in a bowl of ice water.",
      "content": "Set the brass in a bowl of ice water. Cooling off the brass immediately should make the paint even easier to remove. It will also make the brass much safer to handle. Let the brass sit in the ice water for about 5 minutes, then transfer it to an old towel you’re prepared to throw away."

Wear rubber or gardening gloves and check them frequently for holes or tears.

You don’t want to scratch the brass. [7] X Expert Source Patrick Coye Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 19 August 2020. If you start to notice any scratching, switch to a soft cloth to more gently rub off the paint. You can also scrape away the paint with your fingernails, if you don’t mind getting them dirty."

These areas might need extra attention that can’t be provided by your steel wool. [8] X Research source Avoid wire brushes, as these may scratch the surface of your brass. You can also try using a putty knife to help remove excess paint. [9] X Expert Source Patrick Coye Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 19 August 2020."

You’ll need to let it sit for a few hours, and then you should be able to wipe off the paint residue with a rag. [11] X Research source Protect yourself from these substances by wearing gloves while you apply and remove it. Discard your gloves and any rags with chemical stripper on them in a metal trash can outdoors. Don't use sandpaper to remove the paint, since it will just scuff up your fixtures.

The application process will also require a soft cloth, and you can buff the surface using the same small circular motions you would use with the oil. Some of these substances may require you to wear protective gloves."
