Do not enter unless a safe gap is present. If there is no traffic in the roundabout, you may enter the roundabout without yielding. [3] X Research source Crosswalks are placed one or two car-lengths before the roundabout itself. Yield to any pedestrians who are in, or about to enter, the crosswalk. If a car is in the roundabout, you could look at the direction of its tires or if it has a signal, this will give you an indication whether they're turning or they're going to go straight through the roundabout."

Instead, exit out your original destination and only then pull over."

[7] X Research source If you know you'll be turning right, and hence staying in the rightmost lane, but you see an oncoming car in the left lane, wait for it to pass before entering the roundabout. Although frowned on, the car could merge into your lane just as you are entering the roundabout, causing an accident."

In multi-lane roundabouts, which usually have three or more possible exits, the lane you choose to drive in is dictated by the kind of turn you want to make: [8] X Research source Occupy the left lane if you decide to turn left, make a U-turn, or go straight. Occupy the right lane if you decide to turn right or go straight. Look for signs indicating the allowed movements for each lane. These signs are usually located above or alongside the road and/or arrows painted on the road itself."

Remain centered in your lane to be most visible and avoid being cut off by other vehicles. Stay in the dedicated bicycle lane and proceed to your exit. The roundabout may have an undercrossing or overcrossing for pedestrians and cyclists to avoid conflict with vehicles.
