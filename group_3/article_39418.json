      "content": "Most experts say no, but it can depend on your motivation for texting them. Are you just a good friend wishing them well, or are you secretly hoping that a birthday text could lead to something more? It's important to explore whether you might have underlying motives before you decide to hit send...otherwise, you might end up getting hurt all over again. [1] X Research source If you’re trying to use their birthday as an “in” to strike up a long conversation, there are better options. Really, almost any other day is a better time for a heart-to-heart. For now, just let them enjoy their birthday plans. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "You’re lonely and you miss your ex. Knowing they’re celebrating without you can bring up wistful memories of happier times together. But if you’re using their birthday as an excuse to initiate contact, it probably won’t go over well. Think about it: this is their special day, and hearing from an ex could really ruin the party mood! [3] X Research source If they aren’t interested in reconnecting with you, your text won’t be welcome. Worst-case scenario? You could give off stalkerish vibes, and that’s the LAST thing you want. [4] X Research source Even if they’re missing you too, a text could still throw off their day. Instead of focusing on celebrating, they’re now dissecting your message word by word, trying to figure out what it really means."

      "content": "You want them to know you’re so over it. You’ve moved on, you’re doing well, and you’re living the dream! That nasty breakup you two had? No biggie. In fact, you’re so chill about the situation that you can send a casual happy b-day text to wish them well. That’s very mature of you! But there’s a chance they won’t see it that way…after all, you’re clearly sitting there thinking about them, and you even remembered their birthday [5] X Research source If you’re texting to make it clear that everything’s cool between you, a happy birthday message might send the wrong message. Your ex will wonder why you’re bothering to reach out if you’re really over them. If you feel the need to prove you’re over the relationship, you might not be quite as over it as you think. [6] X Research source That’s okay, healing from a breakup takes time. Meanwhile, resist the urge to message them. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "You’re curious about their life without you. It’s totally normal to wonder what your ex is up to now. Are they still working at the same place? Are they in a relationship? And perhaps the most important question of all: how’s their dog? Curiosity is perfectly natural, but think carefully about how the info you learn might impact your mood. [8] X Research source If they’re engaged, can you truly be happy for them? And what if–heaven forbid–Fido crossed the rainbow bridge to that big dog park in the sky? For your own emotional well-being, some questions might be better left unanswered."

If you’re reminiscing about how good you were together and you’re hoping a text might lead to some frisky fun, just hold up for a minute. There was a reason you broke up, right? Sure, there were some good times, but take a second to reflect on the bad parts as well. Now ask yourself: is it worth it? [9] X Research source There’s a chance that they’ll take the bait and “happy birthday” will lead to “happy hookup.” But wow, things are going to get complicated after that. Unless you’re also in the mood for drama, it might be best to skip the HBD text. Of course, there’s also a chance that your text will just upset them. If that happens, they’ll probably share “WTH?!” screenshots with all their friends, landing you right in the middle of–yep, you guessed it–drama."

Maybe a birthday text would lead to a conversation so you could clear the air and find closure. It’s an understandable desire, but according to relationship experts, it’s misplaced. That is, you probably won’t find closure by turning to your ex for answers. [10] X Research source Instead of turning to your ex for healing, look inward, learn to validate yourself, and strive to make peace with the situation. [11] X Research source Focus on finding meaning instead of closure. What lessons have you learned from the experience? Have you become wiser or more resilient? Have you discovered truths about who you are and what you want? [12] X Research source If you’re struggling to process the end of your relationship, therapy can help. A mental health professionals can offer non-judgmental support as you work through your feelings in a productive way. [13] X Research source"

That begs the question: if it’s totally casual and honestly no big deal, why are you researching this topic? Are you sure you’re not harboring any secret hopes or dreams about how they’ll respond? If you can completely rule out an underlying motive, then consider whether sending a happy birthday text is necessary. If it isn’t, then why do it? This may be a case where it’s simplest to just let things be. [14] X Research source In this scenario, a text that you see as completely neutral might be misinterpreted as romantic interest. If you text your ex to let them know you’re thinking about them on their birthday, you might be leading them on unintentionally ."

If you and your ex made that rare transition from romantic partners to close pals, it’s perfectly okay to text them “happy birthday.” [19] X Research source Since you already communicate on a frequent basis, it would be kind of weird to ignore their special day.

As long as you don’t have any ulterior motives, it isn’t a big deal. [22] X Research source There’s no good reason to send them a direct message. Handle it the same way you would with any random acquaintance on Facebook: by posting a generic birthday message on their wall. For what it’s worth, research shows that simply keeping your ex as a Facebook friend is linked to less personal growth. Maybe it’s time to cut ties there, too?
