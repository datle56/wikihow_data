      "content": "Add another shape you want to cut out. For example, you can add a text stencil that says the word \"Happy Birthday,\" but this method works with any shape or text . If you're making a gift tag, like in the example, you can also add a small circle to cut out a hole in the gift tag."

      "title": "Select the background shape and the cut-out shape.",
      "content": "Select the background shape and the cut-out shape. You can only do Slices with two layers at a time, so if you have multiple shapes to cut out, you'll have to do them one at a time."

You will see your layers change to \"Slice Result\" layers, and you will have a layer for the original shape, the background shape (minus the cutout), and the cutout shape from the background. Repeat this step for every additional shape you want to cut out from the background shape."

      "title": "Delete the extra layers, if necessary.",
      "content": "Delete the extra layers, if necessary. In the example, if you're trying to cut the word \"Happy Birthday\" out of a gift tag, you likely can delete the original \"Happy Birthday\" shape and the \"Happy Birthday\" cutout while leaving the background alone (as this will become your gift tag once you send it to the Cricut). However, if you plan on using these cutouts for a different part of your project, you should keep them on the canvas. If you also cut a hole out of your gift tag, you can delete the original circle shape and the cutout circle from the background."
