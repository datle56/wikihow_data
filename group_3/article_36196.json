Head & Shoulders and Original Formula Prell are popular options. [1] X Research source Dandruff shampoo is a little more heavy-duty than normal shampoo; people with dandruff have excess sebum that causes the skin to flake off, necessitating a stronger formula."

      "content": "Rinse your hair thoroughly. Dish soap causes hair to become very dry and strips out natural oils, so be sure to rinse it out thoroughly. You will probably have to repeat this technique more than once, but because dish soap is so harsh, don't repeat it too many times in a row."

      "title": "Follow up with a deep conditioner every time.",
      "content": "Follow up with a deep conditioner every time. Always follow the last rinse with a deep conditioning treatment such as hot oil. Dish soap is extremely drying; your strands will need a dose of hydration every time you use it. You can even sit under a heated dryer to increase the effectiveness of the conditioner."

If you dyed your hair a darker color with a semi-permanent dye (one that claims to wash out in 28 shampoos) and only a couple of days have passed, try this technique. Dump a bunch of vitamin C tablets in a bowl, add hot water, and crush with a spoon to make a thick paste. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Create a mixture of equal parts vinegar and warm water. Be sure to use plain white vinegar. Apple cider vinegar is less acidic, so it won't be as effective.
