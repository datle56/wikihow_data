Permanent inks are usually oil-based and can be broken down by applying an alcohol-based solvent. There are many common household items that will work. Choose hand sanitizer, rubbing alcohol, or an acetone nail polish remover. [2] X Research source Hairspray used to be the most recommended product for cleaning ink from fabrics. Today, however, most hairsprays are made with much less alcohol and will not be very effective at breaking down an ink stain. [3] X Research source Don't water down or dilute the solvent in any way. You will apply it directly to the stain."

      "content": "Make a vinegar and water solution to tackle tough stains. Vinegar can act a stronger solvent than some of your other alcohol-based cleaners, but it is also very acidic and corrosive and should be used with caution. Dilute the vinegar with water in a 1:1 ratio. Either make the solution in a bowl and dip your cleaning cloths in it, or fill a small spray bottle with 1 part vinegar and 1 part room-temperature water. [5] X Research source Don't use water that is too hot as it may damage your fabric when you apply it."

Make the solution in a bowl or spray bottle with 1 part water to 1 part bleach. [6] X Trustworthy Source State of Michigan Official website for the State of Michigan Go to source Chlorine bleach not only removes dyes from fabric, but it's also a harsh chemical that can break down the fibers and cause damage. Making a mistake with chlorine bleach is usually irreparable, so only use it with extreme caution. Color-safe non-chlorine bleach is not always as safe for fabric as it is advertised. Use it with caution and spot test a hidden part of the fabric first if you want to use it."

Use dry paper towels or clean white rags and blot the spill until the stain no longer looks wet. [7] X Research source If you are able to turn the fabric over, blot up excess ink that leaked through the reverse side as well. Keep blotting up the ink until no more comes off on the towel when you gently press on the stain. [8] X Research source"

Rotate the cloth or cotton ball as you dab to ensure you are using a clean part of it. Replace the cotton balls or cloth with new ones when they become saturated with ink to avoid spreading the stain farther. Repeat the process until no more ink comes out of the fabric and the stain disappears. [13] X Research source If you are cleaning clothing or linens that you can easily move around, place a clean towel or paper bag underneath the fabric as you blot the ink so it can help to soak up any pigment that is soaking through the fabric. Never rub an ink stain—always blot—otherwise you will spread the stain around and make it worse."

If you are cleaning a carpet or upholstery, dab away the cleaning solution with a damp, slightly soapy cloth. Only use one or two drops of soap on the cloth so that you don't leave behind a soapy residue on the fabric's surface. [14] X Research source Don't put clothes or linens in the dryer until you are certain all the ink has been removed. If there are still traces of ink, the heat from the dryer will set the stain and they may be impossible to remove after that."
