      "title": "Be patient.",
      "content": "Be patient. If the nerve has been only partially compressed or severed, it may repair itself over time. [5] X Research source This is because the nerve tissue beyond the damage point dies and the nerve must regenerate between healthy nerve endings. A pinched nerve can occur from a number of reasons including: bad posture, injury, arthritis, spinal stenosis, and/or obesity.

      "content": "Take non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAID) or acetaminophen. These medications should be used to treat acute pain sporadically or for no more than one to two weeks, unless recommended by a doctor. [7] X Research source While NSAIDs treat swelling and possibly inflamed nerves, acetaminophen only treats pain. Be sure these medications will not interact with any other medications you take. For example, avoid taking aspirin when on blood thinners. Long-term NSAID use can lead to gastritis and gastric ulcers. Be aware of your use of these medications."

      "title": "Try physical therapy.",
      "content": "Try physical therapy. If a nerve was pinched, rather than severed, physical therapy (PT) is often used to repair the damage and increase strength and mobility. Check if your doctor will prescribe physical therapy. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Some insurance companies will not cover PT. Always check with your insurance company if you have a question about billing. You may need to wait several weeks or months after acute injury to start this phase of repair. The nerve may need time to heal and regrow. Try de-weighted training in the pool for problems with movement on land. After you build up your stamina, try some strength and resistance training."

      "title": "Sign up for acupuncture therapy.",
      "content": "Sign up for acupuncture therapy. Some patients find that acupuncture calms the nerves and allows them to continue normal function while the nerves repair themselves. [9] X Research source Biofeedback can also be helpful. This is a technique you can use to control your body’s functions. You are connected to electronic sensors that provides information that will help you focus and relax. [10] X Research source Unfortunately, neither acupuncture nor biofeedback are typically covered under American health insurance plans."

      "title": "Undergo electromyography (EMG) or nerve conduction tests.",
      "content": "Undergo electromyography (EMG) or nerve conduction tests. These tests may find the location of the nerve damage and its severity. Your doctor may also prescribe a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) test. [11] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Some of these tests, like an EMG can be done at your general practitioners. However, more invasive tests like an MRI may be conducted at a specialist or a hospital."

      "title": "Consider an epidural injection to numb nerves.",
      "content": "Consider an epidural injection to numb nerves. If your doctor determines that your nerve damage is not causing long-term damage, you may be a candidate for a numbing or steroid injection called a “nerve root block” (epidural). [12] X Research source Nerve root blocks are usually done by a trained anesthesiologist in pain therapy. Steroids can help your body heal more quickly from nerve damage. [13] X Research source These medications are injected near the spine or neck (where the “roots” of periphery nerves are located)."

      "title": "Consider minor surgery.",
      "content": "Consider minor surgery. Some types of nerve damage occur from compression or pinching. Minor outpatient surgeries are often sufficient to repair this damage. Criteria for surgery include symptoms of radiculopathy, evidence of nerve root compression on an MRI, persistent nerve pain last longer than 6 weeks, and progressive motor weakness. https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6481-pinched-nerves Minor surgery can be an arthroscopic surgery to unblock the pinched nerve or sew the damaged ends of the nerves together. Surgery is the last resort for minor or moderate nerve damage like pinched nerves. It may be necessary for more serious damage or injuries. Another minor surgery is a nerve release, which can help to fix nerve compression seen in nerve damage like carpal tunnel syndrome. [14] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source These may create more room for the nerve by dividing tissue, or by moving the nerve to a new location."

      "title": "Engage in nerve “re-education” therapy.",
      "content": "Engage in nerve “re-education” therapy. The nerves may need to be re-trained with this special type of physical therapy. This re-education therapy is generally completed in two stages: “early” and “late.” It is the process of “tuning” your nerves into feeling sensations normally. [15] X Research source The early stage of this therapy is making sure your nerves can feel a wide scope of sensations, while the late stage is fine tuning the sensations to manageable sensations. This type of therapy is generally done in outpatient physical therapy. The length of the sessions depends on the severity of the injury. Generally, this procedure does take some time, as it is essentially “retraining” the body to return to a normal range of function."

      "content": "Seek medical attention. Go to the emergency room immediately if you have had an acute injury and you are experiencing numbness or tingling in your extremities. [16] X Research source If you have cut yourself on something sharp, try to staunch the bleeding with firm pressure and sterile gauze as you go to the emergency room. [17] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Nerve damage due to cuts from knives in the kitchen or broken glass is fairly common. Visit the emergency room if you have had recent contact with lead, arsenic, mercury, or other toxic substances. They need to be flushed from your body before repair can start."

      "content": "Consider surgery to reconnect or graft nerves. If the nerve has been completely severed, this may be necessary in order to start repair. [18] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source If the surgery is successful, the nerve will grow and repair at a rate of approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) per month. [19] X Research source Nerve grafts often require the removal of nerve fiber from another part of the body. The area from which it was taken may remain numb after the surgery. [20] X Research source"

      "title": "Retrain your body.",
      "content": "Retrain your body. There are two general phases of “sensory re-training” you’ll undergo with a physical therapist or neurospecialist. The early stage teaches you to differentiate between constant touch (like the feeling of a chair on your buttocks and back while you’re sitting) and moving touch (like a gust of wind hitting your face). The late phase retrains your sense of directionality, or the ability to sense which direction a stimulus is moving across the skin (left to right, right to left, up or down, etc.). [21] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This repairing requires the cells to heal and “retune” themselves to properly send signals to the brain. Additional physical therapy will help you train your body to heal properly by doing incremental range-of-motion exercises. This may require time. Nerve repair may not happen overnight. It may take weeks, months, or years to heal. [22] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In severe cases, nerve function may not repair fully. Your doctor should be able to give you a prognosis about how long it will take to heal from a specific injury."

Loss of muscle control. This may cause weakness. If you find yourself having trouble with everyday tasks like buttoning a shirt or twisting a doorknob, these may be signs of nerve damage. Difficulty digesting food. This may be accompanied by bloating or fullness. You may vomit partially digested food or have trouble using the bathroom. Peripheral neuropathy affects the brain’s ability to receive pain signals from your nerves. It is a common disorder and the symptoms include pain or numbness in the extremities. You may feel tingling or burning in your arms or legs, which may be an early sign of nerve damage."
