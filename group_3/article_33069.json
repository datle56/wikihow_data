      "content": "The goal of chess is to capture your opponent’s king; however, most games end before the capture when the opponent is unable to prevent their king from being captured. Checkmate occurs if you put your opponent’s king in check (meaning it is under direct threat) and they are incapable of moving the king or blocking the threat with another piece. When this happens, say “checkmate” out loud to declare the end of the game. Let your opponent double-check if they can make a move before declaring yourself the winner! [1] X Research source Games may also end in a draw if neither player can force a checkmate, such as if the kings are the only pieces left on the board. A game also ends in a draw if the opponent has no legal move that they can make, such as if the king is trapped but also not in check. This is referred to as a stalemate . A game also automatically ends in a draw if the same board state is achieved 3 times. This can happen accidentally, but it’s more common when both players repeat the same move 3 times because nobody thinks they can win. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Rooks (the small castle towers, valued at 5 points) Rooks are the stubby round pieces that look like medieval towers on a castle. They can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically, but they cannot jump over other pieces or move diagonally. After your queen, your two rooks are the most valuable offensive pieces in the game, although they’re excellent defensive pieces early on in the game."

      "content": "Knights (the horses, valued at 3 points) Knights move in L-shapes by going 2 spaces horizontally and 1 space vertically (up or down), or 2 spaces vertically followed by 1 space horizontally (left or right). Knights are unique because they can jump over other pieces. Knights are considered just as valuable as bishops. They’re versatile pieces that are helpful when it comes to offense and defense. Knights are also unique because they’re the only piece outside of the pawns that you can move on the first turn of the game."

They can move in a straight line diagonally in any direction. They cannot jump over other pieces. Like the knight, bishops are extremely diverse when it comes to their skills on offense or defense. Note that you have one bishop that can only move on black pieces, and another bishop that can only move on white pieces."

      "content": "Queen (the tall piece with the round cap, valued at 9 points) Your queen is the heavy hitter. It can move any number of squares in any linear direction as long as there isn't a piece blocking the path. In other words, they can move diagonally, up/down, or left/right. They can’t jump pieces. If you’re struggling to picture this, a queen moves like a bishop and a rook combined. Your queen is the single greatest tool when it comes to capturing your opponent’s king while protecting yours."

Kings can move 1 space at a time in any direction. You can’t move your king into a space where it can get captured during the next turn. In other words, you cannot intentionally move your king into check."

      "content": "Pawns (the short, stubby, round pieces, valued at 1 point) Pawns can only move 1 space forward toward your opponent’s side of the board. However, a pawn can move 2 spaces forward on their first move of the game (if there isn’t another piece in the way). Pawns can only attack by taking a piece that is 1 space away on a diagonal to the pawn. There is, however, an exception. When a pawn moves two spaces forward to bypass a pawn capture, and only a pawn capture, the opposing pawn may capture as if said piece moved one square. This move is called en passant. The pawn captured will then be taken off the board. Your pawns are the shortest and weakest pieces in a game of chess. However, they’re extremely important. Your pawns help create space for other pieces, set up moves, and box in your opponent’s pieces. A pawn can be promoted to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight if it is successfully advanced to the other side of the board."

Ranks are listed 1-8, starting with the side of the board with the white pieces. Files are listed as the letters “a” through “h” starting from the white player’s left side. Reference a specific square on the board by listing the rank followed by the file. [3] X Research source For example, the left corner for the white player is a1 while the left corner for the black player is h8. Practice notation by listing each move you and your opponent make by writing down the piece and the square to which it moves. You do not need to use the rank and file notation system if you don’t want to, but it does make setting up the board and learning the game easier."

[11] X Research source If you’re playing multiple games in a row, alternate who starts with the white pieces to keep the games fair. The player with the white pieces has a slight advantage since they get to make the opening move. You can flip a coin, do rock paper scissors, or allow players to volunteer who goes first."

You can threaten your opponent’s pieces by moving your pieces into a space where you can capture them on the next turn. Alternatively, you can reinforce a defensive position by moving pieces away from your opponent’s threats so that your pieces protect one another. [12] X Research source For the first few turns of the game, players usually move pawns, followed by knights and bishops. You can play in whatever order you’d like, though! In competitive chess there’s a rule that if you touch a piece, you have to move it. It’s okay to touch pieces as you’re just starting to learn, but practice moving the pieces in your mind once you’ve got the basics down."

Try to capture your opponent’s stronger pieces, like their queen, rooks, and bishops to make their turns less powerful. [13] X Research source When you capture your opponent’s piece, pick it up off of the board and set it aside. Pawns cannot capture pieces directly in front of them like other pieces do. Instead, pawns can only capture pieces that are 1 space diagonally in front of them. You cannot capture your opponent’s king.

Your opponent must get out of check during their next turn either by moving their king, blocking your piece, or capturing your piece. [14] X Research source Putting your opponent in check is ideal because it can cause them to drop whatever their gameplan was and move pieces to protect their king. It can also force the king into progressively riskier positions. The king can capture the enemy piece only if it’s not in check after the capture. If you’re in check, you must do something to protect your king, or else you make an illegal move."

      "title": "The “en passant\" rule",
      "content": "The “en passant\" rule En passant, meaning \"in passing\" in French, is when one pawn captures another pawn after its starting move. You can only do en passant if your opponent has moved a pawn 2 squares forward from its starting position so it’s next to one of your pawns. If this happens, you may move your pawn into the space behind your opponent’s pawn to capture it. [15] X Research source You can only perform an en passant move during the turn after your opponent moves the pawn. You cannot wait to do it on any other turn after. This is probably the most complicated move in the game. If you’re new to chess and you’re just playing casually, feel free to skip this rule as you’re learning."

      "title": "Pawn promotion",
      "content": "Pawn promotion If you move a pawn to the back row on your opponent’s side of the board, it immediately gets promoted to any piece of your choosing (besides the king). In most cases, it's best to choose to promote to a queen because the queen is the most powerful piece. This way, you can have multiple queens on the board at a time. [16] X Research source It doesn’t matter if your queen has already been captured or is still in the game when you promote your pawn. To indicate pawn promotion in chess notation, write the square where the pawn is promoted. Then, use an equal sign to show what the new piece is. For example, you may write c8=Q. Reasons to “underpromote” (i.e. not choose a queen) are to avoid stalemate or to utilize the knight's move. This is pretty rare, though."

Then on the same move, move the rook to the square immediately on the other side of the king. The spaces between the king and rook must be 100% clear. [17] X Research source You cannot castle if your king was in check during the previous move, or if it would be in check after the move. You also cannot castle through any squares that are under attack by enemy pieces. You cannot castle rooks that have moved, or if your king has moved."

      "title": "Use the point value of each piece to determine their importance.",
      "content": "Use the point value of each piece to determine their importance. Each piece in a game of chess is valued differently depending on how powerful it is. The queen is the most powerful piece and is worth 9 points. Rooks are worth 5 points, bishops and knights are worth 3, and pawns are worth 1 point. Try to protect your more powerful pieces so you can use them later in the game. [18] X Research source The king's value is undefined as it cannot be captured. Compare the total value of all the pieces still on the board for each player to determine who has a material advantage (this is one way to determine who is “winning”). Point assessment is also useful when considering possible captures. For example, using pieces with a lower value to capture pieces with a higher value gives you more of an advantage."

      "content": "Start with a strong opening pawn or knight move. Your opening move determines a lot about how the beginning of the game will play out. If you’re white, choose a center square to attack with your D or E pawn, or move your B or G knights out to the center for a strong attack. As black, defend the center squares by matching and playing off your opponent’s pawn or knight moves. [19] X Research source When people talk about complex “openings” like the Queen’s Gambit , London Opener, or Sicilian Defense, they’re talking about a sequence of memorized moves that are proven to start you off right. These are known as book moves, and they’re a great way to improve at the game !"

      "title": "Aim to control the center of the board.",
      "content": "Aim to control the center of the board. Pieces near the center are at their most powerful since they have the most mobility and control. This forces your opponent to the sides of the board where they have fewer moves to choose from. Controlling the center helps you play more offensive and your opponent defensive. [20] X Research source Keep 1 or 2 pawns in the center of the board so you can still use your stronger pieces to attack. This is why people often start the game by moving the 2 pawns in the middle of the pawn file and the 2 knights, since this covers the 4 squares at the center of the board."
