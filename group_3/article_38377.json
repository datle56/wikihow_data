Apply your conditioner, allowing it to soak in for a few minutes before you rinse your hair. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source After you wash your hair, put in a good leave-in product. If you have tangles in your hair it can end up looked a bit ragged after scrunching. Work any tangles or knots out of your hair with a wide-tooth comb while in the shower. It's easiest to do this while the conditioner is still on your hair."

      "title": "Towel-dry your hair.",
      "content": "Towel-dry your hair. Separate your hair into small sections by hand. Grab a single section at a time and place it inside your towel (preferably a microfiber towel to help reduce frizz). Then, apply pressure to squeeze out any excess water. Repeat until you’ve finished all of the sections. You can also use a cotton T-shirt to wring out the excess water from your hair. Many people find that the thinner cloth helps to create better waves and reduces frizz. If you have already curly hair, a t-shirt will also prevent the curl from breaking down. [2] X Research source To give your hair even more texture, you can use a towel to wrap it up on your head like a turban right after stepping out of the shower. Keep it up like this for 2 minutes. The heat from your shower will start to produce waves in your hair."

      "title": "Flip your hair upside down.",
      "content": "Flip your hair upside down. Bend over and let your hair fall down towards the ground. Gradually work your fingers through the exposed underside of your hair, smoothing out any knots. You can use the towel to further dry off any additional damp spots in your hair. However, most of the work in this step should be done with just your bare hands."

      "title": "Work in a curl-enhancing product.",
      "content": "Work in a curl-enhancing product. With your head still bent down, apply a quarter-sized amount of styling mousse into one palm and press your hands together. Then, starting at the roots, gather your hair in your hands and scrunch it up. Your hand movement should look almost like it would if you were wrinkling up a piece of paper in your hand. Stand back upright and continue applying the mousse. Mousse is not your only option. You can also use other products, such as gels, sprays, or serums. Just select a product that advertises a strong degree of hold, especially if you have thin or straight hair. Don’t apply the mousse or other products to the very tips of your hair. This can lead to a greasy, heavy look. If your hair is very porous, you might want to use a spray leave-in. Thick products might weigh your hair down and make it look greasy in the next day or two."

      "content": "Push small sections of hair towards your scalp. Once you’ve finished working in the product, continue moving your hands in a scrunching motion across your hair. For the areas around your face, do a precise scrunch by placing a small section of hair in your palm and folding it up like an accordion before releasing it. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Let your hair continue to air dry.",
      "content": "Let your hair continue to air dry. Repeat the all-over hair scrunching every 5 to 10 minutes until all of your hair feels dry to the touch. It’s best not to use the hair dryer to speed up the process, as it can pull apart the waves that you’ve created."

      "content": "Towel-dry your hair. If your hair is wet from the shower, grab a towel and dry it in small sections at a time. Place each section of hair inside the towel. Then, apply gentle pressure until most of the excess water is absorbed. Repeat until all of your hair feels damp, not soaking wet.

      "title": "Clip your hair up for extra curls.",
      "content": "Clip your hair up for extra curls. After towel drying your hair, get a number of small and medium butterfly hair clips. Fold up small sections of your hair and place them into the clips against your scalp. Arrange the clips in a haphazard fashion to achieve that beachy, wavy look. This is another way to create extra texture as your hair finishes air drying. If you don’t have butterfly clips, you can also wind your hair up into mini buns against your head. Hold these buns in place using bobby pins. [5] X Expert Source Matt King Director of Education, Fox and Jane Salon Group Expert Interview. 31 August 2021. You can do as many bunches or buns as you like. Fewer buns will create larger, looser waves, while many buns will give you smaller, tighter curls."

    {
      "title": "Spray with hairspray.",
      "content": "Spray with hairspray. While the clips are still positioned in your hair, get a can of strong-hold hairspray. Apply it all over your hair in even amounts. Let your hair stay in the clips for about 30 minutes after you finish spraying. This will give your hair enough time to set into waves. Depending on how fast your hair dries, you may need to leave the clips in longer than 30 minutes. Try to use a hairspray that makes your hair feel soft after it’s applied. Some hairsprays can leave behind a crunchy, rough texture."

      "title": "Remove the clips.",
      "content": "Remove the clips. Take the clips out one-by-one. Use your fingers to gently release the hair and pull it slightly downwards. When all of the clips are out, do at least 1 round of all-over hair scrunching with your fingers. Work out any rough spots caused by the hairspray, too. Whatever you do, do not brush your hair out with a hairbrush or comb. This will undo the curls and cause your hair to look frizzy. If you're not 100% happy with how the curls turned out, it's okay to cheat and use a curling tong to give a little extra definition."

      "content": "Apply some hair gel or serum to the tips of your hair. Squeeze out a dime-sized portion of gel or serum onto your fingertips. Gently work the product into the bottom edges of your hair. This will make your ends appear shiny and vibrant, instead of flat and dull. It will also help to prevent frizzing."

      "title": "Attach a long-finger diffuser to your hair dryer.",
      "content": "Attach a long-finger diffuser to your hair dryer. A diffuser is an attachment that fits on the end of your blow dryer right where the air comes out. You can purchase them online or at a beauty product store. Most diffusers are wide-mouthed with a bowl or cup at the end where the air gathers. A diffuser is quick way to get a scrunched look with minimal damage to your hair. [6] X Research source Diffusers help to evenly disperse the air flow."

      "content": "Turn the hair dryer's speed and heat settings to low. It’s important to use a low heat setting because it is less likely to cause frizziness. A low setting will also keep your hair from being damaged or burning as you dry it. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Dry your hair with the diffuser.",
      "content": "Dry your hair with the diffuser. Flip your head upside down and place your hair in sections into the diffuser bowl. Try to keep the diffuser about two to three inches away from your scalp. As you move the diffuser around, scrunch up your hair with your fingers. This option is best used as an alternative to towel drying immediately after a shower."

    {
      "title": "Apply some hairspray or gel.",
      "content": "Apply some hairspray or gel. When your hair is about 80% dry from the diffuser, flip it back up. Then, lift your hair slightly away from your scalp and spray hairspray over it. Or, squeeze a dime-sized about of styling gel into your palms and work them through your hair from slightly away from the roots to the tips. Hair gel can provide a firmer hold. However, it can also make your hair look greasy if it’s overused. If you use a light coating of hairspray, you may need to reapply throughout the day to avoid frizziness."
