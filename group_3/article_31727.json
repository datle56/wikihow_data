If only a sheet in the Excel workbook is protected—that is, if you can open the Excel file and view its contents but not edit it—then you can use this method to remove the password protection on both Windows and Mac computers. If the Excel file itself is encrypted and requires a password even to view the contents, this method will definitely not work. You can try using a password cracker , but there are no guarantees. There's a chance this method won't work if the file was protected using the Microsoft 365 version of Excel. [1] X Research source"

You'll have an easier time cracking a shorter password without special characters, although it may still be possible to crack more complex passwords using the right app. It is impossible to crack an Excel file without purchasing a password cracker, as free versions of reputable password crackers usually only cover up to Excel 2010. If your Excel file truly is encrypted, double-clicking the Excel file will prompt you for a password before you can view the file's contents. If this is the case (and you don't know the password), you'll need a password cracker to view its contents."

It can also decrypt Excel files made in all versions of Excel, including 2019 and Microsoft 365. There are two drawbacks, though: One is that the app only works on Windows, so Mac users will need access to a PC. [6] X Research source There may be a Mac alternative, but none have proven to be as reliable. If you don't have access to Windows, try searching for another Excel password-cracking app. Just be sure to research the app thoroughly before downloading and installing, as there are many rogue apps out there. The other is that the software is not totally free—some basic features in the trial version may help crack your password, but you'll need to pay for a license if the password is complex. If you just need to crack one workbook, you can go for the one-month option that's only $15.95.

There are three options you can choose from: Dictionary Attack is a good option if you think the password is a simple word from the dictionary. You can also provide your own list of words to add in addition to the dictionary, such as common passwords used by your organization. Just add those potential passwords to a text file, save it, click Settings next to \"Dictionary Attack,\" and select that file. This is the only free option, and it only includes a limited dictionary. [9] X Research source If you want to gain access to more options, click Upgrade Now to purchase a license. Brute Force with Mask Attack is a great option if you know any parts of the password, or want to include certain letters, numbers, or symbols in your cracking attempt. If you choose this option, click Settings beside it to customize the length of passwords to try, which characters to use, and prefixes and/or suffixes. Depending on the length and complexity of the password, this option can take a long time—hours, days, even weeks! Brute Force Attack is just like the previous option, except it's best for when you really have no idea what the password could be. It tries all possible combinations until it can figure out the password, which can take a long time, depending on its length."
