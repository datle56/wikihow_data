      "title": "Opt for dry brushing if you're dealing with early efflorescence.",
      "content": "Opt for dry brushing if you're dealing with early efflorescence. If you're just noticing the salt deposits building up on your pavers, you may be able to simply brush it away using a large push-broom or other stiff-handled brush. This method keeps the salts from being washed back into the pavers, so it should be the first thing you try. If you leave the efflorescence in place, it will crystallize, making it harder to remove."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sweep the pavers from one end to the other.",
      "content": "Sweep the pavers from one end to the other. Focus especially on areas where the white deposits appear, but be sure to brush the entire surface of the pavers, since some of the deposits may not be built up enough to see. If you successfully remove all of the salt, you will reduce the chances that the efflorescence will return. It may take a little elbow grease to remove all of the visible white powder."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse the area with water if brushing doesn't remove the minerals.",
      "content": "Rinse the area with water if brushing doesn't remove the minerals. If you're having trouble removing the efflorescence with just a brush, rinsing the pavers off with a hose could help loosen the salt. However, water shouldn't be your first choice, because you could rinse some of the salts back into the brick, which could result in the efflorescence returning. The water may flush out some of the original salts from the concrete, so you may have to repeat this process. If you need to, you can also pour water from a bucket onto the pavers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Continue treating the efflorescence as it appears.",
      "content": "Continue treating the efflorescence as it appears. Efflorescence will not stop forming until all of the minerals in the concrete have been expelled. This means you may have to remove the efflorescence several times before it stops appearing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sweep the area to remove loose efflorescence.",
      "content": "Sweep the area to remove loose efflorescence. Even if you are dealing with stubborn, crystallized efflorescence, you should dry brush the area before you apply any chemicals. This will help ensure that you don't wash any of the salts back into the pores in your pavers."

      "title": "Rinse the pavers with 6% vinegar if dry brushing alone doesn't work.",
      "content": "Rinse the pavers with 6% vinegar if dry brushing alone doesn't work. Vinegar is extremely effective against efflorescence, and you don't have to worry about rinsing dangerous acids into the soil around your pavers. Pour vinegar that is 6% acid over the pavers, scrub them with a brush, then rinse it away with a water hose. [1] X Research source Vinegar may not remove large buildups of efflorescence. Most common vinegar is 6% acidity."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try muriatic acid if vinegar doesn't work.",
      "content": "Try muriatic acid if vinegar doesn't work. If nothing else works to remove efflorescence from your pavers, mix together 1 part acid and 5 parts water, then scrub the acid into the pavers with a stiff brush. Be sure to rinse it off completely with a hose or water from a bucket, since muriatic acid is a dangerous chemical. [2] X Research source Wear rubber gloves and goggles to protect yourself while you're working with muriatic acid. When you're diluting muriatic acid, pour the acid into the water, not the water into the acid. This will help prevent the acid from splashing up and burning you. You can purchase muriatic acid at a home improvement store. For an even stronger solution, mix white vinegar, ammonia and muriatic acid and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing."

      "title": "Use a minimal amount of cleaner and water.",
      "content": "Use a minimal amount of cleaner and water. Leaving the cleaner on your pavers can cause erosion, especially if you're working with muriatic acid, so you'll need to rinse it away. However, using large amounts of water can wash the salts back into the pavers, so it's best to use as little of the cleaner as possible. By minimizing the cleaner you use, you will also reduce the amount of water needed to rinse it off of the pavers."
