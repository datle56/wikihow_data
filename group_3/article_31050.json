      "title": "They’re overly flirtatious with others.",
      "content": "They’re overly flirtatious with others. A tell-tale sign of a monkey brancher is how often they flirt. If someone’s monkey branching you, they may flirt with everyone but you.

      "title": "They have dating apps.",
      "content": "They have dating apps. A monkey brancher keeps all of their options open. They’ll often have dating apps still on their phone even after the relationship is official.

      "title": "They’re oddly secretive.",
      "content": "They’re oddly secretive. A monkey brancher will keep things close to their chest especially if they're emotionally involved with someone else. Perhaps they start sneaking out or give you stories that don’t add up. If they avoid telling the whole truth, it may be because they’re emotionally involved with someone else. [3] X Research source Keep in mind that secrets aren’t a definitive sign of a cheater. Use context clues and trust your instincts to make the best judgment.

      "title": "They don’t make future plans with you.",
      "content": "They don’t make future plans with you. If someone plans to end a relationship, they’ll stifle any future plans.
