During each round, players play 1 card per turn, which is known as a “trick.” After everyone plays their cards, the player that has the card with the highest value wins the trick. Your team gets points at the end of the round based on how many tricks you win, and the first team to 10 points wins. [1] X Research source"

Sit directly across from your partner so the members of the other team are on your left and right. [2] X Research source If you’d rather leave it up to chance, have each player draw a random card. The players with the 2 lowest cards become one team and the other players become the second team."

Set the cards you’re not using aside since you won’t need them while you’re playing the game. [3] X Research source You can buy a specialty Euchre deck so you don’t have to pull cards out every time you want to play. Some people play with slightly larger decks that may include the 7s and 8s. They may also include a joker. Ask the people you’re playing with to clarify any rules they use."

Whoever has the highest value (with aces being the highest) gets to start the game as the first dealer.

Once you go around the table once, then give everyone 3 more cards to fill up their hand. Players can look at the cards in their hand, but shouldn’t show them to their teammates or other players. [5] X Research source Alternatively, you can deal out 3 cards to each player the first time around and 2 cards the second time. Either way works as long as everyone gets a total of 5 cards."

Starting with the person to the left of the dealer, players one at a time decide if they want the revealed suit as trump. Accept the trump if the majority of the cards in your hand match the same suit. Since the trump suit is the most powerful for the round, that means you’re more likely to win. When any player accepts the trump suit, the dealer adds the revealed card to their hand and then discards a card face-down. [7] X Research source If a player doesn’t want the suit as trump, they can pass it to the next person to decide instead. If a player accepts the trump suit, an opponent says, “I order it up,” the dealer’s partner says “I assist,” or the dealer says “I take it up.” If you’re the dealer, discard a low-valued card from your hand, like a 9 or 10, since it won’t be as powerful for winning."

The first person who chooses a trump suit sets it for the rest of the round. [8] X Research source If all players still pass without picking a trump suit, collect all of the cards and shuffle them again. The person to the left of the dealer becomes the new dealer.

When a player declares they want to go alone, their partner sets their hand face-down and sits out for the rest of the round.

Once a trump suit is picked, the jack of the trump suit becomes the strongest card in the suit and is called the “left bower.” The jack of the suit with the same color (hearts/diamonds or spades/clubs) becomes the second-highest trump card, known as the “right bower.” The other cards in trump rank normally. [10] X Research source Example: If the trump suit is diamonds, then the trump suit ranks from highest to lowest are jack (diamonds), jack (hearts), ace (diamonds), king (diamonds), queen (diamonds), 10 (diamonds), and 9 (diamonds)."

[12] X Research source If you want to win the trick, play a card higher in value than any other cards that have been played. If your teammate already played a high-ranking card in trump or the lead suit, then you can play lower-valued cards since your team is already set to win. If you don’t have any cards matching the lead suit or in the trump suit, try to get rid of a low-valued card.

If any trump cards are showing, then the highest-ranking trump is the winner. Otherwise, the highest card in the lead suit wins. The person with the highest card takes all of the played cards and sets them face-down in a pile in front of them. [13] X Research source Example: Trump is clubs. The lead card is an ace (spades). Players follow with queen (spades), king (spades), and queen (hearts). The ace of spades is the highest rank of the lead suit and wins the trick. Example: Trump is hearts. The lead card is king (hearts). Players follow with jack (diamonds), 9 (hearts), and 10 (clubs). Since the jack of diamonds is the right bower, it ranks higher than the king and wins the round."
