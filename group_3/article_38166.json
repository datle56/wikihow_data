Tanti means \"many\" and auguri is the plural form of the noun augurio , meaning \"wish.\" The entire phrase literally translates into \"many wishes.\" Pronounce this expression as: tahn-tee ahw-goo-ree"

      "content": "Ask about the person's age with \"quanti anni hai?\" This is an indirect way of asking someone how old he or she is, but the question doesn't translate directly into “how old are you?” Instead, it uses gentler phrasing, asking the birthday boy or girl, “how many years do you have?” Quanti means \"how many,\" anni means \"years,\" and hai means \"have\" in the second person singular form. Pronounce this question as: kwahn-tee ahn-nee ai"

      "title": "Describe an advanced age with \"essere avanti con gli anni.\"",
      "content": "Describe an advanced age with \"essere avanti con gli anni.\" This phrase essentially means that someone is \"getting on in years,\" and you would use it in a complimentary way to imply that someone is growing in both age and wisdom. Essere means \"to be,\" avanti means \"forward,\" con means \"with,\" gli means \"the,\" and anni means \"years.\" When strung together, the expression says, \"to be going forward with the years,\" or less directly, \"to be advancing in years.\" Pronounce this expression as: ehs-ser-eh ah-vahn-tee kohn ghlee ahn-nee"

      "title": "Declare your own age using the \"sto per compiere ___ anni\" form.",
      "content": "Declare your own age using the \"sto per compiere ___ anni\" form. You would generally use this phrasing to say that you're about to turn into a certain age (filling the blank), but it's more common among young people than older generations. More directly, it states, \"I am to fulfill (number) years.\" To state your age, simply fill in the blank with your new age. For instance, if you're turning eighteen, you'd say \"Sto per compiere diciotto anni.\" Sto means \"I am,\" per means \"to,\" compiere means \"fulfill\" or \"complete,\" and anni means \"years.\" Pronounce this expression as: stoh pehr kohm-pier-eh ___ ahn-nee"
