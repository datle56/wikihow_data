      "title": "Grab a small reflective surface.",
      "content": "Grab a small reflective surface. The idea is to use the reflection to peer through the bottom of the door. Any reflective surface will do, so long as the reflective surface is clear enough to make out what is happening on the other side of the door. There are a variety of options, including music CDs or small pocket mirrors. If you use a CD, choose one that you aren’t particularly concerned about. It's easy to scratch the object you are using during this procedure."

      "title": "Kneel down next to the door you wish to see under.",
      "content": "Kneel down next to the door you wish to see under. Take care not to make too much noise or move too suddenly when kneeling. Any loud noises or sudden movements may make your presence noticeable to those on the other side of the door."

      "title": "Place the reflective surface flat on the ground, next to the door gap.",
      "content": "Place the reflective surface flat on the ground, next to the door gap. Face the shiny portion up, making sure not to place it halfway through the door's length. If you do so, the item may become noticed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look at the edge of the reflective surface closest to the door.",
      "content": "Look at the edge of the reflective surface closest to the door. Tilt the CD and angle your view as needed to see inside the other room. While you will not be able to see everything, you will be able to see a vast majority of anything on the ground, or close to the ground and far away from the door. Make sure there is plenty of lighting on the other side of the door. It helps if your side of the door is not very bright."

      "title": "Turn on your cell phone camera.",
      "content": "Turn on your cell phone camera. The camera feature of your phone allows you to look at images captured by the viewfinder on your screen. Both the photo and video mode are acceptable for this purpose, with one able to take pictures of your subject, and the other able to take videos. Turn off your flash feature on your phone camera, especially if you plan on taking photos. The bright flash of the camera is a dead giveaway of your activities. Silence your phone completely, including vibrations. Vibrations rattling against the floor, as well as typical phone sounds, will give away your location. Try turning on airplane mode. Both Android [1] X Research source and iOS [2] X Research source phones have this feature."

      "title": "Aim your phone lens under the door gap.",
      "content": "Aim your phone lens under the door gap. Point the lens such that you have a clear view directly underneath the door. The most common way to achieve this is by placing the phone upside down on its head, or laying it on its side."

    {
      "title": "Peer into the room using the phone screen.",
      "content": "Peer into the room using the phone screen. The phone screen should give you a right-side-up view of the room no matter what position the phone is in. Your phone also offers exposure options, making seeing into a darker or overly bright room easier. [3] X Research source Most phones also come with zoom features. Pinch or expand the screen to zoom in and out on any crucial details. Keep in mind your cell phone screen won’t be able to angle itself for expansive views. Floor level is the extent of your coverage."

    {
      "title": "Take pictures or video.",
      "content": "Take pictures or video. Use your phone controls to take pictures or video of the events under the door. One advantage of taking video is that you will also be able to record audio of any conversations taking place on the other side of the door. Remember: recording an individual without their consent is illegal. [4] X Research source Phone cameras for both Android [5] X Research source and iOS [6] X Research source also have additional options such as slow-motion and panorama, if you have specific needs when viewing under the door."

      "title": "Purchase a telescoping camera.",
      "content": "Purchase a telescoping camera. The most expensive option for viewing under a door, telescoping or “snake” cameras can be purchased. They come in a few varieties, with some being reserved for more professional uses. The cheapest among the telescoping cameras are the camera kits that plug directly into your cell phone. These can be purchased online and at some retail stores such as Walmart."

      "title": "Install the camera application.",
      "content": "Install the camera application. The exact nature of these applications will vary from product to product. Make sure you read the specifications of the camera and its application to make sure your cell phone is compatible. Some are specially made to work with certain operating systems, while others will only work with certain models of cameras. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Snake the camera under the door and turn it on.",
      "content": "Snake the camera under the door and turn it on. Most snake cameras are made from a material that allows the camera to be angled in various directions. Maneuver the camera as desired and begin shooting. If the camera wire is too flimsy to navigate effectively, try connecting it to a coat hanger or other pliable wire, and snake it under the door. [8] X Research source Such cameras shoot in a small area, or use a macro lens. You’ll be able to see much of the room, but the image will be distorted or somewhat blurry compared to a normal camera."
