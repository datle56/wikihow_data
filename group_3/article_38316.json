      "title": "This Japanese legend is known as Kuchisake-onna or the Slit-Mouthed Woman.",
      "content": "This Japanese legend is known as Kuchisake-onna or the Slit-Mouthed Woman. Originating in Japan during the Heian period (794 – 1185), the story tells of a very beautiful woman who was married to a samurai. Although she was admired for her beauty, she was also vain and ended up having an affair. Enraged by her betrayal, her samurai husband slit her mouth from ear to ear before asking her, “Who will think you’re pretty now?” [1] X Research source Following this story, people in Japan then began to spread warnings of a woman wearing a surgical mask approaching people (particularly children) at night and asking them if she was pretty. If they said no, she would cut their faces in a similar way to her own. If they said yes, she would reveal her face and ask again. If they said no this time, she would cut their faces. If they said yes, she’d still follow them home and kill them. According to Japanese lore, the only way to escape her would be to confuse her with an answer like “you’re okay” or “you’re so-so,” rather than a definite “yes” or “no.”"

      "content": "Area 51 is a famous U.S. Air Force base connected to extraterrestrial activity. The infamous mystery around Area 51 makes it arguably one of the most famous urban legends in America—but what is it? The idea is that Area 51—a U.S. Air Force base in the state of Nevada—is used to store alien spacecraft and study their technologies. It’s believed that a UFO landed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947 and that the spacecraft and the bodies of the alien pilots are housed in Area 51. [2] X Research source Some people have reported UFO sightings above and around the Air Force base. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Geographic Website of the National Geographic Society Go to source The U.S. government claims that the crashed craft was actually a weather balloon, although the Air Force has admitted that the wreckage from the Roswell crash was part of a secret spy project involving advanced aircraft from other countries. Despite the government’s protestations against the Area 51 legend, the story itself is fueled by the base’s public inaccessibility and the general secrecy around what goes on inside.

The first mention of the bandage man appeared in the 1950s when he was described as the mummy of a logger that was hacked to death in a sawmill accident. He’s said to be wrapped completely in bloody bandages with a smell of rotting flesh. According to legend, he haunts a stretch of Highway 101 near the notable beach town of Cannon Beach, Oregon. [5] X Research source Some stories of the Bandage Man involve him targeting teens in parked cars or moving vehicles with open tops (like convertibles and pickup trucks). Apparently, he jumps into the vehicle and mysteriously disappears before arriving in town, leaving behind no trace except for his rotting stench. He’s also been said to feed on dogs, small animals, and (rarely) an unfortunate individual."

In the ritualistic game, players are instructed to turn off the lights in a bathroom, fill the tub with water, and sit on the edge. They should then close their eyes and wash their hair while chanting, “Daruma-san fell down, Daruma-san fell down.” [6] X Research source According to legend, players should begin to see a ghostly figure falling and dying in the bathtub. They’re advised to avoid making eye contact at the risk of incurring her wrath."

The urban legend of Bigfoot (also known as Sasquatch) tells of a hairy biped animal that stands 6–15 ft (2–4.5 m) tall and leaves behind footprints that are up to 24 in (60 cm) in length. [7] X Research source Some witnesses have said that he moves silently, while others claim that he smells foul and makes high-pitched cries. [8] X Research source All sightings of Bigfoot have been reported in North America, and he’s most strongly associated with the forested areas of Pacific Northwest states like Oregon and Washington. These reports started as early as the late 1800s. Some individuals have claimed to have photographic evidence of Bigfoot, but all of these specimens are either blurry or have been proven fake.

      "title": "Bloody Mary is one of the most infamous urban legends with a storied history.",
      "content": "Bloody Mary is one of the most infamous urban legends with a storied history. The most well-known aspect of this legend is the Bloody Mary game , where someone says her name repeatedly in the mirror in a dark room. After three recitations, it’s said that the ghost of Bloody Mary will appear. According to different tellings, Mary may appear as a benevolent ghostly woman holding a dead baby, or she may be a malevolent spirit who tries to scratch or kill her summoner, turn them insane, or pull them into the mirror. [10] X Research source Some believe the story derives from the life of Countess Elizabeth Báthory de Ecsed, a Hungarian noblewoman accused of torturing and killing hundreds of young women during the 16th and 17th centuries. [11] X Trustworthy Source National Geographic Website of the National Geographic Society Go to source Others point to Queen Mary I of England as a potential source, as she was nicknamed “Bloody Mary” due to the hundreds of Protestant followers whom she burned at the stake. [12] X Research source However, one of the prevailing stories of Bloody Mary describes her as a young girl named Mary who lived during the 1800s. An illness swept through her town, causing people to drop dead soon after contracting the sickness. [13] X Research source There were many cases of people being pronounced dead mistakenly. So, townspeople would drill a small hole in a coffin, put a piece of string through the hole, and tie either end of the string around the deceased’s finger, and a bell hung next to their home. The idea was that if the “dead” person woke up, they’d ring the bell and be dug up. According to the tale, this is exactly what happened to Mary. However, her parents moved away a few weeks after her burial. So when she awoke in the grave, she pulled and pulled the string until the bell fell—and no one heard her. She clawed and scratched away at the coffin until she drew her last breath. When her parents came back home, they realized what had happened, unlatched the coffin, and found her coffin covered in scratches and her hands covered in blood. They put a mirror under her nose to check for signs of breath, to no avail. For this reason, her spirit is said to be attached to mirrors."

      "content": "Chain letters were a spooky tech phenomenon popular in the early 21st century. If you were on the internet in the 2000s and early 2010s, you likely remember receiving chain emails that demanded that you copy and forward the letter to a certain number of recipients. The emails would also specify that, if you didn’t forward the email, a certain type of bad luck or misfortune would befall you. [14] X Research source Over time, you become a part of a “chain” as the email is rapidly copied and forwarded to dozens of people at a time, who then forward it to dozens more people. Some of the most popular chain letter stories include “The Cursed Necklace,” which tells of a necklace that brings bad luck to everyone who doesn’t pass it on, and “The Dead Child,” a story about a tragic accident said to happen to email recipients who don’t pass on the message."

The cryptid is typically depicted as a winged and horned goat-like creature with glowing eyes that attacks and kills livestock in order to feed on their blood.

In the 1970s and 80s, stories about an escaped mental patient who lived in the tunnels beneath the abandoned Willowbrook Mental Institution began to circulate in Staten Island. According to legend, this person with a mental health condition—known as Cropsey—would leave the tunnels at night with a bloody axe to abduct children off of the street.

Samuel Chew, according to the stories, was a normal man who served as the Chief Justice of Delaware in the 1700s. Due to the phonetics of his name, he was tormented relentlessly by the people in his community who would fake a sneeze or make chewing sounds whenever he passed by. [21] X Research source As soon as Samuel Chew passed away, he began to haunt the town he lived in—Dover, Delaware—and the people who had mocked him. Many townspeople reported sightings of Chew’s ghost. They described him as dressed in a judge’s robe with a white powdered wig. Allegedly, he would pull on the tail coats of men and send shivers up women’s spines. In the aftermath of the sightings, people in the town closed up their shops and houses, stayed indoors, and set curfews once the sun set. Eventually, the town decided that the only way to get rid of Chew’s ghost was to hold a funeral. The town of Dover then hosted a funeral for Chew’s spirit, burying an empty casket under the tree where he was most often reported to be seen. According to reports, this ritual mostly suppressed his ghostly apparition."

The micronation of Inunaki is said to be located within the tunnel of the Inunaki mountain pass in Fukuoka Prefecture. The town, whose name translates to “Howling Village,” rejects Japan’s constitution and lives without the oversight of the government or its laws.

[28] X Research source In other stories, there’s a phone booth outside the Inunaki tunnel that rings every night. If someone answers it, they’ll be taken to Inunaki and go insane before dying. The Inunaki tunnel (a real place) is no longer in use and is sealed with concrete blocks, although it has become a tourist hotspot since the release of the Japanese horror movie Howling Village (2019). Aside from the stories of the village, the tunnel itself is also thought to be haunted due to the many workers who died due to accidents and mishaps during its construction. A real murder also occurred there in 1988, and a dead body was found in the nearby dam in 2000."

Around this same time, a phenomenon known as the “New England Vampire Panic” swept through the northeastern United States, leading people in rural communities to believe that dead people could return as vampires, spread disease, and drain the life out of their living relatives. [40] X Research source After Mercy’s death, her brother became ill, and her family members believed that she must have become a vampire after death, making her the source of her living brother’s illness. Mercy’s family and neighbors exhumed her body, reportedly removing and burning her organs in an attempt to stop her “vampire” curse from spreading and killing more individuals in the community. This incident is largely considered to be one of the last known cases of “vampire hunting” in the U.S. While Mercy Brown’s story is based on a real person and event, the idea of her being a “vampire” is what constitutes this story as an urban legend."
