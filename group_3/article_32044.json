If possible, you'll want to disassemble items that will not fit through doorways or down a narrow staircase. You should also think about taking apart fragile items or highly valuable items, as they can be easier to move in pieces. A list of items you want to disassemble might include: [1] X Research source Beds Armoires or wall cabinets Tables Desks"

It is a good idea to take pictures of the disassembling process so that you can have a visual reminder of what things are supposed to look like. [2] X Research source Take multiple pictures to record each step of the process. You can reference the pictures when you put the piece back together again."

After you've completed your inventory, consider what you'll need to move each piece of furniture. For example, items like couches will generally be wrapped in blankets and tape. Something like a lamp might be wrapped in bubble wrap. You can purchase supplies at your local hardware store or online.

Unscrew the legs and place those and the cushions aside to move separately. Use a Flathead screwdriver and pliers to remove the staples that secure the covering to the bottom of the sofa. [4] X Research source Roll the upholstery far enough up that you can see the frame of the sofa and the fasteners that hold the arms to the base. Loosen the bolts or screws that secure the arms with an Allen wrench or a screwdriver. Roll up the upholstery far enough so that you can remove the arms. Look for the bolts that hold the seat and back of the sofa together. Remove the bolts and separate the pieces of the frame, just as you did with the arms. Take careful notes so that you remember how to reassemble the sofa. Only undo as much upholstery as is necessary. Follow these same steps to take apart an easy chair."

Lower it as far as it will go to make the base as small as possible for moving. [5] X Research source If you pull on the wheels, they should easily pop off. Store them in a separate bag for moving. All chairs are different. If yours is more complex, follow the instructions that came with the chair.

For larger tables, you will likely need to get underneath the table for a good vantage point. Each leg will be held in place with hardware called a leg assembly. Locate each leg assembly and use a screwdriver to loosen and remove the bolts from each leg assembly. Once the screws are out, remove the braces from the legs. You may also need to unscrew the legs from the table. Gently twist them to the left until they come loose easily. Pack the braces and screws separately in a clearly labeled bag."
