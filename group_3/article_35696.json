If you don't see this option, click the Summary tab in the middle of Handbrake. If the original video file is in a different format besides \"MP4\" (i.g. .MOV, or .WMV), simply converting it to an MP4 file may do a lot to reduce the file size without having to reduce the picture quality.

This will reduce the picture quality. You'll want to keep the picture size proportional to avoid cropping or stretching. Some common video sizes include the following: 2160p: 3840w x 2160h (extremely large, 4K ultra HD). 1440p: 2560w x 1440h (larger). 1080p: 1920w x 1080h (large, standard HD). 720p: 1280w x 720h (medium). 480p: 854w x 480h (small). 360p: 640w x 360h (smaller). 240p: 426w x 240h (smallest)."
