      "content": "Say hello. Whether it's your first time talking to him or the millionth, smile as you approach him and act friendly. [1] X Expert Source Nicole Moore Love & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 6 October 2021. Walk up and say hi, or toss a casual greeting his way as you pass him in the hall. [2] X Research source Keep it simple but not too simple. Say hi and ask how his day is going, but don't make it boring with the same old, “Hi! How are you?” Try something more engaging and personal like, “Hey! What's up, blue eyes?” Comment on his appearance. If he's wearing clothes or such for something you know, comment on that. Find something interesting or that you like. If you've never heard of what's on his clothes, backpack, etc, ask about it! It's a win-win either way! You might find another thing you like, but if you don't, you're still starting a conversation with him! Be sure to avoid cheesy pickup lines because your popular guy has probably already experienced a lot of that, and you want to stand out from the crowd! If you aren't ready to say hi yet, don't rush yourself. Wait until you feel comfortable enough to do it."

      "title": "Hang out with him and his friends.",
      "content": "Hang out with him and his friends. If possible, try to spend time with him in a group setting – preferably with mutual friends around. This will be a low-pressure situation for him to get to know you and see how fun and interesting you are. If you have mutual friends, ask them if you can tag along to activities and events you know he'll be at. Make friends with his friends so that they will say positive things about you to your popular guy."

      "content": "Get the conversation going. Whenever you have a chance to spend some time around your popular guy, try engaging him in a conversation. You'll hold his attention by asking him questions about things he's already familiar with, interested in, or enjoys doing. [4] X Research source Don't just ask him questions he can respond yes or no to. Try to talk about things that will prompt a more involved answer. Ask him about his favorite band and if he's ever seen them in concert. Ask him if he's thought about what he wants to do after graduation. Ask him to tell you about the family vacation he took this summer that you overheard him mentioning to someone else."

      "title": "Avoid boring topics.",
      "content": "Avoid boring topics. Your popular guy is probably the kind of person who has seen it all and done it all. If you want to grab his attention, you want to give him something new and interesting to think about. Think of something exciting that you've done and tell him the story. [5] X Research source Tell him about that time you traveled out of the country with your family, or how you swam across the lake at summer camp. Avoid talking about things that will bore him like his good looks or other things everyone knows he is good at (like sports)."

      "title": "Be friendly.",
      "content": "Be friendly. Being nice may make you less intimidating to your popular guy. At the very least, it will give him a favorable impression of you. Even if he isn't interested or available now, he will remember you for being nice later when he is available.

      "title": "Leave him wanting more.",
      "content": "Leave him wanting more. A great way to make your popular guy want you is to always leave him wanting more. You don't want him to get sick of you or to feel like you are too available. Don't overstay your welcome if you're hanging out together. Give him a chance to wish you had stayed longer. On occasion, cut conversations short and act like you have somewhere else you have to be. This makes you look busy, desirable, and not at all desperate."

      "title": "Be gentle, but persistent.",
      "content": "Be gentle, but persistent. Remember that after rejection, that it's not the end of the world. Don't go crying and begging for him to take you. The guy will probably get annoyed or embarrassed. Give him a space for a couple of weeks, then consider trying again. [9] X Research source Don't keep going after him forever. If he rejects you outright, consider moving on to find someone else who is more interested. You never know if another cute guy out there is attracted to you!"

It's okay to update your wardrobe, put more effort into your appearance, or even try some new activities to get his attention. But only do so if you are comfortable with these small changes and you feel like you're still being true to yourself. It's more likely that he will like you more if you are genuine. [12] X Research source Never do something you are uncomfortable with. For example, if you don't normally like to swear, you will probably look awkward doing it. Just talk how you normally do and be confident that you don't need to cuss for people to like you."

      "title": "Pay attention to your clothing choices.",
      "content": "Pay attention to your clothing choices. Love your body and flaunt it. Don't hide beneath baggy potato sacks. If you notice that your popular guy seems to find a girl attractive, take note of what she's wearing so that you can get an idea about what he likes. You can consider integrating some of these styles into your wardrobe, if you like them. At the same time, make sure to stay true to your own style instead of just turning into a clone [13] X Research source But don't forget to be yourself. Don't wear things for the sake of him; wear them for you. Wear clothing that brings out your best features.

You'll have more things to wear a great black bag with than a hot pink one."

This means washing your face every day, removing your makeup each night (if you wear any), and using beauty products that work for your skin.

      "content": "Avoid going overboard with the makeup. Makeup should be used to enhance your natural beauty, not to overshadow your features with artificial elements. It's not about wearing a lot or wearing trends, it's about wearing what makes you look and feel better. [17] X Research source You should never wear too much makeup and always wear colors that complement your skin tone and eye color. Mascara is almost always a safe bet, as long as you know how to apply it properly. If not, ask a friend who does. If you're clueless about makeup, ask your parents to take you to a makeup counter for a consultation. Take notes. If you can't afford to buy all the makeup there, get the foundations and look for the colors elsewhere. Or buy a little at a time."
