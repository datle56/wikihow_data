If someone who is coming needs routine medication, make sure they have it. If they wear glasses or contacts, make sure they have a case, saline (contacts only), and/or a spare pair of glasses.

Also, remember to pack lots of water. Try sticking with dehydrated foods that can easily be prepared with boiling water. This way, you can make a “home-cooked” meal over the campfire."
