      "content": "Many people think big ears are attractive, but it depends on who you ask. If you’ve ever heard the expression, “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,” then you already know the answer to this question. In some Western cultures, large ears may be considered physically unattractive to some, the same way a larger nose or forehead might be. However, when you take a look at other parts of the world, particularly Asia, big ears are perceived to be signs of good luck, prosperity, and intelligence. [1] X Research source In physiognomy, or the art of studying faces to determine personality traits, large, prominent ears are associated with high energy, enthusiasm, and a sound mind. Siddhartha Buddha is said to have been born into a wealthy family, with huge ears that continued growing as he did, fortifying the link between prosperity and big ears. He was even said to have worn big heavy golden earrings that made his ears appear even longer. In China, big ears and thick noses are considered especially auspicious. It’s often viewed as a sign that the person had a happy childhood, successful adulthood, and is financially well-off. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "People with big ears are resilient, level-headed, and independent. Some personality tests based on facial features can reveal what your ear shape says about you. Some ears are pointy, others are small and shell-shaped, others have detached ear lobes— but if you have bigger ears, here are a few qualities you are presumed to have. [3] X Research source Level-headed. People with big ears are often perceived to be cool as cucumbers, even in stressful situations. Gentle, thoughtful, and tactful, these larger-eared people are optimistic and fully enjoy life without taking themselves too seriously. Independent. People with big ears can be viewed as authoritative, taking charge and not letting anyone order them around. Natural-born bosses, large-eared people tend to inspire others, leading the way in many avenues of life. Resilient. Laidback and easygoing, people with big ears don’t allow their feathers to be ruffled. They understand that grief is necessary to experience joy, and tackle hardships head-on. Social and compassionate, big-eared folk will always bounce back as they are often pillars of their communities. Good listeners.

      "content": "Ear size Large ears are viewed to be the most fortuitous and sought-after ear size. They are associated with prosperity, an abundant life-force, and social charms. Big-eared folk typically have tons of friends and a wide, exciting social circle. [4] X Research source When it comes to ears from a physiognomical point of view, bigger really is better. People with smaller ears can be perceived as having less energy, luck, and career success. Smaller-eared people may thus be forced to work harder in order to bridge the gap between them and their luckier, larger-eared counterparts."

      "content": "Ear thickness Thickness is just as important as size when it comes to ears. Thick and fleshy earlobes are also good indicators of prosperity, kindness, and a long life. Thick-eared people are perceived by others as empathetic, forgiving, and open-minded, leading them to have strong ties in the community. In physiognomy, chunky earlobes are a near guarantee that somebody will be there to help should you need it. Slimmer ears may belong to people less fortunate, who are more likely to face trials and tribulations in their daily lives. Thin-eared people may also be seen as selfish, insecure, or indecisive."

      "content": "Ear shape Just like size and thickness, shape plays an important factor in categorizing ears. As it turns out, ears can reveal much more than meets the eye. Here are some of the most common ear shapes and what they might mean. Droopy earlobes. Just like Buddha, people with long earlobes are believed to be lucky and tend to lead long, prosperous lives, garnering the help and attention of important people. Ears that stick out. If you can see someone’s ears while looking at them head-on, that might mean that they’re intelligent, creative, and business-minded. Ears with defined lobes. These ear-types tend to indicate that the person attached has a high emotional and practical intelligence, which is considered a blessing."

      "content": "Grow your hair long. Growing out your hair to help dissimulate bigger ears can be an option for anyone. You can choose to grow out your fade to a beach-tousled surfer length just beyond the ears, or you can grow it below your shoulders so that you always have a curtain of hair handy. No matter what, hair is your friend in this scenario, so don’t be afraid to ask it for help! Getting layers around the ears could best hide their large appearance. Consider asking your hairstylist for face-framing pieces to really highlight your other features."

When styling your hair to disguise larger ears, makeup artists and hair stylist, Hannah Metz, advises that you keep the attention on the face. She says, “I recommend styling the hair towards the face as well as adding some curls that are curled away from the face to add volume.” She recommends the hair stay down, in front of the face, and not tucked away behind the ears. Metz also suggests, “Ensure not to tuck the hair behind the ears, and to keep the face framing layers in front of the ears to help diminish the appearance while bringing more attention to the face.”"

Investing in a variety of hats might not be a bad idea, as you’ll get to have one on hand for every occasion. When you’re feeling cool and casual, a baseball cap can do the trick. If you’re on vacation, a large-brimmed sun hat could be the right move. [5] X Research source Beanies are perfect for the colder winter months, and will keep keep your ears warm and pinned close to your head. Choosing a hat that compliments the proportions of the face is most important. Medium-brim or wide-brim hats allow the hat to be the focal point— not the ears."

      "content": "Ear-shape and size is genetic. Just like every other physical feature, the way our ears look is determined by our parents. The main gene that determines our ear-shape is called an allele and we get two: one from mom and one from dad. Some people may have free earlobes, detached earlobes, or higher-set ears, but no matter what, your ancestor's ears will definitely play a part. [6] X Research source Certain genetic conditions, like Downs Syndrome or Turner's Syndrome, can have a dramatic effect on ears and the way people look overall. Protruding ears may be considered \"big ears\" and are actually a result of an underdeveloped anti-helical fold. If this fold does not form correctly, it causes the outer rim of the ear, or the helix, to extend out. There are surgical and non-surgical options to fix this. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Your ears will likely look bigger as you age. A 1993 study measured ear growth among over 200 people aged 30+. They ultimately found that the human ear can grow about a centimeter over the course of 50 years. Studies conducted in later years also discovered that men's ears tend to grow larger than women's, but growth occurred in both genders regardless. [8] X Research source Other factors can contribute to the increased size of the ear, like loss of elasticity due to aging, frequently wearing heavy earrings, and gravity. Ears are made up of cartilage, and some evidence suggests that cartilage continues to grow while bone does not. People with large ears can't necessarily hear any better than their smaller-eared counterparts, and ear growth does not affect hearing in any way."
