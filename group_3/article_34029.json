      "content": "Ask the tough questions. [1] X Research source It can be difficult when you are going through a rough patch, or are in a big fight, to not feel like your relationship is doomed. Before you go about separating yourself from the relationship, make sure you aren't jumping to inaccurate conclusions. Evaluate where your relationship really stands and where you think it is going. Figure out where you are emotionally and maybe where your partner is, before you start mentally detaching from the relationship. Once you begin to distance yourself it can be hard to come back. Ask yourself about the quality of your relationship. Are there more good times than bad times? Are you exhausted or unhappy because of the constant ups and downs?"

      "title": "Determine what has been done to work on the relationship.",
      "content": "Determine what has been done to work on the relationship. Consider what you have done to try and address whatever problems you have had. Be honest about who, if anyone, is committed to making the relationship successful. If the answer isn't both partners, then the relationship is likely not going to be saved. Have you talked about it with each other? How many times have you both tried to change things? Have you tried counseling?"

      "content": "Enjoy it while you can. If you have determined that your relationship is past the point of saving, then begin to accept that it will end. Instead of waiting for it to end, spend time focusing on the good things in the moment and the good things about your relationship. Use this time to discover what good memories you have, what you can learn, or what you can take away from this experience."

      "title": "Change the way you think about being single.",
      "content": "Change the way you think about being single. Begin working on emotionally and mentally preparing yourself for a shift in relationship status. Instead of the \"forever alone\" mentality that sometimes comes along with a break up, think of it as a much-needed rest from the rigors of the relationship you've been fighting for. [2] X Research source Try and change the word \"single\" in your mind into \"free\" and changing negative thinking into more positive thinking. [3] X Research source Think about the bad parts of the relationship, and how it would feel to live free of those.

      "content": "Be kind to yourself. You may feel down or sad about the ending of your relationship, and that's okay. Allow yourself to grieve the end of your time with your partner. Be kind to yourself and remind yourself that you were just not a good fit for each other. Don't let the impending break up cause you to become sorry for yourself or depressed about your life. Love yourself the way you want to be loved, and treat yourself the way you deserve to be treated. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Reframe the way you perceive \"alone\" and \"loneliness.\" In many societies there seems to be a higher value set to being in a relationship or being married than being on your own. Due to that, and the pressure that comes along with it, people can get into relationships that are not healthy for them, or stay in relationships that don't make them happy. Have high standards, and keep them high. [5] X Research source You are worth it! Ask yourself, \"Didn't I feel lonely in this relationship anyway?\" Remind yourself that being single or free from this relationship does not mean you are alone. You still have people in your life that are there for the long haul and truly care about your happiness."

[6] X Research source Being able to clearly visualize future changes will help give you something to work towards fulfilling while you work through the impending break up. What would you like to do? Is there a place you have been wanting to visit or see? What would you eat? Is there a restaurant or a type of food you liked but did have because he didn't like it? Who would you like to be with? Are there friends you have lost contact with? A dream relationship you have in your mind?"

There's no need to drag something out that you are not interested in working on or isn't meant to be any longer. Instead of waiting around, unhappy, for your partner to open up the topic, take control of the situation. Speak to your partner face to face. Don't end the relationship over the phone or over text message. Talk about the relationship and how it has affected you. Try to avoid blame or judgment.

[18] X Research source You have been unhappy in your relationship, so it is easy to see how tempting it may be to seek out the affections of another person. Avoid looking for that type of comfort before your current relationship has been declared over. Even if your relationship is ending from a cheating partner, don't stoop to their level. Additionally after the break up give yourself some time to recover before looking for the stability of a new relationship. Be open-minded, meet new people, or check out a new scene, but honor yourself by not running to the next available relationship."
