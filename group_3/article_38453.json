      "title": "Clean your griddle with dish soap and water if it’s brand new.",
      "content": "Clean your griddle with dish soap and water if it’s brand new. Fill a bowl or bucket with warm water and add a bit of mild dish soap. Dip a clean cloth or paper towel into the mixture and scrub the griddle’s surface to get rid of any factory residue and oil used to prevent rust during shipping. Rinse it with another cloth dipped in fresh, clean water, then dry it thoroughly with a clean, dry cloth or paper towel. [1] X Research source If you’re seasoning an old griddle, skip this step—applying soap to a used griddle can actually damage the plate coating. Make sure the griddle is completely dry before you begin seasoning it."

      "title": "Preheat your Blackstone on high until it starts to brown.",
      "content": "Preheat your Blackstone on high until it starts to brown. Turn your burners to maximum heat and allow the griddle to start heating up. After 10-15 minutes, the surface should start to brown, which is the first step to making it stick-resistant. Once the color changes, turn the burners off. [2] X Research source If necessary, first turn on your propane tank by rotating the valve counterclockwise. Put on heat-resistant gloves for safety. For Blackstone griddles with specific temperature settings, turn the knob to 350 °F (177 °C)."

      "title": "Spread 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 44 mL) of oil over the griddle surface.",
      "content": "Spread 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 44 mL) of oil over the griddle surface. Adding oil creates a natural non-stick surface and adds some flavor to your food. Choose an oil that’s rich in fatty acids (like vegetable shortenings, vegetable oil, flaxseed oil, etc.) and apply a thin layer to the griddle. Spread it evenly across the surface using a paper towel. Use a pair of tongs or heat-resistant gloves so you don’t burn yourself, and be careful not to leave any dry spots or thick oil puddles. [3] X Research source Crouch down and examine the layer of oil from the side to see if it’s even. Blackstone recommends using their Blackstone Griddle Seasoning & Cast Iron Conditioner to season your griddle. Marrow Private Chefs recommend “avocado or flaxseed” oil. Be sure to apply oil to the edges, sides, and corners of your griddle, as well, including the sides facing outward from the griddle, if possible. The exact amount of oil you need will depend on the size of your Blackstone griddle."

      "title": "Turn the griddle back on and heat the oil until it smokes.",
      "content": "Turn the griddle back on and heat the oil until it smokes. Turn your Blackstone back to its maximum temperature and allow the oil to cook. The top plate will slowly turn black and the oil will start smoking. It typically takes 15-30 minutes to reach the smoke point. Once it does, wait until all of the smoke disappears before continuing to the next step. [4] X Research source The smoke point is the temperature at which an oil will start to burn."

    {
      "title": "Add more oil and repeat until the surface is black.",
      "content": "Add more oil and repeat until the surface is black. One layer of oil likely won’t be enough to properly season your Blackstone griddle. Once all the oil burns off and the smoke dissipates, add another layer the same way you did the first time. Let it burn off, then apply another layer and do the same thing. It typically takes 3-5 applications of oil to properly season a Blackstone. The griddle will be done when the entire surface is dark brown. [5] X Research source Some Blackstone owners recommend turning your griddle off and letting it cool for 10 minutes between each application. Blackstone, however, suggests leaving your griddle on throughout the whole process. Mix up your oils to create different flavor combinations. For example, use vegetable oil for the first two rounds and top it off with coconut oil for the third round."

      "content": "Wipe the griddle surface with cooking oil to finish it off. The final touch is a quick wipe down with your oil of choice to prevent oxidation, also known as rust. Before placing it into storage, pour some oil onto 2 to 3 paper towels and lightly wet the top of the grill. [6] X Research source Be sure to wait until the grill has cooled before wetting it lightly."

      "title": "Choose a high-heat oil rich in fatty acids.",
      "content": "Choose a high-heat oil rich in fatty acids. Marrow Private Chefs recommend “high smoke point oils,” as they won’t burn and create a strong seasoning layer. Oils that are high in fatty acids also bond well with the griddle plate. Here are some oils that are often recommended for seasoning Blackstone griddles: [7] X Research source Vegetable shortening Vegetable oil Flaxseed oil Canola oil Avocado oil Grapeseed oil Lard Blackstone also recommends using coconut oil , as it can withstand high temperatures. [8] X Research source Some people, however, believe it gives their food a strong flavor. Keep this in mind if you decide to use it to season your griddle."

      "title": "Avoid olive oil, extra virgin olive oil, and butter.",
      "content": "Avoid olive oil, extra virgin olive oil, and butter. While olive oil can technically work to season a Blackstone griddle, many users have reported problems with their griddles becoming sticky after using it. It also has a low smoke point and requires more layers for proper seasoning. [9] X Research source Butter also isn’t a good idea, as it has a low smoke point and will likely burn at high temperatures. [10] X Research source Here are some other oils it’s best to avoid: Sesame oil Non-stick aerosol sprays Flavored oils Bacon grease Avoid products with trans fatty acids, which have been connected to health problems like coronary artery disease, weight gain, and liver dysfunction."

      "title": "Seasoning creates a non-stick surface.",
      "content": "Seasoning creates a non-stick surface. Even when new, the surface of a griddle contains tiny cracks, crevices, and bumps that food can get stuck in. Seasoning your Blackstone griddle allows the oil to seep into and fill those crevices. This way, when you cook, the food will sit on top of the surface but will not be able to penetrate the layers of oil. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "It helps prevent rusting.",
      "content": "It helps prevent rusting. When a griddle is seasoned properly, its surface will repel water, which in turn can help protect the surface from rust and oxidation. The layers of oil keep the water from penetrating the griddle’s metal surface, so the more it’s seasoned, the more protected it will be. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "It typically takes about an hour to season a Blackstone griddle.",
      "content": "It typically takes about an hour to season a Blackstone griddle. It typically takes a Blackstone griddle 10-15 minutes to heat up initially, and it often takes the oil 15-30 minutes to reach its smoke point, depending on the type you use. Since you’ll likely have to apply the oil 3-5 times, expect to spend about an hour seasoning your griddle. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Re-season your griddle if food starts to stick.",
      "content": "Re-season your griddle if food starts to stick. According to Blackstone, just cooking on your griddle will add to the seasoning, so it shouldn’t need to be officially re-seasoned often. However, if your food starts to stick or the surface appears discolored or rusty, it may be time to season it again. [14] X Research source If you’re not sure if it’s time to re-season your Blackstone, sprinkle a few drops of water onto its heated surface. If the water beads up, the seasoning is intact. If it sizzles and evaporates, it’s time to re-season."

      "title": "Clean your griddle after each use with a paper towel and hot water.",
      "content": "Clean your griddle after each use with a paper towel and hot water. Once you start using your griddle, each use will add to your layer of seasoning, so never clean it with soap. Instead, use a spatula to gently scrape any food from the top. Afterward, clean the surface with a dry paper towel. For tougher spots of food residue, fill up a 2 litre (0.53 US gal) bucket with boiling water. Pour it over the tough spot and leave the water to eat away at the residue for about 5 minutes. Wipe the spot with paper towel afterward. [15] X Research source Pour ¼ cup (32 grams) of salt over tough areas to help the cleaning process. Marrow Private Chefs suggest using a “chemical grill cleaner or charcoal brick if [the griddle] is really dirty. Rinse with hot water, polish with a little lemon juice, and then season with oil again.”"

      "title": "Coat your griddle with a thin coat of oil after cleaning to maintain seasoning.",
      "content": "Coat your griddle with a thin coat of oil after cleaning to maintain seasoning. A thin coat helps maintain the seasoning bond and also prevents rust build-up. Any kind of cooking oil will work, including non-stick cooking spray. Always coat your griddle after removing food buildup and rust. [16] X Research source Over time, your griddle top should become blacker and more resistant to sticking. If it doesn’t, you're not maintaining it properly."

      "title": "Store your griddle in a dry, cool place with a cover.",
      "content": "Store your griddle in a dry, cool place with a cover. Place a heavy-duty cover over your griddle to further prevent rusting and weather damage. Avoid storing it in humid, hot areas—this can alter your seasoning. If you're willing to make the investment, store your griddle in a carry bag , especially if you're leaving it outdoors. [17] X Research source Leave the zipper of your carry bag open 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm) to prevent rusting."

      "content": "Remove rust with steel wool or 40- to 60-grit sandpaper. When you spot rust, remove it right away before it gets worse. Using either steel wool or low-grit sandpaper , scrub the rusted spot thoroughly until the corrosion spots smooth over. Be sure to apply a firm amount of pressure toward the rust spots as you scrub them. [18] X Research source Purchase steel wool and sandpaper from home hardware stores and kitchen supply stores, respectively. Another option is to mix salt, soap powder, and water to scrub off the rust or use a Blackstone griddle cleaning kit ."

      "content": "Do Blackstone griddles come pre-seasoned? No, Blackstone griddles do not come pre-seasoned. In some cases, griddles may be coated with oil to protect them from rust during shipping, but this oil needs to be washed away before you use the griddle, as it’s factory-finished and not food-safe.

      "content": "What should I cook first on my Blackstone griddle? While you can cook whatever you want after seasoning your griddle, it’s often recommended to cook bacon or onions first. Onions contain sulfur, which helps the oil stick to the griddle, resulting in a smoother, non-stick surface. [21] X Research source The fat in bacon also helps season the griddle, though it also contains salt and sugars that may stick to the surface if it isn’t seasoned properly."

      "title": "Why didn’t the outer edges of my griddle blacken?",
      "content": "Why didn’t the outer edges of my griddle blacken? If the edges and sides of your Blackstone are still lighter in color after seasoning, you didn’t do anything wrong. The surface should still be well-seasoned, and the color will continue to darken as you cook. It isn’t necessary for the entire surface to be black after seasoning; as long as it’s non-stick, you’re good to go. [22] X Research source"

      "content": "What do I do if my Blackstone starts to rust? Put on some heat-resistant gloves and turn your griddle on high heat for 20 minutes to loosen the rust. Turn the griddle off and let it cool down, then scrape the rust off with a metal scraper until all visible corrosion is gone. Add 3-4 tbsp (44-59 ml) of oil and scrub the whole surface with a grill stone or steel wool. Wipe the griddle clean, then add more oil, and repeat until all signs of rust are gone. Season the griddle again to restore its protective coating. [23] X Research source"
