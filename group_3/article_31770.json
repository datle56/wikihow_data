      "title": "Loosen the rafter knobs on both awning support arms.",
      "content": "Loosen the rafter knobs on both awning support arms. There should be a black knob on the back of each awning arm. Loosen these so that the awning arms will be able to move, being careful not to unscrew them all the way. [1] X Research source When you’re traveling, these knobs should be tightened well so that they don’t become loose and fall off."

    {
      "title": "Release the travel locks on both support arms.",
      "content": "Release the travel locks on both support arms. To release the travel locks, squeeze the support tabs on the awning. These tabs are what hold the two arms together. When you squeeze them, you should hear a click telling you that they’ve been properly released. [2] X Research source Some models require you to swing the release tabs up to undo them."

      "title": "Switch the ratchet mechanism to the roll-down position.",
      "content": "Switch the ratchet mechanism to the roll-down position. The ratchet mechanism is essentially a directional lever located on the end of the awning closest to the front of the RV. Using your awning rod, switch the lever to the open position. All RVs that come with an awning will come with an awning rod as well. The ratchet mechanism should be labeled with both “open” and “close” for when you go to switch the lever. Some RVs have a slide mechanism on the awning arm that releases the ratchet by itself."

      "title": "Roll out the awning using the awning rod.",
      "content": "Roll out the awning using the awning rod. Hook the black pull strap on the awning with your awning rod. Use the rod to pull the strap straight out, opening the awning. You can use your hands to pull the strap the rest of the way until the awning is fully extended. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Slide the rafters up the awning arms and lock them.",
      "content": "Slide the rafters up the awning arms and lock them. The rafters, or the inner arms, should be pushed to the top of the opposing arms. Once the inner arms slide all the way into position, you should hear a click that will lock them. If the rafter knobs are loose enough, the arms should slide easily. [4] X Research source To keep the rafters lubricated, you can spray them with WD-40."

    {
      "title": "Tighten the rafter knobs on each rafter.",
      "content": "Tighten the rafter knobs on each rafter. The black knobs that you loosened earlier should now be tightened. Press down on the awning arms to make the fabric taut, and then tighten the rafter knobs to keep the rafters locked in place. Make sure to tighten both sides of the awning. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Raise the awning using the handles on each arm.",
      "content": "Raise the awning using the handles on each arm. Lift the handle on the arm and raise the awning to the desired height. If you’re doing this by yourself, it’s best to raise the awning a little bit at a time on each side. If you have another person helping you, you can raise both sides at once. [6] X Research source Lifting the handle on the arm releases the lock, allowing you to raise the awning. Once you release the handle, the awning will lock. Make sure the awning is high enough to clear the door."
