Rub your hands together to create a lather with the soap making sure to coat the back of your hands, between your fingers, and underneath your fingernails. Continue scrubbing your hands for 20 seconds. This is about as long as it takes to sing the “Happy Birthday” song twice in a row from beginning to end. Rinse the soap off of your hands with clean water from the tap. Dry your hands with a clean cloth towel, paper towel, or you can air dry them. As an alternative to washing your hands, you can use a hand sanitizer that is at least 60% alcohol."

Fill a clean bowl with clean tap water and mild liquid soap. Warm or cold water is fine, although warm (not hot) water may feel more comforting. Soak a clean washcloth in the soapy water and wring it out to remove excess moisture. Gently wash the skin around and on top of the band-aid with the washcloth. Avoid putting direct pressure on top of the band-aid as you do this. Instead, give it a quick wipe with the cloth. Gently pat the area dry with a clean, dry washcloth."

The less you peel, the less it will hurt. [2] X Research source If the band-aid is in a hairy part of your body, ripping it off slowly may be more comfortable. It can help to get a fingernail up under the edge of the band-aid to tease the adhesive away from the skin."

      "content": "Lift it a little, tug at it a little more, then rest and repeat until the bandage comes off completely. This part can feel like it’s taking forever, but in order to reduce discomfort, you need to work slowly. Take breaks for as long as you need to in between tugs. This gives your pain reflex a chance to calm down. This process takes extra patience, but you are getting there, slowly but surely. How many times you repeat these steps depends on how big the band-aid is, and how much you are able to peel back each time. Take your time, breathe, and stay relaxed as you work the band-aid off. Remember, if you get bored, though, you can always switch to the quick rip method."

For the final bit, you may have to pull up more vigorously and finish with a quick jerk up and away from your skin. It will help if you have “follow-through” with your movement so you don’t get stuck at the very end. Keep this movement as steady and smooth as you can so you don’t prolong any discomfort. Alternatively, you can peel the band-aid off diagonally across the wound. Some people find they are better at controlling the band-aid with this method. The tingling feeling you have on your skin where the band-aid was should subside shortly."

This will take 1-2 minutes depending on how big your cotton ball is. Be sure to protect your clothing and other items around you from accidental drips. Alternatively, you can also use baby oil instead of olive oil. Another option is to use a mixture of lotion and baby oil applied with a cotton swab to achieve similar results If you don’t have either of these oils on hand, you can also soak the band-aid and surrounding area in a bowl of clean, warm water until the adhesive dissolves. This option may work better for fabric types of band-aids."

If the skin is really irritated, apply a chunk of ice or a cold compress to the area to help soothe the skin."
