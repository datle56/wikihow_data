      "content": "Place a piece of paper on a surface. Place a sheet of paper (letter size or A4 is best) on a surface that can be cleaned from oil. Oil may spill on this surface so make sure it cannot be damaged if it does spill. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Obtain manufacturer-approved oil.",
      "content": "Obtain manufacturer-approved oil. Purchase the oil recommended for your paper shredder by the manufacturer. [2] X Research source Different shredders will use different oils and will usually sell the oil where you purchased your shredder. If you are using an old and/or out of warranty paper shredder, you can use canola oil as a substitute rather than purchasing oil. The oil produced by some brands is actually just repackaged canola oil so you can save a little money by using canola oil."

      "title": "Apply the oil to the paper in a zigzag pattern.",
      "content": "Apply the oil to the paper in a zigzag pattern. Drizzle the oil over the paper in a zigzag pattern on one side of the paper. [3] X Research source Try not to saturate the paper or put too much oil or else it can get a little messy. Make sure the zigzags stretch all the way from side to side to ensure sufficient coverage."

      "title": "Turn the paper shredder on and shred the oil-covered paper.",
      "content": "Turn the paper shredder on and shred the oil-covered paper. Shred the oil-covered paper by running it through the machine. As the paper gets shredded the oil will coat the blades, which then redistribute the oil. This keeps the shredder operating smoothly. Ensure that paper is not creased and damaged or it may cause a malfunction in the machine."

      "content": "Add a few more papers into the shredder to absorb the excess oil. Pass a few more pieces of paper into the shredder so that they absorb the extra oil left on the blades."

      "content": "Set the shredder to manual mode. Setting the shredder to manual mode allows you to control the direction that the blades are rotating and the length of time that they are moving. You will need this for oiling the paper."

      "title": "Squirt a little oil along the paper entry line.",
      "content": "Squirt a little oil along the paper entry line. While the paper shredder is off, squirt a line of oil lengthwise across the paper entry. [4] X Research source This puts oil along the entire length of the blades."
