      "title": "Write down a chronology of events.",
      "content": "Write down a chronology of events. Start from the beginning, with your first contact with the perpetrator – even if that first contact was relatively benign. Write each event that occurred along with the date and time (if possible). [2] X Research source This chronology will help you organize your report as well as figure out what kind of evidence you might have or be able to access. For example, if you were chatting with the perpetrator through social media, you may be able to pull up the history of those exchanges."

      "title": "Keep electronic copies and files where possible.",
      "content": "Keep electronic copies and files where possible. The source code of web pages, emails, and other electronic files contains information that can help law enforcement identify and locate the people involved in the incident. If you merely print up a hard copy of something online, law enforcement won't have access to this information. [3] X Research source If the perpetrator has a web page through which they conduct their activities, save that webpage on your computer. It will be preserved in case the perpetrator deletes or alters the webpage to hide their activity."

    {
      "title": "Take screen shots of online evidence you can't save.",
      "content": "Take screen shots of online evidence you can't save. There are some places online, such as social media sites, that can't be saved the way a webpage or an email can. While a screen shot doesn't provide a lot of information that would be of use to law enforcement, it's better than nothing. [4] X Research source Screen shots are also helpful, even if you have saved the webpage on your computer, because they provide date and time information for when you accessed the page."

    {
      "title": "Collect receipts, envelopes, and other related evidence.",
      "content": "Collect receipts, envelopes, and other related evidence. If you sent money or other property to the perpetrator, you may have receipts or other evidence that could be useful to law enforcement. Keep the originals and also make copies in case you need them. [5] X Research source Preserve everything that is in any way related to the incident, even if you think it isn't relevant or doesn't include much information. You never know when a seemingly useless item may be a link that helps law enforcement piece everything together."

    {
      "title": "Start with your local law enforcement agency.",
      "content": "Start with your local law enforcement agency. While many countries have national methods for reporting cybercrime, your local law enforcement agency is most likely to have the tools to help you – particularly if you are a victim. [6] X Research source In most cases, you should use the non-emergency number or go to your nearest police station in person. Only call the emergency number if you believe you or someone else is in immediate danger. If you go to the police station in person, bring all your evidence with you. If you call first, let the officer know what evidence you have. They will tell you when to bring it in and what steps you should take to preserve it."

    {
      "title": "Determine which agency is responsible for cybercrime in your area.",
      "content": "Determine which agency is responsible for cybercrime in your area. Apart from local police, each country has different agencies that investigate and prosecute cybercrime. Which agency is responsible depends on the type of cybercrime you have to report. [7] X Trustworthy Source United States Department of Justice Official website of the U.S. Department of Justice Go to source For example, in the US most types of cybercrime can be reported to your local FBI office. If the crime deals with drugs or explosives, you can also report it to the ATF. In Canada, report all cybercrime to the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police)."

      "title": "File a report online if possible.",
      "content": "File a report online if possible. Many countries, including the US, Australia, and most countries in Europe, allow you to report cybercrime online. Your report will be evaluated by a cybercrime expert and referred to the appropriate authorities if necessary. [8] X Research source For example, you can report cybercrime to the FBI in the US using the agency's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), available at https://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx . In Australia, go to https://www.cyber.gov.au/report-and-recover/report . For links to various European reporting sites, go to https://www.europol.europa.eu/report-a-crime/report-cybercrime-online and click on the country where you live. Online cybercrime reports may not necessarily be investigated further. These systems enable national law enforcement agencies to monitor cybercrime, identify patterns, and come up with preventative strategies."

      "content": "Report anonymously to Crime Stoppers International. Law enforcement agencies in most countries won't allow you to file an anonymous report about cybercrime. However, if you want to remain anonymous, Crime Stoppers International provides a method for you to do that. [9] X Research source Crime Stoppers International uses encryption and other technical measures to protect your anonymity. The site does not log IP addresses.

      "content": "Follow up on your report if necessary. In most cases, law enforcement will contact you if they need any information from you beyond your initial report. However, if something else happens related to the incident you reported, you should let law enforcement know.
