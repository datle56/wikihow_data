Let the dish soap sit on the stain for 5-10 minutes. Because dish soap cuts through grease, it’s especially effective on tomato sauce stains, which usually include oils and tannins. If you don’t have access to dish soap, apply a small dollop of your regular laundry detergent to the stain instead, and work it into the fabric the same way. [3] X Research source"

If the stain has lifted out of the fabric, move on to the next step. If the stain is still visible, repeat the process of applying dish soap, allowing it to soak, and rinsing it out one more time. If you prefer, you can apply a commercial stain remover or white vinegar instead of re-applying the dish soap. If you do choose to use one of these additional stain removers, do a patch test on an unnoticeable area of the garment to make sure it won’t discolor the fabric. Allow whichever stain remover you choose to sit for 10-15 minutes, then rinse it out with cool water."

Repeat the entire stain removal process one more time before placing it in the dryer. Tomato stains can be stubborn and may take a few rounds to remove, so try to be patient!

It’s always best to start cleaning tomato sauce stains immediately, but it’s still possible to remove older, set-in tomato stains. If you can't get to the stain right away, don’t panic.

Simply dissolve a capful of oxygen bleach in a bucket or large bowl of warm water, and allow the garment to soak for at least 30 minutes, or as long as overnight. [11] X Research source If you’re worried about discoloration of the fabric, do a small patch test with the oxygen bleach on an unnoticeable area to test for colorfastness. Always check the care label on your clothing items to make sure they’re bleach safe. A triangle with two diagonal stripes inside it means it is safe to use oxygen bleach on the item, while a triangle with an “X” through it means no bleach should be used on the item.

Pasta and pizza sauces contain tannins, oils, and sometimes even proteins from meat. All of these factors make tomato sauce stains complex and difficult to tackle, which is why it may take a few rounds of treatment to fully lift the stain from the fabric."
