      "content": "Use “noona” to address female staff in a restaurant. In Korean restaurants, waitresses are usually busy, and they may not check up on you or wait for you to order. You can get a waitress’ attention by calling her “noona,” raising your hand, or making eye contact with her. Alternatively, you can say “yeogiyo” (여기요 or “excuse me”) if you’re in a crowded bar or a BBQ restaurant.

      "content": "“Noona” is exclusively used by males, while “unnie” is used by females.

Calling someone “unnie” acknowledges the older female’s role as a mentor, similar to “noona.” Examples of when to use “unnie” include: [5] X Research source A sister speaking to her older sister. A female talking to her older female friend. A younger female speaking to an older waitress. A younger female fan referring to older female idols."

      "content": "“Noona” is deemed a friendly and polite term of endearment. In Korean culture, honorifics are super important because they convey respect and keep social order. Calling someone “noona” acknowledges their age or position, making it clear who’s older so everyone behaves respectfully in social situations. The term “noona” also indicates closeness and affection, adding a personal touch when addressing an older female. [6] X Research source Is calling a girl \"noona\" flirty? Not necessarily! When a man calls an older woman “noona,” it usually means he views her as an older sister. However, it can be flirty if he constantly invites her out, pays for her things, or expresses romantic interest. Why is it important to use honorifics? If you don’t use honorifics correctly or choose to ignore them, Korean people will probably think you’re being rude. It’s crucial to use them correctly to build good relationships in both personal and professional settings!"

The level of formality you use depends on the situation and the person you’re addressing, but it’s important to learn all 7 since you will usually combine them with the appropriate honorific title to approach someone: [14] X Research source Hasoseo-che (하소서체): The most traditional and respectful level of speech, used in formal situations and to elders or superiors. It was mostly used to address royalty in the past, but can be seen in historical dramas or religious texts. Hasipsio-che (하십시오체): This level of speech is right between formal and casual, providing respect without going overboard. Strangers typically use this during their first few encounters, and it’s often used in public speeches, business, and people in the service industry. Haeyo-che (해요체): This is the most common polite level of speech, and it can be used to address strangers and the elderly. Foreigners are often urged to learn this form because it’s ideal for everyday situations. Hao-che (하오체): This is an outdated style of formal speech that you can find in historical K-dramas. It can be used to address people that are the same age as you or younger, and it's mainly seen in writing. Hage-che (하게체): This is an uncommon, casual-leaning style of speech that middle-aged people use to address other adults that they’re close to. It can also be used by older people to address younger people. Haera-che (해라체): This is a casual level of speech that’s still a bit formal. It’s most often used in writing, but not commonly used in conversation. Hae-che (해체): This is the most informal level of speech, used with friends, family members, and close acquaintances. Avoid using it in front of someone of a higher rank."
