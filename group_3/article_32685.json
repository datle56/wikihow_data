Choose “Scan Documents.” Follow the onscreen directions, and you will be able to scan photos to your phone easily! [1] X Research source The app will show a yellow box and all you need to do is line your document up within the yellow box. When it’s aligned, press the camera button to take a photo. The app will automatically correct for any tilting. You can take multiple scans in a row. After you tap “Keep Scan,” it returns to the scanning page so you can keep working. Tap “Save” once you are done to return to your main documents page. You can edit photos from the app by clicking on the scanned image. You can crop and change color and orientation, and you can share the photo directly from the Notes app."

[2] X Research source With the app open, point the camera at the photo you want to capture. The app will augment 4 dots over the image and will direct you to hold the camera over each dot for several moments. This won’t take more than 2 minutes, if that. This app detects the edges of the photo for you automatically so you don’t have to worry about cropping. The app will remove any glare for you automatically, so you can start taking photos without much prep work. The app will combine the photos you took from each augmented circle and will create a single, glare-free image."

If you have an iPhone with an older operating system, these options could come in handy! [3] X Research source Some apps to check out are Photomyne, TurboScan or Shoebox. Some of these do cost money ($1.99 to $4.99), so check out their functions carefully to make sure they’ll meet your needs before committing to one. Once you choose an app to use, download it from your phone’s app store and follow the guide it gives you when you first open it. Most apps give step-by-step instructions on how to capture and modify images."

      "content": "Use a tripod to ensure stability while you photograph. Taking free-hand photos can result in blurry images because of shaky hands. Mount your camera upside down between the tripod legs. Use a level on top of the camera to make sure the lens is parallel to the photo. [4] X Research source If purchasing a tripod, look for one where the center column can be reversed. This is how you can get that upside-down camera angle. [5] X Research source Set the tripod either on the ground or on a sturdy table. The goal is to minimize as much camera shake as possible. [6] X Research source"

Most digital cameras have good tools to combat poor lighting, but it is still a good idea to avoid photographing in a dark room. Using lamps, overhead lighting, or natural lighting will help you obtain the best quality photos. [8] X Research source Flash photography will give you captured image a glare. Turn on lamps or use natural light to brighten the room."

      "content": "Choose the right aperture depending on the lighting in your room. A smaller aperture is good for a brighter room, while a larger aperture will help your camera capture more brightness in a dim room. This is same reason your pupils dilate when it starts to get dark—you want to get the most light in sight as possible. [9] X Research source A lot of times your digital camera will automate these settings for you, but don’t be afraid to manually change them to see the different results. You may be surprised at the quality difference from one aperture size to another!"

      "content": "Choose a low shutter speed to reduce blurriness. The shutter speed is the length of time your camera shutter is open. The longer a shutter takes to capture an image, the blurrier it will be. Since you are taking pictures of still images, you don’t need to worry about opting for a longer shutter speed. [11] X Research source Try using a few different settings once you have your lighting set up. This way you can decide which ISO setting will be best for the quality you are looking for."
