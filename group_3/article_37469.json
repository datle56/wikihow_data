      "content": "Scrape off the dry glue underneath the veneer with a file or paperclip. Carefully lift the edge of the veneer so you can fit the file or paperclip underneath it. Rub the surface under the veneer with the file to break down any leftover glue that’s still stuck on the furniture. Blow away the dust so you can see your work area clearly. Continue removing as much of the glue as possible. [1] X Research source Be careful not to pry the veneer too far up since you could cause it to break or snap."

      "title": "Spread wood glue onto the surface under the veneer using a palette knife.",
      "content": "Spread wood glue onto the surface under the veneer using a palette knife. Apply a bead of wood glue along the edge of a palette knife and lift the veneer with your nondominant hand. Position the blade of the knife between the veneer and piece of furniture and scrape it over the wood. Try to make the layer as thin and even as possible to ensure proper adhesion. [2] X Research source Palette knives have flat, flexible heads so you can easily spread glue in tight areas. You can buy them from an art supply or hardware store. If you don’t have a palette knife, you can also spread the glue with a toothpick."

      "title": "Press the veneer down and wipe away excess glue with a damp shop cloth.",
      "content": "Press the veneer down and wipe away excess glue with a damp shop cloth. Wet a shop cloth with warm water and wring it out completely. Push down firmly on the top of the veneer to help spread the glue out more. Work from the center of the raised area toward the edges to force any excess glue out from the sides. Wipe any glue that comes out with the cloth so it doesn’t dry. [3] X Research source Push lightly for the first few times to help flatten large bubbles of glue underneath the veneer. Avoid leaving the wood glue on furniture since it will be more difficult to remove later on."

      "title": "Lay a piece of wax paper on the veneer.",
      "content": "Lay a piece of wax paper on the veneer. Set a sheet of wax paper over the edge with the shiny side face-down so it covers the entire glued area. Make sure you have about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of wax paper extending past the glued section so glue is less likely to leak out the sides. [4] X Research source If you don’t use wax paper, the glue may ooze out and stick to clamps later on."

      "content": "Clamp a flat piece of wood on top of the wax paper and leave it overnight. [5] X Expert Source William & Shannon Latil Furniture Refinishing & Home Remodeling Specialists Expert Interview. 29 October 2021. Choose a piece of wood that has a flat side large enough to cover the glued section. Lay the wood over the wax paper and secure it to your work surface with a C-clamp. Add additional C-clamps every 6 inches (15 cm) down the length of the wood so it doesn’t rise up away from the veneer. Leave the clamps on the wood overnight so the wood has time to dry. [6] X Research source Clamping the veneer down ensures it’s flat against the furniture so it’s less likely to develop blisters or damage in the future. You can buy C-clamps from your local hardware store. You can use any scrap piece of wood as long as it has a flat surface and covers any section you glued."

      "content": "Clean off any dried glue with a damp shop cloth or abrasive pad. Wet a shop cloth with warm water and wring out so it doesn’t drip. Lightly rub over the edges to see if any excess dried glue comes off. If the glue still sticks on the exterior of the vinyl, use an abrasive sponge and apply light pressure to break it down. [7] X Research source Avoid applying firm pressure while you’re removing glue since you could scrape through the veneer’s surface and make it discolored."

      "content": "Cut a slit in the middle of the blister with a utility knife to drain out the air. Position your cut so it runs with the wood grain to make it less noticeable. Push a utility knife lightly into the veneer until you pierce through the other side. Make the slit about half the length of the blister so you can easily poke a syringe inside of it later on. [8] X Research source Blisters occur when you set something hot on the veneer, which separates the adhesive from the wood to create a bubbled area on the surface. Always cut away from your body so you don’t injure yourself if the knife slips."

      "title": "Clamp a flat piece of wood over the veneer and leave it overnight.",
      "content": "Clamp a flat piece of wood over the veneer and leave it overnight. Set a flat piece of wood on top of the wax paper that’s large enough to cover the entire blister. Secure a C-clamp to your piece of furniture or work surface so it holds the wood block tightly against the veneer. Put additional clamps every 1 foot (30 cm) if the block doesn’t stay flat against the veneer. Leave the veneer clamped overnight so the wood glue has time to set. [12] X Research source Avoid removing the clamp or wood block any earlier since the veneer could still raise off the furniture and form another blister."

      "content": "Sand the dried glue on top of the veneer with 180-grit sandpaper. Take off the clamps, wood block, and wax paper so you can see your repair. Apply light pressure as you work 180-grit sandpaper over the slit. Remove the dried glue around the hole and continue smoothing out the edges until they’re flush with the rest of the veneer. [13] X Research source Don’t press too hard with the sandpaper, or you may sand through the veneer and cause discoloration. Blow the dust away or wipe it off with a damp cloth periodically so you can see what you’re doing."

      "title": "Tape around the chipped area if it’s along the edge of the veneer.",
      "content": "Tape around the chipped area if it’s along the edge of the veneer. Attach a strip of painter’s tape along the outer edge of the furniture so it extends about 1 inch (2.5 cm) over the surface. Make sure the tape forms clean, straight walls around the outer edges of the veneer. Continue applying tape around any corners or sides that have chips. [14] X Research source Painter’s tape helps form straight, clean edges with the wood filler. This works well if you’re fixing chips in the corners of drawers or along a table’s edge. You don’t need to apply tape if you’re filling chips that aren’t along the edge."

      "title": "Combine wood filler and hardener on a paper plate.",
      "content": "Combine wood filler and hardener on a paper plate. Read the mixing directions on the wood filler packaging and add enough to a paper plate to fill in the chips on your furniture. Add the listed amount of the hardening solution and mix it into the filler with a stir stick. Continue stirring the wood filler until it gets tacky. [15] X Research source You can buy wood filler from your local hardware store. You can also use a matching-colored wood putty for this. [16] X Expert Source William & Shannon Latil Furniture Refinishing & Home Remodeling Specialists Expert Interview. 29 October 2021. Make sure to use a stainable wood filler if you want to match the color of the original veneer. If you plan on painting over the veneer later on, then you can use any wood filler. Work quickly after combining the wood filler and hardener since it will start setting with 15 minutes and be difficult to work with."

      "content": "Press the wood filler into the damaged sections with a plastic scraper. Scoop the wood filler off of the paper plate with a plastic scraper and push it into the area that’s damaged. Move the scraper in multiple directions while applying firm pressure so the filler works deeper into the wood and veneers. Make sure corners and edges are as straight as possible. Scrape the surface flat and remove any excess wood filler. [17] X Research source If you have trouble scooping or pressing the wood filler into the chipped sections, it may have dried out before you were able to use it. Scoop out as much as you can before combining more wood filler with hardener."

      "title": "Allow the filler to dry for about 15–20 minutes.",
      "content": "Allow the filler to dry for about 15–20 minutes. Leave the wood filler alone in a dry place so it has time to harden. Lightly tap on the wood filler after 15 minutes to see if it’s solid. If it still feels wet, allow it to dry for another 10–15 minutes before checking again. [18] X Research source Wood filler may take up to 2 hours to completely set if you filled in large areas."

[21] X Expert Source William & Shannon Latil Furniture Refinishing & Home Remodeling Specialists Expert Interview. 29 October 2021. Brush the stain on with a paintbrush and follow the direction of the wood grain so it blends in easier. Allow the stain to dry completely, which usually takes 6–8 hours. [22] X Research source Try using a wood stain marker if you’re filling in sections smaller than 1 square inch (6.5 cm 2 ). You don’t need to apply stain if you plan on painting over the veneer and wood filler."
