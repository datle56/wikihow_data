They’ll think of 2 statements about themselves that are truthful and 1 lie that sounds believable. The person then says all their statements out loud. [1] X Research source If you don’t want to put people on the spot when it’s their turn to share, give everyone a few minutes at the start of the game to write down their statements first. You can play Two Truths and a Lie with any number of players, but it usually works best as an icebreaker activity with a larger group."

      "content": "The other players guess which statement is the lie. All the other players can either discuss the statements as a group or individually choose which statement they think is the lie. After everyone makes their guess, the original player reveals the lie they told to the group. [2] X Research source People may play the game slightly differently depending on if it’s for an icebreaker activity or for fun, so double-check the rules if you’re not sure. If you want to play Two Truths, One Lie as a drinking game, take a sip if you guess the lie incorrectly. If all the other players guess the lie, the player who told it drinks instead.

      "content": "Continue playing rounds until you decide to stop. Choose another random player to take the next turn. Play until everyone has had a chance to list their statements, but keep the game going if you’re having fun. Just think of 3 new statements for the next round. While Two Truths, One Lie doesn’t normally have a winner, you can easily keep track of the score. Give 1 point to players who guess the lie correctly, and whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins!"

      "content": "Choose statements that have the same level of believability. When you’re figuring out your 2 truths and 1 lie, try to pick things that all sound believable or all sound fake.

      "title": "Use outrageous truths and simple lies to fool other people.",
      "content": "Use outrageous truths and simple lies to fool other people. If you really want to fool the other players, think of true statements that are hard to believe and sound like lies. Then pick lies that sound so basic that no one would suspect them. Example: An outrageous truth could be something like, “I’ve been stung by a bee inside my mouth.” A simple lie may be something like, “I’ve never broken a bone.” Players will tend to pick the more outrageous-sounding statements as a lie, so it’s the perfect way to fool the other players."

      "title": "Say a half-truth if you have trouble thinking of a lie.",
      "content": "Say a half-truth if you have trouble thinking of a lie. Rather than thinking of a complete lie on the spot, think of a truthful statement and just switch the name of a place or person. That way, it sounds like the truth but the details are changed. Example: If pizza is your favorite food and you’re a die-hard Pizza Hut fan, you could easily lie and say, “My favorite food of all time is pizza from Dominos.” Other players may think telling a half-truth isn’t fair because it’s harder to figure out. If anyone seems annoyed by it, tell a full lie the next time it’s your turn."

      "content": "Mix up the order of your statements each time it’s your turn. Try to avoid making the lie your last statement every time because clever players may catch on. If you’re playing multiple rounds, switch between saying the lie as your first, second, and third statement every turn so you don’t get caught ."

      "title": "Try to keep a straight face and tone.",
      "content": "Try to keep a straight face and tone. When you list your statements, use the same facial expression and tone for each one so the lie is harder to figure out. Rapid blinking, flaring your nostrils, and changing the tone of your voice are all common ways to tell that someone is lying , so avoid doing it if you’re able to. [4] X Research source"
