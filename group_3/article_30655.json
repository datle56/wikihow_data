      "content": "Place your box on the edge of the wrapping paper. Set your gift down on the cut end of the wrapping paper so the largest side is face-down. Line the gift up along the side of the wrapping paper to help you with the measuring process. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Roll the box 3 times in a straight line to measure how much paper you’ll need. Start at the cut end of the wrapping paper and flip it over 3 times, going in the direction of the rolled paper. As you flip it, the box will roll onto its side, again onto its back, and one more time onto its other side. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Add 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) inches to the paper's length and cut it.",
      "content": "Add 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) inches to the paper's length and cut it. Hold a ruler next to the side of your box that's closest to the rolled wrapping paper, which is where your box landed after 3 rolls. Add an extra 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) to this length to make sure the wrapping paper is long enough to cover the entire gift with room to spare. Mark the paper and cut it using scissors in a straight, even line. [4] X Research source Use a pencil to mark the spot where you’ll cut, if you’d like. For bigger boxes , use a second roll of wrapping paper if the wrapping is too short to fit."

      "title": "Pull up the paper on the box's ends to see if it covers ¾ of each side.",
      "content": "Pull up the paper on the box's ends to see if it covers ¾ of each side. Now that the paper is measured to cover the length and width, pull the last 2 edges of the wrapping paper up to the box’s ends. If both ends are able to cover three-quarters of the box’s side, great! Otherwise, use scissors to trim the paper until it’s the right length. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Secure the wrapping paper",
      "content": "Secure the wrapping paper to the box using tape. Now that the wrapping paper is measured and cut to fit the box, it’s time to tape it up. Pull the wrapping paper length so it’s taut and covering the box before taping it in place. Crease the ends of the gift so the wrapping paper folds flat and tape these as well. [6] X Research source Add ribbon or a bow to the gift to complete it, if you’d like."

      "content": "Unroll your wrapping paper and place your object in the center. Choose which wrapping paper you’d like to use to wrap your gift and roll it out on a clean, flat surface. Put your oddly shaped gift in the center of the unrolled paper. [7] X Research source You might have an oddly shaped gift like a toy castle or a football. Circular or cylindrical items count as oddly shaped gifts too."

      "content": "Wrap the end of your wrapping paper all the way around your gift and cut it. Take the loose end of the wrapping paper and pull it over your object so it’s covering it completely. Once the end of the wrapping paper is touching the paper on the other side of the object, add about 2 in (5.1 cm) of extra length with a ruler (or just estimate!) and cut the paper in a straight line. [8] X Research source The extra length will help you tape the wrapping paper together and ensure the paper is wide enough to fit your gift. Remove the gift from the center of the wrapping paper once you’re done measuring."

      "content": "Pull both cut sides together and put tape down their entire length. Once your paper is cut, bring both loose edges in towards the center. Overlap them slightly for a stronger hold and put pieces of tape along the edges to hold the ends together. [9] X Research source Use double-sided tape if you don’t want the tape to be visible. Use at least 3 pieces of tape to hold the 2 ends together—one at each end and one in the center."

If the object you’re wrapping is pretty short, pull the edge up even farther. Fold the horizontal crease so that it’s in a straight, flat line. [10] X Research source"
