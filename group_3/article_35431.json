      "content": "Look for glassy or bloodshot eyes. A person’s eyes can tell you a lot about them and their mental state in a particular moment. If their eyes are glassy and bloodshot, it could be a sign that they've been drinking too much. Additionally, if a person has droopy eyes and is clearly having trouble keeping their eyes open, this could also be a sign of intoxication.

      "content": "Notice how the person smells. While intoxication can mean being under the influence of several different substances, the smell of the user can be a big giveaway for many people. Both alcohol and marijuana have very strong odours that linger with the user long after the intoxicating substance has been consumed. Try to smell the person and see if you can notice hints of alcohol or weed on their breath or clothes.

      "content": "Watch for impaired motor function. Intoxicated people can’t perform normal tasks as easily as they can when they are sober. This includes things like walking a straight line, lighting a cigarette properly, spilling drinks, or fumbling with other objects. [4] X Research source Keep in mind that impaired motor function can be a side effect of many other conditions, such as Parkinson's disease or ataxia.

      "title": "Estimate the person’s size.",
      "content": "Estimate the person’s size. Although alcohol affects everyone similarly, the speed at which it does so will be different based upon their physical characteristics. Size, sex, rate of consumption, the strength of each drink, the amount of food and the additional use of drugs all are to be considered when determining how quickly alcohol may be affecting someone. [6] X Research source For example, a person who weighs 150 lbs. will feel the effects of the alcohol much more quickly than someone who weighs 250 lbs., even if they drink the same amount of alcohol. This is because the larger person can tolerate more alcohol since their body takes longer to process it."

      "title": "Watch for a person’s inhibitions to become lowered.",
      "content": "Watch for a person’s inhibitions to become lowered. If someone is becoming more talkative and beginning to lose some control of knowing how far he can go in a social setting, they are showing the first signs of intoxication. Louder behaviour than usual — and even mood swings — are also possible warning signs. [7] X Research source For example, loud outbursts or inappropriate comments could be signs of intoxication. An intoxicated person may spend their money more freely than they usually would. With lowered inhibitions, people are more likely to focus on the good feeling that they get from drinking, rather than thinking about how they need to be responsible with their money. They might also buy drinks for strangers or acquaintances. Additionally, many people like to smoke cigarettes while they are drinking. Smokers usually smoke more when they are drinking, but many non-smokers will light up the occasional cigarette when they’ve been drinking. [8] X Research source This is another sign of intoxication."

      "content": "Listen to the volume of the person's voice. There are many signs of intoxication that you can spot just by paying attention to how someone speaks. If a person is speaking too loudly or too softly, then they are showing signs of intoxication."

      "title": "Notice if the person slurs their speech.",
      "content": "Notice if the person slurs their speech. Slurred speech is almost always a sure sign of intoxication. If you notice a person (your child, your customer, or anyone really) is slurring their words together, especially to the point where it is difficult to interpret exactly what they are saying, it is may be a sign of intoxication. Again, slurred speech can be a side effect of another condition or even a sign that someone is having a stroke. Don't automatically assume a person is drunk because they're slurring their words."

      "content": "Pay attention to what the person says. If a person is being combative with her words, speaking more slowly than usual, or repeating themselves a lot, these could be signs of intoxication.

      "title": "Observe how the person interacts with others.",
      "content": "Observe how the person interacts with others. As they become increasingly intoxicated, a person will progress through the stages of poor judgment. This is inappropriate behaviour that they normally would not engage in. Foul language, off-colour jokes, and overly flirtatious behaviour are signs of poor judgment, especially if these things are out of character for this person. Also, if their rate of consumption begins to increase or he participates in drinking games, these could also be signs of poor judgment. [10] X Research source For example, inappropriate sexual advances, mean comments, and unusually dirty jokes can all be signs of intoxication."

[11] X Trustworthy Source Mental Health Foundation UK charity working towards good mental health for all. Go to source If their mood seems more exaggerated than normal (on either end of the spectrum), they might be intoxicated. For example, if someone is drinking and they seem to be in a good mood but suddenly starts crying, this could be a sign of intoxication."

      "content": "Look for clues in other modes of communication. Sometimes it’s important to be able to determine if someone is intoxicated even if you are not in the same room with them. Phone calls. An intoxicated person might call an old lover or call someone repeatedly (also known as ‘‘drunk dialing’’). Their inhibitions are lowered, so calling over and over might not seem disruptive or rude to them and so they may feel less accountable for their actions. [12] X Research source Text messages. Signs of intoxication to look for in text messages include drastic misspellings, overly emotional pronouncements, or receiving a text (or a series of texts) at an unusually late hour.

      "title": "Consider alcohol tolerance.",
      "content": "Consider alcohol tolerance. Remember that people can develop a tolerance for alcohol, but that doesn't mean that they are not legally intoxicated. It just means that visual recognition is more difficult. [14] X Research source For some people with exceptional tolerance, drink counting may be the only way to assess intoxication but this is not without problems. If you are a bartender trying to determine whether you should keep serving someone alcohol or not, try to count the number of drinks the person has had. You can even ask one of their friends how much she has had to drink or how drunk the friend thinks the person is."

      "content": "Try to get the person to stop drinking. Once people drinking alcohol begin to show signs of physical impairment, first get them to stop drinking any more alcohol. [15] X Research source Some beginning signs of physical impairment are slurred speech, slow or clumsy movements, swaying, dropping objects (e.g., goods, money, keys) or forgetting thoughts in mid-sentence. [16] X Research source To get someone to stop drinking, try talking to them calmly as a friend. Tell them that you think they may have had too much to drink and that you are worried, so it would make you feel better if they would quit drinking for the night. Appeal to their sense of friendship if you have to — that they are doing you a favour by not drinking anymore. If they refuse to quit drinking, consider taking more drastic measures. If you are in a bar, tell the bartender that you think the intoxicated person has been drinking too much and ask the bartender to quit serving them alcohol. If you are in a private space like a house, try to hide all the remaining alcohol. The drunk person will not be as observant as usual because of their dulled senses, so it should be relatively easy for you to hide the alcohol without them noticing."

Sometimes people make poor decisions when they have had too much to drink, or aren’t able to correctly gauge their own level of drunkenness, so they choose to drive when they shouldn’t. To prevent someone from driving drunk you can try helping them get home another way, by notifying the bartender or the police, or even by stealing their car keys. [19] X Research source"

      "content": "Make sure the person is safe. People can be a danger to themselves when they are intoxicated. This is especially true if the intoxicated person is well past the point of minor drunkenness. There are many dangers to be considered — for example, people have been known to die from choking on their own vomit while they were intoxicated. If the person is unable to sit up, make sure they are lying on their side so they won’t be able to choke if they vomit. [20] X Research source If you see a person who is heavily intoxicated but this seems to be out of character for them, or notice they only had a single drink, it is possible that they have been roofied. This means that someone has slipped a drug in their drink (usually the sedative Rohypnol) that will cause them to lose some muscle control and, in effect, be unable to resist if he is assaulted."

Ask them to smile, to raise both arms over their head, and to speak a simple sentence. If part of the person's face droops or their smile is asymmetrical, if one arm seems to drift downward, and/or if they cannot repeat the sentence or seems to be searching for words, they may be having a stroke and needs emergency medical assistance.
