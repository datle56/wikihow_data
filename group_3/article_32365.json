Then, mix all the different prompts together; on their turn, each player must randomly pick a prompt and act it out while the rest of the group tries to guess what the word is! [1] X Research source If you have a particularly large group, try splitting into teams. Then, the teams can take turns, with one team member acting out a prompt while the others try to guess what it is."

      "content": "Fishbowl Fishbowl is a bit like Charades, but offers more options beyond just acting! Players must write out words or phrases and put them in a bowl or hat, then take turns drawing them and getting their teammates to guess the prompt. They can give hints by acting out the prompt, offering a vague clue, or using a single word to describe the prompt. If the player’s team correctly guesses their prompt, they get a point!"

Whoever gets the cross is the assassin, and they must try to “murder” other players by covertly winking at them. [2] X Research source While the assassin attempts to secretly eliminate the other players, they must try to guess who the assassin is. Any player who correctly guesses the assassin wins the game—but if they guess wrong, they’re out of the game."

Each team must take turns drawing a question randomly (or being asked the question), and after that, they have a limited amount of time to work together and figure out the answer. If they answer a question correctly, they get a point! The team with the most points at the end of the game wins. You can decide how long teams have to brainstorm answers. For example, you might give them 30 seconds to a minute (or less to make the game more fast-paced). Trivia questions can cover any topic, from history to pop culture. If there are any common interests between the players, try coming up with related trivia questions."

Normally, this game is played using snippets of actual recorded songs, but if you prefer, you could do a version with whistling instead. In this version, one person must whistle part of a song of their choice, and the others must try to guess the song’s name."

Then, have each player sit in the chairs, with the player who doesn’t get a chair standing in the middle of the circle. That player must say, “Mail call for everyone…” and then choose a descriptor. Each player with that descriptor must race to find a new seat! When players get up to look for a new seat, they can’t return to their original seat or pick the one next to them. At the same time, the player in the middle will also race to look for a seat after choosing a descriptor. Whoever is left standing at the end of each round must go to the middle of the circle and run the next round. Descriptors can be things like “wearing blue,” “with brown eyes,” or “with a pet dog.”"

If everyone at the party is an adult over the legal drinking age, you can also easily make this a drinking game by passing out shots beforehand. Just be safe and make sure everyone is drinking responsibly."
