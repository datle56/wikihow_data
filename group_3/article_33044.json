      "content": "Shake the game dome to scramble the letters. Pick up the Boggle tray with the dome on top and dice inside. Turn the dome upside-down and shake the dice to mix them thoroughly. Then, flip the board right-side up and give it a few gentle shakes until all of the dice fall into their own space on the tray. [3] X Research source If the dice land crooked or stacked, re-shake them so they perfectly fit into the grid on the tray."

      "title": "Start a timer for 3 minutes and remove the dome.",
      "content": "Start a timer for 3 minutes and remove the dome. The mini hourglass that comes with a Boggle game already counts down 3 minutes, but a watch or digital timer on your phone works if you need it. Flip the hourglass or start the timer, and immediately remove the dome from the Boggle game so the players can see the dice clearly. [4] X Research source The letter dice may land in a random direction in the grid. If players have trouble reading them, wait to start the timer and turn the dice so all the letters face the same direction."

      "title": "Find words by \"chaining\" adjacent letters.",
      "content": "Find words by \"chaining\" adjacent letters. Look over the letter dice in the tray and look for words that are at least 3-letters long. To form a word, each letter must be touching the previous letter either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally without any skips or jumps. When you find a word, write it down on your paper. [5] X Research source As long as you can find the word in a standard English dictionary, it’s a legal word in Boggle. You cannot use the same letter die twice in the same word. For example, you can only make the word NEON if you have 2 letter dice that show the letter N. Plural forms count as separate words than their singular forms, so you’re allowed to write down “MIND” and “MINDS” if the letters are connected. Some letters have lines to tell you which way they’re supposed to face. For example, Z has a line below it so it's not mistaken for N, and M has straight sides while W has slanted sides."

      "title": "Count each word only once.",
      "content": "Count each word only once. While it's common for simple words to appear on the Boggle board several times, each word only counts once when you write it down. [6] X Research source This also applies for words that are spelled the same but have more than one definition. For instance, \"tear\" (a drop of water that comes out of your eye) and \"tear\" (the act of ripping something) count as only one word in a game of Boggle."

As other players read their words, check for the same word on your own list. [9] X Research source Whenever two or more players wrote the same word down, every player crosses out that word from their list. The word will not score points for anyone.

      "title": "Find longer, less common words to score more points.",
      "content": "Find longer, less common words to score more points. As a general rule, it’s worth spending most of your effort finding a few long, difficult words instead of looking for short and easy words. Longer words are worth a lot more points, and they're also less likely to be found by other players, so there’s a better chance you’ll be able to score them at the end of the round and win the game ! [12] X Research source Example: Scoring a tough 8-letter word like \"acquaint\" means your opponent has to find eleven unique 3- or 4-letter words to match your score. Since shorter words are easier to find, it will be much harder for your opponent to catch up. Strategy Tip: If you’re playing with 2 players, make sure to add the short words to your list near the end of the time limit. That way, you can easily cancel out the easy words the other player wrote down. In a standard game, the longest potential words you could find are 17 letters long and are “inconsequentially,” “sesquicentennials,” and “quadricentennials.” [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Make singular words plural with the letter S.",
      "content": "Make singular words plural with the letter S. The board game experts at Our Family Plays Games agree that the letter S is your best friend in Boggle. Putting it at the end of most nouns or verbs will instantly get you another word that's an extra letter longer. It's easy to forget this simple trick, so racking up lots of plurals is a great way to find words that your opponents will overlook. Example: If there’s an S next to the letter T when you make the word MINT, you could easily add the word MINTS to your list for another 2 points. Look for other common prefixes and suffixes that you can add to a word to make it longer and earn more points. Other suffixes to look for are \"ed,\" \"er,\" \"est,\" \"ier,\" and \"ing.\" Some prefixes to look for include \"de,\" \"re,\" and “in.”"

      "title": "Use anagrams to find multiple short words.",
      "content": "Use anagrams to find multiple short words. Short words may not be the most effective way to get points, but they can add up if you write down ones that other players can’t find. Try to find different words that are made from the same few letters. Example: If you have the letters H, E, A, R, and T in a cluster, \"heart\" is an obvious word most people will notice. However, it's not as likely that everyone will notice \"earth,\" \"rate,\" \"tear,\" \"rat,\" \"heat,\" \"tea,\" \"hater,\" \"art,\" and other smaller words made from these letters. Check for any words that can be made by spelling other words backwards. For example, if you can make the word DRAW, you can also make the word WARD."

Just remove another letter die at random and replace it with the challenge cube. Successfully making a word with the challenge cube gives you 5 extra points toward your score. Just be sure to look for long, unique words because everyone else will try to use the challenge cube too. When you're playing with the challenge cube, the standard Boggle scoring rules are a little different. See below: [15] X Research source 3 letters: 1 point 4 letters: 2 points 5 letters: 3 points 6 letters: 4 points 7 letters: 5 points 8 or more letters: 6 points"
