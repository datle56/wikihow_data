      "title": "Take a decongestant medication.",
      "content": "Take a decongestant medication. A decongestant usually contains a cocktail of drugs to treat the multiple symptoms associated with congestion. In most cases, they are combined with a painkiller such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin to relieve headaches and sinus pain. These can be purchased over-the-counter at a drug store. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Many decongestants, such as phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine, narrow the blood vessels to clear out nasal congestion. This also increases blood pressure. Therefore, proceed with caution if you already have high blood pressure. Decongestants can be found in tablets, capsules, liquids, and syrups. Make sure to read the label carefully or talk to a doctor before taking a decongestant because serious side effects can occur in babies, pregnant people, and people with allergies. Take the correct dosage and do not abuse the medication."

      "content": "Try saline nasal drops. Saline nasal drops are effective, safe, and non-irritating. Saline (salt water) helps to liquefy mucous secretions that block the sinuses and reduce the chance that the mucus will crust along the sinus cavity. Nasal drops (or sprays) will moisten the mucous membranes of the nasal sinuses and can be purchased over-the-counter at a drug store. It is recommended to take saline drops after the use of a decongestant. Taking saline nasal drops will help you avoid the “rebound effect” often associated with taking a decongestant nasal spray too often."

      "content": "Suck on some zinc lozenges. Taken as a lozenge or syrup, zinc has been shown to reduce the length of a cold by up to 1 full day if taken during the onset of symptoms. Zinc lozenges and syrups can be purchased over-the-counter at a drug store. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Zinc prevents the rhinovirus from multiplying and keeps it from lodging in the mucous membranes of the throat and nose. The rhinovirus is the source of most common colds. Despite these initial findings, there is still not enough evidence that zinc has the impact on reducing head congestion as previously advertised. Zinc will boost the immune system against the virus but will have little influence on congestion. Don’t use zinc nasal spray or drops, since these can cause permanent damage to your sense of smell. [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Using zinc supplements long-term can cause a copper deficiency, which may lead to symptoms like numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arms and legs. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using zinc and ask whether you should also take copper supplements."

      "content": "Drink liquids. It is important to stay hydrated when you have a cold. Try to drink more liquids than you regularly drink during the day. You can be creative with your drinks to avoid dehydration and fight congestion. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Drink water, juice, or a clear broth. You can add lemon or honey to help soothe your throat and loosen congestion. Sipping on warm liquids, such as chicken soup or warm apple juice, could increase mucus flow and relieve blockage. A saltwater gargle can help relieve a sore or scratchy throat associated with congestion. Add about a quarter to one-half teaspoon (1.4-2.8 g) of salt into an 8 fl oz (240 mL) glass. Make sure the salt is dissolved before gargling. Try some aromatic or herbal tea to relax your body, soothe your throat, and provide temporary relief from head congestion."

      "title": "Eat to fight congestion.",
      "content": "Eat to fight congestion. Some foods have sinus-healing properties. These foods are more likely to help ease your suffering from head congestion than they are to cure it, but relief from congestion in any form will enable you to function better throughout the day. [5] X Research source Pineapples contain bromelain, a mixture of enzymes that digest protein, which has been used for centuries in South America to reduce inflammation from sinus surgery. Garlic releases the enzyme allicin, which destroys bacteria and viruses, when you crush or chop it. Wait 10 minutes after you crush or chop garlic before cooking it. Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, nuts, eggs, and flaxseed have anti-inflammatory properties that can help alleviate allergy-related conditions."

      "content": "Eat a diet rich in vitamin C. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that counteracts histamine. Histamine causes inflammation, runny noses, sneezing, and other symptoms related to head congestion. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Try to get plenty of vitamin C in your diet, since getting enough vitamin C may make your cold symptoms milder and help you get well faster. [7] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Citrus fruits are high in vitamin C. Eat lots of oranges, grapefruits, and strawberries to utilize the full effect of antioxidants. Vegetables such as tomatoes, red and green bell peppers, kale, spinach, broccoli, and brussels sprouts also have lots of vitamin C. Make sure to choose red and green vegetables. Ideally, you should get most of your vitamin C from food rather than from supplements, and aim to make it a regular part of your daily diet. Taking vitamin C supplements right when you start to get sick is unlikely to help with your cold symptoms."

Buy a good humidifier that will keep your house between 30% and 50% humid. [9] X Research source Maintain your humidifier regularly or it could become a health hazard. Monitor and clean your humidifier so that it does not become a haven for mold and the humidity level does not go too high or low. In both cases, you will cause more problems than you solve. In addition, consider taking a hot bath or shower, inhaling steam, or putting a hot cup of water under your nose to help loosen mucus."
