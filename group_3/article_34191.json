This nitrogen is deposited back onto the land, leading to both soil and water pollution. To reduce your electricity consumption, turn off and unplug devices and equipment you aren’t using, such as televisions, printers, tablets, and computers. [1] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Turn off lights in rooms you’re not in and use LED bulbs rather than fluorescent or incandescent bulbs. Select energy-efficient light bulbs and appliances, like washing machines, refrigerators, and air conditioning units. Use a programmable thermostat and keep the temperature between 77–80 °F (25–27 °C) in the summer and 64–68 °F (18–20 °C) in the winter."
