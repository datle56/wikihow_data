      "content": "Use a box large enough to fit the wrapped bottles plus extra padding. Make sure the box is sturdy and free of holes or tears. While you can often obtain used boxes from retailers for free, it’s better to buy a new box than use one that’s worn or flimsy."

      "content": "Find a second box that is 6 inches (15 cm) larger in each dimension. To make your packaging extra secure, it’s a good idea to put your bottles inside 2 layers of boxes. Look for a box that will leave room for about 3 inches (7.6 cm) of padding on each side of the smaller box when it is placed inside. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Seal the bottom of both boxes with packing tape. Use packing tape at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide. Fold 2 opposing flaps together, then fold the remaining 2 flaps over them and seal them with tape. You should use one long strip of tape down the middle where the 2 outer flaps meet, then tape the 2 sides perpendicular to that line, making an H. [2] X Research source For added security, put a strip of tape on the bottom inside the box to seal the inner flaps as well."

      "title": "Line the bottom of the larger box with packing materials.",
      "content": "Line the bottom of the larger box with packing materials. Packing peanuts or bubble wrap is ideal, as paper will not absorb as much shock if the package is shaken or dropped. Make a layer of packing materials at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) deep in the larger box.

      "title": "Wrap the bottles individually in bubble wrap.",
      "content": "Wrap the bottles individually in bubble wrap. If you are using small-bubble wrap, you should wrap each bottle at least 4 times all the way around. If you are using large-bubble wrap, 2 times should be enough. You want about 3 inches (7.6 cm) of bubble wrap surrounding each bottle. [4] X Research source You can tape the bubble wrap in place with Scotch tape, or use rubber bands to hold it in place. You can also purchase a partitioned packaging container, which will keep the bottles separate so they don’t knock against each other, but it’s still a good idea to wrap them in at least 1 layer of bubble wrap if you do so. [5] X Expert Source Marty Stevens-Heebner, SMM-C, CPO® Professional Move Manager Expert Interview. 14 January 2020. Partitioned packaging containers are usually available at shipping supply stores, and may come in the form of a box or an insert you can place inside a box."

      "title": "Seal each bottle in a plastic bag if they contain liquid.",
      "content": "Seal each bottle in a plastic bag if they contain liquid. This will keep them from leaking if any of them break during shipment. You can also seal the bottle cap with electrical tape if you are concerned about leaks. This is especially important with carbonated liquids such as beer and kombucha, which are more likely to blow their caps during shipment."

      "content": "Pack the smaller box inside the larger one. Place the smaller box roughly in the middle of the larger one on top of the padding layer, and stuff more packing material around the sides of the smaller box. It should be packed tightly enough that it does not move when you shake the larger box. [6] X Research source"

You may also be able to ask an employee at the post office to stamp it for you, but it’s best to write it yourself as well just in case. [13] X Research source It’s also a good idea to write “this side up” with an arrow pointing towards the top on each side, especially if you are shipping bottles that contain liquid."
