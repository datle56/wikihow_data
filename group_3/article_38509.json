Sometimes people's TikTok names are hard to remember, so it might be helpful to go to the original creator's profile to find their exact username. You'll need their full username to search for their Duets. Each TikToker's username appears at the top of their profile below their photo. For example, @wikihow . You'll only be able to find Duets that are public—private Duets won't show up in search. [1] X Research source"
