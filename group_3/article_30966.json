      "content": "Dissolve alpha arbutin in water before adding it to other products. Pure alpha arbutin comes in powdered form. This powder must not be applied directly into a skin because it’s too potent and may cause a burning sensation. In addition, it cannot be mixed directly into a skin care product without being dissolved first. If it isn’t dissolved, the arbutin will just sit in the product like flaky chunks of powder and won’t spread evenly across your skin. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a digital scale to weigh your alpha arbutin. While it hasn’t been studied thoroughly, alpha arbutin‘s shelf life is roughly 12 months. If you plan on using it every day, use 20–25 grams (0.71–0.88 oz) or more. If you only plan on using alpha arbutin on occasion, use 10–15 grams (0.35–0.53 oz). Use a digital scale to weigh out your arbutin, or purchase a bottle containing the exact amount that you plan on using. [2] X Research source The 2 main reasons to use alpha arbutin are for skin lightening and covering blemishes from skin discoloration. If you’re trying to lighten your skin, start off with a 2-month supply (around 25 grams (0.88 oz)) so that you can make adjustments to your skin lightening formula once you find what’s working for you."

      "content": "Calculate the amount of purified water needed to create a 5:1 ratio. The easiest way to get purified water is to purchase it. Alternatively, you can use a commercial water filter or boil the water for 30 minutes. Avoid chemically purifying your water with iodine or bleach since it may modify the arbutin in an unexpected way. [3] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source You need 5-parts water for every 1-part alpha arbutin. To determine how much you need, multiply the amount of arbutin by 5 and convert it to milliliters. For example, if you’re using 25 grams (0.88 oz) of arbutin, multiply it by 5 to get 125 grams (4.4 oz). This converts to 125 millilitres (0.53 c) of water."

Dissolved alpha arbutin is generally safe in any skin care product that is applied directly to the skin so long as it makes up less than 2% of the total composition of a face cream, and 0.5% of a body lotion. Choose a lotion or cream that you use regularly to combine with your dissolved alpha arbutin. You cannot mix arbutin into an oil-based cream or lotion since the oil and water won’t mix evenly."

If you’re adding it to a facial cream, add 2%. Alpha arbutin can be quite strong on its own and cause a burning or stinging sensation if it takes up a high percentage of the lotion or cream. For example, if you have 200 millilitres (0.85 c) of skin care lotion, add 1 mL (0.0042 c) of dissolved arbutin. If you have a facial cream, add 4 millilitres (0.017 c)."

If you’re using making a large amount, feel free to measure out the dissolved alpha arbutin using a standard measuring cup.
