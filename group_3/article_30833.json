      "content": "Learn the rules. This is also known as the \"consonant system\" or \"phonetic system.\" You build associations between each individual number and a sound. Since words are easier to remember than numbers, you construct a word from each group of numbers and then memorize the word(s). [1] X Research source The associations you choose to make are up to you. There is no right or wrong answer as long as you continue to make the same associations as you continue to use this technique."
