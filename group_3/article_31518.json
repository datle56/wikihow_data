      "content": "Choose the right joke for your audience. Reading a room and gauging what your audience will find funny is a big part of being funny and telling jokes that make people laugh. Muñoz suggests being very careful about telling any type of joke in serious situations like work events, funerals, and weddings. He recommends that you always pay attention to the reactions to any jokes you tell. Pay attention to the mood of the event by listening to what the people around you are talking about. Lighter conversations with a little laughter are going to be better settings for telling jokes than serious conversations."

      "title": "Pause briefly between the setup and the punchline.",
      "content": "Pause briefly between the setup and the punchline. The key to getting a laugh when you tell a joke is to use comedic timing. That means adjusting how fast you talk and using a “pregnant pause” right before you deliver the punchline to build tension. This gives people a second to catch up, but not long enough to really think, [5] X Research source Some people get excited and rattle off the punchline before the setup has a chance to sink in. Others pause, but wait a little too long, and the joke falls flat. Payne says you just have to relax , be confident , and believe in yourself and your sense of humor."

      "content": "Keep practicing if people don’t laugh at first. Everyone bombs or tells a bad joke from time to time. Payne explains, “You just have to have fun, do your best, and know that you’ll probably fail the first few times.” The best way to practice is to tell more jokes. If people don’t laugh, try to figure out why and don’t take it personally. “You just have to develop a little bit of a tough skin, and know that somebody not laughing at your jokes isn't a personal attack on you or your personality,” Payne suggests."
