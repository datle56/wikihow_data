      "title": "Begin with a flat piece of rectangular paper.",
      "content": "Begin with a flat piece of rectangular paper. These instructions were made for a standard piece of A4 printer paper, 8.5 x 11 inches (216 x 280 mm) in size. You may use larger paper instead (such as A3) for a louder sound. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Place the paper flat on the table.",
      "content": "Place the paper flat on the table. If your paper is the same color on both sides, you can make a small mark on one side to keep track. This shouldn't be necessary for this project, but it's a useful technique to know about when making origami out of regular paper. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Crease your paper in half horizontally along the center.As you make each fold, run your fingernail or a creasing tool, such as a bone folder, along the crease.",
      "content": "Crease your paper in half horizontally along the center.As you make each fold, run your fingernail or a creasing tool, such as a bone folder, along the crease. This will make each fold sharp and crisp, giving a clean, professional finished shape. Once you're done, unfold it so that the paper is laying flat again. At this stage, the orientation of your paper doesn't matter, but you want to make sure that you are making a valley fold. When you unfold the paper the crease should look like the bottom of a valley"
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold your paper in half vertically along the center.",
      "content": "Fold your paper in half vertically along the center. Once again, after you have made a crease, unfold it. You should now have two creases in your paper when it lays flat, creating a cross in the center."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the top corners to meet the centerline.",
      "content": "Fold the top corners to meet the centerline. Rotate your paper if necessary so the short side faces you. Now fold the top corners into the vertical centerline. [3] X Research source Your folds won't reach the horizontal crease. Think of it like you’re folding a paper airplane ."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the bottom corners into the centerline.",
      "content": "Fold the bottom corners into the centerline. Just as before, fold the corners on the other end of your paper into the centerline. You should now have two folded over triangles with a space of flat paper in the middle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn your paper so that it’s horizontal again.",
      "content": "Turn your paper so that it’s horizontal again. Your origami banger should now be lying flat on the table with two folded triangles on either side of your paper and a lane of flat paper running vertically down the middle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold your paper over in half vertically.",
      "content": "Fold your paper over in half vertically. Now you want to fold your paper up along the horizontal centerline. If done correctly, you should now have a trapezoid shape with a long, flat bottom, and a smaller flat top to it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the left and right corners inward to meet the crease.",
      "content": "Fold the left and right corners inward to meet the crease. Position the trapezoid so the short side is facing you. Fold the top left corner inward to meet the vertical center crease. Fold the top right corner inward to meet the crease as well. [4] X Research source These corners should stick out past the short side of the trapezoid, meeting to form a diamond."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flip the paper over.",
      "content": "Flip the paper over. Pick up the paper and turn it over on the table, from left to right. There should be two flaps of paper on top that do not quite meet the bottom corner of the diamond."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the left corner over to meet the right.",
      "content": "Fold the left corner over to meet the right. Fold the left corner over to the right, creasing along the same centerfold. You now have an origami banger, which looks like a triangle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the banger at the bottom corner.",
      "content": "Hold the banger at the bottom corner. Hold the bottom corner between your thumb and finger, with the longest side of the triangle facing you. Make sure you are only holding the two outer layers of paper, not the flap inside."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring the banger down fast to make a noise.",
      "content": "Bring the banger down fast to make a noise. Hold the banger above your head. Swing your arm down as fast as you can, snapping forward with your wrist at the same time. The inner flap of the banger should pop out into a \"balloon\" in front of the banger, making a noise. It may take a few tries to get this to work. [5] X Research source If you're having trouble getting this to work, try tugging the innermost flap out a tiny bit. To re-use the banger, just gently push the paper back in. You might need to experiment with the positioning of the flap."
