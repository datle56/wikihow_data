      "content": "Circulate a card among coworkers. A communal card signed by coworkers can be a nice memento from the final days at the workplace. Most stores that sell greeting cards will have a selection of cards for retirees, but you might also consider making your own card, which can often be more meaningful. Since coworkers are often gathered in one place, it is often easiest to circulate the card at work, but try to avoid letting the retiree see it before you’re ready to give it to them. This might require some subterfuge. You might try sending an email to everyone but the retiree, asking them to find a moment to discreetly sign the card."

      "title": "Send a personalized message.",
      "content": "Send a personalized message. If the retiree is a friend, family member, or a coworker with whom you have worked closely, try to go beyond a communal card and offer a personalized message in a separate letter or card. Avoid a generic “congratulations” and express something unique about the retiree, their career, and/or what they mean to you. This is an opportunity to share a memory and reflect upon their accomplishments. Also be sure to wish them well with the activities they will pursue after retirement. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Give a thoughtful gift. Your gift will depend on how well you know the retiree. If you’re the retiree’s employer you might opt for a watch or a clock, which are the quintessential retirement gifts, but a personalized gift might be more meaningful. A keepsake box filled with mementos from the job might be an idea. If the retiree is a friend or family member you might consider gifts oriented towards life after retirement. Think about the person's hobbies and interests. If they are a nature lover, you could choose an outdoors-themed gift. Is there equipment or accessories that a retiree could use for their hobbies?

      "content": "Determine how the retiree would like to celebrate. Ask the retiree if they would enjoy a large party or prefer a small quiet gathering. It’s probably a good idea for family members to coordinate with coworkers. Some retirement parties are large affairs that combine people from both the retiree’s personal and professional lives. Some people, however, prefer to have one celebration for colleagues and another with family and friends. Another option is to forgo the party and to do something more intimate like celebratory dinner."

      "content": "Find the right location. Retirement parties can be held at the workplace, in a hired hall, or a local restaurant. If possible, hold the party in a private venue so that guests and speakers are more comfortable expressing themselves. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a guest list. Current coworkers and immediate family, including spouses and children, are almost always on the guest list. For a larger party, consider inviting extended family, friends, former colleagues, and longstanding professional collaborators."

      "title": "Prepare a visual display that reflects the retiree's career.",
      "content": "Prepare a visual display that reflects the retiree's career. A retirement party is a celebration of both a person and their career. It is nice for party attendees to see pictures from each stage of the retiree's professional and personal life. Pictures displaying the person's accomplishments and work history can mounted on a poster, shown on a monitor sitting on a table, or projected onto a large screen for all at the party to watch. Include photographs of the person both at work and at home with family. Add in photos of other important events such as a memorable trip or the birth of a grandchild. Old photos of out-of-date fashions and hairstyles might add some comic relief."

      "title": "Set the right tone.",
      "content": "Set the right tone. Humor can be an important element in saying goodbye to someone who is retiring, but fit the humor to the person and situation. For instance, a roast could be appropriate for a retiree who enjoys bawdy or teasing humor. Be sure to moderate the humor, however, for someone who could become offended easily or who is finding the idea of retirement challenging. Those who are anxious or mournful about retirement would appreciate a more heartfelt goodbye. Remember that the main focus is to honor the retiree so make sure that the atmosphere of the retirement party always keeps a sense of dignity. A retirement party should feel like a fun celebration, not a sad event. [5] X Expert Source Natasha Miller Professional Event Planner Expert Interview. 29 January 2020."

      "content": "Plan a toast or a speech. Most retirement parties include a speaker who offers remarks that are both touching and humorous. Someone close to the retiree - like a spouse or supervisor - should be prepared to share the story of the retiree’s career and include anecdotes that are illustrative of his or her character."

      "title": "Commemorate the event.",
      "content": "Commemorate the event. A retirement party is a good opportunity to produce mementos and keepsakes. Videotape the party or event so the retiree can view it again later. Provide a blank memory book for guests to sign and encourage them to write down their memories of the past and good wishes for the future."

      "title": "Strive to keep in touch.",
      "content": "Strive to keep in touch. After an active career, it is normal for a retiree to miss their colleagues and the social aspect of the workplace. Make sure friends and coworkers have the retiree's contact information and make an effort to keep in touch. The retirement party or the last day of work is a good opportunity to exchange phone numbers, email addresses, and social media profiles."
