      "title": "Attach the separate parts of the fishing pole if they’re apart.",
      "content": "Attach the separate parts of the fishing pole if they’re apart. Many fishing poles are made of two or three pieces—they take up less storage space when they’re broken down, but you’ll need to assemble them to use the pole. The joint where the sections fit together is called the ferrule—insert the male ferrule into the female ferrule, then twist the pieces to snug them together. [1] X Research source Make sure the guides along the fishing pole (the rings that the fishing line goes through) are lined up with each other. Don’t force the pieces together. If you feel any obstruction, or if the pieces don’t lock into place, examine the pole or check the owner’s manual to see if there’s a locking mechanism you need to engage or disengage. Each time you re-assemble your fishing pole, wipe down the pieces with a cloth to remove any dirt or debris that could scratch the ferrules and damage them. A light-power, fast-action rod is usually best for a beginner fishing setup because it’s easier to feel when there’s a fish on the line, and you’ll learn to work with the fish’s movements to successfully reel it in."

      "content": "Attach the reel to the rod if it’s not already assembled. If your rod and reel came separately, look at the bottom of your rod—you should see a female opening to insert your reel. Seat the reel against the opening in the rod, then rotate the threaded connector clockwise until the reel is snugged securely in place. Don’t over-tighten the reel. If you force the threading, the rod might crack."

      "title": "Spool the reel if it doesn’t have line on it already.",
      "content": "Spool the reel if it doesn’t have line on it already. The way you spool new line onto the reel will depend on the type of reel you have. The most common reel is probably a spinning reel, but bait-casting, spin-cast, and fly fishing reels are also common. If you have a spinning reel : Flip open the bail (the wire bar on the reel) and secure the end of the fishing line to the reel with a slip knot. Close the bail, then turn the handle on the reel until the reel is almost full. [2] X Research source If you have a bait-casting reel : Feed the line through the small hole on the reel, called a line guide. Wrap the line around the reel two or three times then secure it with a knot. Turn the reel handle to load the line onto the reel. If you have a spin-cast (close-faced) reel: Unscrew the cap on top of the reel. Pass the fishing line through the line guide and knot it onto the spool, then replace the cap and turn the reel handle to load the line. If you have a fly-fishing set-up : Tie your backing line to the reel using an arbor knot. Fill the reel with 50–100 yd (150–300 ft) of backing line, then knot the fly line to the backing line ."

      "title": "Lift the bail arm and pull the fishing line.",
      "content": "Lift the bail arm and pull the fishing line. If you’re using a spinning reel, flip open the bail on the reel to make it easier to pull off some of the fishing line. Pull out enough line to go all the way to the tip of the fishing pole, plus a little extra. On spin-cast reels, push the button at the bottom of the reel to release the line. [3] X Research source If your reel doesn’t have a bail, try loosening the drag (or tension on the line) by turning the small wheel or knob on the front of the reel."
    },
    {
      "title": "Thread the line through the guides.",
      "content": "Thread the line through the guides. Most rods have four to five guides, or eyelets, attached to the rod. Starting at the eyelet closest to the reel, pass the line through the guides. Work your way up to the top of the rod. [4] X Research source Fishing instructor Michael Reynolds recommends, “Always apply tension to the spool when you’re applying line onto a reel, regardless of the type of reel. And never fill it to the very edge of the spool—always leave about 1 ⁄ 16 in (0.16 cm) of space.” Take your time and make sure the line goes through each guide—if you miss any, you’ll have to reel the line back in and start over. Once the line is threaded through all of the guides, close the bail arm or tighten the drag."

      "title": "Thread the end of the line through the lure.",
      "content": "Thread the end of the line through the lure. After you’ve threaded the line onto your pole, pull out an extra 10 in (25 cm) or so of line. Pass the end of the line through the eyelet on the lure you want to use. [5] X Research source Pull about 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) of line through the eyelet. You can trim off any excess, but it will be harder to tie the knot if you don’t have enough line to work with. Beginner knot-tying tip: Since fishing line is so difficult to see, it is often recommend that you practice knot tying with string or shoelaces."

      "title": "Wind the line back around itself.",
      "content": "Wind the line back around itself. Pull the free end of the line (also called the “tagline” or “tag”) back up so it’s doubled up with the rest of the line. Leave a small loop just above the eyelet—there needs to be enough of a gap for the line to pass back through there. Loosely wrap the tag around the other piece of line about 5 times. [6] X Research source When you’re finished, the line should look twisted, similar to how a candy cane would have two colors wrapped around another. Be sure to leave plenty of length on the tag. If it’s too short, undo the twist and start over."

      "title": "Tuck the free end of the line back through the gap you made.",
      "content": "Tuck the free end of the line back through the gap you made. Pull the tag back towards the lure, then loop it through the little space you left next to the eyelet. Hold the tag and the main line firmly and pull the tag tight to secure the knot. [7] X Research source To get the knot as snug as possible, moisten your fingertips with saliva and running the line over your finger before you pull the line tight. Use nail clippers or scissors to clip off any excess line from the tag. But since the knot may snug down a little more, leave about 1 ⁄ 8 – 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.32–0.64 cm) instead of cutting it perfectly flush."

      "title": "Pick the right color based off weather.",
      "content": "Pick the right color based off weather. Depending on the sun and cloud cover, you may want to pick a different lure. On sunny days, try using a silver lure. The silver will help reflect light and attracts attention. [8] X Research source Contrastingly, use a gold lure on a cloudy day. Gold has high reflective properties and will help give off light on an overcast or stormy day."

      "title": "Choose a lure that matches the fish’s natural food.",
      "content": "Choose a lure that matches the fish’s natural food. Fishing instructor Kathy Sparrow recommends paying attention to what the fish are eating when you’re choosing a lure. If you pick something that looks tasty to the fish, you’re a lot more likely to catch one. If you’re fishing in freshwater: A jig will work well in fresh water by using feathers and a metal head to attract fish. If you’re fishing in saltwater: Sparrow recommends using a brightly-colored or patterned lure, or bait like fish, crabs, and shrimp. If you’re fly-fishing: Sparrow says, “Pay attention to what insects are in the water at the time—that’s more than likely what the fish are eating, so you want your flies to mimic that.” A spoon lure will work well for fish that prey on small fish. The spoon will wave back and forth to mimic the movement of a fleeing fish, attracting the bigger predators. If you’re looking for an all-purpose lure, try a spinner. A spinner is a metal piece that will spin in the water as it moves. This attracts a lot of attention and should be used in a particularly difficult-to-catch location."

      "title": "Pick a lure with a lot of movement in muddy water.",
      "content": "Pick a lure with a lot of movement in muddy water. If your water is muddy or dirty, it will be harder for fish to see the lure. Use a lure that makes a lot of movement, such as a spinner or a spoon. [9] X Research source These lures create vibrations, so even if the fish cannot see the lure, they can feel it. Comparatively, if the water is clear, an overwhelming amount of vibration and movement may scare off a fish."

      "content": "Have a valid fishing license and check local regulations so you know what’s legal to catch. Your state wildlife agency will have a website that includes up-to-date fishing regulations, like how many fish you can catch and what size they must be to keep them. They’ll also have the instructions for getting a fishing license in your state. Failing to follow local fishing laws can lead to fines and other penalties, so it’s important to do your research before you head out on a fishing trip. [10] X Research source Sparrow says, “In many places, you can get a fishing license online—you can get it immediately and it’s digital, which makes it convenient.” If your state doesn’t offer same-day online fishing licenses, you can usually buy them at a local sporting goods store or fishing shop. You can find the website for your local wildlife agency by clicking on your state on this U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service map ."
