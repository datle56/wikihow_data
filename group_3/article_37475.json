      "content": "Get your cleaning materials ready. Cleaning the leather before you condition it ensures you don't lock in any dirt or grime as you moisturize. In a bucket or small basin, mix a cleaning solution of dishwashing soap and warm water (one part soap to 8 parts water). [1] X Research source Alternatively, purchase saddle soap from a shoe store, department store, or online. Saddle soap contains ingredients like beeswax that add suppleness to leather while cleaning it, but wax or oil may inhibit a filler or compound from properly adhering to the leather. Use a small amount of the soap (i.e. a small dab on a wet cloth) to prevent buildup on the leather. [2] X Research source To remove dry dirt and dust, just rub the surface of the leather with a soft, damp cloth.

Wring the cloth out lightly, then wipe down the entire damaged surface of the leather with firm, circular motions. Rinse and repeat.

Just make sure to do a patch test on an inconspicuous area to make sure it doesn't stain the leather.

      "content": "Leave the leather to dry. Once the leather is thoroughly rinsed, let it air dry. Avoid using a heater, blow dryer, or other heat source to speed up drying time. Heat can change the chemical structure of leather, leaving it stiff and misshapen. [7] X Research source"

In theory, these kits should contain all of the tools and substances required to repair leather surfaces. To find a good quality kit, read user testimonials before buying; a reputable company will have many. If you just have a small scratch on soft leather, try rubbing the surface of the leather in circular motions with your index finger.

      "content": "Avoid a mess. To avoid stains from any of the ingredients being used to treat your leather, lay down newspaper, plastic sheeting, or towels under the leather object. Wear protective gloves and old clothing while you work. To minimize fumes from repair products, open the windows or bring the object outside to restore it."

      "content": "Apply a leather repair compound. Using a sponge, gently spread a thin layer of leather binder (a liquid that seeps into the leather fibres and binds them together) over the entire surface of the worn leather. Let it air dry. Repeat the process 3-5 times, or until you are satisfied with the results. Remove excess binder that might accumulate around the seams."

Apply a thin coat onto the leather, concentrating on hard to reach areas like creases, cracks, and seams. Wait 30 minutes for the colorant to dry. Shake the colorant well to ensure that it is mixed well before using it."

      "content": "Use a blowdryer. Heat can be bad for leather, but in small doses it may be beneficial. Turn the blowdryer to a medium setting and use it on the section of scratched leather, gently rubbing the scratch with your free hand. The heat should bring dyes applied to the leather at the tannery back to the surface, thereby reducing the appearance of the scratch. [12] X Research source"

Keep leather away from water as much as possible, and be sure to be delicate about drying it if it does get wet (i.e. avoid direct heat, and air dry). Use a leather conditioner to moisturize leather every few months, or whenever it starts to feel too dry. [13] X Research source"
