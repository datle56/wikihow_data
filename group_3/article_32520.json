      "title": "Raise your jeans so the hem sits on the thinnest part of your ankle.",
      "content": "Raise your jeans so the hem sits on the thinnest part of your ankle. Pull up the jeans from the knees so that the hem finishes at the narrowest part of your ankle. This is usually just above the ankle bone. This is important as it will help you to create a firm tuck that won’t unravel later. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Pull the inside seam of your jeans into a fold.",
      "content": "Pull the inside seam of your jeans into a fold. Use your thumb and index finger to pinch the inside seam of the jeans and pull it away from your ankle. Fold the flap of denim backward vertically so that it sits on top of the denim behind it. Make the fold as tight as possible, without cutting off your circulation. Use your thumb to keep the fold in place. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Fold the bottom seam of the jeans up 0.5 inches (1.3 cm).",
      "content": "Fold the bottom seam of the jeans up 0.5 inches (1.3 cm). Hold the fold in your jeans with one hand and use the other hand to fold up the entire bottom seam of the jeans approximately 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) or a finger width. Try to make the entire fold the same height. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Fold the cuff up over itself.",
      "content": "Fold the cuff up over itself. Apply pressure to the initial fold and cuff with one hand. Use your other hand to fold the cuff up about 1 inch (2.5 cm) or to your desired length. Make sure to fold the entire cuff to the same width. If you find that the cuffs are unraveling, fold the peg up 1 more time. Fold your jeans so that they fall around your ankle bone or slightly above."

    {
      "title": "Remove any wrinkles or twists from the cuff.",
      "content": "Remove any wrinkles or twists from the cuff. Check the pegged jeans for lumps, twists and uneven length. Squeeze the folds to help flatten them out and remove any wrinkles. Pull up any part of the cuff that is longer than the rest of the hem. Use a full-length mirror to check the back of your jeans. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Choose jeans you can pull out 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) from your ankle.",
      "content": "Choose jeans you can pull out 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) from your ankle. The aim of pegging your jeans is to make the cuffs of the jeans slimmer. If your jeans are already tight it will make it difficult to roll the jeans and won’t give the classic pegged look. Choose a pair of jeans where you can fit at least 3 fingers (about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm)) between your ankle and the inside of the jeans. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Avoid choosing baggy jeans.",
      "content": "Avoid choosing baggy jeans. Rather than choosing a loose pair, opt for straight-leg jeans instead. Flared jeans are a popular and striking style but don’t work well for pegging. The contrast of the tight pegging and the wide legs will make the jeans look ballooned. Choose loose skinny jeans or a straight fit jean instead. When baggy jeans are pegged the folds tend to roll out quickly, making them a frustrating option. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Select jeans that fall below the tops off your shoes.",
      "content": "Select jeans that fall below the tops off your shoes. The idea of pegging your jeans is to expose your shoes without showing too much leg skin. Choose a pair of jeans that fall below your ankles. This will give you enough length of denim to make the folds and will avoid your jeans looking like ¾ pants. If your jeans sit at or above your ankle, it is best to wear these as they are and choose a different pair to peg. Avoid choosing jeans that drag on the floor. Jeans that are too long will make your cuffs too thick and will come undone"

    {
      "title": "Choose shoes that sit just below your pegged jeans.",
      "content": "Choose shoes that sit just below your pegged jeans. Select a pair of shoes that either slightly touch or fall under the pegged hems. This will help your outfit look slick and will show your pegged jeans. Runners, sandals, flats, and heels, all look good with pegged jeans. Avoid ankle or knee-high boots. Pegged jeans accentuate your footwear, so take the opportunity to wear your favorites."

    {
      "title": "Wear sockettes or ankle socks with your pegged jeans.",
      "content": "Wear sockettes or ankle socks with your pegged jeans. Choose a pair of socks that don’t show over your shoes. Low ankle socks, sockettes, and shoe-liners are all good options. These allow your pegged jeans and shoes to be the main focus and won’t detract from the minimalistic look."

      "title": "Tuck your shirt in for a clean look.",
      "content": "Tuck your shirt in for a clean look. Tucking your shirt in shows the full silhouette of the jeans and is a flattering look for both men and women. Tuck your shirt in and then slightly pull it up to give a casual and relaxed look. Or, leave it firmly tucked in for a more formal look. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear a belt to accessorize your look. If you feel like adding more of your personal style to the look, wear a belt that expresses your style. A simple leather belt, pearls, or a brightly-colored belt are all fun and striking options. [8] X Research source Draw extra attention to your belt by wearing a brooch on your belt."
