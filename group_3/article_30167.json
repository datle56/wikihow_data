      "content": "Select the right camera for your needs. If you're a beginner, you may already have all you need to record a video! However, there are a few things to take into consideration: Use a webcam for convenience. If you have a laptop with a built-in webcam , you can use it to make a YouTube video. Unlike your smartphone, you don't have to hold your webcam in your hand while recording your video, which is handy if you're making a vlog . However, built-in webcams tend to have poorer quality than many smartphone cameras. Still, a webcam will work if you don't want to purchase a digital camera . Use a smartphone for ease and mobility. Tech video producer Naseem Speach recommends using your Android or iPhone's built-in camera and microphone to film your videos. \"I used to shoot with my Canon, but I definitely should have started out with my phone much sooner,\" he says. Premium smartphone models have amazing built-in cameras and can produce high-quality video. You could purchase a tripod if you want to record yourself doing something, or just hold the phone in your hand while you talk. You can then upload the video to YouTube straight from your phone or transfer the video to your computer first. Use a digital video camera for high-quality filming. Professional YouTubers use high-quality DSLR cameras, which can get expensive. Fortunately, you can also make a YouTube video with a less-expensive digital camera , ranging from under $50 up to $200. Digital video cameras generally make higher-quality videos than webcams and smartphones, and you can typically put them on a tripod so you don't have to hold them in your hand the whole time. Most modern digital video cameras have a removable SD card that can be used to transfer videos to your computer. Double-check to ensure that your selected camcorder has an SD card or can be easily connected to your PC or Mac before purchasing."

      "content": "Get screen recording software if needed. If you want to start a gaming channel on YouTube, make computer tutorials, or just record yourself doing something on your computer, you'll want to use software that records your screen . Software like OBS allows you to record your screen, your webcam or camera, and your voice all at the same time. You can even use it to stream live on YouTube. When recording, be sure that both the audio and video are properly being recorded by first making a test clip and viewing it. If you want to capture or stream lengthy videos from a gaming system, such as a Nintendo Switch or a PS5, you’ll also need a video capture card ."

      "content": "Consider a dedicated microphone. Even though most phones and cameras have built-in microphones, having a dedicated microphone will improve your audio quality, which can make your YouTube videos sound more professional. Good sound quality can make or break a video; to this end, relying on your recording item's built-in microphone may not be ideal. Once you find a reasonably priced microphone, connect it to your computer ."

      "title": "Choose the type of video you want to create.",
      "content": "Choose the type of video you want to create. YouTube hosts videos from millions of users from all around the world, but some types of videos are more popular than others. Before you set up your camera, you should have an idea of the genre or type of video you want to make. Some of the most popular YouTube genres are: Video blogs , or vlogs are regularly-updated series featuring a creator talking about whatever is on their mind, usually for 10 minutes or less. Gaming videos attract a lot of viewers, especially if you cover recent game releases. Tutorials and how-to videos can encompass literally any topic in which you are skilled. Montages are videos filled with images or video clips, set to music. Pet videos are always popular. These are typically recorded with a handheld item, such as a smartphone or camcorder. They often feature the creator's pet doing something funny or endearing. Reviews are video blogs that review a product or service. Being sardonic and funny when reviewing something will get more people to watch. Comedy videos encompass a wide range of styles and approaches. They're best done with friends, and can feature anything from practical jokes to silly dancing to scripted sketches and beyond. Speach encourages new YouTubers to choose and stick to a niche rather than creating a more general channel, as YouTube's algorithm is more friendly to niched-down content.

      "title": "Plan a personal video.",
      "content": "Plan a personal video. Some people might not care about gaining a following and just want to upload a personal video to YouTube to share with people they know. This can be great if you want to share an experience with friends or relatives who can't be there to live it with you. In this case, you'll still want to plan your video ahead to ensure that you're creating a great YouTube video . Plan ahead of time to film events like family picnics, weddings, and birthdays so that you'll have the raw video to edit and upload to YouTube later. You can choose to make the YouTube video private so that only people with the specific URL (web address) of the video can view it. Still, there's no guarantee it won't eventually be seen by third parties. Keep the content of your video clean and in accordance with YouTube's guidelines."

      "title": "Consider making a video from other videos.",
      "content": "Consider making a video from other videos. This practice is especially popular with clips that don't belong to any specific YouTube user, such as clips of old cartoons and TV shows. If you're taking this route, you won't need video recording equipment, but you will need source files in the form of downloadable video clips (you can download YouTube videos for this purpose if need be). These \"remix\" videos often exist in legal limbo. You're unlikely to get in any trouble for making one, but if one of the copyright holders for the original clips in your video requests that YouTube remove it from their site, they will do so immediately. YouTube creator Timothy Linetsky suggests collaborating with other YouTubers to help build your channel and expose your content to a wider audience."

      "content": "Write a script. While optional, doing this before settling on a video genre will help determine the kind of video you wish to record. Occasionally glancing at a script can help you keep on track, give your video more structure (and therefore make it more professional), and will mean you don't forget anything. Fast food & social media expert Wayne Deng recommends making the video as short as possible without sacrificing quality and detail. \"Any unnecessary information will likely make the viewer click away,\" he explains. \"Keep the video straight to the point and only include relevant things in the video.\""
