      "content": "Assess your current studying techniques thoroughly. Sit down and think about how you’ve been studying up until this point. Analyze what has worked and what hasn’t - then ask yourself why. Make a list of things you want to avoid doing in the future (e.g., procrastination) - and don’t do them. Figure out what your motivations for studying are and take advantage of them. This is a good opportunity to learn how to do a S.W.O.T. (Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities Threats) analysis. The SWOT analysis method was designed for businesses, but can easily be adapted to your personal academic situation."

If you’ve been a lazy student up until this point, and you’re now asking for help, some teachers are not going to be impressed. Make sure you approach them sincerely and then actually follow through on their advice. If you ask for their help and then don’t follow it, they’re probably not going to be too thrilled to help you again in the future. Ask your teacher if there are any assignments you can do for extra credit. Ask your teacher if you can hand-in any outstanding assignments, even those past the deadline. Or if you can re-do any assignments you did badly on. Ask for help as soon as you know you're having trouble. Do not wait until the last minute to ask for help, or to ask for things such as extra credit. In most cases it will be too late for you."

[3] X Research source Even if all you need them to do is constantly follow-up with you to make sure you’re doing your work, asking for help is a good idea. Keep in mind that showing this initiative to your parents may help them provide additional support to you in the future. For example, if they see you’re having a lot of trouble with math, they may be able to hire a math tutor to work with you the next semester or during the summer."

Assign specific study goals to yourself everyday, and the times each day that you’ll spend on studying. [4] X Research source Try not to schedule large amounts of time for one topic unless absolutely necessary. Try to study more than one topic per day if possible. [5] X Research source Remember that smaller chunks of daily study time are more effective than a huge cram session or two. If you're in college, you should plan to study 2-3 hours per week for each credit hour you're enrolled. So, if you're in a 3-hour history class, you should plan on studying an additional 6-9 hours per week for that class. If that sounds like a lot, that's because it is -- and it's what it usually takes to get good grades. [6] X Research source Don’t forget to reward yourself for meeting your goals. These rewards just need to be small things to keep you motivated to move forward day-by-day - such as allowing yourself an hour to watch your favourite TV show, or an hour to play a video game. Save the big rewards for when the semester is done!"

You may want to consider re-taking a class over the summer (to increase your grade) or taking a supplemental class to help you prepare for a hard class you have coming up. At the post-secondary level there are additional benefits to taking one or more classes in the summer term: you can reduce your workload in the fall and winter terms, or reduce the total amount of time you spend in college; some summer programs are offered in other countries or at other colleges, giving you a chance to travel; if you’re aiming to take a specific course with a prerequisite, you can get the pre-req out of the way early."

What did you find worked really well for you, and what did you find worked really badly for you? Is there anything you’d like to do differently next time? Think about the study methods you took on that really helped and make sure you build them into your permanent repertoire. Think about what didn’t work and why it didn’t work.

Organize your study materials in a way that makes sense to you and allows you to find things quickly. Have a separate notebook or binder for each class you're taking and label them appropriately. Have pens and highlighters of different colours to signify different things in your notes and textbooks. For example, blue might mean examples, whereas yellow means definitions. Turn your cell phone or tablet off while studying. And if you're not using it, turn the wi-fi off on your computer while studying. Don't give into the temptation to check your email or text messages!

Keep track of your teachers’ contact information and office hours in a centralized location. Each week review where you are in each course and determine if you need to take advantage of your teacher’s office hours, and if you do, schedule it in. When asking for advice, try to avoid saying things like \"What's important in your class?\" or \"What do I need to do to get an A?\" These suggest that you aren't actually invested in the class. Instead, ask questions such as \"What types of questions do your exams usually focus on? I'd like to know how to improve my note-taking\" or \"What advice would you give a student who really wants to do well?\""

Some of this extra help is free, while some has a cost associated with it. If you’re interested in hiring a tutor, ask your teacher for recommendations.

Attending class shows your teachers you’re actually interested in learning. If you need help in the future, they’re usually more willing to help someone who has already shown initiative. If you really want to show initiative, sit in the front of the class. Not only will this make you more visible to your teacher, but the rest of the class will be out-of-sight behind you, hopefully removing any distractions they may cause."

Use a system of shorthand for your note taking if possible. This includes using symbols instead of words (e.g., “&” instead of “and”), and abbreviating words (e.g., “approx.” instead of “approximately”). Make up your own abbreviations if that helps. Don’t worry about your spelling and grammar when taking notes (unless it’s an actual language class teaching spelling and grammar!) - you can correct that later if you need to. Gear your note-taking to the course. Some courses can benefit from highly structured methods such as the Cornell method , while others -- such as those that are very discussion-heavy --will benefit from more free-form notes."

If there are participation grades, teachers aren’t looking for quantity as much as they’re looking for quality. Participation also demonstrates your understanding of the subject matter to the teacher. They may determine, through class participation, that they’ve explained something badly and re-explain. Class participation can often turn into a class debate - a teacher’s dream come true! If you disagree with what a classmate has said, you can say so, but be respectful. Don’t turn the debate into an argument."

Begin homework assignments the same day they were assigned (if not known about in advance) or build the work required for the assignment into your study schedule (if known about in advance). Plan to get your homework done in advance so you can review and revise without pressure.

Check with your teacher or class syllabus before doing outstanding assignments. If the teacher will not accept them, and you’re short on time, it may not be useful to complete them. If the teacher won’t accept late assignments, but you do have the time, use the assignments as practice tests and complete them.

Don't wait until two days before your term ends to ask for extra credit! This suggests that you were lazy all semester and want an easy grade fix. If you're struggling, ask sooner rather than later. There is a never-ending debate in the academic community regarding “extra credit.” One side thinks it’s great, the other side thinks it’s bad. [15] X Research source Each of your teachers is probably on one of these two sides, and has a good reason for being there (such as their own past experience).

[16] X Research source Make sure you’ve perfected one topic before moving onto the next topic, especially if they’re linked. Most textbooks and classes are set up in such a way that each consecutive chapter/lecture builds on the stuff learned in the previous chapter/lecture. If you haven’t learned the previous material, it’ll be much harder to learn the current material. [17] X Trustworthy Source Edutopia Educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation Go to source Use personal or familiar situations to help you understand the material. [18] X Research source Textbooks (and some teachers) tend to use boring examples when explaining concepts and ideas, but that doesn’t mean you have to. For example, if you’re learning about Newton’s First Law of Motion where it states that “an object in motion continues in motion … unless acted upon by an unbalanced force” try to think of examples where this makes sense for you.

      "content": "Read all exam instructions completely before starting the exam and then follow them. For some strange reason, one way students lose points on tests is because they don’t actually read the instructions and do what they say! [19] X Research source For example, have you ever had that situation where a section of a test asks you to choose 4 of the following 6 topics to write an essay about, but you end up writing an essay for ALL 6 topics? This is a clear situation of not reading the instructions, and then losing valuable time doing work you didn’t need to do, possibly at the expense of completing other parts of the test. There is also no reason why you have to do the test in the order it’s written - unless each question builds on the previous one. Look through the entire test first, then start with the easiest questions and work your way to the hardest questions. This will help build your confidence as you write the test. Tests aren’t the only place where you need to follow the instructions precisely. If you’re writing an essay and the teacher asks for double-spaced lines with 12pt Times New Roman font and 1” margins - then DO that. Don’t use single-spaced lines with 10pt Arial font and 1.5” margins!"
