      "title": "Cool your engine for 30 minutes if it was running recently.",
      "content": "Cool your engine for 30 minutes if it was running recently. Always let your engine cool off before you start poking around underneath the hood. If you used your vehicle recently, about 30 minutes should be enough. Without cooling, you risk burning yourself. If you can feel the heat of the engine against your car grill or bumper, talk to a mechanic about overheating ."

      "content": "Engage the hood release from the inside of your vehicle. If your car requires a release to open, locate it within your vehicle. In most cases, it's underneath the dashboard left of the steering column. Pull or press it and it should lift the hood 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) without completely disconnecting it from the latch. [1] X Research source If you can't find the hood release, look at the driver's manual provided by your manufacturer. Either find the physical copy or look on their website for your car model's manual in electronic format. If the hood release doesn't open your hood, the wire is probably broken ."

      "content": "Find the latch from underneath your vehicle if it doesn't have grilles. If you have a mechanic's creeper—a mobile seat that helps you move while lying on your back—use it to roll yourself underneath the vehicle. If not, shimmy underneath on your back directly underneath the hood. At this point, you should be able to see a small hole with a small metal latch hanging down towards you. [2] X Research source Give the ground a quick sweep before going under your car and wear clothes you don't mind getting dirty."

      "content": "Locate the latch through your bumper if your vehicle has large grilles. If your vehicle has a grille with big enough openings, locate the broken latch from the front of your vehicle. Crouch down and look for the small metal latch directly underneath the spot where the front-center of the hood meets the car frame. [3] X Research source If you're having trouble, follow the release cable—it connects to the latch from the driver's side of the car."

      "title": "Remove your vehicle's grille to access the latch if you can't find it.",
      "content": "Remove your vehicle's grille to access the latch if you can't find it. Depending on the vehicle, you might be able to remove the grille without opening the hood. However, this only works for select models—refer to your vehicle's owner's manual or visit your manufacturer's website and locate information on hood removal. If you can access the screws holding your grille in place, you should be able to remove them with a Phillips head screwdriver. [4] X Research source If you can see the latch and access it with a screwdriver, don't bother removing the grille. Unscrew and remove the parking lamps and turn signal lights before attempting to remove the grill."

      "title": "Trip the latch with a screwdriver or long piece of metal.",
      "content": "Trip the latch with a screwdriver or long piece of metal. Reach toward the latch with a metal tool that is long enough to reach the latch—at least 10 inches (25 cm) should do the trick. Insert the metal piece in-between the latch and the metal piece it's hooked onto. Now, trip the latch by pressing it away from the hood. [5] X Research source If you're having trouble, check the direction of the wire running from the latch—this is the direction you need to push the latch. If the hood does not open after tripping the latch, bring your car to a mechanic."

      "title": "Lubricate the latch with a lithium spray lubricant if it's jammed.",
      "content": "Lubricate the latch with a lithium spray lubricant if it's jammed. Purchase a spray lubricant—ideally lithium-based—with a bendable straw at the nozzle at least 8 inches (20 cm) long. Insert it into your grill or from underneath your car and apply it generously to the latch. Often, broken or stuck latches can be remedied with lubrication. [6] X Research source Be sure to wear safety goggles if you apply the lubricant from underneath the car. Never use silicone spray as it can contaminate the oxygen sensor and impair engine performance."

      "title": "Adjust the latch mechanism if it's misaligned.",
      "content": "Adjust the latch mechanism if it's misaligned. In many cases, latches don't work properly because they become misaligned. After locating the latch, loosen the bolts that hold it in place just enough that you can move it. Move it side-to-side so it aligns with the opening in the inner panel of the hood. Now, move the latch up and down until it fits flush between the fenders and the top of the hood while the hood is pressed upward. Finally, tighten the latch bolts. Open and close your hood afterward to ensure it works properly."
