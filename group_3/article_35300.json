If you truly do love this person, then you owe it to them to stick around in the relationship. There may be reasons why they are not ready yet, such as negative previous relationships or being new to dating. On the other hand, if you come to the realization that your significant other just does not feel the same way, then it would be best to end the relationship before experiencing any further heartbreak."
