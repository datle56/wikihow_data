If you aren’t sure what to say, give something like this a shot: “Hey, just so you know, I'm here for you if you need anything. I’ve always got your back” “I hope you know that you are important to me and I care about you.” “Whatever you are going through—good or bad—I'm here if you need me.”"

If you can encourage your friend to open up and share things about themselves, they’ll feel how much you care for them. The next time the two of you are chatting, ask them more questions than you normally do. This will make them feel like you’re making an active effort to learn about them, which is a great way to show you care.

Questions like, “What did you do this weekend?” or, “What have you been up to lately?” are great ways to get them talking."

The next time the two of you are relaxing in private, ask them if they’re doing alright. You can even just shoot them a quick text if that’s how the two of you talk regularly. Even if they’re totally fine, the fact you’re checking in will mean a lot. If they do have a lot on their plate, listen and “let them vent,” Chronister suggests.

[8] X Expert Source Allison Broennimann, PhD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 29 January 2021. Listening to your friend discuss their problems, joys, or ideas is a great way to show that you care about them and what they are going through. Being listened to helps people vent their frustrations, share their feelings, and feel validated and important. When they talk to you, actively internalize what they’re saying. If your friend is telling you about something they’re struggling with, don’t respond by talking about a problem that you’re dealing with. This can make it seem like you’re only talking to them because you want to talk about yourself. Instead, ask them more questions about their experience to help them share their thoughts on feelings, but don’t press them too hard if they don’t want to share. Show you are listening by maintaining eye contact and an interested body posture, such as leaning forward. Every once and awhile reflect or repeat back what your friend has told you to show you are listening and make sure you are hearing correctly."

Something like, “Shout out to my favorite math genius! I’d be failing geometry if it weren’t for you!” is perfectly fine, though. Include a nice photo of the two of you.

The occasional out-of-the-blue gift shows that you were thinking about your friend when they weren’t around. It also shows that you don’t only care about them when you’re supposed to, and that you’re really invested in your friendship. Even if it’s something small, it may mean the world to them. Get them something personal, not just cash or a gift card. When you give it, say, “I saw this and thought of you.” If you’re short on cash, make them a piece of art, or write them a genuine letter explaining what their friendship means to you. Or, get them something the two of you can do together. Concert tickets, seats for the ball game, or a two-player video game are all great options."
