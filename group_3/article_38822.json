Position the foil cutter so it’s resting on the top of the lip and squeeze it to cut the foil that’s covering the cork.

Keep turning until you’re one turn away from the corkscrew being all the way inside of the cork. Then, pull up on the handle of the corkscrew with your fingers until the cork pops out of the bottle. Repeat on all the bottles of wine you’re serving. [2] X Research source If you do not have a corkscrew, you can open the wine bottle using sommelier knife, a screw and pliers, or even a shoe ."

      "content": "Re-cork opened bottles so they stay fresh. Insert the wine-stained side of the cork back into the bottle after you've poured some of the wine into a glass. Store the wines in the fridge when you're not drinking them. The cold temperature will slow down the rate at which the wines go bad. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Decant red wines that are 5 years or older.",
      "content": "Decant red wines that are 5 years or older. After 5 years, bottles of red wine can develop bitter-tasting sediment. Decanting separates the wine from the sediment. After you open the bottle of red wine, slowly pour the wine into a wine decanter. When you get to the last bit of wine in the bottle, carefully observe the inside of the neck of the bottle. When you see sediment start to accumulate on the neck, stop pouring. [4] X Research source Pour your guests wine using the decanter. When the decanter is completely empty, refill it with another bottle of red wine."

      "content": "Serve white wines in small-bowled glasses. The bowl is the part of the glass the wine sits in. Serve light-bodied white wines, like Moscato and Soave, in wine glasses with bowls that are tall and thin. Full-bodied whites, like Viognier, should be served in wine glasses with shorter, rounder bowls. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Serve red wines in large-bowled glasses. The wider opening of the bowls in red wine glasses makes the wine taste smoother. Full-bodied red wines, like Cabernet Sauvignon, should be served in tall, large red wine glasses. Serve low-bodied reds, like Pinot Noir and Gamay, in a shorter glass with a slightly rounder bowl.

After serving your light-bodied whites, like Pinot Grigio and Asti, move on to full-bodied whites, like Chardonnay and Viognier. Then transition into your reds, starting with light-bodied red wines, like Lambrusco, and finishing with full-bodied red wines, like Barolo. Save sweet wines, like Sauternes and Vintage Port, for last. [8] X Research source"

Never fill wine glasses all the way up to the rim (it's OK if the foam comes up to the rim of the glass when you're pouring sparkling wines). Carefully watch the level of wine as you're pouring so you know when to stop. If you’re not sure what 5-6 ounces (148-177 mL) looks like, learn using a measuring cup. Before your guests arrive, practice filling a measuring cup with the right amount of wine and then transferring it to a wine glass. Memorize where the wine comes up to on each kind of wine glass so you know when to stop pouring. [13] X Research source"

Serve rich red wines, like Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz, at a warmer temperature than light red wines, like Pinot Noir and Zinfandel. Rich wines taste smoother when you serve them a little warmer. [14] X Research source If you don’t have a wine cooler, chill the red wine in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before serving. Only chill rich red wines, like Merlot and Rioja, for 15-20 minutes in the fridge since they taste better warmer. If you're chilling wine in the fridge, turn the temperature dial up 1 or 2 notches so the wine doesn't get too cold. Don't forget to turn it back after you're done chilling the wine.

Serve light, zesty white wines, like Chablis and Grenache Blanc, at the lower end of the temperature spectrum — 50 °F (10 °C) or colder — and oak-aged white wines at the higher end. Use a refrigerator to chill white wine if you don’t have a wine cooler. Place the wine in the fridge several hours before serving.
