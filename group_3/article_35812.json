If the chicken was in the fridge, let it sit out on the counter for at least 30 minutes so it comes to room temperature."

Roast the chicken until it reaches 165 °F (74 °C) with an instant-read meat thermometer. Insert the thermometer into the thickest part of the chicken. If your dish doesn't have a lid, cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil."

If you only have part of a rotisserie chicken left or you just want to reheat some of the chicken, tear off the portion you want to use and cut or tear the chicken. [1] X Research source The pieces should be between 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5 cm) in size."

      "content": "Stir in the chicken and cook it for 4 to 5 minutes. Keep stirring the meat as it reheats. Turn off the burner once all of the chicken is completely hot. [3] X Research source Keep in mind that some of the edges may become crispy as the chicken reheats. Because the pieces will be too small to check with a meat thermometer, it's important to heat them until they're steaming hot."
