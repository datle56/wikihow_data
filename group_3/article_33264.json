Your Monopoly Junior game should include: [1] X Research source 1 game board 4 player miniatures 1 die 20 Chance cards 48 player tokens (called “sold signs”) 90 Monopoly banknotes"

      "content": "Allow each player to choose a character and take their sold tokens. Different versions of the game use different tokens, but the 4 default minis on the basic Monopoly Junior game are a black dog, a blue boat, a green car, and an orange cat. Let each player pick their piece. Each player takes their 12 color-coded player tokens with their photos on them (called sold signs). Place all of the minis on the “Go” square. [2] X Research source Each player’s color-coded player tokens are Monopoly Junior’s version of the property card you buy in normal Monopoly. When a player buys a property, they put their token on it. The tokens have photos of their corresponding character on them."

      "content": "Select one player to serve as the banker and give them the money. The banker administers the money in the game. The banker can play if they’d like to so long as they keep the bank money separate from their own cash. [3] X Research source If you’re playing with a child who’s enthusiastic about being the banker, let them do it! This is a fun way for them to practice counting and money management."

      "title": "Ask the banker to distribute the Monopoly money.",
      "content": "Ask the banker to distribute the Monopoly money. Unlike traditional Monopoly, this version of the game only uses $1 bills. The amount of money the banker distributes depends on how many are playing. [4] X Research source For a game with 2 players, everyone gets $20. For a game with 3 players, everyone gets $18. For a game with 4 players, everyone gets $16."

Like typical Monopoly, each Chance card contains instructions. Make sure that all of the Chance cards are facing down so that players won’t be able to see what they are before they draw them.

Once a player purchases a property, have them place one of their player tokens on the space to symbolize they own it. [7] X Research source Unlike traditional Monopoly, there is no choice involved when you land on property. However, if you want to increase the complexity of the game for older players, feel free to auction properties off and give players the choice to buy each square or auction it off. If a player cannot purchase a property they land on, the game ends."

If that player owns all of the properties in that color, pay twice the amount. [8] X Research source For example, if you land on a $2 red property and the same player owns both of the red properties, you’d pay $4."

If you get sent to jail because you land on a square that sends you there or you’re unlucky enough to draw a Chance card that sends you to jail, pick up your piece and put it in the jail square. On your next turn, pay $1 or use a Get Out of Jail free card and then take your turn as normal. [11] X Research source Remember, if a player rolls a number that causes them to land on the jail square, they’re “just visiting” and they don’t have to pay anything. In normal Monopoly, you can try and roll doubles on the two dice for up to 3 turns to try and get out of jail. In Monopoly Junior, you don’t get that option. You still collect rent while you’re in jail."

If multiple players are still in the game, everyone counts their money and the player with the most cash is the winner.

If you prefer, allow players who go bankrupt to pay their fees or rent with their property. Sell your property to the other player (or the bank if it’s a Chance card or open space) for the face value of your property. [14] X Research source If a player cannot pay another player or the bank by selling their properties, then they go completely bankrupt and the game ends."
