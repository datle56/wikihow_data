      "content": "Ask about their dreams in a playful way. Take the conversation in a more flirty direction by saying you hope to dream about your crush. If you’d prefer to be slightly less direct, ask your crush if they plan on dreaming about you, instead. Overall, follow the vibes of the conversation—if your crush seems to be flirting back, try to come up with more romantic things to text them. [1] X Research source For instance, try saying something like: “I hope you have sweet dreams tonight!” Never underestimate the power of a well-placed wink emoji."

      "content": "Countdown the time until you’ll see them next. Make your conversation more romantic by letting your crush know how excited you are to see them. Don’t go overboard with this—if you feel like there’s a mutual romantic connection, saying something like “I can’t wait to see you tomorrow!” is a sweet way to let your crush know that you value them. [2] X Research source For example, try sending something like: “I can’t wait to see you in homeroom tomorrow!” These types of messages can be double-edged swords. While nice in the proper context, messages that go into intense amounts of detail about when you hope to see them next can come off as creepy and unwanted."

      "content": "Impress your crush by saying goodnight in another language. Keep your crush on their toes by saying goodnight to them in a different language, like French or Spanish . Aside from making you sound fancier, texting or saying goodnight in another language might open a new conversation topic in the future. If your crush is bilingual, try saying goodnight to them in their native language! [3] X Research source Try to pick a language that your crush will be able to read phonetically. If you choose a language with a different alphabet, like Russian, your thoughtful message might be viewed with confusion instead."

      "content": "Opt for a corny line to make them laugh. Don’t be afraid to pack a few humor-filled punches when you’re telling your crush goodnight. If it feels like there’s some awkward romantic tension lying between you guys, say something especially silly to lighten the mood. After saying goodnight, close out the conversation by saying something on the flirtier side.

      "content": "Keep it simple by sticking with the classics. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither was your relationship! Texting something as simple as “Goodnight!” or “Have a great night!” can go a long way, especially if you’re not looking to take the conversation to the next level. If you’re planning on seeing your crush soon, try messaging them something like “See you tomorrow!” [5] X Research source Mention if you plan on seeing them in a specific place. For instance, if you both have a class together, say something like: “See you in history!” Try lightening up your message with emojis. A few sleepy emojis can also communicate that you’re getting ready for bed."

      "content": "Text them relaxing videos that they might like. Look on a video sharing website to find content you think your crush would enjoy. If your crush is interested in animals, try sending them a baby animal compilation video, or some other tribute to animals. It’s okay if they aren’t hooked on the video—as is the case with most gifts and messages, it’s the thought that counts. [6] X Research source If you can’t think of anything new and fun to send, you can always resort to sneezing panda videos."

      "content": "Send memes, gifs, or pictures to be relatable in a clever way. Focus on building a connection with your crush before saying anything obviously flirty. Instead, look up funny pictures and gifs that accurately express how you’re feeling. Do an image search or look on a gif website to find a picture that perfectly displays your emotions! [7] X Research source For example, if your crush is talking about getting ready for bed, you can send a gif of a yawning cat in response. If your crush is mentioning how they don’t get enough sleep, send a gif or picture of a person acting surprised."

      "content": "Link them to one of your favorite songs. Give your crush something to fall asleep listening to by sending them a video link to a song you really enjoy. If possible, try to pick a relaxing song that your crush would enjoy listening to in bed. Nevertheless, trust your own judgment and send whatever you think your crush would like, even if it isn’t peaceful or quiet. [8] X Research source Some phones let you send music directly through the messenger app. For example, send a link to a slow-paced EDM song, or a song from a different musical genre that your crush may like."
