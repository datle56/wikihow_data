When you remove the bandaid, the splinter should come out easily. [7] X Research source If the splinter does not come out by itself as you pull off the band aid, try gently squeezing it with tweezers (sterilize tweezers with alcohol before using). If the splinter does not come out the first time, or is still very deep, try repeating the process and leaving the bandaid on longer, up to 24 hours. Rinse the area with soap and water and apply antibiotic ointment after the splinter comes out. You may also cover the area with a bandaid after the splinter has been removed to help with the healing process."
