They're the guiding Life Path Numbers called \"The Earth Guide\" (10), \"Spiritual Guide\" (11/2), \"Master Builder\" (22/4), and \"Master Teacher\" (33/6).

      "content": "Use your birthdate to find if you have a Master number in your life path. Your life path number explains who you are at your core and shows who you’re destined to be. [8] X Research source If a Master number is your life path number, you’re destined for great things. Finding your life path number is super simple; all you need is your full date of birth. If you already have an 11, 22, or 33 in your birth date, you have a Master number life path. If not, Write out your full birthday, then add up each of the digits until you get a single digit or Master number—that’s your life number! [9] X Research source For example, say your birthday is April 21, 1989 (04-24-1989), giving you 4+2+4+1+9+8+9 = 37, then 3+7 = 10, and finally, 1 + 0 = 1. In this case, your life path number is 1. As another example, pretend your birthday is August 3, 1971 (08-3-1971): 8+3+1+9+7+1 = 29, which then gives you 2+9 = 11. You’d stop adding here because you got a Master number, making your life path number 11. If you don’t have a Master number as your life path number, don’t sweat it! Every number has a specific meaning in numerology, and your life path number may be more significant to you than a Master number."
