If you want to get out of poverty and stay out, one of the best things you can do is get the right education and training. Some careers only require a two-year degree, and offer $50,000-60,000 a year. Go to your local community college and see what programs they offer. They should be able to help you find careers in high demand. [1] X Research source Talk to the financial aid office about programs to help you pay tuition.

Sharing the cost of housing can make things much more affordable. [3] X Research source If you have a house, see if you can find a way to lease one of the rooms. Make sure to do a background check on any potential roommates. Be especially thorough if you have children. [4] X Research source Consider moving to a state with a lower cost of living. If it is particularly difficult to find inexpensive housing, you may need to move. Do some research and compare the cost of living in different cities. If you do decide to move, make sure you have a job lined up before setting out. [5] X Research source"

Working two or more jobs is not a permanent solution to overcoming poverty, and may cause more stress than it relieves. [6] X Research source If you don't have access to the internet at your house, use the public library. Make searching for a better full-time job part of your daily routine. If you have a few hours in the morning before you go to work, use that time to search for jobs. [7] X Research source Don't apply to every job you come across. Be selective in your job search and find something that will improve your situation. [8] X Research source Build a LinkedIn account to help you with your job search. Build your profile to attract potential employers. Include a professional photograph and a catchy headline. Fill out as much of the profile as you can. Treat it like an overflow for your resume. If you have a lot of volunteer experience but can't fit it on your resume, include it in your profile. [9] X Research source"

[13] X Research source Getting debt-free should be your top priority. [14] X Research source Credit card debt is arguably the worst kind of debt. Sometimes the interest rates are as high as 25%. Try to pay those back first and, if possible, change to a 0% credit card, which is going to charge you 0% interest for some time. This might help you get debt-free sooner."

Examine your income, your bills, and how you spend any extra money you may have. Make goals and keep track of your spending. The sooner you learn how to budget, the quicker you can reach financial independence. Make a list of your needs and your wants. Needs are things like food, clothing, shelter, and medicine. Wants are things like pets, entertainment, computers, and TV. Some things may be harder to give up than others, but it's important to determine what you can and can't live without. As soon as you pay your debts, try to save enough to cover your expenses for three to six months just to deal with any emergencies."

It may be difficult, and will likely take some financial creativity, but try to start an emergency fund. A good goal for a starting emergency fund is $500. That may seem like a lot of money, but start small. Try to set aside around $10 per paycheck. The best thing you can do to avoid turning to payday lenders is to stick to your budget. If you stick to your budget and you still come up short, don't immediately turn to lenders for help. Try to work out payment arrangements if possible. See if you can delay payment until your next paycheck arrives. However, be cautious when working out late payments. Ask about any fees for extended payments, and don't get behind. Continual late payments can hurt your credit score."

[17] X Research source Rather than shop at a rent-to-own store, wait until you have the money for the item in question.

Healthcare.gov can help you determine if you qualify for a healthcare subsidy. [20] X Research source If you have outstanding medical bills, try to negotiate with the hospital. Review your bills and look for any charges that don't belong. Sometimes errors will slip through the cracks and you may find yourself overcharged.

Depending on how you answer these questions, you may be considering an impulse buy. Don't give in to impulse purchases. Consider waiting 24 hours before making the purchase. If you wake up the next day and your first thought is about buying the item in question, wait a little longer. See how long you can go without the item."
