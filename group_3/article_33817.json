Then, say you’re from a local radio station and tell them they won a big giveaway. Tell them they must answer a riddle to win, and no matter how they answer, you know they’ll lose. [1] X Research source Stick with a nearly impossible question like, “Do cows drink chocolate milk?” or “What came first, the chicken or the egg?” Bonus points if you let them think they got tickets to an anticipated event!"
