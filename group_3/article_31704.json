      "content": "Take the soda out of the freezer as soon as you can. If you forgot about your soda in the freezer, the sooner you take it out, the better. Soda only needs about 15 to 20 minutes to cool down in the freezer, so if it’s been longer than that, don’t wait! [1] X Research source If you accidentally leave sodas in the freezer a lot, consider setting a timer on your phone or computer as a reminder to take them out."

      "content": "Place the soda in the fridge to thaw it for an hour or 2. If you heat up your soda too quickly, it could explode from the rapid change in temperature. Keep your soda in the fridge for 1 to 2 hours so it can thaw out gradually instead of all at once. [2] X Research source You can put your soda on the counter to thaw it out quicker. Just be warned that it may burst!"

      "content": "Open the soda when it’s completely thawed. After 1 to 2 hours, check on your soda to see how it’s doing. If it’s in a clear bottle, try to peer through the plastic to see if the soda is liquid. If there’s a lot of ice left, leave the soda in the fridge for a little bit longer. [3] X Research source If you’re working with a can or an opaque bottle of soda, try swishing the bottle gently side to side. If you can hear liquid soda sloshing around, you’re probably good to go."

      "content": "Twist the cap open slowly over the sink. You don’t want to open your soda over your floor where it could make a sticky mess. Open the cap up slowly and close it up again if the soda starts to fizz or bubble. [4] X Research source Since the soda expanded in the freezer, it may push the liquid up and out of the opening as you twist the cap. It’s important to stand over the sink to catch any drips as they happen!"

      "title": "Open up the cap slowly.",
      "content": "Open up the cap slowly. If your soda is still frozen, there’s probably a lot of pressure built up in the bottle. Hold the bottle over to the sink and twist the cap open slowly. [5] X Research source It’s important to take the cap off before you start cutting to release some of the pressure inside the bottle. Frozen soda can be a delicious slushie. If you want to save your frozen soda, grab a large bowl to collect the slushie contents of your bottle before you keep going. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut the top of the bottle off.",
      "content": "Cut the top of the bottle off. Grab a sharp knife or a box cutter and lay the bottle on its side on a cutting board. Slice through the top of the bottle, just below where it starts to bottleneck upwards, to make a large opening for the soda to come out. [7] X Research source Use caution as you cut through the bottle. If you meet any resistance, slow down. This can be tough to do on your own. If you need help, grab a friend or an adult nearby. Make sure you take the lid off before you start cutting! If you don’t, your soda could explode."

      "title": "Peel the rest of the bottle away.",
      "content": "Peel the rest of the bottle away. Using the scissors or box cutter again, make a small slit in the side of the soda bottle. Hold the bottle over a bowl and use your hands to peel the plastic off the soda. Just let the slushie fall out into the bowl. [8] X Research source Grab a straw and enjoy your delicious slushie."

      "content": "Wipe out your freezer if your soda exploded. Take everything out of the freezer and wipe it off with a wet towel. Grab the shelves and drawers out of the freezer and let them come to room temperature, then wash them with dish soap and water. Make a cleaning solution out of a 1:1 ratio of vinegar and hot water, then spray the inside of your freezer and wipe it down with a paper towel. [9] X Research source Sticky soda can make your freezer really gross. It’s annoying to clean, but it’s better to get it over with sooner rather than later."

Rent a carpet cleaner and wipe the brush over the floor mats and the car seats if they’re made of cloth, then let them dry for about 1 hour. Use a leather cleaner on a microfiber cloth to wipe down any leather interior you have in your car. [10] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If any sticky soda is stuck in the cracks and crevices of your car, use a cotton swab and water to really dig in there and wipe it out. If there’s soda on your windshield, use a glass cleaner and a microfiber towel to gently wipe it off."

      "content": "Blot soda stains off carpet with dishwashing detergent. If your soda exploded inside and got on the carpet, blot up as much of the liquid as you can with a paper towel. Mix 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of dishwasher detergent with 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of white vinegar and 2 cups (470 mL) of warm water. Dip a paper towel into your mixture, then blot the carpet to get the soda out. [11] X Research source Try not to rub or scrub the stain, since that could push the soda further into the fibers of your carpet."
