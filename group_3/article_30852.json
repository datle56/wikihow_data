The business-in-the-front, party-in-the-back style was a symbol of rebellion and nonconformity, especially among white men who played hockey or rock music. It features cropped hair around the face and longer locks in the back, making it super easy to maintain. [1] X Research source How to get the look: Request this style by name and show your barber reference photos. To cut a mullet at home , grow your hair out to 2 inches (5.1 cm) to 6 inches (15 cm) long. Then, cut the front short, texturize the top with wispy layers, and add lots of layers to the longer back section. Styling tips: Spritz sea salt spray onto damp hair, then scrunch your hair to create texture. Mullets look best on second or third-day hair, so wash your hair every 2 to 3 days using dry shampoo to soak up any oil between washes.

For a medium-to-long cut, prep your hair with detangling spray before blow-drying. Celebrity hairstylist Noël Reid-Killings says to “use a round brush” to lift the hair up and away from your forehead while blow-drying your hair from the front. This will help you sculpt the feathery layers. Celebrity references: John Stamos, Mel Gibson, James Spader, and Brad Pitt"

      "title": "The Perm",
      "content": "The Perm The 80s were all about big hair, which included the era of perms. Getting a perm involved wrapping the hair in perm rods after applying a chemical solution to break down the hair’s structure. After rinsing the hair out, a neutralizer was applied to lock the curls in place and preserve the style for months. Modern perm styles aren’t as coiled as they were in the 80s, but they still require chemically treating the hair. How to get the look: Talk to your barber to find the right perm for you and achieve the hair texture you want. Specify whether you want small, tight curls or loose, bouncy waves, and bring in reference photos for guidance. Styling tips: If your hair is damaged, apply a keratin treatment before perming your hair. Avoid wetting your hair for 2 days following a perm, and use a leave-in conditioner in between washes to take care of permed hair .
