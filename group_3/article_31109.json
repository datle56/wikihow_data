      "content": "Obtain a correctly-sized bracket either online or at an electronic retail store. Any major electronic retailer should be able to help you with this purchase if you have questions. Generally, brackets come in a size range. This means you can buy a bracket that fits a range of TVs. For example, you might purchase a bracket that fits 32 to 56 inch (81.3 to 142.2 cm) televisions. Any flatscreen TV within this size range should fit the bracket, unless otherwise stated."

If you have any reservations about laying your plasma TV glass-down on the carpet or floor, check the owner's manual for guidance. Some plasma screen manufacturers recommend working with the flat screen facing upright while attaching the brackets."

The two small brackets will attach to your TV. Remove any screws plugging the holes if necessary. Many TVs manufacturers plug their mounting holes with screws during assembly."

      "title": "Find the wall studs.",
      "content": "Find the wall studs. Mark the centers of the wall studs you will screw into. Wooden wall studs in all modern homes are 1.5\" (3.8 cm) thick. Homes built in the 1920's and earlier are thicker, either 2\" (5.1 cm) or 1 3/4\" (4.4 cm) thick. You must screw every lag screw into a stud because a TV is much too heavy to be supported by drywall or plaster alone. Also, if the stud is wooden (some are metal), you must screw into the center. If you put it in near an edge, the wood could split and the lag screw would have almost no strength. The best way to find the studs is with a stud finder, which you may be able to rent, but they are cheap to buy. Stud finders, especially cheap ones, and especially if the wall is plaster and not drywall, are not accurate enough to guarantee that you find the exact center of a wall stud.Therefore, you need to drill a few 1/8\" (0.32 cm) test holes where the stud finder tells you the stud is. You will know when they hit wood, and this is your only guarantee. Without a stud finder, you can knock on the wall until you find a hard spot, then drill holes to find the exact location of the wall stud. Using the wall bracket as a guide, holding it level with a small level, mark the spots to drill the holes. You may not need a level because very large brackets have a built in level."

      "content": "Place the mounting bracket on the wall and screw in the lag bolts using a socket wrench or plyers. To assure that it will be level, mount it with one lag bolt and check if it is level. Check if any pilot holes should be re-drilled. Cut two holes in your wall if you want to fish the cords through and keep them hidden. Be very care not to cut a cable when cutting into the wall. In the middle of the mounting bracket, cut a square hole. Your mounting bracket should have a square hole designed for this. One foot from the ground, cut another square hole into the drywall. This hole may be smaller than the first hole. Feed your cords into one hole and out the other. To guide the wires, drop a nut with a string tied to it from the top hole and pull it out at the bottom."
