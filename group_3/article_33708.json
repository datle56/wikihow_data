      "content": "Look for a maker’s mark to find out who manufactured your doll. The easiest way to identify an antique doll and find out who made it is to look for a maker’s mark. Maker’s marks are often a series of letters, numbers, a name, a word, or a combination of any of these elements. It’s usually a raised or indented mark that’s somewhere on the doll’s body. [1] X Research source Most makers’ marks are on the back of the doll’s head or neck. However, they’re also placed between the doll’s shoulder blades, the bottom of its feet, or on clothing tags. If the doll has a removable wig, the maker’s mark may appear on the head where the wig covers it. The McKinley Tariff Act of 1890 required that goods imported to the U. S. be marked with the country of origin. If your doll has a country’s name, it was made after 1890. Once you’ve found your mark, find the manufacturer by looking for the design in doll reference books or at DollReference.com ."

      "title": "Figure out when your doll was manufactured.",
      "content": "Figure out when your doll was manufactured. Antique dolls are over 100 years old, and vintage dolls are usually between 60 and 100 years old. In general, the older and rarer a doll is, the more it’s worth. [2] X Research source However, value can change depending on current demand. Sometimes, a particular doll becomes popular with collectors, making it harder to get and driving up the price. Here are a few indications of age for porcelain dolls: Body: The oldest dolls have porcelain or wooden bodies, while later dolls have bodies made of cloth. Eyes: Dolls with eyes that are painted on are typically older than those with glass eyes, which appeared around 1870. Eyes that open and close are generally newer than stationary glass eyes. Hair: Dolls with painted-on hair are older than dolls with rooted hair or wigs. Clothing: Older dolls from the 1800s and early 1900s have clothing made of natural fibers like cotton, wool, and silk. Their shoes and other accessories may be made of real leather. Crazing: Crazing is what fine cracks in the doll’s glaze are called. Crazing indicates a very old doll. [3] X Research source Generally, porcelain dolls from the 1980s and 1990s onward don’t hold as much value as older dolls, unless they commemorate an event or were a very limited edition."

      "content": "Assess your porcelain doll’s condition. A doll’s condition is extremely important when you’re trying to find out how much your doll is worth. [4] X Research source In general, collectors want dolls, clothing, and accessories that are as close to how they looked when they were new. However, less-than-perfect dolls can also be worth more depending on the rarity or demand. If the box the doll originally came in is still present, it add value to the doll. The following terms are used to communicate an antique or vintage doll’s condition: Min t – Like new, perfect, or flawless. Near mint – Only very minor superficial flaws. Otherwise, like new. Very fine – Very good condition with some slight wear to clothing, hair, or facial paint. Fine – Has some slight wear and chipping. Accessories may be missing. Good – Has clearly been played with paint chipping and a missing, but replaceable part. Poor – Tends to be in bad condition and has very little value unless it’s very rare."

      "content": "Find the prices of similar dolls that have recently sold. When pricing any antiques or collectibles , it’s important to do your research and see how much dolls like yours have sold for.

Check upcoming auctions and sales results at Theriaults , an auction house that specializes in dolls and other toys.

      "title": "China Dolls",
      "content": "China Dolls China dolls are some of the oldest and rarest types of porcelain dolls. The head and shoulders, hands, and feet are made of porcelain and attached to a wooden body. The porcelain is glazed, so it’s very glossy. The doll’s hair is sculpted as part of the head and then painted, usually with a center part. However, hairstyles changed over time. [5] X Research source These dolls were mostly produced in Germany from 1836 to 1940. However, reproductions have been made in the U.S. and Japan since the mid-20th century. Dolls with black hair and blue eyes were the most common, though hair was sometimes painted blonde or brown. Later china dolls featured cloth or leather bodies instead of wood. Older dolls very occasionally had porcelain bodies."

      "title": "Bisque Porcelain Dolls",
      "content": "Bisque Porcelain Dolls Bisque porcelain dolls were created in 1860. They were popular from their creation to about 1900. The soft matte texture of the porcelain had a more realistic “skin-like” appearance than the earlier glazed porcelain China dolls. [6] X Research source There were adult fashion dolls, bébé dolls (baby), and character dolls. Toymakers in Germany and France dominated the porcelain doll market until around the time of World War I. French Bisque – French dolls were famous for their elaborate clothing and high fashion styles. French dolls were mostly of adult figures. The most famous doll makers from the 1800s were Bru, Gaultier, Huret, Jumeau, Rohmer, and Simone. Dolls from Albert Marque and Jumeau tend to be the most valuable. German Bisque – The earliest German childlike dolls were called “dolly-faced” and made between 1890 and 1930. The most prolific German makers of antique dolls were Gebrüder Heubach, JDK Kestner, A. Marseille, Kammer & Reinhardt, and Simon & Halbig. [7] X Research source German Parian – Parian dolls were made of pure white porcelain with elegantly painted faces. Parian dolls with pink-tinted faces, sculpted hair, and bonnets began to appear after 1865. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Porcelain dolls became a status symbol during the Victorian Era. Many porcelain dolls depicted fashionable, high-society ladies with lavish clothing. These dolls were much too expensive for anyone but the wealthy to afford, so they began to collect them to show their wealth. An economic boom in the U.S. during the 1800s meant middle-class American families had more money to spend on status symbols like children’s toys. [18] X Research source They copied European elites and bought expensive—and breakable—porcelain dolls for their children to show their newfound wealth. Giving such an expensive and delicate toy to a child showed the world that your family had enough money to repair or replace it. People still collect porcelain dolls for many reasons, including historical value, appreciation for the artistry, or they have an emotional connection to them."

[20] X Research source The box should be large enough to hold the doll, but not so large that it can shift around. If you store antique doll clothing separate from the doll, place it flat with acid-free paper padding the sleeves and bodice. Wear white cotton archival gloves so you don’t get acid from your hands on the doll. Avoid using plastic bins or bags to store your dolls. Plastic can trap moisture and cause mildew to form on your dolls."

[21] X Research source Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth to very gently remove any stubborn stains. Do not rub or you risk removing pigment.
