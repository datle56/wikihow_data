Separate the small pods (4 inches (10 cm) and under) from the large pods (over 4 inches (10 cm)). [1] X Research source Pods that are 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) long are ideal. [2] X Research source Cut the stem right above the cap using garden scissors. If it is too hard to cut, the pods are too old and should be disposed of."

Use them immediately if their ridges and tips turn black. Keep your pods away from raw meat and meat juices to prevent cross-contamination."
