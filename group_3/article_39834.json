      "content": "Sleep with your hair above your head, not under it. Your hair needs to be completely straight for the first 3 days so the treatment sets. Sleep caps, scrunchies, and hair wraps will create creases or waves in your hair, so skip them. Instead, leave your hair down while you sleep. If your hair is folded, it'll create a crease where the fold is. That means you can't use any type of wrap or cap, even if you're not using a ponytail holder."

      "content": "Get a silk or satin pillowcase to prevent creases and frizz. Silk is smooth, so it reduces the friction between your hair and the pillowcase. Look for a pillowcase that's 100% silk or satin to protect your hair. Replace the pillowcases on all of the pillows that you sleep on. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that a cotton pillow case may cause frizz or might ruin your results."

      "content": "Sleep flat on your back so your hair stays straight. When you get into bed, smooth your hair down so that it's straight below your head. Then, position your head carefully on your pillow so that your hair is flat. Sleep on your back for the first 3 days after you get a keratin treatment. If you sleep on your side or stomach, your hair may get creased or frizzy. Try to position pillows or a folded blanket around your body to prevent you from rolling over to your side. This might help you stay on your back."

      "content": "Check your hair after you brush it to make sure it's sleek. While your silk pillowcase will minimize your risk of creases and frizz, they might still happen. Examine your hair in the morning using your bathroom mirror and a handheld mirror. Angle the handheld mirror so you can see the back of your hair. If you notice any creases, dents, or frizz, use your hair straightener to fix them. Make sure your hair is completely straight without any creases or frizz. Even a small dent needs to be smoothed with a hair straightener because it will stay in your hair after the treatment sets."
