      "title": "Be present to ground your energy and focus on positive goals.",
      "content": "Be present to ground your energy and focus on positive goals. Accept yourself for who you are and embrace the current moment to stay present. Focus on what truly matters to you, whether that's your health, family, passions, or friendships. When you meditate on what fulfills you, you'll ground and center yourself so you're receptive to the world and in control of your energy. [1] X Research source When you’re grounded, you’re also more “conscious,” or aware of yourself, so it’s more intuitive and natural for you to direct your energy toward positive goals, like creativity, connection, and self-growth."

      "title": "Pray to the Universe so your energy invites in what you want.",
      "content": "Pray to the Universe so your energy invites in what you want. To manifest anything with your energy, call out to any higher power you believe in. Ask for this sacred force to open your heart so your energy can flow freely and accept the presence of miracles. [2] X Research source \"Dear Universe—I am ready to accept my soulmate and a life full of passion.\" \"God, I pray for wealth so that I may support and provide for my family.\" \"Higher Power, please provide abundance so that I may thrive.\""

      "title": "Visualize your desire to shift your energy and attract positivity.",
      "content": "Visualize your desire to shift your energy and attract positivity. Turn on relaxing music, get in a comfortable position, and close your eyes. Meditate on your most sincere wish—try to play it out in your head like a movie scene. When you imagine that you already have what you want now, your energy flows toward that possibility to bring it to you. [3] X Research source When you visualize , focus on all 5 senses for the most immersive experience. For example, if you want to go on a vacation, imagine what a beachside resort looks like, what the crashing waves sound like, what your comfy loungewear feels like, and what your exquisite brunch smells and tastes like."

      "title": "Use affirmations to ground your energy and feel self-acceptance.",
      "content": "Use affirmations to ground your energy and feel self-acceptance. If you're anxious or nervous, your energy is probably scattered or fragmented. To get back in touch with your inner power and draw your energy back to your center, concentrate on loving yourself . Use affirmations to calm your heart, restore your self-esteem, and regain a sense of control. \"I am worthy of being cherished and valued.\" \"I am creative and enterprising. I'll find the perfect solution.\" \"I am funny and witty. I'm amazing to be around.\" \"I am strong and resilient. I can overcome anything.\""

      "title": "Practice deep breathing to open your energy and accept blessings.",
      "content": "Practice deep breathing to open your energy and accept blessings. If you have a lot of energetic blocks—like pent up anxiety or frustration—then you may be closed off to higher frequencies of energy, like love, gratitude, and miracles. To let go of stuck energy that's keeping you from being present and peaceful, ground and center yourself by breathing deeply . Sometimes, you carry the energy of trauma or negative experiences in your body. When you ground and center, you'll relax your muscles and mind, which helps you release energetic blocks. Add different breathing exercises to your daily practice so you can soothe your body, calm your spirit, and open your heart to the Universe. Listen to guided meditations to focus on positive messages so your blocked energy can start to shift and eventually flow freely."

      "title": "Change limiting belief systems to free up stagnant energy.",
      "content": "Change limiting belief systems to free up stagnant energy. When you have a fixed—unchanging—thought pattern, you develop an energetic block. For example, if you tell yourself, \"I'll never have financial freedom,\" then that becomes the kind of energy you hold onto. In order to manipulate that energetic block so it can flow freely again and attract better circumstances, tell yourself a new story. In the scenario above, start with a simple affirmation like— \"I think positively about money. Money is attracted to me.\" Write it down several times in a journal or say it in front of the mirror. Take inspired action to challenge your limiting belief systems, too. For instance, you might pamper yourself with affordable luxuries to improve your relationship with money."

      "title": "Consider whether you’re forcing anything so you can let go of blocks.",
      "content": "Consider whether you’re forcing anything so you can let go of blocks. When you try to control a situation, such as getting someone to like you, you create a \"forcing current\" of energy. Forcing currents of energy tell others and the Universe that you're unhappy and unsatisfied, which is a lower vibration. To attract people, positive experiences, and miracles, allow life to naturally unfold."

      "title": "Move your body in order to stir up your energy and remove blocks.",
      "content": "Move your body in order to stir up your energy and remove blocks. Your experiences may cause you to physically hold onto stuck energy. For example, you might feel defensive, so you hunch your shoulders and lock up your energy. In this case, roll your shoulders, do some arm swings, and improve your posture—energy will start flowing and attracting the vibration of confidence. [4] X Research source Another way to unleash energy is to laugh. In many spiritual practices, laughter is considered sacred—in fact, it's seen as a type of medicine and a high vibration that can lift the energy of an entire room. When you cry, you also release energy—the tears you shed are restorative and transform pain into catharsis. When you cry, the energy you release has healing properties and allows others to be vulnerable."

      "title": "Practice gratitude to restore any energy that’s been depleted.",
      "content": "Practice gratitude to restore any energy that’s been depleted. If you've spent most of your time ruminating—obsessing—over negative situations, you may be using up all your valuable energy to focus only on disappointing matters. Fortunately, there's a quick fix: say what you're thankful for and you'll begin to concentrate on blessings. When you do, you'll nurture your spirit and train your energy to move toward positivity. [5] X Research source If you’re insecure or anxious because you concentrate on worries or crises, your energy gets depleted—this use of energy ultimately doesn’t serve you or “fill” you up. Even noticing the small things helps: \"I am grateful that I have food in my pantry and a roof over my head. I am so lucky to be healthy and safe.\""

      "title": "Surrender to faith to release your energy and manifest miracles.",
      "content": "Surrender to faith to release your energy and manifest miracles. Whenever there's a time that you feel utterly stuck or don't know what direction to take, simply let go and confess to the Universe that you need help. Just like crying, your vulnerable plea is a way to purge blocked energy. When your energy field is open, a higher power can enter your life and take over. [6] X Research source For example, if you have no idea how to pay all your bills, you might admit to the Universe, \"I don't know how to do this by myself. I'm praying for a miracle.\" Suddenly, you may open your energy field and invite in a client who buys one of your art pieces."

      "title": "Be mindful about your thoughts, which are forms of energy.",
      "content": "Be mindful about your thoughts, which are forms of energy. As soon as you focus on an idea, you manipulate energy. For example, if you're angry or crave revenge, you actually internalize these thoughts, and they become part of you. To make sure you radiate positive energy, concentrate on inspiring concepts, like friendship and excitement. The way your energy shifts toward what you reflect on is known as the “law of attraction.” For example, if you're attracted to the idea of money, your energy shifts toward that vibration, so you’re more likely to pursue opportunities that generate wealth."

      "title": "Reflect on your emotions to see if you need to shift your energy.",
      "content": "Reflect on your emotions to see if you need to shift your energy. If you feel like your energy is scattered, check in with yourself. For instance, you may find out you're nervous but mostly enthusiastic about a new creative project. In this situation, focus on what you love about it and let that energy guide you. However, there might be other cases where you realize you feel overworked. To redirect your energy, carve out time for rest and relaxation to attract peace."

      "title": "Say “yes” or “no” to see how certain choices influence your energy.",
      "content": "Say “yes” or “no” to see how certain choices influence your energy. Some decisions may make your heart sing, like going on a getaway with friends or adopting a pet. If these make you say \"yes\" without resistance, you'll notice energy flowing through you. Other ideas might not sit right, like taking out a loan or taking on a second job. If you feel compelled to say \"no,\" then you might begin to stiffen and feel your energy start to lock up. [7] X Research source If you immediately recognize what doesn't serve you and say \"no\" as soon as possible, then your energy will start flowing again. Simply move on and pursue what does bring you joy. As soon as you say “yes” to ideas, like supportive people or positive situations, you allow your energy to flow openly. Your open energy field invites in exactly what you wish for."

      "title": "Notice how others impact you to see if you need to protect your energy.",
      "content": "Notice how others impact you to see if you need to protect your energy. When you're around people, pay attention to how your body responds to them. Do you feel anxious, nervous, stiff, or guarded? If so, it's a sign these individuals aren't a vibrational match for you. If you take some space from them, you can maintain your energy reserves without spending any of it trying to create a \"wall\" or barrier. [8] X Research source Once you draw a boundary , you create a barrier out of your energy. When you resolve to protect yourself from outside energy, you create your own \"energetic wall\" so it can't reach you. If you want to detach yourself, then you also create an energetic barrier. For example, if you no longer wish to speak to your biological family, you can raise an energetic wall to separate yourself from them. Sometimes, drawing a boundary is a form of self-love. If you create an \"energetic wall\" and move on with your life, you won't deplete your energy. Just make sure not to continue focusing on people or situations that no longer serve you. You can restore your energy by grounding yourself in nature, doing breathing exercises , or meditating . You could also cleanse your aura to help get rid of unwanted energies."
