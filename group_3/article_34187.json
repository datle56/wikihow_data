      "content": "Cut your nails straight across. When you cut your nails at an angle, you create more chances for a sharp edge to dig into your flesh. Use nail clippers that cut in an even, straight line. Hold your clippers upright and keep them parallel to your toe as you cut. Pay special attention to the corners of your toes so that you don’t cut them at an angle.
