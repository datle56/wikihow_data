      "title": "Pick up the bottom of your blinds and roll them halfway up by hand.",
      "content": "Pick up the bottom of your blinds and roll them halfway up by hand. Start rolling by folding up the bottom end of the blinds. Then, continue rolling them layer by layer, applying even tension across the width of the blinds. Stop once you reach the halfway point or when you think you have a good enough start. [1] X Research source Although you can skip this step if your blinds are short, rolling them partially up by hand will help the blinds roll up evenly."

    {
      "title": "Hold the blinds with one hand as you grab the cord.",
      "content": "Hold the blinds with one hand as you grab the cord. The cord is usually located on the right side of the blinds near the top. At this point, it’s important that you don’t let the blinds go, as they aren’t secure. If you don’t hold onto them, they’ll unroll again. [2] X Research source Your blinds may have a fabric or plastic cord that’s used to open and close them. Both types work in the same manner."

    {
      "title": "Lift the bottom loops that cradle the blinds by pulling on the cord.",
      "content": "Lift the bottom loops that cradle the blinds by pulling on the cord. If you partially rolled your blinds by hand, you’ll need to lift the cords that hold the blinds in place, which will still be down where your blinds started. Don’t let go of the rolled blinds until these cords reach the bottom of the roll. Once they do, you can take your hand off of the roll and let the cords pick up from there. [3] X Research source Some cords consist of 2 pieces, with one controlling each side. If yours is made like this, make sure the cords on both sides are equally tight before you move on. If they aren’t, pull the cord that controls the loose side until it’s just as tight as the tight side."

    {
      "title": "Continue pulling the cord until your blinds reach your desired height.",
      "content": "Continue pulling the cord until your blinds reach your desired height. Apply a light to medium tension as you pull the string so that the blinds don’t come up too fast. This will help keep them neat and even as they roll up. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Hold your string straight down and let go if your cord locks in place.",
      "content": "Hold your string straight down and let go if your cord locks in place. Some blinds have an internal mechanism that holds the cord in one spot until you pull on it again. If your blinds have this feature, the cord will stay put automatically when you let go of it, so you don't need to tie off the cord. This is a built-in feature that some blinds have. It works the same way as the cord on mini blinds."

    {
      "title": "Tie off the cord on a hook, if you have one.",
      "content": "Tie off the cord on a hook, if you have one. Some blinds need to be tied on a hook to keep them from unrolling. If your blinds are like this, make several loops around the hook to keep it secure. If you can, tie the cord in a figure 8 pattern for added security. [5] X Research source This hook is sometimes called a \"cleat.\""

      "content": "Grasp the bottom of the blinds at the center. You’ll be able to trigger the spring in the blinds more easily if you’re holding it at the center. If you hold it too much to the left or right, the blinds may only roll up on one side. [6] X Research source Your blinds may get damaged if they roll up on one side but not the other."

      "content": "Guide the blinds as they roll back up. They will roll back up on their own, but it’s best to hold the end of the blinds as this happens. This way you can make sure the blinds don’t roll up too quickly, which can result in damage or uneven blinds. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Let go of the blinds once the end reaches the top or your desired height. If you want them to roll all the way up, you can just let go. However, if you want to stop the blinds partway up, let them roll up to just above where you want them. Then, lower the blinds back toward the window. Finally, tug the blinds down until they're in the right spot and let them go. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Grab the bottom of the blinds with both hands. It’s best to position your hands at about shoulder-width apart. This will allow you to create a more even roll. However, hold your blinds in whatever way is most comfortable to you. [10] X Research source"

Go slowly so you can make sure each layer is even with the last. [11] X Research source It’s up to you how tightly you want to roll up your blinds. You might like the look of tightly rolled blinds, or you might prefer loosely rolled blinds. Either way works."
