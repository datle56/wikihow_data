      "content": "Play with a size 4 soccer ball. A regulation soccer ball is a size 5, which is about 27–28 inches (69–71 cm) in circumference. Futsal is played with a size 4 ball, which has a 25–26 inches (64–66 cm) circumference. The smaller ball is a little heavier and has less bounce, making it a better option for playing indoors."

      "title": "Choose 5 players per team.",
      "content": "Choose 5 players per team. One of the biggest differences between soccer and futsal is that futsal has 5 players per side, while soccer has 11. [1] X Research source Pick one player on each team to act as the goalkeeper. Choose a dedicated attacker for each team. This player, called the pivot, will lead the charge during offensive play. [2] X Research source Select a dedicated defender, known as the last man, who stays back in case the other team gets the ball. [3] X Research source The remaining two players should play in the midfield and are known as the wingers."

      "title": "Set a timer for 20 minutes.",
      "content": "Set a timer for 20 minutes. Futsal is made up of 2 halves, each of which is 20 minutes long, as opposed to the 45-minute halves in soccer. Another difference is that in soccer the clock continues to run, while in futsal the clock is stopped if the ball is not in play. If there is a tie at the end of the game, more time can be added to the clock. The first team to score in overtime wins. For casual games, you can omit the timer and end the match when the first team scores."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do not touch the ball with your hands or arms.",
      "content": "Do not touch the ball with your hands or arms. Just like in soccer, futsal players can not use their hands at all. However, you can use any other part of your body to pass or shoot the ball."
    },
    {
      "title": "Allow each team 1 time-out per half.",
      "content": "Allow each team 1 time-out per half. No time-outs are allowed in soccer, but in futsal, each time gets 1 for each half. If a team does not use their time-out during the first half, it can not be carried over into the second half."
    },
    {
      "title": "Kick the ball into play if it goes out of bounds.",
      "content": "Kick the ball into play if it goes out of bounds. In soccer, you throw the ball back into play, but in futsal, the ball is kicked in. [4] X Research source A ball that touches the ceiling is considered out of bounds. You cannot kick a ball from out of bounds directly into the goal and score. However, once you pass the ball to another player, it is in play as usual."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make use of unlimited substitutes.",
      "content": "Make use of unlimited substitutes. In soccer, you are only allowed 3 substitutions. In futsal, however, you can have as many substitutions as you like, as long as they’re made in the substitution zone. The substitution zone is the area directly in front of each team's bench. Since futsal is such a fast-paced, aggressive game, use your substitutes strategically to relieve tired players."

      "title": "Send in substitution for a sent-off player after 2 minutes.",
      "content": "Send in substitution for a sent-off player after 2 minutes. In soccer, there is no substitution for a player who has been sent off. However, in futsal, you can substitute for that player after 2 minutes or after the other team has scored."

      "title": "Play as wide as possible to leave the field open for passes.",
      "content": "Play as wide as possible to leave the field open for passes. Since futsal is played on a smaller pitch, the wingers should try to play out towards the sidelines to allow more space to play in. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Move into the space left open by a teammate.",
      "content": "Move into the space left open by a teammate. It can be hard to find a place to move to, but when one of your teammates moves, you can move where they were just standing. [6] X Research source You should never stay in one place for more than 3 minutes at a time."

      "title": "Move towards defenders if you have the ball and away if you do not.",
      "content": "Move towards defenders if you have the ball and away if you do not. If you have the ball, moving towards the defender will help you push past them. If you don’t have the ball, moving away from the defenders will help open the field more. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pass the ball generously.",
      "content": "Pass the ball generously. Futsal is a fast-paced, high-energy game. The more you pass the ball, the more chances you’ll have of scoring a goal. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Expect to pass the ball at least 5 times before taking a shot.",
      "content": "Expect to pass the ball at least 5 times before taking a shot. The smaller field means the defense can easily organize to block your shots. The offensive team usually needs to pass the ball about 5 times to break down the defense’s organization. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Fight to steal the ball.",
      "content": "Fight to steal the ball. Futsal is often played more aggressively than soccer. If you’re playing defense, keep your eye on the ball and always be looking for an opportunity to steal it away from the other team if the attacker loses control. [10] X Research source You may not hit, kick, push, trip, hold, or charge at an opponent, or the other team will be awarded a direct free kick. Sliding tackles are also not allowed. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep your knees bent and stay on your toes.",
      "content": "Keep your knees bent and stay on your toes. In futsal, you can never rest. By staying crouched forward and resting your weight on your toes instead of your heels, you will be in a better position to move quickly and defend the ball. [12] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Stay on top of the player with the ball.",
      "content": "Stay on top of the player with the ball. Your goal should be to put enough pressure on the attacker that they lose focus and have a hard time thinking of their next move. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Defend the ball from behind. All of the defending players should be behind the ball. This will create a wall that the offense will have trouble penetrating through. [14] X Research source"
