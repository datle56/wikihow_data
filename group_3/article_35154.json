      "content": "Gauge the green’s flatness to determine how to putt the ball to the hole. Reading a green is about anticipating how your golf ball will move from your putter to the hole. No green is perfectly flat, so you always need to take a close look at the slope to do this. Any hills or divots will also change the speed of your ball and, sometimes, its trajectory. You can’t always putt along the flattest part of the green. Most times, you need to hit the ball along the green’s slope in order to curve the ball towards the hole. The route your ball takes from the putter to the green is called a line. Always take time to read the green’s slope before determining your line."

      "title": "Stand behind the hole to determine the slope around it.",
      "content": "Stand behind the hole to determine the slope around it. The read you get while behind the hole is often the most important one. Crouch down if you need to do so in order to get a closer look. Then, look back up towards your ball. Note how the green looks from this perspective, paying attention in particular to how the slope changes a few steps from the hole. [1] X Research source To visualize the read, imagine pouring water into the hole. Ask yourself which way the water would spill out if it were to overflow. You expect the water to spill out towards the lower end of a slope. [2] X Expert Source Michael Metz Golf Instructor Expert Interview. 24 March 2022. The last stretch of green before the hole has the most impact on your ball. The ball rolls at such a slow speed that the green’s slope has more of a pull on it."

      "content": "Walk along the lower side of the hole as you return to your ball. [3] X Expert Source Michael Metz Golf Instructor Expert Interview. 24 March 2022. Once you have identified which part of the green is lowest, you know which way your ball will roll after you hit it. Stroll back to your ball, taking plenty of time to examine how the green changes. Any subtle changes, such as slope increases, have an effect on how your ball moves. [4] X Research source If you are uncertain of a particular spot you need to hit through, crouch! Get a close look at the grass. Note any uneven spots that can drag your ball away from the hole."

      "title": "Check the perspective around the ball to improve your read.",
      "content": "Check the perspective around the ball to improve your read. Get multiple reads until you have a good feel for the green. Try walking to the higher side of the green and imagining how you want to hit the ball. If you still aren’t sure, walk back to the midpoint between the ball and hole. [5] X Research source You should have a pretty good idea of how the ball will move on the green. Keep looking at the green from different angles until you feel confident about your read. When you’re standing between the ball and cup, take a few practice swings until you feel comfortable with the read."

      "title": "Stand over the ball to analyze the ground around it.",
      "content": "Stand over the ball to analyze the ground around it. Return to your ball, taking care to avoid any penalties from disturbing it. Look down and notice if the ball is higher or lower than your feet. This should give you a little extra information about how the ball will behave. Fine-tune your approach to compensate for the slope near your ball. For example, if your right foot is higher than the bottom of the ball, the ball will roll towards your left foot. You can adjust your stroke by hitting the ball towards your right foot."

      "content": "Squat behind the ball to finalize your read. Complete your read with a worm’s-eye view of the ball’s path to the hole. After all, no one can be more familiar with the intricacies of a green than someone who sees it up close. Examine the ball’s path to the green to make any final adjustments to your approach. [6] X Research source To visualize the ball’s path, imagine what it will do if you hit it straight at the hole. From analyzing the green from so many angles, you should be able to figure out where the ball would go."

      "title": "Take your time when reading greens.",
      "content": "Take your time when reading greens. Getting a good read can seem like a slow process, especially when you’re starting out. However, rushing is a fast pass to a 2-putt or even a dreaded 3-putt. Wait until you feel confident with your read and comfortable taking the putt. You may feel rushed when other golfers are waiting for you. Remember to tune this out and let the golf course be a peaceful place to enjoy hitting a small, dimpled ball. Once you get used to reading greens, you can often do it within 30 to 60 seconds, but don’t despair if you need extra time."

      "title": "Ask someone else for a second opinion if possible.",
      "content": "Ask someone else for a second opinion if possible. Even the best professional golfers turn to their caddies from time to time. Get the opinion of a caddie, friend, partner, or teacher. They should go through a similar process as you, studying the green from different angles before offering their advice. [7] X Research source In some circumstances, such as during a competitive round, you may not get a chance to ask anyone unless you have a caddie. Take extra time to get comfortable with your read. Remember that an opinion is nothing more than an opinion. If you still think you’re right, stick with your initial read."

      "title": "Avoid overthinking your read.",
      "content": "Avoid overthinking your read. While you should take as much time as you need to read a green, you shouldn’t ever doubt your read. Having a clear, confident image of the ball’s trajectory is important when hitting it. If you have any doubt, you may end up altering your swing and getting yourself into trouble with a poor putt. [8] X Research source Stick to your instincts. Your first read is usually the best, unless you have good evidence that your read was wrong."

      "title": "Envision a line tracing how the ball will roll to the hole.",
      "content": "Envision a line tracing how the ball will roll to the hole. Use this line to calculate how the slope of the green will affect the ball’s movement after you hit it. The line should move towards the higher side of the green, then head to the hole where you think the ball will break back towards the hole. Seeing the line can help you hit the ball with confidence. Imagining a clear line can take some practice. At first, you may not be able to hit the ball exactly along your line. Master your putting technique as you get more confident reading greens."

      "title": "Adjust your aim according to the slope.",
      "content": "Adjust your aim according to the slope. Once you have read the green, stand near the ball and imagine where you will hit it. The slope is the most integral influence on the ball's movement. You will need to hit the ball towards the slope so it rolls back down towards the hole. Position yourself to hit the ball in this direction. [9] X Research source For instance, if the green slopes down to the right, aim to the left to let the ball roll downhill towards the cup."

      "title": "Hit the ball harder for high-grain grasses.",
      "content": "Hit the ball harder for high-grain grasses. Bermuda grass is known to play slower than regular grass, which means you need to hit the ball harder to get it to the cup. Bermuda grass often has a stronger grain than regular grass. To see the grain, look at the tips of the grass blades and notice which way they are pointing. If the blades point towards your ball, they will resist it and slow down its movement. [10] X Research source With slower greens, you may wish to get a second read to make sure your approach is right."

    {
      "title": "Putt softer on fast or bumpy greens.",
      "content": "Putt softer on fast or bumpy greens. If you notice that the green looks uneven, you probably need to hit the ball a little lighter than usual in order to avoid overshooting the hole. You may notice bumps or other rough patches when you crouch down to analyze the green closely. Fast greens are another problem that require you to slow your ball. [11] X Research source To know if a green is fast, watch how others hit their balls. You will also know by putting on greens at other holes on the course. On fast greens, the ball faces less resistance than usual and rolls faster."

      "title": "Take a few practice strokes beside the ball.",
      "content": "Take a few practice strokes beside the ball. Make practice strokes a part of the routine you go through before taking any shot. It gives you a final chance to look from your ball to the hole. Picture the ball rolling along the line you chose. Then, loosen up before taking your actual shot."

      "title": "Hit the ball firmly towards the hole.",
      "content": "Hit the ball firmly towards the hole. Shake out your arms to loosen yourself up if you need to. Keep a firm grip on your putter, take a deep breath, and hit cleanly through the ball. Avoid stopping your swing short, or else your ball will end up short of the hole. Trust in your read and hit well to sink that ball! [12] X Research source Aim your club towards your target, which is where you want to hit the ball. The target is the part of the green that will cause the ball to roll down into the hole."
