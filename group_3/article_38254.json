      "content": "Say gamsahamnida in most formal settings. This is the most common way to say “Thank you” in Korean. It’s a very polite and formal way of expressing thanks, and you use it when speaking with people who are older than you, have a higher rank than you, or with people you aren’t that close with. This is the best expression to use in formal situations like when you’re speaking with your boss or teacher, or giving a presentation. [1] X Research source Pronunciation: gahm-sah-hahm-nee-dah Hangeul: 감사합니다 An equally polite but slightly less formal way to say “Thank you” is to say gamsahaeyo (감사해요 / gahm-sah-hae-yoh). This is good to use with people you’re close to who are older than you. Say daedanhee gamsahamnida (대단히 감사합니다 / dae-dan-hee gahm-sah-hahm-nee-dah) to say, “Thank you very much.”"

      "content": "Use gomapseumnida as an alternative to gamsahamnida . The phrase gomapseumnida is interchangeable with gamsahamnida , and you use it in the exact same situations. For example, use gomapseumnida when talking to your teacher, boss, colleagues, or strangers you meet throughout the day. [2] X Research source Hangeul: 고맙습니다 Pronunciation: go-mahp-seum-nee-dah If you're talking to friends with whom you'd normally speak more informally, the politeness of this phrase can communicate more sincere gratitude. You might use it, for example, when thanking a friend for going out of their way to help you with something serious or important. A less formal but equally polite version of this phrase is gomawoyo (고마워요 / go-mah-woh-yoh). This is also perfectly acceptable to use with people who are older than you who you’re close with."

      "content": "Say aniyo gwaenchanseumnida to say “No thank you.” If someone offers you something that you don't want, this phrase allows you to turn down their offer but still remain polite. This phrase is best to use in formal situations, such as if you’re in a meeting, talking with someone much older than you, or speaking to someone like your boss or teacher. [3] X Research source Hangeul: 아니요 괜찮습니다 Pronunciation: ah-nee-yoh gwaen-chahn-seum-nee-dah To refuse an offer from someone familiar to you, but with whom you should still be polite, such as an older relative or another adult you’re close with, you can instead say aniyo gwaenchanayo (아니요 괜찮아요 / ah-nee-yoh gwaen-chahn-ah-yoh)."

      "content": "Say sugohashyeoseumnida to thank someone for their effort. This is a great phrase to use when thanking someone for a favor they did for you or simply as a way to recognize their hard work and effort. For example, it’s common to say this to colleagues at the end of the work day. However, avoid using this phrase with your superiors or elders since it can sound like you’re talking down to them. [4] X Research source Hangeul: 수고하셨습니다 Pronunciation: soo-go-hah-shyeo-seum-nee-dah This phrase is also good to use when you finish a task or project with another person or a group of people. Use the slightly less formal sugohaesseoyo (수고했어요 / soo-go-hae-sseo-yoh) when talking to people you’re close with in a formal setting, such as older colleagues at work you’re friends with."

This phrase is similar to sugohashyeoseumnida , but it’s more often used when you’re thanking someone for doing something particularly hard. The phrase can be literally translated as, “You’ve had a difficult time.” This is also a good phrase to use in formal situations and is more appropriate to use with superiors than sugohashyeoseumnida . [5] X Research source Hangeul: 고생많으셨습니다 Pronunciation: go-saeng-mahn-eu-shyeo-seum-nee-dah This phrase is also appropriate to use when thanking someone for doing a task they don’t normally do. For example, if you asked a colleague to run an errand they’ve never done before, you would say gosaengmaneushyeoseumnida to thank them. Use the slightly less formal phrase gosaengmanasseoyo (고생많았어요 / go-saeng-mahn-ah-sseo-yoh) to thank people you’re close with who are older than you."

It literally means “I’ll eat well,” and you use this phrase with friends, family, colleagues, and acquaintances alike. Also, this phrase isn’t restricted to only when someone cooks for you. You also use it when someone buys you a meal. [6] X Research source Hangeul: 잘 먹겠습니다 Pronunciation: jal meok-gghess-seum-nee-dah When you’ve finished eating, say jal meogeosseumnida (잘 먹었습니다 / jal meog-eos-seum-nee-dah) to thank them once again for the meal.

This phrase is very informal and is considered appropriate only if you're talking to close friends or family members around your age or younger than you. Unless they’re small children, avoid using this phrase with anyone you don't know, even if they're considerably younger than you. [7] X Research source Hangeul: 고마워 Pronunciation: go-mah-woh Casual Korean is never used between adults who are strangers, even if there’s a significant age gap between them. If the person is older than you, but the situation is still informal, such as if you’re hanging out a cafe together, say gomawoyo (고마워요 / go-mah-woh-yoh) instead. Add jeongmal (정말 / jeong-mahl) or jinjja (진짜 / jeen-jjah) before gomawo to express a deeper thanks. Jeongmal gomawo and jinjja gomawo translate as, “Thank you so much.”"

[10] X Research source Hangeul: 아니에요 Pronunciation: ah-nee-ae-yo If you need to be more formal, such as if you're in a position of authority or speaking at a business meeting, use animnida (아닙니다 / ah-neem-nee-dah)."
