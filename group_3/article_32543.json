This does not need to be stated out loud; just thinking it to yourself is fine.

      "content": "Go to a private area to perform the ritual, if you can. It’s considered sinful in Islam to expose the lower half of your body to other people. The easiest way to do this is to simply perform the ritual in your private bathroom with the door closed and locked.

      "content": "Find a source of clean water you can use. In addition to an ordinary shower or bath, this source can also include rain, well, spring, sea, river snowmelt, or pond water. However, avoid using impure water or water that has already been used for something else. [3] X Research source Note that discolored water or water that may contain bodily fluids from animals or humans cannot be used for the ghusl ritual. Make sure to use safe water to perform this ritual, especially if you’re in an area where the sanitation of the local water supply is in question. Use clean earth and rub it over your face and hands if you are traveling and can’t find a source of clean water. This is known as tayammum . Afterwards, perform ghusl with water as soon as you find a water source."

This means \"In the name of Allah, the most gracious, the most merciful.\""

It should be performed in detail with the intention in your heart to become clean. Note that there isn’t scholarly consensus regarding the order in which the ghusl is performed. While most scholars argue that the right side of the body should be washed first, some also claim that the entire body should be washed after the head and face."

If you’ve had sexual intercourse without ejaculation, you will also need to perform ghusl in this instance."
