[5] X Research source An MRI is a large tube with holes on either end. You'll be placed on a moveable table that slides into the tube while a technologist monitors you from another room. Magnetic fields and radio waves provide an internal reading of your body, used to detect things like brain tumors or brain cancer, chronic conditions, and other abnormalities. The procedure, however, is painless as you do not feel the magnetic fields. The MRI machine makes a lot of noise while the procedure is taking place. Many patients opt to bring earplugs and listen to music or books on tape during the process. Exams vary in length, but some can be quite long. It occasionally takes up to an hour for an exam to be completed."
