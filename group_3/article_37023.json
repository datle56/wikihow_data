If your stripping is worn, cracked, or loose to the point that it doesn’t properly seal the gap under your door, it may be time to replace it. [1] X Research source Some thresholds (the wood or metal section underneath the door) are adjustable. [2] X Research source If your threshold has screws, simply unscrew them to adjust it to the proper height and close large gaps under your door. [3] X Research source"

If the nails or screws are still in good shape, save them to use later. Then, pry the stripping off with a putty knife or flat-head screwdriver. [6] X Research source The stripping may also be attached with staples, which can be removed either with a staple remover or a flat-head screwdriver.

      "title": "Measure the width of the door you will install stripping on.",
      "content": "Measure the width of the door you will install stripping on. If multiple doors need new stripping, take the measurements for all of them. You can do this by using a tape measure across the width of the bottom of the door. Write down your measurements and take them with you when choosing a replacement. Most modern doors are 32 to 36 in (81 to 91 cm) wide, so most stripping is about that size or longer. However, your door may be narrower depending on its age. [8] X Research source If you’re buying a different type of stripping than you had before, measure the height of the gap under your door. Remember to measure the door itself, not the width of the doorway."

      "content": "Use the same type of stripping you had if it’s worked well. The best way to know if the stripping you buy will fit is to use the kind you already have. Take the old stripping to the store to match it or write down the brand and style if you know it. If your old stripping was not effective or to your liking, however, try something new. If your old strip has spines that slip underneath the door, try to find a similar strip that will slip into the same holes. [9] X Research source If you're replacing weather stripping on an indoor door, handyman Lui Colmenares says you can use “a door draft stopper” instead. These “prevent the wind from coming in the doors” and are “mostly applicable to… apartments.” [10] X Expert Source Lui Colmenares Licensed Contractor Expert Interview. 18 August 2020."
