Vaginal burning is commonly caused by infections, irritation from a tampon or douching, using vaginal hygiene products, diabetes, urinary tract infections, and by normal changes in hormonal levels. Determine if your vaginal burning may be from tampon usage, a recent douching, or use of other vaginal hygiene products. [10] X Research source If you think the cause may be medical, the specific cause can be determined by a pelvic exam, microscopic examination of any vaginal discharge and vaginal swabs, taking a culture of vaginal organisms to determine the cause of an infection, or taking a Pap smear.

[19] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Never douche (clean inside your vagina). Your vagina contains both beneficial and harmful bacteria, carefully balanced to create an ideal, acidic environment. When you douche, this balance is disrupted and can lead to an overgrowth of the bad bacteria. This can lead to a yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis and can push an infection deeper into your body where it can cause more harm.

[22] X Trustworthy Source US Office on Women's Health U.S. government agency providing resources for women's health Go to source Just using warm water is enough to clean your vagina. After using the toilet, always wipe yourself from front to back. This prevents bacteria from fecal matter from getting in your vagina.
