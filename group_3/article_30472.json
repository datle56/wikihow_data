In order to help you try to narrow down what the underlying causes of your headaches may be, you can keep a headache journal. You should write in your journal every time you experience a headache, and track the following items: [4] X Research source When the headache occurred. Where the pain was on your head, face, and/or neck. The intensity of the headache. You could use a personal rating scale from one to ten where you’ve defined each level based on your personal experience. What activities you were involved in when the headache started, including where you were. A note on how well you slept the night before you experienced the headache. A note on what you ate, drank, heard, or smelled in the 24 hours leading up to the headache. A note on how you were feeling before the headache started. Any other points that you may find useful."

You can either rearrange your office furniture on your own, or employ a specialized company to do it for you.

It should be directly in front of you, a smidgen below eye level. If your monitor’s stand won’t allow you to move it to the proper level, use books, boxes, a short shelf, or whatever else you have around that can support the monitor. You should not have to reach far to access your keyboard and mouse. You should be able to comfortably rest your arms on your chair’s armrests while your hands touch both the keyboard and the mouse. When you sit in your office chair, no part of your body should have to reach anywhere in order to sit in a relaxed position. Your legs should be at 90-degree angles and your feet should be flat on the ground. You arms should be at 90-degree angles with your arms or wrists being able to rest on either the armrests or desk. You should be able to lean back comfortably, with proper lumbar support. You should never sit forward on your chair with your feel on the castors! In fact, it’s best if your chair isn’t able to move around on wheels. You should never hold a phone between your shoulder and ear.
