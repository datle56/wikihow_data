      "content": "He's endlessly curious about you, and wants to know what you're up to. Another sign that shows how much he loves you is his eagerness to hear all about how you’re doing and what’s going on in your life. When he asks “How was your day?” it’s an open invitation. He wants you to tell him everything, from the best parts of your day to the worst. He’ll listen to every single detail with rapt attention, and that’s how you know he’s fallen hard for you. [2] X Research source If he’s showing genuine interest in your life and how you’re doing, don’t be afraid to open up to him .

      "content": "He really cares about your feeling, so he makes an effort. Maybe you told him you had a big presentation coming up and were nervous. Or maybe you off-handedly mentioned that you’re trying a new fitness regime. Whatever it is, he’ll be sure to ask you how it went and be ready to cheer you up, hype you up, or do anything else you may need. Reciprocate the action to show that you love and care about him as well. Give him little reminders about important appointments or events he has coming up. Or send a small message during the day to remind him to eat well and stay hydrated."

And oftentimes he’ll use this information to do sweet things for you, making them all the more meaningful since they come from a place of deep understanding and love. Maybe one day he makes your favorite meal for you because he knows you eat it when you need comfort. Or maybe he brings home a bouquet of your favorite flowers in your favorite color.

If he loves you deeply, he’s willing to make changes to his own routine so that you always feel comfortable. For example, maybe he’ll start leaving his shoes by the door or start doing the dishes before leaving for work because he knows you prefer that. He might even do things that aren’t as convenient for him, but still won’t ask for anything in return. Maybe he’ll drive a little farther than usual to pick you up from work, or spend a little more money than he normally would to buy the type of laundry detergent you like."

For example, when he thinks about future living situations, he might look at locations that are not only convenient for him, but you as well. Even if you can’t afford a vacation at the moment, he’s ready to make plans for maybe a year from now and start saving .

[9] X Research source One way to let him know you’re missing him is to send a heartfelt \"I miss you\" message .
