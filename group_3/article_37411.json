Did it cause more problems? Would you feel okay just moving on? Take as much time as you need. If you take a long time, start your response with, “I’m sorry I didn’t respond to this earlier, I’ve had a lot on my mind.” You might also consider letting them know off the bat if you think you'll need time before responding, just so they know you're not ignoring the text: \"I need some time to think but will reply in full later.\""

It doesn’t sound like you’re really taking responsibility for what happened.” Or, “Thanks for apologizing, but I’m still really upset and I’m not ready to forgive you yet.
