      "content": "Blend all of your marinade ingredients to get a thick liquid. It's hard for the flavor of chunky ingredients to penetrate meat, so it's important to blend them into a liquid marinade. If you don't have a blender, put all of the ingredients for your marinade into a food processor and combine them until they're smooth. [5] X Research source If your marinade recipe only calls for liquid ingredients and dry seasonings, feel free to skip the blender. Put all of the ingredients into a jar with a tight-fitting lid and shake until the marinade is combined."

      "content": "Customize your marinade if you want to adjust the flavors. The beauty of marinades is that you can substitute many ingredients as long as they serve the same purpose. For instance, if you don't want to use lemon juice, choose another acidic ingredient like vinegar or lime juice. Here are some categories of marinade ingredients that are easy to swap for one another: [6] X Research source Acidic ingredients: citrus juice of any kind (lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange), vinegar (white wine, red wine, apple cider, balsamic) Oils: olive oil, grapeseed oil, toasted sesame oil, avocado oil Sweeteners: brown sugar, molasses, maple syrup, honey, jam, ketchup, soda Seasonings: herb mixes, miso paste, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, ginger, shallots"

If you want to get a little prep work out of the way but you're not ready to marinate the chicken, you can make the marinade up to 1 week in advance. [7] X Research source If you want to baste the meat with marinade as it cooks, set aside a small bowl to use during cooking. For long-term storage, put the marinade into a freezer-safe container and freeze it for up to 3 months. Don't forget to label it or you may not remember what you're looking at!"

      "content": "Poke the chicken with a fork so it absorbs the marinade. To help the marinade penetrate deeper into the meat, take a fork and poke the surface of the meat. The same marinades taste great with chicken breasts, thighs, legs, wings, or an entire bird. If your chicken still has the skin, there's no need to peel it. [8] X Research source If you're using chicken pieces, decide if you want to use bone-in pieces or boneless pieces—keep in mind that boneless pieces cook faster than bone-in or whole chicken."

      "content": "Place the raw chicken and marinade in a sealable bag. You can also use a food storage container that's large enough to hold all of your chicken. Put the chicken and marinade into your bag or container and turn the chicken until it's coated in the marinade. Then, seal the bag or cover the container. [9] X Research source Don't marinate chicken in a metal container or the metal will react with the acidic ingredients and create unpleasant flavors. Instead, stick with a ceramic or glass container."

      "content": "Marinate the chicken in the fridge for up to 24 hours. The longer the chicken marinates, the more flavor it will absorb. However, if you marinate the meat for more than 1 day, the acidic ingredients will break down the meat proteins which can make the chicken texture too soft or mushy. [10] X Research source If you're short on time, don't worry! Even 1 hour of marinating will give the chicken flavor. If you have a lot of acidic ingredients in the marinade or you're marinating boneless-skinless or thin pieces of chicken, go with a shorter marinating time. Always marinate chicken in the refrigerator instead of setting it out on the counter where bacteria can grow. [11] X Research source"

Then, take the chicken out of the marinade and set it on a platter. Use paper towels to pat the chicken dry. This also prevents excess marinade from burning. [12] X Research source If you want to use the leftover marinade in your bag, pour it into a saucepan and bring it to a boil.

Preheat the oven to 400 °F (204 °C), put the whole chicken into a baking dish, and roast it until it reaches 165 °F (74 °C) with an instant-read meat thermometer—this takes around 1 hour for a whole chicken.

Cover the grill and cook the chicken, turning the pieces occasionally, and taking them off once they reach 165 °F (74 °C) with an instant-read meat thermometer. [15] X Research source If you'd like to baste the meat during the last few minutes, use reserved marinade that you didn't marinate the chicken. Don't baste the meat with marinade that raw chicken came into contact with. If you're cooking boneless chicken pieces, they'll cook faster, so start checking them after 8 to 12 minutes. Bone-in pieces of chicken take around 30 minutes to cook."
