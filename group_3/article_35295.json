      "title": "Get a dance bag.",
      "content": "Get a dance bag. In most dance studios, they sell merchandise such as leotards, tights, shoes, and duffel bags. They come in all sizes, patterns, and prints so get one that is right for your child. If they are only in ballet, get a small bag for their leotard, tights, ballet slippers, hair items, and spare shoes. If your child is in more than one dance genre (jazz, acro, musical theater, hip-hop, lyrical, tap, etc.), get a bag that will hold all their stuff (shoes, sweats, leotard, tights, hair items, etc.). Since this is all for fun, get a dance bag they like that fits all the items."

      "title": "Feed your child a snack about half an hour before you leave for class.",
      "content": "Feed your child a snack about half an hour before you leave for class. Give them something healthy, so that they're energized, and ready to have fun. The best options for a snack are fruit, yogurt, or a granola bar. Give them something small so they aren't too full or tired during the dance class. If your child is loaded up with sugar or too full, they may end up crashing, getting tired, slowing down, and throwing a tantrum. However, if they're hungry during class, they will also be tired and distracted from hunger, and not pay attention in class. So, remember to give them a little something before dance class."

      "title": "Take your child to the bathroom about twenty minutes before you leave for class.",
      "content": "Take your child to the bathroom about twenty minutes before you leave for class. Even if your child says they don't have to go, make them try so they don't miss anything in class. Afterward, change them into their leotard, tights, and ballet shoes. Most ballet dress codes include black leotard (no sparkles, tutus, or fringe), plain white or pink tights, and pink, black, or white ballet slippers."

      "title": "Put her hair into a bun about ten minutes before you leave for class if it's long.",
      "content": "Put her hair into a bun about ten minutes before you leave for class if it's long. You may need to freshen it up right before class if it gets ruined while she's in the car or playing before class. The best method for a bun is to put your daughter's hair in a ponytail (preferably a high ponytail), and twist it tightly. This might pull her hair a bit, but it will be fine. Next, twist the twist so that it forms a bun. Add a hairband and bobby pins to the hair that sticks out. Add a pretty bow so your daughter looks cute in class."

      "title": "Get to class fifteen to twenty minutes before, so that you aren't \"that mom/dad\" that always gets there late, and makes everyone else relearn every step they just went over.",
      "content": "Get to class fifteen to twenty minutes before, so that you aren't \"that mom/dad\" that always gets there late, and makes everyone else relearn every step they just went over. It is also crucial to get there on time because if you don't, it hurts your child when dancing, everyone gets annoyed with you, your child will be unhappy, and it makes you look unreliable. If you can't make it on time, have a friend or family member take them. Tell them about the uniform, snack, bathroom, hair, and when to be there."

      "title": "Avoid buying ones with elastic strings when buying ballet slippers.",
      "content": "Avoid buying ones with elastic strings when buying ballet slippers. It's a hassle to tie them, tuck them in, and have them trip your child when dancing. If you can't find any slippers without elastic strips, cut them a bit shorter, to the point where they won't drag, if they are untied accidentally."

    {
      "title": "Don't stress too much.",
      "content": "Don't stress too much. You aren't going to be able to be on time every week. You may forget to tie their shoes or take them to the restroom. Just remember, this is for fun! As long as your child is happy, that's all that matters. Most children don't care if they show up to class in a sundress, and cowboy boots! You are their parent, and if your child is happy, you are perfect!"
