First, you'll need to gather the necessary supplies. You'll need Styrofoam, paper, or plastic drinking cups. You can wash used disposable drinking cups and use them for crafts. [1] X Research source You will also need glue, masking tape, shoe polish, a paintbrush, rags, and permanent markers. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Glue the cups together. The first step is to glue the cups together. Apply a generous amount of glue to the bottom of each cup. Stick the bottoms together, hold until secure, and then let dry. [3] X Research source If you're doing this activity with kids, they should be able to manage this step on their own. However, if you're working with a large group of children it may be easier to prepare the cups yourself ahead of time. Young kids especially may be impatient waiting for their cups to dry and want to hurry into to the decorating process. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Cover the cups in masking tape. Once you have the cups prepared, cover them in masking tape. This creates a surface on which children can color and decorate the cups. Use strips of masking tape 4 to 5 inches in length. If you're doing this activity with kids, you can allow them to tear off their own masking tape. [5] X Research source Coat the drum in small strips of masking tape, overlapping as needed so the whole drum is covered in a layer of tape. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Add shoe polish.",
      "content": "Add shoe polish. Now, you'll add the shoe polish. This will give your project a color similar to a traditional African drum. Use your paintbrush to brush a layer of shoe polish over the masking tape. Then, take a clean rag and wipe off excess polish. Allow the drums to sit until they're dry to the touch before use. [7] X Research source If you're working with kids, use your judgment regarding shoe polish. If you feel your kids are old enough to handle applying it on their own, allow them to do so with supervision. Very young children, however, may make a mess when using shoe polish. If you decide to let your kids apply the polish alone, have them wear old clothing or provide them with smocks. Shoe polish can smear easily."

      "content": "Gather your supplies. For a sturdier drum, you can use a garden pot or planter pot. This activity requires a bit more skill. It might be fun to use with slightly older children. To begin, gather the necessary supplies. You will need a garden pot or planter made with a terra-cotta covering. It should have a seven inch diameter. You should be able to find this at a local gardening or craft shop. [8] X Research source You will need a plastic lid big enough to fit over the pot. You can use a disposable food storage lid. [9] X Research source You will also need another lid that goes with a sturdy plastic container. The pot should be able to sit comfortably on this container. You can buy a plastic container at a local craft shop. However, you can also use a deli container or a takeout container for soup. [10] X Research source You will also need dry beans, twine or string, medium weight twine, a glue gun, craft glue, and brown acrylic paint. [11] X Research source"

To do this, use the glue gun to add a dab of glue to the top and bottom of the string on the points forming the zig-zag. Press down on the string for a few seconds after applying glue to make sure it stays in place. [12] X Research source If you're working with a child, help him during this process. It can be helpful to show him zig-zag patterns online to get a sense of what he should be creating. A child should not operate a glue gun without supervision. If your child is very young, it's best to operate the glue gun yourself."

Ropes usually tie the goatskin in place, holding it down in a somewhat zig-zag pattern. The shoe polish on the cup design and the terra cotta pot and painted containers in the pot design both imitate the wood covering of a Djembe drum. If you did the terra cotta design, you'll already have made some zig-zags. If you're using cups, you can draw or paint on zig-zags to mimic an authentic design. This will get you started in terms of making realistic designs. [18] X Research source"

You can try adding such designs using stickers, paint, or other craft supplies to make your project more authentic. Various animals may represent different things on a drum. A crocodile is considered one of the first creatures on earth in some African cultures, for example. A python is often associate with divination and fortune-telling. Chickens can represent possibility and sacrifice. Fish can represent wealth and happiness. [19] X Research source A padlock can represent power and control. Some occupations also hold significance. Drawing a blacksmith, or a blacksmith's tools, on your drum can symbolize transformation or fire. [20] X Research source Keep in mind symbolism varies from culture to culture. You might want to get a sense of how symbolism is used and then use symbols from your own personal life and culture on your drums. For example, if a particular animal has special symbolism to you, you could put that on your drum."

These can be covered up with the use of paint or markers. [21] X Research source When working with children, provide smocks or have your kids wear old clothing. Paint and markers can get messy."
