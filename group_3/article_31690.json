Place one magnet on the left, bottom side of the locking bar. Slide it around a little until you feel the magnets snap into place. [1] X Research source The locking bar is an indented rectangle located on the edge of your DVD, used to help you open the case. Use any household magnet, like from your fridge. If your DVD case is clear, you should be able to see the small magnets."

Drag the internal magnets, moving the DVD case lock from the “locked” to the “unlocked” position. [3] X Research source You only have to move the magnets about 1 inch (2.5 cm) to the right. If your magnets do not unlock the case, try this again using stronger magnets."

You need both lock tabs pressed down at the same time to open the DVD. If you are having trouble using multiple screwdrivers, ask a friend for help."
