      "content": "Simply open your camera app and point it at the sky. You'll have to be in an area where the Northern Lights are happening, of course, and you'll want to go to a spot with as little light pollution as possible. Lights from nearby cities will make it much harder to see the aurora, especially if it's already so faint you can't see it with the naked eye. [1] X Research source If your phone camera has a Night Mode option, you can turn it on to have an even better chance of catching a glimpse of the Northern Lights."

      "title": "Cameras are better than the human eye at capturing images in low light.",
      "content": "Cameras are better than the human eye at capturing images in low light. With a long exposure and high ISO, a camera can take in a ton of light. This results in a picture that shows more lights than what we can see with the naked eye. On top of that, camera sensors are also able to pick up wavelengths of lights that we can't even see. [2] X Research source This works even if you don't actually snap a photo, and simply use your phone camera as a viewfinder.

      "title": "Go out at peak times.",
      "content": "Go out at peak times. Auroras are most active between 10 pm and 2 am, though this range extends if the aurora is stronger. Additionally, the best times of year to view auroras are around the spring and fall equinoxes. [5] X Research source Wintertime is also good for viewing the Northern Lights, since the nights are longerâ€”especially closer to the Arctic Circle, which is where the strongest auroras are found."

      "title": "Get a smartphone tripod.",
      "content": "Get a smartphone tripod. When taking photos at night, your camera will need to use a longer exposure to let in more light. This can lead to blurry or shaky photos if you're holding your phone with your hands. To fix this, get a sturdy smartphone tripod to hold your phone steady. If you're taking photos somewhere windy (such as Iceland, a prime Northern Lights viewing location), consider getting a tripod with hooks that can be placed in the ground to stabilize it further."

      "title": "Use your camera's Night Mode.",
      "content": "Use your camera's Night Mode. Many modern smartphones have a special Night Mode built into the camera to help you take better photos at night. Most phones will also activate Night Mode automatically if it can tell you're taking pictures in the dark. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Adjust your phone camera's settings.",
      "content": "Adjust your phone camera's settings. If your phone doesn't have Night Mode or you want to adjust your camera's settings further, look for options to adjust the focus, exposure, aperture, and/or ISO. Focus on the night sky. If your phone wants to focus on something else, tap on the sky to adjust the autofocus. Set your exposure and aperture (also called f-stop) as low as possible, but set your ISO around 2,000 to start. [7] X Research source Don't be afraid to experiment with your camera's settings to find the right combination that works for you! Once you get the right combination of settings, press and hold the screen until you see AE/AF lock. AE stands for auto-exposure, and AF stands for autofocus. Doing this will stop your camera from changing the exposure and focus point until you tap on the screen again."

If you live in or are visiting somewhere that is known for its Northern Lights shows, you can probably find guided tours to help you find the best aurora viewing spots. Some places that have guided Northern Lights tours include Iceland, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Alaska, and northern Canada."
