      "content": "Opalite is an artificial crystal designed to emulate a natural opal. It’s made from synthetic glass and metal, although some opalite manufacturers may use other materials, too (like plastic resin). Though “opalite” used to refer to a particular kind of opal gemstone, the name “opalite” has been associated with the synthetic gem since the 1980s. [1] X Research source Other names for opalite include common opal, Tiffany stone, purple opal, ice cream stone, and opalised fluorite. You can tell opalite from a real opal by putting it under UV light. If it has a greenish glow under the UV light, it’s opalite (not natural opal). The properties of opalite are believed to equal those of natural opal, so it doesn’t matter which you use for spiritual and healing benefits."

      "content": "Opalite is known for its brilliance and its opalescent pearly luster. Typically, opalite gemstones are iridescent, coming in milky white hues tinged with blue, though they may be translucent or opaque. However, not all opalite gemstones are the same white-blue color, and when exposed to light, opalite’s play-of-color creates many different colors within the gemstone. [2] X Research source Aside from white, opalites also come in hues of purple, blue, pink, green, and yellow. Because they’re manufactured, opalites are often even more vibrant than natural opals. Play-of-color is the phenomenon that produces changing colors in opalite (and opals). As light enters the gem, it bounces across the molecules within and reflects a rainbow’s worth of colors across the stone’s surface."
