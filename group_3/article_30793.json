      "content": "Fill a saucepan with 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of water. You can use an actual double boiler, or improvise your own with a saucepan and a heat-safe bowl. Do not place the second saucepan or bowl on top just yet, however. If you are using a bowl, make sure that it fits comfortably over the saucepan and that there are no gaps where heat can escape. Double boilers are great if you need the chocolate to stay melted for a long time (ie: when you are making chocolate dipped strawberries with a decorative drizzle)."

      "content": "Bring the water to a boil over medium heat. While the water is coming to a boil, you can start measuring out the chocolate. If you can't find any chocolate chips, you can use whole chocolate bars instead. You will need to cut them into ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) wide chunks first, however. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Take the saucepan off the burner. Set it down onto a heat-safe surface to protect your counter. It might be a good idea to keep it near the stove, however, just in case your chocolate starts to harden too quickly."

      "title": "Put the chocolate into your second saucepan.",
      "content": "Put the chocolate into your second saucepan. If you are using a makeshift double boiler, then put the chocolate into your heat-safe bowl instead. Whichever one you end up using, make sure that it is perfectly dry. Any moisture will cause your chocolate to \"seize\" or harden. If you are working with large amounts of chocolate, consider putting only two-thirds of it in first. This will help it melt faster. It is possible to fix seized chocolate by adding cream to it, but this will affect your recipe."

      "content": "Place the upper saucepan (or bowl) on top of your lower saucepan. Make sure that the bottom of your saucepan or bowl does not touch the surface of the water. If it does, pour some of the water out. Make sure that the fit is tight, and that no steam can escape."

      "content": "Wait for the chocolate to melt most of the way, stirring occasionally with a rubber spatula. Once again, make sure that the spatula is perfectly dry, or the chocolate will seize. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl often. If you are working with large amounts of chocolate, you can add in the remaining third a little bit at a time."

      "content": "Put the chocolate chips into a wide, shallow microwave-safe bowl. [5] X Research source It is important that the container you use remains cool or very slightly warm after several minutes of microwaving, otherwise, the container itself will overheat the chocolate. The container must also be perfectly dry, as any moisture will cause the chocolate to harden and become grainy. If you can’t comfortably handle the container after several minutes of microwaving, then it isn’t a suitable container for melting chocolate. If you can't find any chocolate chips, cut a chocolate bar into ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) wide chunks instead. If you are planning on melting large amounts of chocolate, consider working in smaller batches instead."

      "content": "Microwave the chocolate on medium power for 1 minute, then give it a stir. You can stir the chocolate with a rubber spatula or a spoon, but make sure that whatever you use is dry. Also, keep in mind that every microwave oven is different, so your chocolate may not be melted completely after this. That is perfectly fine; you can always continue heating the chocolate in short bursts. Chocolate doesn't lose its shape when you microwave it, so stirring it will help make it smooth and more liquid-y."

      "title": "Continue heating the chocolate at 10 to 15-second intervals, stirring between each one, until it is almost melted.",
      "content": "Continue heating the chocolate at 10 to 15-second intervals, stirring between each one, until it is almost melted. Milk chocolate and white chocolate tend to overheat quicker than dark chocolate. It would be best to stir them every 10 seconds. [6] X Research source This may sound tedious, but it will reduce the chances of any scorching. Remember, chocolate will keep its shape when heated in the microwave, so stirring it up will help it \"melt.\" How long you end up cooking the chocolate also depends on how much you are working with. For example: 1 ounce (30 grams) will take 1 minute total. 8 ounces (225 grams) will take 3 minutes total. 1 pound (450 grams) may take up to 6 minutes."
