      "content": "Placing ice cubes in a dryer creates steam to de-wrinkle your clothes. Simply place your wrinkly clothes in your dryer and add a handful of ice cubes. Then, set your dryer on high heat and dry your clothes for about 5 to 10 minutes. Take your clothes out as soon as they’re done and wear them, or hang them up to prevent wrinkles. [1] X Research source If you don’t have ice, simply mist your clothes so they’re slightly damp, but not wet. Alternatively, add a damp sock, towel, or several dryer sheets to the dryer to create the same steam effect. If you use dryer sheets, they’ll help prevent static and leave your clothes with a refreshing scent. [2] X Research source Drying wrinkly clothes is great if they have wrinkles all over instead of in concentrated spots. Just check the clothes’ labels to make sure they’re safe to tumble dry."

      "title": "The heated air from a hair dryer quickly blows away wrinkles.",
      "content": "The heated air from a hair dryer quickly blows away wrinkles. Hang your garment on a clothes hanger then lightly spritz the wrinkles with a spray bottle full of water. Make sure the garment is slightly damp, but not completely wet. Then, turn your dryer on to the lowest setting and hold it about 2 inches (5 cm) away from your clothes. [4] X Expert Source Ayad Mirjan Dry Cleaner & Laundry Specialist Expert Interview. 11 August 2021. If your hair dryer has a concentrator nozzle, attach it to focus the hot air onto the wrinkles. Don’t get closer than 1 to 2 inches (2-5 cm) from your clothes with the hair dryer, as the direct heat can damage or burn your clothes. This wrinkle removing method works best on clothes that have concentrated areas of wrinkles."

      "content": "The heated flat iron paddles easily remove wrinkles on smaller areas. Just heat your flat iron on high if you’re ironing a cotton garment, or on low for delicate fabrics like silk. If you’re ironing a shirt, place it on the back of a chair to separate the front and back. Simply clamp the flat iron over the wrinkled fabric and pull down as if you were straightening your hair. [5] X Research source When you iron shorts, pull them onto the back of the chair upside down. For long pants, flowy shirts, or jackets, lay them on a flat surface or hang them. Use a damp cloth to clean off any hair products on your cool, unplugged flat iron before you iron. Leftover products can damage your clothes. [6] X Research source Run the flat iron over your clothes quickly just like you’re using a real iron. If you clamp the flat iron on your clothes for too long, you might burn the fabric. This method works great on smaller areas like shirt collars, cuffs, and hems."

      "content": "Aim the hot steam from a kettle at your clothes to release wrinkles. Get the best of both worlds by making yourself tea and de-wrinkling your clothes at the same time. Just fill your kettle with water and place it on the stove to boil. Once it starts to steam, hold your garment about 12 inches (30 cm) away from the tea spout. [7] X Research source Be careful and keep your face and hands out of the way of the kettle’s steam. This method usually works best on small, wrinkled areas like suit and shirt collars. If you have a larger wrinkled garment, use the steam from a hot shower or dryer instead. Or, use a steamer."

      "content": "Heat up a kitchen pan and press it onto your clothes to remove wrinkles. Just take out any kitchen pan or pot, fill it with water, then boil it on your stove. Lay a towel on your counter or table and place your garment on top. Then, carefully dump out the boiling water and smooth the hot bottom of the pan over the wrinkles. [8] X Research source Wear oven mitts and iron carefully when using this method to prevent burns on yourself and your clothing. Iron your clothes quickly, as pots and pans tend to cool down fast. This method works best on garments made out of durable fabrics like cotton and linen."

Most grocery stores sell wrinkle-removing sprays, but it’s easy to make one yourself with common household ingredients. To use either type of spray, just spritz the wrinkles on your clothes until they’re damp. Then, gently smooth, pull, or shake out your clothes to release the wrinkles.

      "content": "The hot stream from a clothes steamer relaxes wrinkles quickly. Fill up the water reservoir in your steamer and plug it in to heat up for 1 to 2 minutes. Then, hang up your clothes and hold the areas with wrinkles taut. Aim the steamer about 6 inches (15 cm) away and slowly move it in downwards strokes over the wrinkles. [13] X Research source The steamer usually sputters at first, so hold down the button to release the steam until it comes out evenly before using it. Steamers release wrinkles delicately, so they’re great for most shirts, pants, and even suits. Just check the labels on your garment to make sure it’s safe to steam."

      "content": "Use the pressure of a mattress to flatten wrinkles if you have time. If you don’t have access to steam or heat, use good old-fashioned force to de-wrinkle your clothes. Just smooth your garment on a flat surface and roll it up tightly into a burrito-like shape. Then, place it under a mattress or a heavy stack of books for about 1 hour. [14] X Research source As an alternative, place the wrinkled clothing on a flat surface. Then, dampen a bath towel or paper towel and set it on top of the wrinkled areas. Press the towel down with your hands, then let the garment hang to dry. This method works great for all kinds of clothes and fabric types."
