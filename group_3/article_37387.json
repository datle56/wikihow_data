      "content": "He might be busy, he might not like texting, or he might not be into you. Dry texting is incredibly frustrating, but try to be patient for the first couple of short texts or long response times. If he starts the conversation up again or starts sending more detailed messages, he was probably just busy. However, if you notice a pattern of dry texts, ask yourself these questions to figure out if he’s into you : How often does he initiate the conversation? If you’re the one consistently sending the first message, he may not be interested in you. That’s his loss! How does he communicate in real life? Is he a chatty guy or more reserved? He might be a shy guy or an introvert who doesn’t feel like engaging in small talk. Try out a few of the conversation starters below to try to pique his interest. Has he ever sent longer texts? He might be having a bad day if his texts have gone dry. Think back to the last time you interacted, too, and ask yourself if you did anything to upset him. If not, give him some space and see if he starts texting again. When do his texts usually go dry? For instance, do his texts get shorter when you bring up a certain subject? He might prefer talking at a certain time of day or about certain subjects. Shake up the conversation to get him to text back with better responses."
