If sensitivity is not an issue, shave both up and down, as underarm hair may grow in several different directions.

The skin is likely to be sensitive, so consider using a gentle moisturizer after you dry off. Deodorants may sting if applied immediately after shaving. Consider shaving at night to allow the skin to rest and heal before applying any products. If irritation or inflammation persists consult a dermatologist or try a different process. Reader Poll: We asked 180 wikiHow readers if they use deodorant, and 53% of them said yes. [Take Poll] So, if you experience inflammation, that may be the cause."
