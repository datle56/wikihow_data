A cavity that grows too big due to negligence can require a root canal, which costs an average of $900. [11] X Research source If a tooth gets so bad that it’s unable to be saved, it may need to be pulled. When a tooth is pulled, the teeth and jaw around that spot become weaker over time and the bone suffers resorption. [12] X Research source Forces on your teeth will change and an entire series of problems will occur. If your teeth are sensitive to hot or cold, a toothpaste for sensitive teeth can help change that. These toothpastes contain minerals that help protect the nerves in the teeth and make them less sensitive."
