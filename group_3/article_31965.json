      "title": "Accept your thoughts and move on.",
      "content": "Accept your thoughts and move on. OCD thrives on your resistance to obsessive thoughts, as well as your negative emotional reactions to them. If you have obsessions, don't try to reason with the obsessive thoughts as this will only intensify your symptoms. OCD is full of intrusive, irrational thoughts and you cannot reason your way to serenity. Try using mindful acceptance to deal with these issues. Accept and allow your unpleasant feelings, and just observe them without judging or reacting to them. Then, focus back on the present moment and all of your sensations. If you are busy focusing in on the here and now, you won't have time to worry about the future. It may be helpful to simply accept and agree with the obsessive thought. Consider the possibility that your fear will come true, and try making a compromise with that possibility. For example, if you have an obsessive thought about dying from pneumonia from touching the shopping cart, the world ending tomorrow, or a meteor falling on you and your family, you could say: \"Well, those scenarios are all possible, but the odds of all these situations happening are extremely low. No matter what, I'm going to let go of what I can't control, stop worrying about these possibilities, and enjoy whatever time I have left. That way, if any of these things do happen, at least I will have had a good time and spent my last moments well. I will now let go of these thoughts and my need for absolute certainty, and I'll bring my attention to my shopping in the present moment.\" It may sound counter-intuitive and even ludicrous, but this technique is often used in therapy and works. Simply acknowledge the thought and accept whatever worst case scenario your mind has concocted and move on.

Compulsions are often done to protect you from some fear. Before now, you may have been trying to avoid any of your fears in order to prevent the compulsive behaviors. Unfortunately, when you avoid your fears, they only grow larger in scope. [11] X Research source Expose yourself to one of your triggers. Let’s say, you are sitting on the couch watching TV and suddenly question whether you locked the door. Sit with the feeling of anxiety without giving into the urge. Resist for as long as you can. When you do give in, try to limit the repetitions of checking the door again and again. Over time, you should feel less and less anxiety when faced with that trigger. Like with exposure and response prevention training that you may do with your therapist, you can also systematically expose yourself to distressing situations on your own. Be sure to only do this when you have successfully practiced with your therapist and have outlined coping strategies to complete if the anxiety becomes too much."

Repeat the process until you feel more calm. Visualization- Sit comfortably. Close your eyes. Breathe deeply. Call to mind a place where you feel completely safe. It can be a place that you know like your childhood bedroom, or an imaginary place such as an exotic beach or a lakeside cabin. Use your senses to connect with this place. Think about how it smells, sounds, feels, or tastes to be there. Use your mind to vividly create a thorough 3-dimensional picture of this place. Activate as many senses as you can. This exercise can be carried out with your therapist, on your own, or with a guided video from YouTube. Progressive muscle relaxation- Sit on a sofa or lie down on a bed. Relax your muscles. Inhale and exhale deeply. Starting with your toes, clench the muscles tightly. Notice how that feels. Hold them like this for a few seconds, then release the tension. Notice how it feels to let go of that tension. Now, move up to your knees. Contract those muscles, holding them this way for several counts. Release.
