When you’re trying to solve a brain teaser, there is a method to the madness—you aren’t meant to just immediately know the answer, like you might with a fact-based question. Instead, follow these steps and tips to master any brain teaser you might encounter: [11] X Research source Understand the question: Make sure you’ve fully understood the question. Reread it or ask for it to be repeated as much as necessary. Identify exactly what the question is asking. Ask for clarification: If you need to and it’s possible, feel free to ask any clarifying questions that you have. Break it down: Divide the problem into smaller parts to make the teaser feel more manageable and easier to understand. Think aloud: If you’re able, talk through your problem-solving out loud or use a piece of paper to work through the brain teaser. State any assumptions: Some brain teasers require you to make educated assumptions or estimates—that’s fine, as long as you make sure to clearly state what assumptions you’re making. Avoid rushing or panicking: The worst thing you can do when faced with a brain teaser is to blurt out the first thing you think of or working up a (metaphorical sweat). Take a deep breath, take your time, and slowly analyze the question and its potential answer."
