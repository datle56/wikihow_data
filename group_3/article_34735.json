      "content": "Pull the ring apart until there’s 0.75 inches (1.9 cm) of space. Hold the hair ring in both hands and gently pull the seam apart so there’s space in between it. Try not to bend the ring out of shape so that it stays in a nice circle. [1] X Research source Be sure you don’t separate the ring too wide, or you might have trouble putting it back together later."

      "title": "Push 1 end of the ring into your hair until it’s through.",
      "content": "Push 1 end of the ring into your hair until it’s through. Pick the area of your hair that you want to add a ring and slowly push the end of the ring through it. Use caution so that you don’t rip or tear your hair, especially if you are wearing box braids. [2] X Research source If you get to a point where you can’t push your ring through your hair anymore, gently pull the ring back out and try it in a different spot that’s less thick."

      "content": "Press the ends of the ring together so they form a circle. Go gently so that you don’t push the ring out of its shape. Try to close the ring as much as you can so it won’t fall out of your hair when you’re out and about. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Twist the ring so the seam is hidden in your hair.",
      "content": "Twist the ring so the seam is hidden in your hair. Gently move the ring into your hair or braid so that all you can see is the closed circle. You can adjust your rings throughout the day if they start to twist back around. [4] X Research source Usually, hair rings will stay put once you situate them. It’s always good to check on them once in a while, though."

      "content": "Put rings sporadically through box braids or dreadlocks. If you want to freshen up your style, try adding a few rings to the face-framing layers of your hair. Put 5 to 6 rings on each braid or dreadlock to keep it simple, or add 10 or more to really add some bling to your style. [5] X Research source This is a great way to refresh your hairstyle if you’re getting tired of it."

      "content": "Add your rings in rows leading to a high ponytail. Separate out a 3 in (7.6 cm) section on top of your forehead, then French braid that section of hair by picking up a new strand each time you cross a strand over the center. Stop braiding backward toward your hair when you reach the crown of your head. Pull the rest of your hair into a high ponytail at the crown of your head, and add hair rings in a line down your braid leading to your ponytail as a final touch. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Trail your rings down a large braid for some added bling. Part your hair on the right side of your head and braid all of your hair into a large braid. Finish off your braid with a hair tie and then add hair rings from the end of your braid to your roots for a cute line of bling. Try to keep them about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) apart so they look balanced. [7] X Research source Try to keep your hair rings all in 1 line so they look cohesive."

Pull these sections into small buns at the crown of your head, and leave the rest of your hair down. Secure your buns with a hair tie, then add a row of 5 hair rings to each braid for some added flair. [8] X Research source If you want to, you can French braid your hair leading up to your buns. You can use all of your hair in your space buns if you’d like to. Just pull your hair up to the crown of your head before you make your buns and add it in!"

Starting with the front of the section, twist the hair around itself until you reach the middle of your head. Add a clear hair tie to keep the twist in place, then do the same thing right below it. Add 3 to 4 hair rings in a line to each twist for some bling. [9] X Research source This is a super easy way to keep your hair out of your face on hot days.

Separate out 3 sections of hair and start French braiding them at the top of your head, grabbing a new strand of hair each time you cross the center of your braid.
