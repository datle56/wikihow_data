      "content": "The spices in curry grow more fragrant as they cook, causing an odor. Indian cuisine is known for its powerful and pungent spices. While these spices are strong in the bottle, they’re even stronger when they cook. Most curries are cooked with fat-soluble oils (like olive oil, coconut oil, or butter) that break down when cooked.

The scent is so strong that it clings to surfaces, especially fabrics."
