      "title": "Use a paper towel to blot the paint.",
      "content": "Use a paper towel to blot the paint. As soon as you notice a wet paint stain on faux leather, grab a paper towel. Use the paper towel to absorb as much of the wet paint as possible. Try to avoid spreading the paint beyond the borders of the original stain. You might need to use several paper towels to absorb all of the remaining paint. Make sure you blot instead of rubbing. Rubbing the paint will cause it to penetrate into the faux leather more quickly."

      "content": "Use the tip of a knife to scratch away the dried paint. Since the paint has already dried on the faux leather, you will need to find a sharp knife or pin to remove it with. Gently scratch at the surface of the paint with the tip of the knife or pin. Be careful you do not scrape or puncture the faux leather."

      "content": "Remove the dried paint with a toothbrush. If you cannot easily remove the dried paint using the tip of a knife or pin, try a toothbrush. Use the toothbrush to make gentle circular strokes, so that the dried paint begins peeling off the faux leather. Do not apply too much pressure or you might scratch the surface of the faux leather."
