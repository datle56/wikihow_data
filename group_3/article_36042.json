You can grow your own aloe vera. If you use it in its natural form, cut one of the leaves off the plant and squeeze the gel out. Rub the gel on your irritated skin. If this doesn’t sound pleasant, you can purchase aloe vera in dozens of different brands and scents at the pharmacy or grocery store. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Rinse face wash thoroughly with room temperature water. Incredibly hot or cold water can actually damage your skin, sending your skin cells into shock. Use room temperature water instead and just make sure that you are rinsing your face completely. If you think you might have residual soap on your face, then rinse one more time than normal. Soap residue can clog pores just like grease and make up can, but instead of breakouts, your skin breaks down after prolonged exposure to the base soap.

      "content": "Use a high-quality moisturizer after you use your face wash. If your face wash irritates your skin, it probably is removing too many oils. A moisturizer will add good oils back into your skin and help seal water in your skin. Dehydrated skin leads to irritation, dryness, flaking, and general discomfort. [5] X Expert Source Paul Friedman, MD Board Certified Dermatologist, American Board of Dermatology Expert Interview. 8 April 2020. The key to a good skin care program is a good moisturizer. Moisturizers that contain humectants (substances that reduce water loss) are very effective. Look for moisturizers with urea, alpha hydroxy acids called lactic acid or glycolic acid, glycerin, or hyaluronic acid in the ingredient list. If you find them there, then you’ve found a great moisturizer. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

      "title": "Limit how frequently and how harshly you exfoliate.",
      "content": "Limit how frequently and how harshly you exfoliate. Scrubbing your skin roughly or using harsh products can definitely lead to irritation. If you have dry, sensitive, or acne-prone skin, use a chemical exfoliator (i.e. a product that contains alpha or beta hydroxy acids) and a washcloth to exfoliate. If you have thick or oily skin, go for mechanical exfoliation (i.e. use an exfoliating tool like a brush or sponge). [7] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source There's no set schedule for exfoliation, as it really depends on the product you use and your skin type. Try it once or twice a week and gradually work up to doing it more often. If you notice redness or irritation, you're exfoliating too much."

Doing so only further damages your skin and can possibly lead to secondary bacterial infections of the skin. If you develop such an infection, you may need antibiotics or at the very least you will prolong any skin issues. Fight the urge to scratch. Use other means of combating that itch.

      "content": "Pick a soap based on your skin type. Too often we just pick a face wash based off of a commercial or the recommendation of a friend with “better” skin than ours. The problem is that everyone’s skin is different, so a soap made for naturally oily skin will strip too many valuable oils from someone’s non-oily skin. Or a face wash engineered for dry skin won’t adequately remove oils accumulated over the course of a day on someone’s naturally oily face. So ask yourself this question: Is my face naturally oily or naturally dry?

Sodium laureth sulfate is a little milder than its more extreme counterpart — sodium lauryl sulfate — but both will still irritate skin susceptible to strong soaps. If your favorite soap has these “bad” ingredients listed on the side of the package, you may want to consider switching to a different cleanser. While there is some controversy around the use of sodium lauryl sulfate, prolonged use may be linked to cancer, neurotoxicity, organ toxicity, skin irritation and endocrine disruption.

Some consumers assume that higher price points equate to a better product, but as we’ve already established, everyone’s skin is different, so some might love an expensive product, while others won’t find them equally satisfying. Read a broad spectrum of reviews written by people who’ve used the product before you try it. See if they complain about dryness afterwards, lingering scents, breakouts, or any other dermatological issue that might send up a red flare or make your skin red and itchy."
