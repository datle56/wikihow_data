      "content": "“There’s more than one way to skin a cat” means there are multiple ways to do something. Saying \"there's more than one way to skin a cat\" nudges people to remember that there are plenty of solutions to the same problem, and that you should try different methods if one isn't working out as well as you'd hoped. For example, if a coworker is feeling stuck on a project, it might be wise to remind them, “Hey, try something else–you know, there’s more than one way to skin a cat!”"

      "content": "The first noted use of a similar phrase dates back to 1678. In his book, “Collection of English Proverbs,” English naturalist John Ray wrote, “There are more ways to kill a dog than hanging.” [1] X Research source Although equally as horrifying as its modern-day counterpart, the phrase is thought to have originally featured a dog instead of a cat. In 1840, Seba Smith wrote a short story titled, “The Money Diggers.” In it, she explained, “As it is said, ‘There are more ways than one to skin a cat,’ so are there more ways than one of digging for money.” From then on out, the image of the less likeable cat had totally replaced man’s best friend. In 1855, Charles Kingsley wrote, “There are more ways of killing a cat than by choking it with cream.” This new take may have been less bloody but no less grotesque, although it certainly proved the very point of the idiom by coming up with new avenues that reach the same destination. In 1889, Mark Twain used the phrase in \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.\" He described a character as, “wise, subtle, and [she] knew more than one way to skin a cat.” It's been in use ever since! [2] X Research source The expression has nothing to do with the move in gymnastics, called “skinning a cat.” The move involves gymnasts passing their legs between their arms while hanging from a bar. Some people believe the idiom could be referring to catfish , which don’t have scales and therefore need to be skinned in order to be cooked. However, this is more likely just a regional adaptation of the adage."

      "content": "Use the phrase to encourage a different solution to a problem. Whether it's a personal conversation with a friend or spouse, or in a professional setting, this expression can be used in virtually any situation—unless those around you are diehard animal lovers! No matter where you are or who you're with, the expression simply denotes that there’s multiple ways to solve a problem or achieve a purpose, urging the other person not to give up. Here are some examples: If you get caught in rush hour traffic and your friend is driving, you might encourage them to try taking another route, saying, “We can get there a bit sooner if we take the turnpike instead–there’s more than one way to skin a cat!” If you’re helping your child with their English homework and they’re getting frustrated, you might gently nudge them by saying, “Why don’t you look for more clues in the text? Remember, there’s more than one way to skin a cat!” If you’re cooking dinner for a loved one and following a recipe to the T but then realize you’re missing an ingredient, they might urge you to substitute it for something else: “Swap the vegetable oil for butter–there’s more than one way to skin a cat!”"

      "content": "As the phrase itself suggests, there are many ways of echoing this same sentiment. If you don’t want to conjure the image of an innocent kitty being tortured in casual conversation– and understandably so– here are some less macabre options. Knowing these, the cat will never get your tongue. All roads lead to Rome. With roots in the Roman Empire, this common adage has grown to mean that there are multiple ways to achieve the same result. Thousands of years of use have made it quite popular, often synonymous with, “I don’t care how you do it as long as it gets done.” Added bonus: no cats were hurt in the making of this expression. [3] X Research source There’s more than one way to peel an orange. Although this iteration isn’t nearly as popular as its predecessor, it does offer the option for customization. Oranges, along with lots of other fruits, can be peeled in a variety of ways. In essence, using this version still conveys the same message without getting PETA involved. [4] X Research source There’s more than one way to crack an egg. Not only is this verifiably true , but it offers yet another way to approach to the idiom without metaphorically flaying any feline friends. Whether you tap the egg with a tool, your fingernail, or against a hard surface, this adage confirms that there’s lots of different ways to achieve eggsactly what you set out to do."
