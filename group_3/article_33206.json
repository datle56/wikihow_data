If you constantly text them over and over or ask, “Why aren’t you replying?,” they might feel a bit smothered and you could lose their interest. [1] X Research source People stop replying for all sorts of reasons. More often than not, it’s because they got busy with something else, not because they’re intentionally ignoring you, so don’t worry if your crush is taking longer than usual to reply!"

Play it cool by keeping your texts short and sweet and refraining from sending long paragraphs. That way, your crush can easily read your texts and respond, and you’ll stay as cool as a cucumber to keep them interested. Plus, shorter texts are a little easier to digest and won’t come off as strong as long texts would. It’s best to keep it casual when you can!"

      "content": "Initiating the messaging should ideally be a 50/50 split between you two. If you find that you’re always the one texting first , wait a little bit to see if they reach out. That way, you don’t feel like you’re putting in all the effort, and they see that they’re going to have to text first sometimes. Plus, when someone texts you first, you know they’re at least mildly interested in talking to you (which is a good sign). If your text never initiates text convos with you, it may be time to move on to someone who’s more willing to put in the effort to get to know you."

      "content": "Complaining about lots of things could rub them the wrong way. It’s totally fine to vent about a bad day every once in a while, but if all your texts are negative or talk about drama, your crush might lose interest. Try to keep your messages mostly upbeat so that your crush looks forward to your messages. As an example, try to turn annoying or irritating situations into funny stories. For instance, if you were walking down the sidewalk and got splashed by an oncoming car, you might text your crush, “OMG, I’m gonna be so late to work today. I was walking down Main St. and totally got splashed by the bus. It was like a waterfall!! I had to run home and change super fast.” Reader Poll: We asked 1004 wikiHow readers about the best ways to build a connection with someone they like over text, and only 10% of people recommended bringing up super deep, philosophical topics . [Take Poll] Instead, keep it light, fun, friendly, and sweet—save the serious topics for in-person conversation!"

You don’t have to follow this rule exactly, but texting back instantly can make it seem like you’re just waiting by the phone for their text. [3] X Research source However, some people may argue that it’s even cooler to not care what your crush thinks and avoid playing any games. If they took awhile to text you back but you see their text and want to respond to them, you do you! Try not to take long response times personally—a lot of people are just bad texters, and they lose track of who texted them when."
