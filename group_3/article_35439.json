Remember that the reactants of an equation are always on the left side of the arrow. [1] X Research source Many reactions have just 2 reactants, but you can have combination reactions with more than 2 reactants."

All products are found on the right side of the arrow. Very occasionally, there will be more than 1 product on the right side; however, most equations will only have 1 product.

Energy, in the form of light, heat, or electricity, is usually the catalyst for the reaction. This type of reaction yields more products than reactants. Almost all basic decomposition reactions will have one reactant. [4] X Research source The reactant is on the left side of the arrow."

To recognize this type of reaction, just see if the equation resembles the general formula C --> A + B. Remember, the products are on the right side of the arrow.

      "content": "Recognize the general formula for single replacement. A single replacement reaction occurs when one element replaces another element within a compound. It generally takes the form of AX + Y --> YX + A or A + XY --> XA + Y. One reactant is always a single element and the other reactant is always a compound. [7] X Research source In a single replacement reaction either the anion (negatively charged ion) or the cation (positively charged ion) is replaced. For example: Cu + AgNO 3 --> Ag + Cu(NO 3 ) 2 . In this example, copper (Cu) replaces the cation silver (Ag)."

Iron replaces the copper element in the compound. Example 2: Fe + HCl --> FeCl 3 + H 2 . Iron replaces the hydrogen. Example 3: CaO + Al --> Al 2 O 3 + Ca. Aluminum replaces the calcium."

These reactions are similar to single replacement reactions except that both components react and there are 2 replacements. The general formula is AB + XY --> AY + XB. The cations and anions from both compounds recombine to form 2 new compounds. [10] X Research source These reactions are usually between acids and bases or metallic aqueous compounds. For example: KOH + H 2 SO 4 --> K 2 SO 4 + H 2 O."

When looking at an equation you can tell it is a double replacement reaction because the outside elements will recombine to make a new compound and the inside elements will recombine to make a new compound. The inside elements will switch position because the cation is always written first. [11] X Research source For example: FeS + HCl --> FeCl 2 + H 2 S. The outside elements, Fe and Cl, combine to form FeCl 2 . The inside elements, S and H, switch positions and combine to form H 2 S."

Generally, the oxygen gas reacts with a compound of carbon and hydrogen. The combustion products are always CO 2 and H 2 O. [13] X Research source The generic equation for a combustion reaction is: C x H y + O 2 --> CO 2 + H 2 O."

If there is no O 2 present, then the reaction is not combustion. [14] X Research source For example: C 2 H 5 SH + O 2 --> CO 2 + H 2 O + SO 2 . O 2 is reacting with a carbon-hydrogen compound so this reaction is probably a combustion reaction."

If both carbon dioxide and water are not products of the reaction than combustion is not occurring. [15] X Research source For example: C 2 H 5 SH + O 2 --> CO 2 + H 2 O + SO 2 . Because CO 2 and H 2 O are both products, this reaction is an example of combustion."

Reactions that release a lot of heat, such as the thermite reaction, can be explosive. [17] X Research source Take proper safety precautions when working with heat, such as wearing gloves and using eye protection. The thermite reaction is a single-replacement reaction between iron (III) oxide and aluminum: 3Fe 3 0 2 + 4Al → 2Al 2 0 3 + 6Fe"
