      "content": "Know which components you need to buy. The average home theater setup includes speakers, a receiver, some form of video input (e.g., a DVD player or a game console), and a television. Before you even start shopping for components like speakers and receivers, take stock of what you have. For example, if you have a decent set of modern speakers and a TV with which they're compatible, you really only need the receiver (mandatory) and the video input (optional). It's generally advisable to use products which are all roughly the same age (e.g., you'll want a modern TV to match modern speakers)."

      "title": "Consider buying an all-in-one home theater package.",
      "content": "Consider buying an all-in-one home theater package. Several companies make packages which include speakers and a receiver, making it easy to match a TV screen to the whole package. If you're not worried about having specific types of equipment, you might want to go with an all-in-one option. All-in-one packages rarely come with televisions, so you'll still need to buy a new one or adjust the one that you have. While you can't expect the same level of sound quality from an all-in-one package as you might expect from individually purchased components, all-in-one home theater systems are perfect for beginners."

      "content": "Determine where you want to set up your home theater. It's easy to get carried away while buying equipment only to realize that your TV and/or speakers are too big for your living room! Before you purchase any equipment, figure out the general dimensions of the room in which you want to set up your home theater, then block out where you want to place the various pieces of the home theater. You may discover halfway through staging your home theater that your selected room is too small to accommodate your preferred components."

      "content": "Think about your home theater's limits. There are several factors which may stunt your home theater's overall size and depth: Budget - Home theater setups can cost anywhere from sub-$500 to well over $10,000. Establishing a hard budget before you purchase anything will help narrow your search. Noise - Setting up a home theater's speakers will vary wildly depending on how close your neighbors are; additionally, your home's acoustics will play a part in determining which speakers best fit your needs. Space - As mentioned in the last step, your home's size will limit things like TV screen size, speaker strength, and more."

      "title": "Decide on a video input system.",
      "content": "Decide on a video input system. A video input system is optional, but recommended unless you have a cable box. Common video input sources include the following: DVD player or Blu-Ray player - While somewhat outdated, nothing beats the simplicity of a DVD player if you're not quite ready to start downloading all of your movies. Game console - Consoles such as the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 have evolved into all-in-one entertainment systems, allowing you to game, watch TV, stream content, rent or buy digital movies, and play DVDs. Smart TV adapter - Things like the Amazon Fire TV Stick, Chromecast, and Apple TV allow you to turn your TV into a smart TV, thus negating a DVD player or cable box. The only downside here is that your existing DVD collection (if applicable) will not be usable with a smart TV adapter."

      "content": "Purchase and plug in power strips. You'll need several electrical outlets for your TV and other components, so make sure that you have plenty of power strips in your preferred area. Once you've set up your electrical outlets in your staging area, you're free to move onto the next part. The power strips should go in the same general location as your TV. Depending on the location of your room's electrical outlets, you may need to use an extension cord as well."

      "content": "Choose the right size TV for your room. While it is often tempting to get the very biggest screen you can, choosing a TV is more of a science than simply using the \"bigger is better\" concept. You should choose your TV based on the size of the room and how far away people are from the screen to get the maximum enjoyment for the maximum number of people. In general, you should be sitting 1 ½ - 2 ½ times the screen size away from the TV; for example, if you want a 70\" TV screen, you should have between 9 and 15 feet of room between the TV and your closest couch. [1] X Research source TV sizes are measured diagonally, from the top-left corner of the screen to the bottom-right corner of the screen. Projectors allow you to adjust the size of the screen as long as you have a large blank wall on which to project the video. You generally need 12-15 feet between the projector and the wall to get the best results. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Select a high-resolution TV. Resolution is one of the key factors when trying to improve your TV's picture. The more pixels, the higher the resolution. This is why 2160p, also known as \"4K Ultra HD\", is more expensive than 1080p (also known as \"Full HD\") or 720p. The “p” stands for the number of pixels on the vertical edge (going downward) of the screen. More pixels give the picture better clarity and color. Some systems are labeled with an “i.” such as 1080i. This stands for “interlaced” pixels, which broadcast slightly differently. While most TV manufacturers have moved past 1080i, you should know that the picture quality is roughly the same, though 1080p has “won” the battle with consumers. [3] X Research source Certain video inputs, such as the Xbox One, do not support 1080i and will instead default to 720p on such TVs."

Feel free to skip this step if you already have a video source, or if you're going to use a cable box instead. Ideally, you'll choose an entertainment system (e.g., a console) or a Blu-Ray player for your TV; DVD players and VCR boxes are relatively outdated at this point."

Ask yourself if you spend more time with your iPod or plopped in front of the TV. [4] X Research source Movies and TV - Most movies are multi-track (sounds come from many different speakers), meaning 5 or 7 smaller speakers will create a more immersive movie watching experience than 2-3 expensive, large speakers. This helps you create realistic surround sound. Music - Speaker quality is more important than quantity. Invest in a good receiver and purchase 2 hi-fi speakers to get the best quality sound you can.

The first number, 5, tells you how many speakers are included in the package, and the second number, .1, indicates how many subwoofers are included. 5.1-channel and 7.1-channel are the two most popular speaker packages, offering a subwoofer, two speakers in front of you, two behind you, one in the center, and one on either side (for 7.1)."

There are a couple of non-traditional ways in which you can receive audio from your home theater: Sound bar - Sound bars often have two main speakers and one subwoofer, making them 2.1 stereo systems. While they lack the depth of true surround sound, they fit in with smaller home theaters or areas in which you can't make much noise. [7] X Research source Component surround sound - Often sold as pre-matched package deals, these speakers are ideal for people who want surround sound but lack the technological know-how for setting it up with 5, 6, or 7 distinct speakers.

A good rule of thumb for receivers is that you should have one HDMI port per connected item.

Connect one wire to the red “input” on your speaker and the red “output” on the receiver and do the same with the black end to connect your speaker. Some modern speakers have plugs instead of speaker wiring. In this case, the wires are color coded for easy access. Most speaker wire is covered in a wax sheath to protect it.
