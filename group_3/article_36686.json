      "content": "Use cold compresses initially and warm ones after 48 hours. Use a cold compress in the first 1-2 days after getting your hickey. Wrap a homemade ice pack in a towel and place it on the hickey as soon as possible to help constrict your blood vessels and reduce swelling. This process may make the mark look less noticeable. Leave the ice on the hickey for up to 20 minutes at a time, with 1-2 hours between each application. [1] X Research source If your hickey is still swollen or visible after two days, apply a warm compress (like a heating pad or a cloth soaked in warm water) to the area (you can make your own with this guide !). Heat therapy helps to open up blood vessels and increase blood flow, which can speed up healing. Apply heat for up to 20 minutes at a time. Repeat several times a day, but make sure to give your chance to return to its normal temperature after each application—otherwise, you may burn your skin!"

      "content": "Use topical creams and gels with vitamin C, vitamin K, arnica, or bromelain. Arnica and bromelain are natural ingredients (an herb and a fruit enzyme, respectively) that have been shown in some studies to remove bruising. [2] X Research source Similarly, Vitamin K and Vitamin C have been shown to speed up bruise and skin healing. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Look for topical creams and gels with these ingredients, then apply them directly to the skin according to package directions. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source You can also eat foods high in vitamin C and K, although this method probably won’t remove your hickeys as quickly. Examples of foods high in vitamin K are kale, spinach, broccoli, liver, and eggs. [5] X Research source Good sources of vitamin C are strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, sweet potatoes, and red peppers. [6] X Research source <"

[7] X Research source You can purchase a store-bought gel , or you can cut open the leaf of an actual aloe vera plant to use the fresh gel. Smooth a thick layer of aloe vera onto your hickey and leave it on for about 10 minutes. Then, wipe away the aloe vera with a tissue. Do this twice per day until your hickey has healed.

Some claim that holding the inside of a banana peel against a bruise can help to cool the area and reduce its size (although there’s no conclusive scientific evidence to back this claim).

[17] X Research source Use your fingertips, a jade roller, or a comb to gently massage the hickey. Avoid working your tool too deep into the injury—if you press too hard, you risk worsening the hickey, so this method should be used with caution. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Let the area around the hickey rest to avoid worsening it. While some treatments may speed healing and reduce the appearance of your hickey, it will take some time to heal. If giving and receiving hickeys is a regular part of your make-out sessions, then you may want to ask your partner to focus on another region of your body that is not visible or injured. [19] X Research source A hickey—a bruise or hematoma—is an injury. You should rest the area just like you would any other type of bruise."

Your body is still developing and smoking can interfere with this process. Talk to your parents, a trusted family member, or a school counselor if you've started smoking.

      "content": "Cover your hickey with a color-correcting concealer and translucent powder. “A fresh hickey has red or purple tones, which you’ll first color-correct with a green or yellow color-correcting cream,” instructs professional makeup artist Ivy Boyd. Then, “go in with a concealer that matches or is one shade lighter than your skin tone. Set with powder.” “If the hickey has progressed into a yellow, green, or blue bruise,” Boyd clarifies, “you will likely need a more peachy color corrector followed by concealer and powder.” For a longer staying power, apply primer to the hickey before your green , yellow , or pink color-correcting concealer . Gently dab the area around the concealer using a makeup sponge until it blends gradually into your natural skin. You should not be able to notice you're wearing concealer when you look in the mirror."

      "content": "Wear a turtleneck or a collared shirt to cover the hickey. Clothing with high collars can help conceal the hickey for a day or so. Go for turtlenecks that completely conceal your neck, or try popping the collar on a collared shirt. [22] X Research source A turtleneck is probably a better option, as a collared shirt may not completely conceal the hickey. Keep in mind that people may get suspicious if you're wearing shirts that conceal your neck for several days in a row (especially if the weather doesn’t call for it!). Try concealing with a shirt for a day or two and then switch to another method."

Wearing a neck-covering accessory can be a cute way to conceal the hickey while adding a little flair to your outfit. A scarf, bandana, or even chunky jewelry—like a chain necklace—can temporarily conceal or distract from a hickey. [23] X Research source Much like covering your hickey with clothing, people may get suspicious if this is your go-to method for days. Try to add some variation to the accessories you use and move on to another method or excuse after a day or two."

      "content": "Use your hair to conceal the hickey in a pinch. If you have longer hair, you may be able to cover up your neck area with it. This is probably not a great solution for full-day coverage, but it can be used if you need to temporarily conceal the hickey. For example, maybe you’re hiding the hickey from your parents. If they pop into your room unexpectedly, you can quickly move your hair over the hickey."

      "content": "Hickeys typically last for about 3 days to 2 weeks. Hickeys are superficial bruises that sit on the surface of your skin. Because they’re superficial, they’re likely to have a shorter healing time than a deeper bruise (like a black eye). Most hickeys go away within 3-5 days. However, if your hickey is especially deep, it could take up to 2 weeks to disappear completely.
