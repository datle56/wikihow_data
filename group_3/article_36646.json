      "content": "Remove the grates and caps and soak them in soapy water. Fill an empty sink with warm water and some dish soap, and let the removable parts soak while you clean the rest of the stove. This is a great way to loosen stuck food and grease. [1] X Research source Caps are small, circular covers that lay over the heat source; the grates sit overtop of the caps. Some stovetops have connected caps and grates, but some are separate. Regardless of which type you have, simply lift the grates and the caps to remove them. The actual knobs that control the heat level can stay in place. Always wait to clean your stove until the burners are completely cooled if you cooked on them recently. [2] X Research source"

As you wipe the stovetop, rinse out and re-wet your sponge as needed. Repeat the process until the surface is as clean as possible. This part of the process clears away the excess grime so you can clearly see where your stove is burnt and needs some TLC."

      "content": "Make a paste out of equal parts salt, baking soda, and water. This mixture is best for ceramic stovetops. For ones made of glass or stainless steel, omit the salt. [3] X Research source This deep-cleaning paste should remove tough stains and marks from your stovetop. Mix everything in a small bowl. [4] X Research source You could also use a commercial cleaner especially made for a stovetop, but natural ingredients should work just as well. Plus, it could save you a trip to the store if you already have salt and baking soda in your cupboard."

Feel free to put it on anything stuck to your stovetop! [5] X Research source To give the paste enough time to saturate the mark, spend a few minutes on another task. You could clear out old leftovers from the fridge, sweep the floor, or empty the dishwasher while you wait."

If you’re cleaning your stove after dinner, you could leave them overnight and replace them in the morning. Always make sure the burners are completely dry before replacing them. If they’re still wet, they could cause problems when you turn on the burners. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Let the stovetop cool down completely before cleaning it. A recently used stovetop could easily burn you. Also, some cleaning materials could burn if they come into contact with hot surfaces, which would create more problems and more to clean up.

For example, you could do the dishes, clean out the microwave, wipe down the counters, or sweep the floor."

      "content": "Remove and clean the burner coils with a baking-soda paste. If your stovetop has removable burner coils (not all electric stovetops do), gently tug and pull them upward to remove them. Mix 1/2 cup (115 grams) of baking soda with 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 44 mL) of water. Spread the paste over the burners and set a timer for 20 minutes. Wipe the paste off with a wet towel when the timer goes off. [10] X Research source Some electric stovetops are made of completely flat ceramic, while others have metal coils that conduct electricity. If the coils are stuck, reference the user’s manual. If you don’t have one, search for a copy online. If your burners aren’t too dirty, you can wipe them down with a soapy, wet dishrag. Dry them with a lint-free towel and set them to the side. Use the 20-minute wait time to clean the rest of the stovetop."

      "content": "Sprinkle baking soda over the entire stovetop and spray it with vinegar. There’s no need to use an entire box of baking soda but use enough to coat the whole surface area lightly. Then, take a bottle of white vinegar and use it to saturate the baking soda. Pay particular attention to dirty spots, burns, and stains. [12] X Research source You can still make this work even if you don’t have a spray bottle filled with vinegar. Just cover the cap of an opened bottle of white vinegar with your thumb and carefully drizzle the vinegar over the baking soda. Avoid using glass cleaner on your electric stovetop. It’s a little too abrasive and could damage the surface."

Wring the towel out so it’s damp but not dripping. Then, lay it over the surface of your stove—if needed, use 2 towels. [13] X Research source This process keeps the baking soda from drying out and helps stains break down more quickly. If you happen to leave the kitchen for longer than 15 minutes, no worries! The baking soda-vinegar mixture won’t hurt your stovetop at all."
