      "content": "Dry texters often expect the other person to start the conversation . All conversations (including texts!) require an equal amount of give and take. Instead of waiting for the other person to shoot you a text, feel free to get the conversation going on your own.

      "content": "One-word texts don’t help a conversation live up to its full potential. Texts like “hey” and “hi” are easy to send, but can be a bit tricky to respond to. Longer messages are way more fun to reply to and show that you’re really interested and engaged in the conversation. Here are a few ideas to help you get started: “Hey there! You ready for the science test today?” “OMG you won’t believe the dog I just passed on my walk today 😭” “My sister just took me to a cat cafe and it was the cutest thing ever 🥺🐈 We’ve got to go together sometime!”"

      "content": "Your IRL convos focus on a specific topic, so make sure your text chats do, too. A basic “what’s up” or “you up” message doesn’t really mean anything; plus, it doesn’t give your texting partner much to work with. Make your message as clear and specific as possible, so the other person has no trouble replying. What Not to Say: “You up?” What to Say: “Trying to sleep and failing.. Any chance that you’re still awake? I’m so bored 😂”"

      "content": "This proves that you really care about and listen to what they say. Maybe your texting partner had a big test coming up, or they were stressing about an upcoming vet appointment for their pup. Shoot over a quick text to see how things are going—they’ll be touched that you cared enough to remember and ask. [2] X Research source “Hey there! I know you mentioned your sister checked into the hospital last week. I hope she’s doing okay, and I’m wishing you and your family the best! ❤” “How’d that math test go? I know you studied a lot last week.”"

      "content": "Give your texting partner the same time and attention you’d give an IRL friend. Yes, texting is meant to be a quick, on-the-go way of chatting with people—but that doesn’t mean your texts should sound super dry and detached. Take all the time you need to really read through the other person’s text, so you can send a thoughtful, engaging reply. What Not to Say: Them: “I just got a raise at my job!” You: “Oh, that’s cool” What to Say: Them: “I just got a raise at my job!” You: “That’s awesome! I’m so proud of you. You totally deserve this! 🥳💗”"

      "content": "A quick reply shows you’re interested and invested in the conversation. Let’s be real—texting convos are way more fun when you have a regular back-and-forth. While you don’t have to reply immediately to a message, do your best to reply within a few minutes so you seem really engaged in the convo. If you’re busy or in the middle of something, just reply when you’re free and able to text. You could say something like “Sorry I missed this! I was at the grocery store” or “So sorry for the late reply. I was just getting caught up on the math homework, LOL”"

Whatever the case, don’t be afraid to sprinkle it into your messages. After all, funny, personality-filled texts definitely aren’t dry! “What did the bartender say to the horse who walked in? Why the long face? 😏” “I was thinking about buying a PS5, but my bank account told me that it wasn’t a good idea 😔”"

[7] X Research source Your texts will be fun and interesting to read, and they definitely won’t come across as dry. “Was at the LEGO Store with my nephew and saw the Seinfeld LEGO set.

Are you on Team Coke or Team Pepsi?” “What’s your favorite pizza topping? Fair warning, I might judge you a little bit if you say anchovies 🤢” “What’s your favorite movie genre?

Spill all of the chaotic, zany details over text. It’s impossible for the other person to be bored when you’re sharing tons of interesting stories in your texting convo. ”I think even Gordon Ramsey would like this shrimp scampi I made 😤” “Guess who just stuck a red sock in their white laundry load?” “I’m technically a Sagittarius, but if you followed the 13-zodiac sign system I’d actually be an Ophiuchus 🤔”"

It’s top-secret! 🤐😏” “I’d love to hang out then, but I’ll be a little bit busy 😉”"
