      "title": "Use the Roman numerals VxVII or IxXXXV.",
      "content": "Use the Roman numerals VxVII or IxXXXV. To pass Rule 9, you need to enter Roman numerals that multiply to equal 35. Luckily, there are only two ways to multiply to 35: 5x7 or 1x35. In Roman Numerals, that would be VxVII (5x7) or IxXXXV (1x35). Add one of these sets to your password. Make sure you separate the 2 Roman numerals with an “x” when you add them to your password. If you type the 2 Roman numerals together without the “x,” the game interprets them as a different Roman numeral. The capital letters I, V, X, L, C, D, and M are Roman numerals, so don’t use them in any other part of your password, or they will count toward Rule 9, and you won’t pass. If you must use one of those letters, make sure it’s not capitalized."

Wordle is a web-based word game where you get 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word. If you play Wordle every day, you shouldn’t have any trouble with this rule. Even if you don’t guess the word in 6 tries, the correct answer is displayed over the top of the Wordle tiles after your last incorrect guess. If you don’t play Wordle and want to skip making 6 wrong guesses, simply do a Google search for “today’s Wordle answer.” Or check RockPaperShotgun.com for a list of past Wordle answers organized by date."

      "content": "Look at a Periodic Table of Elements to beat Rules 12 & 18. Rule 12 asks you to include a 2-letter symbol from the periodic table . Rule 18 requires that the elements in your password have atomic numbers that add up to 200. Use the 2-letter element symbols you chose for Rule 12 to find the atomic numbers on the periodic table. Add the numbers together, then swap out elements until the atomic numbers add up to 200. Some elements on the periodic table have a single capital letter as their symbol. If those capital letters are anywhere in your password, they count toward the total of the atomic numbers for Rule 18. I and V are both symbols for elements and Roman Numerals, so their atomic numbers count toward Rule 18 but must stay capital letters to count for Rule 12. C is the symbol for carbon on the periodic table and the Roman numeral for 100. Avoid using it for Rule 18 so you don’t break Rule 9."
