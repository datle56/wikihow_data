      "content": "Set up a small table to use for the ceremony. Find an open, uncluttered area of your home to arrange a small table or nightstand, which serves as the platform for the abhishekam ritual. You can cover the table with a special cloth or covering, or leave it bare. [1] X Research source The table doesn’t need to be large, but it should be able to fit your lingam, as well as any offerings."

      "content": "Arrange your lingam on your table with the yoni facing north. The lingam itself is a cylinder, which sometimes rests on a yoni, or a rounded disc.

      "content": "Put a draining plate beneath the lingam. If your lingam is small, lift and center it in the middle of a large plate.

Use whatever setup is best for your own home and religious needs."

A typical chant for this offering is, “Om divyaih puspaih samud bhutam sarvaguna samanvitam madhuram madhu na madhyam snartham pratigrh-yatam om sri Shiva namah madhu snanam samarpayami,\" which means “We offer this honey for your bath, which has been extracted from divine flowers.
