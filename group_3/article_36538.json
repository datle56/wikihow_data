If you're using a manual toothbrush, hold the brush at a 45-degree angle to your gums. For an electric toothbrush, follow the manufacturer's instructions to ensure you are using the brush correctly.

      "content": "Use a toothpaste with fluoride and tartar control. Fluoride is a mineral that strengthens tooth enamel and helps reverse acid damage. According to board-certified dentist Tu Anh Vu, it also \"helps re-mineralize the enamel on your teeth, which can help prevent future cavities.\" Your toothpaste should always contain fluoride, even if you live in an area where fluoride is added to the drinking water. You should also look for a toothpaste with tartar control. These use chemical compounds or antibiotics to destroy plaque, which prevents tartar buildup.

      "content": "Floss once a day. Plaque can build up between your teeth, where it's hard to remove simply by brushing. Use regular dental floss or y-shaped floss picks to remove food particles and plaque buildup so tartar can't form between your teeth. [8] X Research source If you see blood when you floss, board-certified dentist Tu Anh Vu explains that \"your gums are inflamed, and that you may need to floss a little more consistently.\" Vu also advises that \"your gums may bleed if you floss too aggressively, but they will heal.\""

      "content": "Use a dental scraper once a week. A dental scraper, or dental scaler, is a small tool which removes plaque and tartar from your teeth. It is similar to the tools your dentist uses. It should be curved to easily reach the spaces between your teeth, and should have a narrow or sharp tip. [9] X Research source To use the dental scraper, hold the tip against your tooth at your gumline and slowly glide it towards the biting edge of the tooth. Rinse it under running water, then repeat until all teeth are smooth and free of tartar. Use a handheld mirror to help you see tartar buildup, which looks like white or yellow stains. [10] X Research source If you feel uncomfortable using a dental scraper, use go between brushes. The go between brushes get rid of tartar between your teeth and on your teeth. To remove the tartar on your teeth use the go between brush like a dental scraper."

Try substituting sugary snacks for veggies like carrots, celery, and broccoli. [11] X Research source The bacteria that cause plaque love starchy and sugary foods. The more of these you eat, the more bacteria will thrive in your mouth. Be mindful of eating these foods only in moderation, and rinse your mouth with water or mouthwash shortly after eating.

      "title": "Quit smoking",
      "content": "Quit smoking if you do smoke. People who smoke have been shown to have higher levels of tartar than those who do not. This is due in part to the fact that smoking limits your mouth's ability to fight off bacteria, including the bacteria which causes plaque. In addition, tartar buildup can lead to infections, which you will have a harder time defending against as well. [13] X Research source Board-certified dentist Tu Anh Vu suggests \"getting your teeth cleaned every 3 months, rather than every 6 months.\" Write down your reasons for wanting to quit and remind yourself of these to stay strong through the quitting process. If you need more help to quit smoking, consider nicotine replacement therapy, such as nicotine gum, patches, or lozenges. If it's too hard to quit all at once, try cutting back at first. Gradually reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke every day until you don't smoke anymore."

      "content": "Visit your dentist every six months to remove tartar. Don't miss those dental checkups, even if you're practicing good dental hygiene on your own. Once tartar forms, it's almost impossible to remove all of it on your own, so you'll need to have a professional cleaning every 6 months. [14] X Research source Tartar buildup is more than just unsightly. Your body sees tartar as an infection and tries to attack it. Long-term tartar buildup can weaken your immune system and lead to other health problems throughout your body, including stroke, heart disease, and dementia. [15] X Research source"
