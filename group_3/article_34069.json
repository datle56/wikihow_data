  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Pick flowers that haven't fully bloomed yet.",
      "content": "Pick flowers that haven't fully bloomed yet. More mature blossoms are more likely to lose petals through air drying, so it's best to choose flowers that have just bloomed and haven't fully opened yet. If you are picking flowers from your own garden, go out in the morning after the dew has evaporated. [1] X Research source Flowers that air-dry well include roses and hydrangeas. [2] X Research source Marigolds, lavender, and cornflowers are other great options."

    {
      "title": "Remove excess leaves and cut the stems down to size.",
      "content": "Remove excess leaves and cut the stems down to size. The more leaves you keep on the stems, the longer your flowers will take to dry and the more likely your flowers are to attract mold. Cut the stems no shorter than 6 inches (15 cm). [3] X Research source Longer stems are easier to bind. You can always cut the stems after the flowers are dry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bind your flowers together with string or a rubber band.",
      "content": "Bind your flowers together with string or a rubber band. If you use twine to tie a bouquet of flowers together, you can tighten it as the flowers dry out. However, rubber bands can work just as well. [4] X Research source Make sure the flowers are tied tightly enough so that they don't slip out, but not so tightly that you're crushing the stems. Crushed stems can stay damp and get moldy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hang the flowers upside-down in a cool, dark place.",
      "content": "Hang the flowers upside-down in a cool, dark place. Use a piece of twine or ribbon to hang flowers upside-down from a hook on a closet door or from a shelf. A well-ventilated space will help the flowers dry out more quickly. Keeping the flowers out of direct sunlight will help them retain a little bit more color. The flowers should be dry in around 2-4 weeks. The flowers will change color as they dry and become less vibrant."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take the flowers down when the stems snap easily.",
      "content": "Take the flowers down when the stems snap easily. When the stems break cleanly in half, the flowers are done. You can leave them as they are to display dried bouquets, or you can snap off the blossoms and display them in a jar. You can also gently spritz the dried flowers with hair spray to make them last even longer and keep from crumbling. Use florist's foam to keep your flowers even more securely in place."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick fresh flowers and remove any leaves you don't want to preserve.",
      "content": "Pick fresh flowers and remove any leaves you don't want to preserve. For the best results, pick freshly-bloomed flowers after morning dew dries up. Cut the stem down to the size you want and remove the leaves from the stem, if you prefer. [5] X Research source Some good small flowers to dry include forget-me-not, buttercup, lilac, daisy, heather, sage, viola, and acacia. Some larger flowers to try could include rose, camellia, gardenia, marigold, peony, or hyacinth."

    {
      "title": "Place the flowers in a microwave-safe bowl filled with silica sand.",
      "content": "Place the flowers in a microwave-safe bowl filled with silica sand. Choose a bowl made of a material like pyrex that is safe to use in the microwave. Fill the bowl 1/3 of the way with silica sand. Place the flower on top of the sand. You can buy silica sand online or at hardware stores. [6] X Research source Silica sand can be expensive, but you can reuse it. If you prefer not to use silica sand, you can use kitty litter or even just place the flower on a paper towel. Using only a paper towel, the flower will take longer to dry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cover the flower with sand.",
      "content": "Cover the flower with sand. Make sure the flower is completely covered in silica sand so that it dries out evenly. If you are drying small flowers, you can put more than one in the same bowl. [7] X Research source You can dry however many flowers fit in the bowl at the same time, but it may take longer for them all to dry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Microwave the flowers for 2-3 minutes for 30 seconds at a time.",
      "content": "Microwave the flowers for 2-3 minutes for 30 seconds at a time. Place a glass of water in the microwave with the bowl of silica sand. Microwave the flower for 30 seconds at a time. Unbury part of the flower to check on it after each 30 second interval and rebury it if you need to put it back in the microwave. When the flower is dry to the touch, take it out of the microwave. [8] X Research source The bigger the flower is, the longer it will take to dry. Alternatively, you can leave the flowers covered in silica sand without microwaving them and wait for them to dry naturally."
    },
    {
      "title": "Leave the flower in the silica sand for a day.",
      "content": "Leave the flower in the silica sand for a day. In order to completely dry out, leave the flower in the silica sand for at least 24 hours. Once the flowers are completely dry, you can place them in a jar to display them. [9] X Research source Microwaving flowers is a shortcut for drying them out, and can sometimes result in inconsistent finishes. However, it is fast and easy."

    {
      "title": "Choose freshly-picked flowers with separated petals.",
      "content": "Choose freshly-picked flowers with separated petals. Hearty flowers with structure, rather than delicate and gauzy flowers, can support the wax the best. Choose flowers that are dry and light in color. Vibrant colors can look dull underneath wax. [10] X Research source Some good flowers to preserve with paraffin wax include camellia, gardenia, magnolia, hellebore, tulip, and daffodil. If your flowers are dewy or wet, the wax won't adhere."

      "title": "Set up a cold water bath and drying station.",
      "content": "Set up a cold water bath and drying station. The drying station can simply be a piece of parchment or craft paper on a countertop. To make a cold water bath, add ice cubes to a bowl full of tap water. Wait until the ice cubes melt or remove them from the bath after it cools down so that they don't damage the flower petals. [11] X Research source Paraffin wax is extremely flammable, so it's important to have everything set up before you start heating the wax. You can buy paraffin wax at hardware stores."

      "title": "Create a wax melting station.",
      "content": "Create a wax melting station. A double boiler is a safe and gentle way to melt paraffin wax. Set one up by boiling water in a medium-sized saucepan. Place a metal bowl or another saucepan on top of the first saucepan where you will melt the paraffin wax. [12] X Research source You can also use a stainless steel, 1 liter electric cooker on the lowest setting to safely melt wax."

      "content": "Melt paraffin wax mixed with mineral oil in the boiler or cooker. For every 1 pound (0.45 kg) of paraffin wax, use 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of mineral oil. Use a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature of the wax and keep it around 130 to 140 °F (54 to 60 °C). [13] X Research source Most projects will need at least 2 pounds (0.91 kg) of paraffin wax, but you may need up to 5 pounds (2.3 kg)."

      "content": "Dip the flowers one at a time in the wax for 1 second. Hold a single flower by the stem. Dip the entire blossom into the wax for 1 second. Gently shake it so that any extra wax drips back off into the boiler. [14] X Research source Take care not to drip any hot wax on yourself or your counter."

      "content": "Allow the flower to dry on the parchment paper. After the wax coating has completely hardened, take the flower out of the cold water bath and place it on the parchment paper. Once the flower is completely dry, you can arrange it for display in a jar or vase. [16] X Research source Flowers will last for several weeks to months using this method. You can also use florist's foam to keep your arrangements securely in place."

      "title": "Spritz your dried flowers with a little bit of hairspray.",
      "content": "Spritz your dried flowers with a little bit of hairspray. The hairspray will help fragile dried flowers hold up better. Coat the whole bud of the flower with a thin, even coat of hairspray. Any hairspray will do. If you don't have any on hand, the cheapest hairspray you can find will work just fine."

      "title": "Fill a jar with different-colored buds for a simple, elegant display.",
      "content": "Fill a jar with different-colored buds for a simple, elegant display. Start placing the flowers into a wide-mouthed jar, like a mason jar. To make it easier to fit more flowers in the jar, trim the stems off. Look at how the flowers appear from the outside of the jar while you are working, and rearrange them if necessary. Alternatively, you can arrange stemmed dried flowers in a bouquet for a rustic display."

    {
      "title": "Use a single color of flower for a monochromatic look.",
      "content": "Use a single color of flower for a monochromatic look. To get a color-coordinated display, try drying a bouquet of one type of flower, such as white daisies or red roses. You can also dry different kinds of flowers in the same color for variation in texture. Trim the stems off of the flowers to keep a monochromatic color scheme. [17] X Research source Alternatively, create layered or ombre look. Start by filling the jar 1/4 full of flowers in one color, then fill another 1/4 of the jar with another color, and so on until the jar is full."

      "title": "Place a single flower in a small jar for a minimalist look.",
      "content": "Place a single flower in a small jar for a minimalist look. Trim the stem off of a flower and place the dried bloom in a small jar or bottle. You can also try adding other natural decoration, such as pretty stones or shells, to add to your display. Try an apothecary jar for a romantic effect."

    {
      "title": "Pull the petals off of the flower to create a confetti display.",
      "content": "Pull the petals off of the flower to create a confetti display. Fill your jar with dried petals, rather than whole flowers, for a pretty keepsake. Dried rose petals are a good choice for a fragrant and pretty display. You can also add in dried lavender, cinnamon sticks, and whole cloves to make a delicious-smelling potpourri. [18] X Research source Go for a single color of flower petals to create a more understated look."

    {
      "title": "Avoid over-filling the jar.",
      "content": "Avoid over-filling the jar. To keep the flowers or petals intact, fill the jar loosely. When you notice that you have to press down on the buds to make them fit, the jar is too full. If your display looks a little sparse, fill it in with smaller flowers like baby's breath."

      "title": "Finish your display off with a bow made of twine.",
      "content": "Finish your display off with a bow made of twine. Tie a bit of twine or ribbon around the mouth of the jar for a bit of extra decoration. Twine will make your jar look more rustic, while choosing a coordinating color of ribbon can make your display more vintage chic. You can also add a pretty label or decorative stickers to the jar."
