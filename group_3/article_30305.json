      "title": "Place a square piece of origami paper flat and rotate it like a diamond.",
      "content": "Place a square piece of origami paper flat and rotate it like a diamond. Use yellow origami paper to create an authentic-looking Pikachu. Place the paper on a flat surface in front of you with the colored side down. [1] X Research source You can make a square out of normal white printer paper if you don’t have origami paper. Color it yellow before you start folding it to make it Pikachu’s color."

    {
      "title": "Fold the origami paper in half left to right, then unfold it.",
      "content": "Fold the origami paper in half left to right, then unfold it. Fold the left corner over the right corner and crease the middle. Unfold it into a diamond again so you can see the crease in the middle. [2] X Research source The crease will help guide your next folds to make your Pikachu."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the bottom half of the paper up to the top.",
      "content": "Fold the bottom half of the paper up to the top. Take the bottom corner and fold it up over the top corner. You will now have a yellow triangle with the top point facing away from you. [3] X Research source Make sure you can still see the crease in the middle to guide your next fold."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the top of the triangle down to the bottom edge.",
      "content": "Fold the top of the triangle down to the bottom edge. Take both layers of the top point of the triangle and fold it down so the tip touches the bottom edge. Make sure the tip is lined up with the crease in the middle of the triangle. [4] X Research source The origami should now look like a triangle with the top third of it cut off."

    {
      "title": "Fold the sides up diagonally towards the center.",
      "content": "Fold the sides up diagonally towards the center. Fold the left side up so that it creates half of a diamond. Do the same for the right side so you have a diamond with a space down the center. [5] X Research source Use the part of the triangle that you folded down as a guide for folding the sides up diagonally."

    {
      "title": "Fold the left and right corners in to the center.",
      "content": "Fold the left and right corners in to the center. Fold the corners in at each side like a paper airplane. This will create Pikachu’s ears that you will fold out next. [6] X Research source You should have a diamond shape in front of you that is long and narrow at the top, and short and wide at the bottom."

    {
      "title": "Fold the ears out to the left and right at whatever angle you want.",
      "content": "Fold the ears out to the left and right at whatever angle you want. Fold the left and right ears out at different angles to give your Pikachu some personality. Fold them at the same angle if you want your Pikachu to look symmetrical. [7] X Research source Look at how Pikachu’s ears are in different Pokémon scenes or artwork for inspiration."

      "content": "Fold in the pointy cheeks and chin of your Pikachu’s face. Fold the bottom point up to flatten the chin. Fold the left and right points in to flatten the cheeks. [8] X Research source Try to keep the folds symmetrical so that you create an evenly rounded face for Pikachu."

Use a red marker to draw the cheeks and color in the mouth. [9] X Research source You can draw many styles of Pikachu's face on your origami Pikachu. Make Pikachu happy, mad, or even sad! Try making a bunch of these easy origami Pikachu for every mood."

Flatten the paper along the creases so you have a triangle with a vertical piece of paper sticking up into the air. Flatten the vertical piece next so that you have 2 triangles. It should now look like 2 triangles, 1 on top of the other, with the top point facing away from you and the flat edge closest to you."

Flip the paper over and repeat this. You will now have a diamond shape with flat sides. Fold the top flaps down. Fold the left and right top flaps down in half and slide the tips into the little pockets. Flip over the paper and repeat this for the other side."
