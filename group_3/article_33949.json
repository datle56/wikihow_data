      "title": "Pick a spot that fits the sunlight needs of your plants.",
      "content": "Pick a spot that fits the sunlight needs of your plants. Vegetables and flowers usually require at least six hours of full, continuous sunlight a day to thrive. However, some plants prefer shade or little sun. Check the growing instructions for the plants you want to grow before you choose your spot. If your plants need full sun, find a spot in your yard where there is a lot of direct sun for the majority of the day. If your plants need partial shade, observe your yard throughout the day to see where the shady spots are. Put your garden in one of these patches."

      "title": "Choose a spot that is level and even.",
      "content": "Choose a spot that is level and even. The garden plot should be on flat, even ground. This will ensure water is evenly dispersed in the plot and everything grows evenly. If you have to choose a spot that is sloped, you will need to terrace the beds by building them up with boards, flat rocks, or wood slabs. [1] X Research source Make sure the spot is at least ten feet from trees and shrubs. You do not want the roots of trees or shrubs to get into the garden plot, as this can disrupt the plants. [2] X Expert Source Ben Barkan Garden & Landscape Designer Expert Interview. 2 June 2020. The shade of trees and tall shrubs can also negatively the garden plot."

      "title": "Use raised beds if you’re in a colder climate.",
      "content": "Use raised beds if you’re in a colder climate. Raised beds are boxed in wood above the ground. Raised beds are good for colder climates because the soil warms up faster in spring and you can plant sooner. This type of garden bed usually results in a higher yield of crops, especially vegetables. [3] X Research source You can buy raised beds made of cedar or recycled plastic at your local hardware store. You can also build your own raised garden beds ."

      "title": "Go for in-ground beds in a warmer climate.",
      "content": "Go for in-ground beds in a warmer climate. In-ground beds are more common than raised beds and are ideal for warmer climates. In-ground beds require less watering than raised beds. They also do not cost anything but they do require you to bend down to weed and maintain. [4] X Research source In-ground beds are more susceptible to weeds and pests than raised garden beds. They also usually yield less crops."

      "title": "Decide how many beds you are going to plant.",
      "content": "Decide how many beds you are going to plant. Usually a garden plot will have several beds. Multiple beds allows you to grow several different plants in one plot. You can then rotate the different beds to have healthy crops every year. A smaller plot of 100-200 square feet can fit four to six beds. A larger plot can fit eight to ten beds. [5] X Research source The beds should be 4 feet or less wide so they are easy to weed and tend. You should also include 21 inch (53 cm) pathways between the beds so you can roll a wheelbarrow through it. If you buy a raised garden bed box, you may not need to worry about having a pathway between the beds. Instead, make sure you place the boxes with enough space between them to walk through."

Not all plants that are considered weeds are harmful, so before you remove weeds, figure out which existing plants will be harmful and try to take over your garden. [6] X Expert Source Ben Barkan Garden & Landscape Designer Expert Interview. 2 June 2020. You can use a weed guide online to figure out what kind of plants are growing in your yard. [7] X Research source If you're growing larger plants, like trees and bushes, you can simply mow the surrounding weeds regularly to keep them at bay.
