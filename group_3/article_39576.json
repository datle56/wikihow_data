      "content": "“Sigma” describes someone who’s cool without trying. The word comes from the idea of a sigma male , which is someone who goes against the flow, or who plays by their own rules while still dominating the game. It’s a spin on alpha male theory , which is a theory that claims that some men are dominant “alphas.” [1] X Research source According to the theory, alpha males are leaders of the “pack,” while sigma males are equals who do things their own way. Example: “He dresses however he wants and still gets dates. He’s a total sigma.” Example: “Brad might be the alpha of the group, but Chad is the sigma.”"

      "content": "“Sigma” is slang for “cool” or “best.” Sigma can be used to describe more than just a cool guy. Something that's \"sigma\" is different, neat, or better than others. You can use to talk about pretty much anything. Example: “I aced that test without studying. I guess I’m just that sigma.” Example: “Your car is so sigma. It’s like the sickest car I’ve ever seen.”"

      "content": "Sigma is also often used ironically or nonsensically. As the word found the mainstream and caught its fair share of parody and criticism, it’s also taken on an ironic or sometimes downright silly meaning, used to make fun of the concept of “sigma males” and to make new and silly phrases for fun. [2] X Research source Example: “That wasn’t very sigma of you.” Example: “Rizzing up the gyatt like a skibidi sigma!”"

      "title": "Use “sigma” to describe someone or something that’s cool.",
      "content": "Use “sigma” to describe someone or something that’s cool. Sigma means something like “cool,” but there’s a little extra flavor to it—it’s cool and different. Someone who’s a sigma is charismatic and a free thinker. Something that’s sigma is unusual and appealing. Example: “He always leaves the party so early because he’s such a sigma. He doesn’t care what people think.” Example: “I never study, but I always pass. Guess I’m just a sigma or something.”"

      "title": "Use “sigma” as a joke.",
      "content": "Use “sigma” as a joke. The truth is, many people who use the term “sigma” aren’t being 100% serious. Often, it’s associated with “brainrot,” which is when someone spends so much time online that their vocab and behavior become total nonsense. Other times, people use the term to make fun of the very concept of “alphas” or “sigmas.” A TikTok video showing Squidward from SpongeBob SquarePants seemingly saying “Erm, what the sigma?” went viral and increased the popularity of this phrase."

      "content": "“Sigma” refers to pseudo-scientific personality types. The term was coined by far-right writer Vox Day in 2010. Day said that “sigma males” are outsiders who don’t care about the “social game,” but who win it anyway. He used “sigma” as an alternative to “alpha male,” or the dominant or most popular male in the group. [3] X Research source The concept of “alphas” is based on a myth that wolf packs have an \"alpha\" or leader of the pack. [4] X Research source The concept of “sigma males” was adopted by popular “pickup artists” and masculinity influencers on YouTube, boosting its popularity."

The tweet went viral, rocketing “sigma” into the mainstream, when it began to appear elsewhere online, like in TikToks, where it’s been used both sincerely and ironically. [5] X Research source Since, many different “sigma” memes have taken shape and spread, like the tongue-in-cheek “sigma grindset,” which parodies unhealthy productivity standards."
