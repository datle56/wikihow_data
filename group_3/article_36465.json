      "title": "Taking the bandage off after a day prevents fluid buildup.",
      "content": "Taking the bandage off after a day prevents fluid buildup. Within the first day of getting a new tattoo, it may start “weeping,” which means plasma and ink push out from your skin. When you notice the fluid building up underneath your bandage and covering your tattoo, then it’s time to take the Saniderm off. [1] X Research source It’s completely normal for a new tattoo to weep and it won’t affect how the design looks, so you don’t need to worry. You can remove a Saniderm bandage as soon as 8 hours after it’s first applied if the adhesive starts to weaken. This is more common on tattoos that have heavily saturated colors or shading.

      "content": "Wet the bandage to make it less painful to remove. Wash your hands before you remove the bandage to stop germs from getting on your tattoo. To take off a sticky Saniderm bandage, hop into a warm shower or run it under a faucet to get it wet. The running water will help loosen the adhesives on the bandage so you can easily peel it off without pain. Avoid submerging the bandage or your tattoo in standing water since it could increase your risk of infection. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Oils break down the adhesive so it doesn’t feel as sticky.",
      "content": "Oils break down the adhesive so it doesn’t feel as sticky. If water isn’t enough to make the edges of the bandage peel off, take a dab of baby oil , coconut oil , or olive oil and rub it around the edges with your fingers. As the oil breaks down the adhesive, gently try to peel up a corner of the Saniderm bandage so it’s easier to pull off. [4] X Research source Alternatively, you can apply Sanibalm around the edges, which is specifically made for tattoo aftercare."

      "title": "Slowly remove the bandage to prevent damage to sensitive skin.",
      "content": "Slowly remove the bandage to prevent damage to sensitive skin. Hold onto a loose edge of the bandage and gently peel it off of your skin. Work slowly and wet the Saniderm whenever the adhesive is giving you trouble. Once you remove the entire bandage, toss it directly into the trash. [5] X Research source New tattoos can make your skin pretty sensitive, so avoid aggressively pulling or yanking on the bandage so you have a pain-free removal."

      "title": "Clean your tattoo",
      "content": "Clean your tattoo to stop it from getting infected. Wet your tattoo with clean, lukewarm water and gently massage antibacterial soap on your skin. Rub the soap in with your fingers using circular motions until the suds cover your entire tattoo. Then, just rinse the soap off under running water. [6] X Research source Avoid using a washcloth or rag to wash your tattoo since they can harbor bacteria and could cause an infection on your tattoo."

      "title": "Paper towels keep you from spreading germs onto your tattoo.",
      "content": "Paper towels keep you from spreading germs onto your tattoo. Press a fresh piece of paper towel onto your tattoo to lift up the water. Avoid rubbing your skin with the towel since it could cause more pain and irritation around your new tattoo. Alternatively, you can let your tattoo air-dry for a few minutes. Steer clear of using a regular towel to dry your tattoo since they’re more likely to contain germs that could infect your skin as it heals."

      "title": "Keep your tattoo protected for the first 3–5 days of healing.",
      "content": "Keep your tattoo protected for the first 3–5 days of healing. Trim a Saniderm bandage so it extends about 1 inch (2.5 cm) past the edges of your tattoo and round the corners so it fits more comfortably. Remove the white paper backing on the bandage and gently press it onto your tattoo. Smooth the bandage out from the center towards the edges before you remove its clear outer layer. Leave the second bandage on for another 3–5 days before you remove it under warm, running water. [7] X Research source Try not to flex your muscles as you apply the bandage since you could cause the Saniderm to bunch up or loosen prematurely. You can easily shower with a Saniderm bandage on. Just avoid picking or rubbing the edges while you’re washing up so it doesn’t come off prematurely. [8] X Research source Keeping your tattoo covered while it’s healing during the first week protects it from getting irritated or infected."
