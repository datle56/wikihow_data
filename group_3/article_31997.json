Identify what your main objectives are, set up steps to take, and follow your plan. Make a list of the things you fear.

Are you concerned with looking good, having bad breath, or sweating too much? Approach your dilemma one step at a time. For example, if you are afraid to ask someone on a date, start by first asking a stranger what time it is. Although you won't be asking the person on a date or to have a sexual encounter, you will gain experience approaching someone and asking them a question. This is the first step toward your goal. Working toward a solution will help lessen your fear. Creating a plan of action helps you feel like you can do something to improve your situation."

You can handle it.” You are stronger than you think. If you feel you lack adequate coping skills, you can take steps to improve them. For example, take notice of the way you effectively cope with another type of fear in your life and apply the same technique. Also, observe how someone you admire copes with difficult situations. Ask them for suggestions that you can implement.
