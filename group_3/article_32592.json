For this kick, I found, it's better if your knees are bent a little more and if your legs are wider apart because that way you will be able to kick a lot higher. How much you lean back on your non-kicking leg also has an influence on how high your kick will be. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Fists clenched tight and strong, legs digging deep into the ground stable, get ready to turn. If you're gonna kick with your right leg, step in with your left leg. If you're gonna kick with your left leg, step in with your right leg. If you kick with your right leg, your right leg should be out in front of you and your back or left leg trailing behind which you will bring around in front which will start the spinning aspect of the hook kick. And vice versa with the other leg."

      "content": "Now, you've spun about 180 degrees and are looking over your kicking leg's shoulder. Some people who perform this kick make the mistake of not looking over their shoulder confidently and therefore not looking into their opponent's eyes confidently and instead looking at the ground. Don't do this! This not only makes you look stupid and timid and uncertain, but it also dampens your target and aim of knockout: the opponent's head. Also, there is a higher risk of falling flat on your face. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Now comes the actual kick.",
      "content": "Now comes the actual kick. Let's briefly go over The Hook Kick. It's self-explanatory really. The kick goes in the motion of a hook. For this, imagine a fish hook. Or the hook attached to a Pirate Captain's missing hand. There's a fs and bs Hook Kick and fs and bs with practically all other kicks, but in this WikiHow we are going over the bs kick so don't get it mistaken with the fs spinning hook kick. If you can't tell a fs spin hook between a bs spin hook then maybe this will help: If you are doing a fs spin hook kick with your right leg then you are spinning left rather than right and doing your kick from there. And vice versa with the other leg. But with the bs spin hook kick, the one we are going over in this WikiHow, you are spinning right and then doing your kick from there. So now, once again, onto the actual kick. The(stationary) bs Hook Kick. This is the one for kicking with your right leg. So, you're in stance, right leg in front, left leg in back. Same concept with your fists covering your face. Leaning most of your weight on your non-kicking(left)leg, you begin to bring up the kicking(right)leg in a sweeping, rainbow curvature-like hook motion with the sharp, glimmering point ending at the right. You are using either the heel or the ball of the foot to inflict damage upon your opponent's head. This may come naturally but it is recommended that when you begin the kick you turn your non-kicking, standing leg slightly more to the left so your kicking leg can have more space to make a wider and therefore more effective arch in its kick.

      "content": "Now back to the Spinning Hook Kick. So, you're turned about 180 degrees and you are looking over your shoulder, your fists clenched tightly up to your chest. From here, lift up your kicking leg and do a Hook Kick like how we went over in step 6. Since you're spinning you will have more momentum in your hook kick and may even flip your opponent over if you kick him/her in the head hard enough, with a grand sweep, almost shoving.

When you bring both legs back down it'll be like Step 2 again and you can get ready for another spinning hook kick but by now, s/he will surely be on the ground, wanting absolutely no more of you."
