      "content": "Put up gates before your baby starts crawling. Most babies begin crawling when they are between 7 to 10 months, so experts recommend installing baby gates when your child is about 6 months old. Since babies develop skills at different rates, keep an eye out for when your child starts experimenting with crawling to determine if you need to put gates up sooner. [1] X Research source This may seem a bit early, but it's better to be over prepared: most babies progress from small movements to fast crawling fairly quickly. [2] X Research source Some babies skip the crawling stage and go directly to walking. If this happens with your child, you may be able to wait until they are 8-12 months old before you need to install gates. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove the baby gate when you child can get around it. Baby gates are generally safe and necessary for children between 6 months and 2 years old. However, every situation is unique since children develop skills at different rates. When your child is able to climb over the safety gate or has figured out how to open it, you should remove it and teach them how to safely navigate that area of your house. Otherwise, the gate can create its own falling, climbing, and tripping hazards. [4] X Research source Larger or stronger children may outgrow their baby gates sooner. [5] X Research source If you still need to use a baby gate for a younger sibling, try to teach your older children how to open and close the gate themselves. Any adults in the house should go through the gates properly (rather than stepping over them) to help teach by example. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a hardware-mounted model for the top of a staircase. Hardware mounted gates, also called permanent gates, are screwed into the wall or doorway on either side of the gate. Although they take more effort to install, they are far more stable than pressure-mounted gates, which can be easily jarred loose with a hard push. To prevent your baby from taking a dangerous spill down the stairs, always use a hardware-mounted gate in this hazardous location. [7] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Falls from stairs are the leading cause of emergency department visits for children under the age of 2, so it's very important to place hardware-mounted gates at the top of any staircase in your home.

      "title": "Use pressure-mounted gates in less hazardous locations.",
      "content": "Use pressure-mounted gates in less hazardous locations. Pressure-mounted gates are held in place across an opening by the pressure they exert against the door frame or walls. These gates are less secure than hardware-mounted gates and are therefore best for areas where falling isn't a major concern, such as in a doorway between two areas with same-level flooring. You should also install pressure-mounted gates at the bottoms of staircases to prevent children from climbing up the stairs and then falling back down. [9] X Research source For example, you may want to use a pressure-mounted gate to block off the pantry or kitchen, keeping your child away from hazardous foods or choking hazards. [10] X Research source You can also use pressure-mounted gates to separate your baby from any pets in your home until they're more comfortable together. [11] X Research source Do not place pressure-mounted gates at the top of the stairs. They can become dislodged, allowing your child to fall down the stairs. The bar at the bottom of these gates can also serve as a tripping hazard for adults. [12] X Research source"

If you have a used gate, make sure it meets current safety standards by checking product recalls from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission: https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls . [13] X Research source Avoid using older accordion-style gates with diamond or V-shaped openings wider than 1.5 inches (3.8 cm). These are not considered to be safe because a baby's arms or neck could become trapped in the open spaces. [14] X Research source Use a gate meant specifically for children. Do not reuse gates intended for pets. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Measure the opening to ensure your gate will fit. Use a tape measure to figure out the length of the open you hope to block with the gate. Most gates will fit into a standard doorway, but you may need to do a bit more digging to find the right model for wider or narrower spaces. If you're installing your gate at the top of a staircase, make sure to measure at least 6 inches (15 cm) back from the edge of the top stair. This is where you'll want to place the gate."

      "content": "Locate a stud or wooden door frame to support the gate. For maximum stability, you should attach the gate's mounting hardware onto the solid wood of a door frame or, if the opening doesn't have a wood door frame, through the drywall and plaster into the wood framing of the wall. Manufacturers usually supply plastic plugs to screw the baby gate into the drywall itself, but most experts agree they aren't strong enough on their own. Instead, use a stud finder to locate the wood framing (stud) behind the drywall. [16] X Research source Do not install hardware onto round or uneven banister posts. This can cause your gate to be unstable or difficult to open and close. [17] X Research source If there is no wall stud located where you want to place the gate, build a frame by mounting a piece of wood vertically on each side of the gate. Attach the frame to the drywall using a toggle bolt (also known as a butterfly anchor) or a wooden stairwell post. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Screw the mounts or hinges on the wall. Once you've located a sturdy place to hang the gate, use a screwdriver or drill to attach the wall mounts. The exact form of the mounts will depend on the type of gate you buy: if the gate hinges from one side rather than opening with a door in the center, you will install hinges on one side of the frame. Either way, the baby gate should come with the appropriate mounting hardware. Use screws that are long enough to extend through the hardware, drywall, and into the wall stud for maximum stability. Sometimes the screws that come with gates are not long enough, so you may need to replace them with your own supplies. [19] X Research source The bottom wall mount or hinge should be no more than 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the floor. Installing it any higher will create a risk for your baby to become trapped it if they try to crawl underneath. [20] X Research source Install the mounts so that the gate will swing open over the floor, not over the steps. [21] X Research source"

If the gate wobbles or appears unsteady as you test it, try tightening the screws attaching the wall mounts.

Some pressure-mounted gates, especially those with a door in the middle, will extend to meet the walls using a small cups on each corner of the gate. To install these models, place the gate into the opening and spin the bolts to extend the wall cups to meet the door frame or wall. You'll be able to tell that the gate is correctly fitted when there is no gap between the frame and the handle of the door. [26] X Research source Some pressure-mounted baby gates have two sliding panels that you can adjust to make the gate fit the opening (you'll remove the panels or slide them to the side to walk through). Pull the panels away from one another until they extend to fill the entire doorway or wall space. The pressure of the panels against the walls or door frame should hold the gate upright. [27] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Other gates may extend in different ways. Make sure to follow the manufacturers' instructions and call the manufacturer directly if you have any questions or concerns. [28] X Research source The bottom of the gate should be no more than 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the floor to prevent trapping hazards. [29] X Research source"
