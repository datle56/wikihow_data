      "content": "Call the police in an emergency. If you witness a violent act against a child or you feel a child is in immediate danger, call the police department. It's important to have someone come to investigate and assess the child's safety right away. Reporting suspicion of child abuse to a hotline does not always result in immediate action, so make the call as to whether the child needs help right now or if there's time for a slower investigative process. Call 911 to reach emergency services if you are in the United States. Call 999 if you are in the United Kingdom. Call 000 if you are in Australia. Do not delay reporting all known or suspected cases of abuse, neglect, or maltreatment to law enforcement. As an individual, you are protected against any civil and criminal penalty and adverse employment actions for such reports. As a reporter, your information is kept strictly confidential."

Provide as much information as you can about the situation. Tell the truth, and do not exaggerate. Based on the answers to your questions, the hotline will determine whether to send Child Protective Services (CPS) to conduct an investigation. Be ready to provide as much information as you can to answer questions like the following: What is the child's name, age and address? What is your relationship to the child? What is the suspected abuser's name, address, and license plate number? What is their relationship to the child? What are the names, addresses and phone numbers of the child's parents? What type of abuse do you suspect? What are your reasons for suspecting it? When did it occur? What is the current location of the child? What is the child's current level of safety? Are there other witnesses? What are their names, addresses and telephone numbers? Are there any evidence of previous incidents?"

      "title": "Understand your legal protections.",
      "content": "Understand your legal protections. Many people hesitate to report child abuse because they do not want to get personally involved in another family's home situation. They are afraid the abuser will find out who made the report, and that there will be repercussions. Remember that every state has laws to prevent someone reporting child abuse from getting sued or penalized for reporting abuse in good faith. If you are still worried about giving your name and relationship to the child, and you are not a mandated reporter, you can make an anonymous report. When you call the child abuse hotline, specify that you want to make an anonymous report. In some states, you may be required to give your name as part of the investigative process. Child welfare agencies encourage reporters to give their name and contact information if possible. They may want to call you back with follow-up questions or stay in touch to determine if you see more signs of abuse."

      "title": "Make follow-up calls if necessary.",
      "content": "Make follow-up calls if necessary. Child Protective Services typically do not respond to reports quickly unless they believe that the child is in immediate danger. If the abuse situation continues after you've made a report, call again to make another one. If more reports are filed, CPS will be more likely to prioritize the case of the child in question. Encourage other witnesses to make reports, too. Don't expect to receive follow-up information from CPS after making a report. CPS does not typically call back to let you know how the situation turned out."

      "content": "See if you have reasonable suspicion of abuse. If you have any type of information that leads you to believe the child is in danger, that can qualify as reasonable suspicion. You do not have to have hard evidence that abuse is happening. If you are in doubt, call the local Child Protective Services (CPS) for a consultation to determine whether you should make a report. [1] X Research source Some people do not want to take action because they fear they will be breaking up a family. CPS aims to do whatever it takes to keep families together. They may help parents get parenting classes or find a solution that keeps the children in the home. Do not let fear of breaking up a family stop you from intervening to save a child from harm."

      "title": "Look for patterns.",
      "content": "Look for patterns. Seeing a typical one sign of abuse may not be sufficient reason to believe that a child is actually being abused. For example, if a child shows up to school dirty with ill-fitting clothes for a day or two, there may be a valid explanation. However, if you notice a pattern that repeats over time and doesn't subside, this is a clear warning sign that abuse may be happening. Even if you aren't completely sure that a child is being abused, if you feel justifiably suspicious, it's worth reporting. If you're wrong, there may be inconvenience to the family, but ultimately no harm done. If you're right, you may be responsible for helping to alter a child's circumstances for the better. Please note that not all shifts in behavior, attitudes, or perceptions are indications that a child is being abused or experiencing abuse. It is important to remember that children are affected by their environments."

If, based on what the child says, you have reasonable suspicion that abuse is taking place, take steps to report suspected abuse. When a child explains what is happening, do not display shock or disgust, since these strong emotions could scare the child. Instead, calmly reassure the child that you are there to help.
