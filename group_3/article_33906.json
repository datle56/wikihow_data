      "title": "Use a starch-testing solution to test plants for glucose.",
      "content": "Use a starch-testing solution to test plants for glucose. When plants go through photosynthesis, they produce glucose. Plants store this glucose in the form of starch. Iodine reacts with starch and turns it dark blue or black. This test can be performed on a leaf to determine whether or not a plant has gone through photosynthesis. [1] X Research source Iodine takes a long time to dissolve. Prepare this solution at least 24 hours in advance of the starch test. To perform the starch test, boil a leaf in water before placing it in a glass beaker. Place the beaker in ethanol and boil the leaf until the color is gone. Then, place the leaf in a petri dish and sprinkle it with a few drops of the iodine solution to see how it reacts. You must wear gloves and protective eyewear if you’re performing this test.

To keep chemicals from damaging your eyes, put on a pair of airtight laboratory goggles. Open the windows in your room or turn a fan on to increase the ventilation.

      "content": "Dissolve 6 grams of potassium iodide in distilled water. Fill a clean beaker or flask with 200 mL (0.85 c) of distilled water . Then, use a scale and scooper to weigh out 6 grams of potassium iodine. Pour the potassium iodine carefully into your water. [4] X Research source Potassium iodine comes in liquid, tablet, or powder form. Don’t use tablets for this, since they’ll take too long to dissolve in the water. Liquid is a poor option as well, since it will be hard to measure out correctly. Potassium iodide is added to iodine to stabilize it. Iodine on its own isn’t neutral enough to react with the plant matter. You can purchase potassium iodide (along with your iodine crystals) online or from a chemical supply company."

      "title": "Mix the solution with up to 1 L (4.2 c) of distilled water.",
      "content": "Mix the solution with up to 1 L (4.2 c) of distilled water. Add a little distilled water to the beaker or flask. Mix the solution with a glass mixing stick for 30-60 seconds. If the crystals dissolve entirely, you can stop. If they don’t dissolve after a little mixing, add more water and mix it again. Continue this process by adding water as needed until the crystals fully dissolve. Do not exceed 1 L (4.2 c) of water to keep the solution potent enough for testing. [6] X Research source If you add more than 1 L (4.2 c) of water, it will be extremely difficult to see the iodine solution reacting with the plant when you apply it."

Store the solution at room temperature. [7] X Research source If you don’t have a dark bottle, you can wrap a clear container in aluminum foil or store it in a dark cabinet. The solution will typically remain stable for 1-2 months."

      "content": "Create Lugol’s iodine to use as a medication. Named after the doctor that invented it, Lugol’s iodine is an iodine solution used primarily as a medication. It is ingested orally as a temporary treatment for thyrotoxicosis, a hormone disorder caused by an overactive thyroid. You may need to mix Lugol’s iodine if you’re in medical school, taking an advanced college course, or in an emergency situation where you need to treat thyrotoxicosis. [8] X Research source You can purchase pre-mixed Lugol’s iodine over the counter at some pharmacies and supplement stores. Prepare this solution at least 24 hours in advance of using it. It takes a while for the iodine to completely dissolve in the water, even if it looks like the solution is thoroughly mixed. Lugol’s iodine can also be used to disinfect surgical incisions, remove mercury residue, and screen for cervical cancer. It’s mainly known as a medicine, though."

Then, turn off the hot plate and move the beaker or flask to a heat-safe surface. [12] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Potassium iodide comes in powder, liquid, or tablet form. Do not use the tablets or liquid forms for this. The tablets will take too long to dissolve and the liquid is difficult to measure in small amounts. Do not allow the iodide to boil or bubble. You only need to raise the temperature slightly to combine your ingredients."
