      "content": "We can’t confirm if Packman carts are real or fake cannabis. Reddit users regularly call Packman out as an illegitimate product. On subreddits like r/fakecartridges , users often say Packman carts “boof” or “bunk,” which is drug slang for poor-quality products. Other users say that Packman carts are unregulated and filled with pesticides. We do know that Packman isn’t a verified cannabis brand by any government agency and legit cannabis dispensaries don’t sell Packman products, indicating that the product may be fake."

      "content": "Many websites claim the Packman brand. Unlike many official cannabis brands, which have one central website and maybe 1-2 social media accounts per platform, Packman has various websites and social media accounts, making it hard to determine which is the real one (or if any of them are real at all). On the following websites, information about Packman tends to be unclear, inaccurate, or unavailable, despite each claiming to be “official”: packmandisposable.us.com packmanofficial.com officialspackman.com packmancarts.company.site packmancartstore.com packmanvapes.org packmanvapes.com"

      "content": "Anyone can order Packman carts online and fill them with their own oil. The packaging and materials for Packman carts are available for anyone to order online and fill with their own oil. The cart packaging may look genuine, but there's no way of knowing what kind of oil is inside. Some black market sellers are known to fill their carts with oils that contain additives, pesticides, and other harmful materials. Black market sellers often use cutting agents to alter the effects of their product, make it last longer, and increase their profits."

      "content": "No, as they aren’t recognized by major government agencies. While there are many Packman websites and social media accounts that claim to be dedicated to the sale of cannabis products, none of them are officially recognized. Their websites also don’t follow state standards for marijuana products, like asking if the user is 21 and requiring proof of identification before purchasing. Verifiable information about the brand is also extremely hard to come by. Their CEO is unknown, with one Packman website simply referring to them as John Smith."

      "title": "Fake carts are unsafe because they're unregulated and sold on the street.",
      "content": "Fake carts are unsafe because they're unregulated and sold on the street. Fake cartridges like Packmans aren’t lab tested in compliance with state regulations, making it impossible to know what’s been added to the cart (and whether it’s dangerous to your health) before buying it. They are also primarily sold on the street and not by licensed dispensaries, meaning that if you buy one, you’re breaking the law and using an illegal, unregulated cannabis product. Fake carts pose a major risk to your lung health, as the harmful additives can cause lung disease. [1] X Research source Many fake carts use synthetic cannabis and are not sold by legal dispensaries. Street vendors often fill their products with vitamin E acetate, which is a dangerous chemical that can cause severe damage to your lungs. [2] X Research source In 2019, vitamin E acetate was found in the cartridges linked to the deaths of various people who had EVALI (e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury)."

      "content": "Packaging Legitimate packaging should be in line with your state’s requirements. So, if you’re looking at the package of your cart and notice that it doesn’t have harvest or “use by” dates, isn’t child-proof, and doesn’t contain the date of final testing and packaging, it’s likely a fake. Fakes also tend to have poor, low-quality images, so be on the lookout for that, as well. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Pricing",
      "content": "Pricing If the price of your cart is significantly lower than what dispensaries in your area sell carts for, you likely have a fake on your hands. For example, if a one-gram dispensary cart is priced at $50 and someone is trying to sell you a two-gram cart for $30, it’s likely fake. [4] X Research source To save yourself from potentially buying a fake cart, avoid purchasing your THC products off the street."

      "title": "Oil Color & Quality",
      "content": "Oil Color & Quality The oil on genuine carts is typically golden and clean, while the oil on fake carts tends to be dark, murky, and runny. So, if you notice that your cart has really runny oil that’s hard to see through, you may want to look into getting it lab tested, as it’s likely fake. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Smell & Taste",
      "content": "Smell & Taste Fake carts have a chemical or metallic taste and smell. Fake carts typically deliver a rough, harsh hit that produces strong, painful coughs. So, if you’re hitting your cart and notice that there’s a foul, unnatural chemical taste in your mouth (or you open the package to that same smell), then you’re holding onto a fake.

      "content": "Buy your carts at licensed dispensaries in legal states. As of 2025, recreational cannabis is legal in 25 states, from Illinois, California, and Colorado to Michigan, Missouri, and Connecticut. If you reside in a legal state, always buy your carts from licensed dispensaries. They are required by law to lab test their products and ensure that they’re safe for human consumption, unlike street vendors and unlicensed dispensaries. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "What does it mean if a cart is fake?",
      "content": "What does it mean if a cart is fake? A fake cart means that the packaging and materials were purchased online and filled with unregulated, untested oil or distillate. The packaging and materials are often made to imitate real brands or get over on unsuspecting customers, making fake carts especially dangerous. The packaging and materials for fake carts are often affordable and ready to purchase online, which has spurred the spread of illegitimate, unverified carts."

      "title": "What color is the oil in a fake cart?",
      "content": "What color is the oil in a fake cart? The oil on a fake cart is typically darker and dirtier than the oil in a real cart, coming in a slightly reddish or clear tint due to the oil being diluted by unknown additives. On the other hand, real oil will typically come in a golden color with clean, consistent oil throughout the cartridge."

      "title": "What are the side effects of hitting fake carts?",
      "content": "What are the side effects of hitting fake carts? Fake carts are typically more potent than natural cannabis, as they use synthetic cannabinoids. Synthetic cannabinoids are considered fake, as they aren’t natural, contain potentially dangerous additives, and are unregulated. This means that the effects are stronger and that it’s much easier to use too much. If you use too much, you may experience unpleasant and harmful effects, but they range. Typical side effects from fake carts include: [9] X Research source Happy, euphoric, relaxed feelings with giggles, hunger pangs, and talkative moods. Mood and perception changes. Difficulties with concentration and coordination. Paranoia, panic attacks, and forgetfulness."
