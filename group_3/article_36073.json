      "content": "Cycle through your other passwords. Operating under the assumption that people forget their passwords one at a time, it is usually a good idea to try out other personal passwords you tend to use regularly. While it's now common practice for web users to use separate passwords for different things, some passwords are often used for numerous things. If you're unsure, it's altogether possible that you didn't actually forget a password, but only forgot that a certain password corresponded with an account. Don't forget to try out old or out-of-date passwords as well if the account you're trying to access is fairly old."

      "content": "Try out the obvious. Any hunt for passwords cannot go without touching upon the most obvious, common answers. This is especially true if you have no idea what the password is and you're trying to guess from scratch. Try to think of the most intuitive, obvious passwords you may have chosen. Passwords like 'Password', 'Cheeseburger', or your full name are incredibly easy for hackers to exploit, and if you think you may have defaulted with one of those, you'll at least have given yourself an easy code to break. Some of the most common passwords include '123456', 'abc123', 'qwerty', and 'iloveyou'. Birthdays are also common. If you think you may have been sneaky enough to add a twist on an otherwise weak password, try out testing some basic encryptions. For instance, if you may have used your name or your birth year in the password, try spelling them backwards. Most passwords today require at least one number. The most common numerical addition is to add a '1' at the end of the password; the second most common addition is to add one's birthday (e.g. 1992)."

      "content": "Recall your life at the time you made the password. In a lot of cases, people will find inspiration for their passwords from their life and surroundings. If you have a rough idea of when the account and password were created, try to look back on that time and decide what important factors may have influenced your choice of password. Did you have a significant other at the time, or a pet? Setting some time aside to reflect upon your past is helpful if you're trying to remember something specific like a password. Other examples include your hometown, your favourite sports team, or the name of your best friend. Stressing yourself out while trying to remember will have the opposite effect you want it to. The human brain has a much harder time retrieving information while under duress, so make sure to relax, breathe, and remind yourself that nothing is the end of the world."

      "content": "Make sure you're typing correctly. Whenever you're typing in your password, make sure you're writing accurately. Something as simple as leaving the Caps Lock key on will reject an otherwise correct password, and runs the risk of giving you the impression that the right answer is actually wrong! Since passwords are usually shown as asterisks (*) on the screen, it's important you type a password carefully if you're unsure about it. This is especially important when you're making a password for the first time. If you accidentally confirm a typo in your password, you'll stand very little chance of retrieving it in the future."

      "content": "Meditate . While it may sound like the hardest thing to do when you're stressed out over losing access to a computer or account, relaxing via meditation can be a powerful tool for memory retrieval. Sometimes, the most effective way to remember something is to try not thinking about it at all. Take a deep breath, and gradually release the frustration from your body; being anxious or angry isn't getting you any closer to finding your password, so you should instead focus on becoming as serene as possible. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source While true relaxation cannot occur if you're simply going about it as a way to remember, it's possible you'll remember it once you're in a clearer state of mind. Going for a run or working out helps a great deal as well. The mind tends to function much better when the body is in motion!"

      "content": "Purchase and use a password cracker. There are certain programs available that are specifically designed to retrieve lost passwords. While generally associated with hacker culture, legitimate enterprises recommend these programs as a way to regain access to a computer. Download the software from another computer, put it on a CD or USB drive, and plug it into the computer. The password cracker will immediately infiltrate your system and fish out the account data. The process is automatic and incredibly fast, so if it's your OS password you're worrying about, this solution can be a quick and relatively inexpensive fix. Password crackers are only designed for cracking OS passwords, like a Windows user account. Online accounts like emails cannot be retrieved this way. Although it's perfectly legitimate to try cracking your own password with this kind of software, using it to hack the accounts of others can get you into serious trouble and isn't recommended."

Fortunately, that doesn't mean you've lost the associated account. Most sites will have a 'Forgot Password' option available for this very sake. Click this button and follow the steps to reset your password . If it's a non-email password (like Facebook ), resetting a password will be fairly easy. An automated confirmation will be sent to your email, from which you'll reset your password and start a new one. Some email services (like Hotmail) offer the possibility of connecting them with another email account for the sake of password resetting. If you have another email account and have done this, resetting the password will be just as easy as it would be with any other non-email account."

If it's an email account you're trying to access, and you haven't connected it with a separate email address, your other option of resetting the password is by answering your listed secret questions. Many email accounts will get you to answer personal questions (e.g. the name of your first pet) as a contingency if you end up forgetting your password later on. Click on the 'Forgot My Password' button and answer questions wherever prompted. [2] X Research source While this won't bring you back your password, it stands a good chance of helping you reclaim your password. Unfortunately, many people don't take secret questions seriously, and some may forget their answers sooner than the passwords themselves!"

While contacting the company that hosts your account won't help you get your password back, the company may be able to help you regain access by resetting the password. While you'll have to deliver certain proof of your identity, some services will allow you to reclaim the use of your account through calling or messaging them. Keep in mind that the process of verification can take a while even in the best circumstances, so patience is a must should you decide to take this route."

      "content": "Make an effort to come up with a memorable password . There are many reasons you may have forgotten a password in the first place. For one, it may have been thought up on the spot, or you might have made it too complex to remember in full. While making your password hard to guess is an essential security step, the most important thing about a password is how uniquely memorable it is to you. Thinking up a distinctive, but the memorable password can be difficult, as obvious answers (like the name of a place or person) are too easily guessed. [3] X Research source Try combining a few individually memorable words. For instance, your pet's name is a weak choice on its own, but pairing it with something completely unrelated, like your favourite food or comic book character, is a strong way to send hackers for a loop. When you're making a password, most sites will have an indicator that tells you how strong your password is. While these are vague tools at best, you'll want to aim for an average strength at least. Adding symbols and numbers to your code is a smart way to improve security. Another common trick you can use is to invent a mnemonic acronym. Write the first letter of each word of a memorable sentence, thereby creating a gibberish word. For example, the sentence \"Friday is my favourite day of the week\" would become 'Fimfdotw'. Likewise, \"Free jazz is my favourite kind of music\" would become 'Fjimfkom'. This can be applied to virtually any sentence imaginable, so long as it has enough words to satisfy the password's minimum character count-- usually 8."

      "content": "Write your passwords and keep them in a sealed envelope. While you should write passwords you'll be able to remember reasonably well, you should write down your passwords and put them somewhere safe if you think there's a chance you'll forget them again. Seal the envelope, and leave it unmarked, or mark it as something misleading. That way, if someone manages to find it, they won't likely grasp its importance. [4] X Research source If you're really concerned that you'll lose the envelope, you might consider giving the envelope to a trusted friend or a loved one. This is not recommended, however, as it means giving up the sole control over your passwords and, by extension, your personal information."

      "content": "Use a password manager . Especially if you're using different passwords for each of your various accounts, you might find them difficult to keep up with on your own. Fortunately, there is password management software available that will fill in the data for you. On the downside, most password managers available cost money-- generally between 20 and 40 US dollars. However, you may find the added security worth it if you're worried about forgetting or the risk of being hacked. [5] X Research source Because a password manager essentially does the legwork of password for you, you can afford to have more complex passwords without worrying about remembering them yourself. As a free alternative, you could create an encrypted file on your computer with all of your passwords on it. That way, you'll only have to remember one of them off the top of your head."

It goes without saying that passwords for banking information should be treated with greater weight than the password for your avant-garde jazz blog, but as a general rule, you want to make your passwords more difficult to crack depending on how important the account is to your life and well-being. [6] X Research source At the same time, while byzantine symbols or numbers can make a password harder to guess, it can also make them harder to remember. The trick is to strike a balance between complexity and memory. Don't write a password you don't think you'll be able to remember on a whim, and if you do, make sure to keep it written down on paper somewhere it does not stand any chance of getting misplaced or seen by someone else.
