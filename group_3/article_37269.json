Empowerment expert Nicolette Tura recommends being honest about where you’re at currently and what challenges you’re facing. Then, think of your highest vision for yourself in all areas of yourself. [1] X Expert Source Nicolette Tura, MA Empowerment Coach Expert Interview. 23 January 2020. What does it look like? Start thinking about the big picture, then work out more details. Visualizing your goals can give you a lot of power toward accomplishing them—and it will also help you be very clear on what goals are the most important to you. Be as specific as possible about what you want, but don't be afraid to change your vision if you find yourself pulled in a new direction. Tura also recommends asking a few questions to figure out what you want. “Where in your life do you feel unbalanced? Are you feeling unfulfilled? Does a relationship feel stagnant? What’s in your way?” [2] X Expert Source Nicolette Tura, MA Empowerment Coach Expert Interview. 23 January 2020."

      "content": "Ask yourself if your life is aligned with those values. Your core values are the beliefs and convictions that guide your thoughts and behaviors throughout life. In short, what really matters to you? Most people have about five to seven core values. [3] X Expert Source Guy Reichard Executive Life Coach Expert Interview. 19 March 2020. Figure out what those values are by thinking about what you really stand for; then, ask yourself if your life reflects those beliefs. If one of your values is spending time with your family, but your job makes you miss important milestones and special occasions, you might examine whether you're satisfied with your career. Although values are things you believe deeply, they can change over time. If you're doing a life reset, it might be time to reconsider what's most important to you. Introspection is important because it helps you reset your life in the most meaningful and satisfying way possible!"

      "content": "Make sure your goals are “SMART.” SMART stands for specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals. When your goals are well-thought-out and planned, meeting all the above criteria, you’ll be more likely to accomplish them than you might with just a vague idea of things you’d like to do someday. [4] X Research source Specific goals have clear expectations and defined steps. What are you trying to do? What could stand in your way, and how will you overcome that? Measurable goals are quantifiable in some way; you can track them and see when there’s progress. Achievable goals are realistic. That doesn’t mean you can’t dream big; just avoid imposing unreachable expectations on yourself. Relevant goals serve a purpose in your overall vision for your life reset. Basically, if you’re setting a goal, there should be a good reason for it! Time-bound goals have a deadline. When do you plan to reach this goal? Do you have a date or time period in mind?"

Instead, clinical psychologist Sirvart Mesrobian recommends backtracking to think about the specific steps you need to take to achieve those goals. Start with the first step, and don’t focus on the next until the first step is accomplished. [5] X Expert Source Sirvart Mesrobian, PsyD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 13 July 2021 Breaking your goals into smaller steps can help you stay focused on what you need to do and keep progressing. According to Mesrobian, it can also boost your self-esteem.

Include incentives and rewards for yourself for making changes. For example, if you’re quitting smoking, use the money you used to spend on cigarettes to treat yourself to a new blouse, a nice outing, or dinner with a friend."

Consider your possessions, the situations you're in, and even the people in your life. Does each individual thing bring you joy? If the answer is no, consider how you can get rid of it. [7] X Expert Source Guy Reichard Executive Life Coach Expert Interview. 19 March 2020. This can apply to any area of your life; you might decide whether to keep a certain shirt or participate in an activity you used to love, for example. It might help to purge certain areas of your home, like your closet or storage. Sort through your clothing; are there items you could give away to make room for things you really want? Be objective—even something that used to bring you joy may no longer serve that purpose. You’ll always have obligations in life that are less enjoyable than others. However, if anything in your life constantly makes you feel depleted or overwhelmed, it's worth reconsidering how much energy you put into it."

The world is noisy and busy, and it's all too easy to fill your entire day with email, social media, TV, music, and chatting. However, it's important to take some time daily to shut out all the noise, especially when you're trying to reset your life. During that time, reflect on your goals and priorities, along with what you're doing to reach them.

When you're resetting your life, Nicolette Tura recommends making sure your wellness is being taken care of—hygiene, nutrition, and physical activities. [9] X Expert Source Nicolette Tura, MA Empowerment Coach Expert Interview. 23 January 2020. Think about whether you’re fueling your body with foods that make you feel good or if you’re just eating for convenience. Also, make time for physical activities you enjoy a few times a week. You’ll be more likely to stick with something if you like doing it instead of simply telling yourself you need to exercise more. For example, you might take a walk around the block when the weather is nice, or meet up with friends for a stroll through the park. You might also play a sport, take a dance class, or take up cycling. When you feel good physically, it's a lot easier to make clear decisions about what you want out of life. In addition, you'll feel more confident—and empowered to make good decisions."

[15] X Research source Bad habits like smoking, drinking to excess, overeating, and not getting enough exercise can all undermine your attempts to reset your life. Still, remember not to get too down on yourself—the way to address bad habits is through positive behavior change rather than through guilt, fear, or regret. For example, rather than feeling guilty about not exercising more, decide to include 20 minutes of walking four days per week. Don't quit just because you slip up—habits are hard to break! If you need to, start by cutting back gradually until you can give up the habit completely."
