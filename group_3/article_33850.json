      "content": "Santa Muerte is a beloved, mystical figure representing death in Mexico. She’s not a Catholic saint, but a folk figure with ties to Indigenous spiritualism and the Aztec goddess of death, Mictecacihuatl. She appears as a skeletal figure wearing colorful, historic Spanish clothes holding a scythe, a globe, or a set of scales. [1] X Research source Santa Muerte is often considered a comforting guide to the afterlife, as well as a mystical figure who can save people from death with her healing powers. Officially, the Vatican doesn’t support the worship of Santa Muerte since she’s not a canonized saint in the Catholic church. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "When praying to Santa Muerte, be genuine in your intent and requests. She doesn’t enjoy being summoned without a meaningful reason, and she may deny your requests or chastise you spiritually if you invoke her frivolously. Mystical consequences might also befall you if you make a promise to her you can’t keep. Always remain grateful, regardless of whether she's answered your prayers or not, since what you ask for may not be something you truly need. [6] X Research source You don’t necessarily need physical objects like a rosary to pray to her—your relationship with Santa Muerte comes from the heart. Santa Muerte’s powers are strongest at night or just before dark. Plan to perform rituals, prayers, or altar work after sundown for the best results. [7] X Research source If you want to connect with her with spellwork, make sure an experienced spellcaster is there to guide you and help you complete the spell safely. [8] X Research source"
