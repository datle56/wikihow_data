      "title": "Ik hou van jou (ick how vahn yow)",
      "content": "Ik hou van jou (ick how vahn yow) This is the most basic and flexible way to say “I love you” in Dutch. The verb houden van is generally translated as “to love,” so this is the most common way to say “I love you” to someone. As in English, the verb is versatile and can be used for any person, place, or thing. [1] X Research source This phrase is not specific to romantic love. You can also use it to express love for a family member or a close friend. The use of jou puts emphasis on “you,” or the person you’re speaking to. Alternative phrase: To emphasize “love” instead of “you,” say Ick hou van je (Ick how vin yeh). To ask someone if they love you, say Hou je van mij? (how yeh vahn meye), which means “Do you love me?” [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Ik heb je lief (ick hehb yeh leef)",
      "content": "Ik heb je lief (ick hehb yeh leef) Use the verb liefhebben to express deeper attachment. Ik heb je lief is an alternate way to say “I love you.” This phrase is less versatile than the more common Ik hou van jou and refers exclusively to a romantic attachment. [3] X Research source Typically this phrase would be used after the initial crush phase in a romantic relationship, once the two of you have settled into a more stable relationship. Dutch speakers have varied opinions on whether this phrase actually implies a stronger feeling than the more common ' Ik hou van jou ."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ik ben verliefd op jou (ick ben vehrleefd ohp yo)",
      "content": "Ik ben verliefd op jou (ick ben vehrleefd ohp yo) This phrase means “I am in love with you” or “I have a crush on you.” Like English speakers, Dutch speakers may wish to differentiate between loving someone and being in love with someone. Use this phrase to let someone know that your love for them is different than the love you may feel for a family member or close friend. [4] X Research source If you’re speaking as a couple, say we zijn zo verliefd (weh zayn zaw vehrleefd), which means “we are so in love.” Depending on the context, Ik ben verliefd op jou can also mean “I have a crush on you.” You might use this phrase when you tell someone your feelings for the first time. Alternative phrase: If you’re in the process of falling in love, say Ik word verliefd op jou (ick vawrrd fehrr-leefd awp yow), which means “I'm falling in love with you.”"

    {
      "title": "Ik hou zielsveel van je (ick how zeelsvayl vahn yeh)",
      "content": "Ik hou zielsveel van je (ick how zeelsvayl vahn yeh) The word zielsveel means “with heart and soul,” making the whole phrase “I love you with heart and soul.” If you love the person very much, use this phrase to indicate that your love for them is deeper and more heartfelt than a basic “I love you.” [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Ik bemin je (ick behmihn yeh)",
      "content": "Ik bemin je (ick behmihn yeh) This saying literally means “I hold you dear,” but is similar to saying “I love you.” The phrase is more appropriate for a romantic partner than for a friend or family member. In Dutch culture, Ik bemin je is considered a bit nerdy or old-fashioned. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Woorden kunnen mijn liefde voor jou niet omschrijven",
      "content": "Woorden kunnen mijn liefde voor jou niet omschrijven Pronounced like “vohrden kuhnnin mine leefdeh fohr yao neet ohmschrieven,” this phrase means “words can’t describe my love for you.” Say this when you want to express truly deep love. While it might strike you as over-the-top, it could be really powerful in the right situation! [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Ik zie in jou meer dan alleen een vriend (ick zee ihn yow mayrr dahn ahl-ayn ayn freend)",
      "content": "Ik zie in jou meer dan alleen een vriend (ick zee ihn yow mayrr dahn ahl-ayn ayn freend) Perhaps you feel close to someone, but you're not quite to the “I love you” stage yet. Use this phrase to mean “I think of you as more than a friend” and tell someone you're interested in a romantic relationship. [8] X Research source Especially if you already have a relatively close friendship with the person, this could let them know that you are interested in taking the relationship to another level."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ik vind je leuk (ick vihnd yeh lurk)",
      "content": "Ik vind je leuk (ick vihnd yeh lurk) This phrase literally means “I find you nice,” but can be interpreted as “I like you” or “I like you a lot” in a more intimate or romantic context. Try this one out if you're not ready to say “I love you” yet. [9] X Research source Alternative phrase: You can also try jij bent echt belangrijk (yai bent eckt belongriek), which means “You are so important (to me).” Tip: If the other person has told you Ik hou van jou , this might not be the best way to reply. Explain your feelings more clearly if you don't want the person to think you're rejecting them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Je bent zo knap (yeh behnt zaw knahp) or Je bent zo mooi (yeh behnt zaw moh-ih)",
      "content": "Je bent zo knap (yeh behnt zaw knahp) or Je bent zo mooi (yeh behnt zaw moh-ih) These phrases mean “You’re so handsome” ( knap ) or “You’re so beautiful” ( mooi ) and make lovely compliments for your crush or partner. Regardless of whether you're ready to drop the L-word or not, giving a compliment in Dutch can let your love interest know that you think of them romantically. [10] X Research source Use knap for male-presenting love interests, or mooi if your crush is female-presenting."

    {
      "title": "Ik heb vlinders in mijn buik (ick hehb vlihndehrs ihn mayn birlk)",
      "content": "Ik heb vlinders in mijn buik (ick hehb vlihndehrs ihn mayn birlk) In English, you might say “I have butterflies in my stomach.” A similar phrase in Dutch is ik heb vlinders in mijn buik . You might use this phrase as a reaction after another person expresses feelings of affection towards you. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Ik kan je nooit verliezen (ick kahn yeh no-eet fehrleezen)",
      "content": "Ik kan je nooit verliezen (ick kahn yeh no-eet fehrleezen) This phrase means “I can’t lose you” or “I can never lose you” and is a sweet way to tell someone how important they are to you. Use this when you’re in a stable or committed relationship, since this may come off a bit strong for a crush or new partner."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use vriend or vriendin to mean both “friend” and “boyfriend” or “girlfriend.”",
      "content": "Use vriend or vriendin to mean both “friend” and “boyfriend” or “girlfriend.” There's no special word in Dutch that lets others know whether someone is your romantic partner or simply a friend. The same word is used for both ( vriend for men or vriendin for women). The type of relationship is inferred by the context: [12] X Research source To signify a romantic partner: You might say ik hou van mijn vriend (if your significant other presents as male) or ik hou van mijn vriendin (if your significant other presents as female). This literally means “I love my friend,” but is typically interpreted as meaning that you're talking about a romantic partner. To signify a platonic friend: If the person is truly just a friend, you would likely say hij is een vriend van mij (“he is a friend of mine”) or zij is een vriend van mij (“she is a friend of mine”). Vriend is pronounced like “freend” and vriendin like “freendin.”"
