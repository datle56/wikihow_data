      "content": "Remove a few inches off the bottom of an old top to transform it. If a piece of clothing is no longer in, don’t be quick to say it’s out. A quick fix to any old, tired shirt is making a crop top. Put the shirt on, look in a mirror, and fold it where you want the crop to start. Mark the spot with safety pins. [1] X Research source Then, lay the shirt on a flat surface. You may want to trace a line where you’ll cut with a fabric marker. Use a pair of fabric scissors to cut the spot and viola! You’ve got a new crop top. You can hem the edges for a clean look. Use a straight or running stitch with a sewing machine, or weave a needle and thread in and out of the fabric in a straight line."

      "content": "Remove the legs of jeans or pants to turn them into shorts. Using the same technique as cropping a shirt, you can make cropped denim shorts. Try on an old pair of jeans and mark where you’d like to cut with a fabric marker. Lay the pants on a flat surface and cut where you’ve marked. [2] X Research source If you fold the pants over, you can cut through both legs simultaneously for a symmetrical cut. For a distressed look, leave the shorts unhemmed to fray naturally over time. You can also take a pair of seam rippers or sandpaper to distress the edges."

Making tube tops is the simplest option since they require minimal sewing. Measure your bust to mark the amount of the fabric you need. Then, cut out the fabric and sew the sides to form a tube. [3] X Research source Add elastic to the top and bottom of the garment for a form-fitting look. Use a tube top you love and trace the pattern onto the garment for an easy hack. You can hand-sew these projects, but it may take a little time compared to using a sewing machine."

You should lay out any embellishments first to figure out the placement before sewing or gluing them down."
