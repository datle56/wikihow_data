      "content": "Have a brush ready. A new, clean eyeshadow brush or an old nail polish brush that you’ve cleaned and sanitized will work perfectly for this. In order to clean a nail polish brush, swirl it around in 2 or 3 drops of nail polish thinner on a plastic plate. Wipe the brush on a piece of cardboard. Repeat this until the brush wipes clean. Nail polish thinner is different than remover. It is most commonly used to restore old bottles of nail polish to their old consistency. Cardboard is recommended because other materials, like paper towels, will leave lint on the brush."

Once you’ve let your nails completely dry, dip your fingers into the sink. Let your nails soak for 2-3 minutes. Feel free to swish them around or simply leave them still. If you polish is water based, letting them soak for 5 or more minutes will peel the color off of your nails. If you don’t have time to soak your nails, this can easily be done in your shower."
