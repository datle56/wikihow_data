If you've ever added your Gmail account to your iPhone, which is very common, you're likely syncing your iPhone contacts to your Google account. If this is the case, you can easily retrieve deleted phone numbers and contacts for up to 30 days after deletion. To see if you're syncing your phone numbers to a Google account: Open your iPhone's Settings app. Scroll down and tap Contacts . Tap Accounts . You'll see a list of accounts syncing to the Contacts app. If Gmail is present, tap it. If the \"Contacts\" switch is on/Green, your contacts sync.

If you've backed up your iPhone to your PC or Mac in the past but don't want to lose data by restoring from your backup, some apps claim they can extract phone numbers and contact information from backups without restoring your iPhone. Because none of these apps are vetted by Apple or any other notable authority, we don't recommend trying them. Also, because these apps are never free, there's always the possibility that you will lose money and still not be able to retrieve deleted phone numbers from your iPhone. Still, if you want to give these apps a try, search the web for \"iPhone backup extractors,\" and make sure to read reviews before downloading an app. One helpful way to see people's experiences with certain apps is to search for the app's name in Google and the word \"reddit.\" For example, searching for \"iMazing,\" the name of a backup extractor, and the word \"Reddit\" brings up plenty of Reddit posts that discuss whether the app is legit or not ."
