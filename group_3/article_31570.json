If the EXE file was downloaded from the internet , you'll be asked to confirm that you want to run it. Be wary when running EXE files from unknown sources, as this is the easiest way to get infected with a virus. Never open an EXE file downloaded as an email attachment, even if you know the sender. EXE files might not run properly if they were designed for an outdated version of Windows. You can try adjusting the compatibility settings by right-clicking on the file, selecting \"Properties\", and then clicking the Compatibility tab. You can set what version of Windows you want to run the EXE file as, but this is not guaranteed to solve the problem."
