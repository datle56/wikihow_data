      "content": "Get cotton fabric that goes well with your project. Most people choose to make their piping using a contrasting color, but you can use the same color as the rest of your project. The fabric can be solid or patterned. If you are using pre-made piping, cut off however much you need for your project, then click here to continue. If you are using pre-made bias tape, cut off however much you need, open it up, and iron it flat to remove the creases. Click here to continue."

      "title": "Wash, dry, and iron your fabric.",
      "content": "Wash, dry, and iron your fabric. Use a gentle cycle on your washing machine, and cold water. Allow the fabric to hang-dry, or speed the process up in a dryer. Iron the fabric once it has dried to remove any wrinkles. You should still wash the fabric, even if the bolt says \"pre-shrunk.\" This will remove any coatings."

      "title": "Fold the fabric in half diagonally on the bias.",
      "content": "Fold the fabric in half diagonally on the bias. Bring the top-right and bottom-left corners together so that the top edge matches up with the left side edge. Smooth the fabric so that it lays flat. It does not matter which side of the fabric is facing out at this point. Cutting your fabric on the bias will make your piping more flexible in the end."

      "title": "Cut the fabric across the bias into 1 1⁄2 in (3.8 cm) wide strips.",
      "content": "Cut the fabric across the bias into 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) wide strips. Use a straight edge and a tailor's chalk or pen to draw lines across the bias. The lines should be 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches (3.8 cm) apart, and parallel to the folded edge of your fabric. Cut along these lines when you are done. Cut as many strips as needed to outline the area that you will be piping. You will also need extra fabric for the seam allowances. Discard the strip from the folded edge, or cut it in half lengthwise to make 2 identical 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) wide strips."

    {
      "title": "Pin and sew the ends of 2 strips to form a right angle.",
      "content": "Pin and sew the ends of 2 strips to form a right angle. Pin the ends of 2 strips together to form a right angle, with the wrong sides facing out. Use a sewing machine to sew across the corner, from 1 outside edge to the other. Use a straight stitch and a thread color that matches the fabric. If you are using solid-colored pattern, there is no right or wrong side. If you are using patterned fabric, the patterned side is the right side. Do not sew from the outside edge to the inside edge of the right angle."

Split open the seam so that it lays flat, with the stitching running down the middle. Iron the seam flat using the cotton setting on your iron.

      "content": "Fold in 1 of the narrow ends of the bias tape, if needed. If you are piping the circumference of an item, like a pillow, you will need to join both ends of the piping together. Fold 1 of the narrow ends of your bias tape in by 1 inch (2.5 cm), then press it with an iron. Make sure that the wrong side of the bias tape is facing you during this step. Skip this step if you are piping a straight seam that does not join together to form a circle or a square."

Lay your cording down the middle, with the end 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the folded end of the bias tape. Trim the other end of the cording so that it is even with the other end of the bias tape. Choose cording that is between 4 ⁄ 32 and 5 ⁄ 32 inch (0.32 and 0.40 cm). If you did not fold the end of your bias tape, then both ends of the cording should match up with both ends of the bias tape."

      "content": "Place the strip under the zipper foot and adjust the needle. Replace the standard foot on your sewing machine with a zipper foot. Place the folded strip under the zipper foot, then bring the foot down on it; the corded part should be under the raised part of the foot. Move the needle to the left or right so that it is as close as possible to the cording. If you have a piping foot, place the piping in the foot's groove. Adjust the needle so that it is right on the piping's stitching. How you replace the zipper foot depends on the type of sewing machine you have. Most sewing machines have a release clutch just behind the needle."

Be careful not to sew the piping too tightly. [4] X Research source Your seam allowances should be about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm). This may vary, however, depending on the thickness of your cording. If you folded in 1 of the narrow ends of the bias tape, stop sewing 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the folded end. You need this end to be open."

Use a steam ripper to open up the stitching on the first 2 inches (5.1 cm) of your pre-made piping. Cut the cording inside the piping by 2 inches (5.1 cm). Fold the end of the fabric in by 1 inch (2.5 cm), and press it flat with an iron. Leave the other end of the piping intact.

If you need to, cut more slits into any corners or curves that won't lay flat. When you are done, turn your project right-side-out. Press the seams to either side of the piping for a nicer finish. You can go over the raw edges of the inside seams with a zigzag stitch to prevent fraying."
