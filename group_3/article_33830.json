      "content": "Put plastic over the top of their shampoo bottle. Unscrew the top of your friend’s shampoo, put a little piece of plastic wrap over the top of the bottle (so it’s blocking shampoo from coming out), and screw the top back on. Then, just leave it in your friend’s shower; the next time they use it, they’ll be stumped when nothing comes out!"

      "content": "Swap out your hat while you're with them to confuse your friend. While this prank isn’t difficult to pull off, it’ll cost some money—so keep that in mind! You’ll need the same hat in at least four different sizes. Start off wearing the smallest version of the hat (while spending time with your friend). Every so often, step out of the room and switch to the next-largest version of the hat…until, eventually, your hat looks inexplicably silly and floppy."

      "title": "Put tape on the bottom of your friend’s computer mouse so it stops working.",
      "content": "Put tape on the bottom of your friend’s computer mouse so it stops working. This simple trick can stop your friend’s mouse from working for a little while (without permanently breaking it, of course). All you need is a roll of scotch tape (or something similar) to cover the bottom of the mouse with—or, if you want to be extra cheeky, you can tape a picture of yourself there!"

      "title": "Hide silly notes in your friend’s clothes and belongings.",
      "content": "Hide silly notes in your friend’s clothes and belongings. Take some time to write up a few totally goofy notes for your friend. Then, when they’re not around, hide the notes wherever your friend is sure to find them eventually—in a sweater or pants pocket, in their bag, or even somewhere in their house. Each time your friend finds a note, they’ll laugh out loud at what you wrote! For example, you might make a love note from their favorite celebrity, a joke treasure map, or a fake coupon for a crazy imaginary snack food."

      "content": "Gradually stuff their shoes with napkins or socks. Make your friend wonder if their shoes are inexplicably shrinking (or their feet are getting a sudden, miraculous growth spurt) by gently padding the toes of their shoes with a clean napkin or sock. If they still don’t suspect anything, add more napkins or an extra sock until they notice their shoes shrink! If you want to be extra elaborate, try doing this with every pair of shoes they own."

All you have to do is pretend to see something in the window—either something normal but interesting to look at, like a herd of deer, or something a little more startling, like a big, hungry bear."

      "content": "Get a convincing (and ridiculous-looking) temporary tattoo. Find a temporary tattoo that looks silly but could totally be real, and apply it somewhere on your body. Then, show the tattoo to your friend while acting like it’s an actual tattoo you just got, and see how they react to it—and if they believe it’s real. For some extra laughs, if you and your friend have ever talked about getting matching tattoos, you could suggest they get a tattoo to match yours. Of course, if they’re a nice enough friend to agree to a matching tattoo, be sure to show them it’s temporary and you’re just joking!"

First, take a small bottle of hand sanitizer and empty it out (into a different container, so you’re not wasting any of it), then rinse out the empty bottle. Refill the bottle with clear glue and let it dry overnight. Then, leave the sanitizer bottle out for your friend to use—and when they try, nothing will come out, no matter how hard they squeeze! Only use non-toxic and non-hazardous glue that can easily be cleaned with water. Don’t use any glue with cyanoacrylate (an ingredient in Super Glue and Krazy Glue) for this prank. Make sure the glue totally dries before springing your prank since you don’t want anyone getting wet glue on their hands."

The next time your friend is sleeping over on an air mattress, wait until they’re asleep and then undo the plug keeping all the air in their mattress. They won’t notice anything right away because the mattress will lose air slowly—but by the morning, they’ll be lying on a deflated mattress."

Just fill each cup with water and position the filled cups outside your friend’s door. When they open the door, they’ll have to figure out a creative way around the cups without spilling the water (or pick them all up one by one). You can do this outside your friend’s front door, bedroom door, or any other doorway that seems like a fun pranking spot to you."

For a chocolate-loving friend, prank them by offering them an oatmeal raisin cookie, while insisting you made chocolate chip cookies, and savor the look on their face when they take a bite. Just in case you need to earn your friend’s forgiveness for this oh-so-cruel prank, you could always keep some chocolate chip cookies nearby!"

It’ll only take one salty bite for your friend to realize they’ve been pranked, and you’ll get to see the silly look on their face when they taste it. Just make sure you’re aware of any allergies or food restrictions before you pull a food-related prank on your friend. You don’t want to trick them into eating something that’s unsafe for them."

Then, remove all the donuts and refill the box with something much less appetizing, like raisins or prunes, and give the box to your friend while announcing you bought them a sweet treat. You can also pull this prank with any kind of baked good your friend enjoys, as long as they can’t see what’s inside the box.
