      "content": "Pull a bait-and-switch and send her something unexpected via text. It’s super silly, but play it up like something really big happened and then send her a link to something really goofy. It’s not the biggest prank of all time, but it’s sure to brighten her day! It’s also a great way to test the waters to see how she likes having her chain pulled with a tiny prank before you go for something bigger. [1] X Research source The Rick Roll, where you trick someone into watching Rick Astley’s music video for “Never Gonna Give You Up,” is a classic option here. You could just send a really funny or risqué gif or YouTube video . Don’t send her anything with a super obvious URL."

      "content": "Look online for a fake news site and craft a custom headline. You could make it super specific to her by making it seem like the student newspaper at your school wrote an article about her having a “kick me” sign on her back all day, or try to trick her into believing aliens finally got loose from Area 51. You might use a headline like, “Best Boyfriend of All Time Misses You” for something cute, or “Girlfriend Picks Nose while Reading Fake News Headline” for something a little goofier.

      "content": "Order something totally pointless from an online shop . Send it to her address, and the day before it’s supposed to arrive, text her to let her know she’s got a gift coming tomorrow. Be super cryptic and evasive about what it actually is. When she texts you back, “What am I supposed to do with this? Why did you send this here?!” just play it off like it’s really sentimental gift and you sent it because you care. [3] X Research source You could send: Candles that start off smelling like apple pie or lavender, but slowly transition to smell like rotten fruit or old cheese. A framed photo of a dog wearing a bowtie. This is an especially good option if neither of you own a dog. A joke book, like Fifty Shades of Chicken (a cookbook based on “sexy” chicken recipes), or How to Talk to Your Cat About Gun Safety (an actual book about teaching kittens how to handle firearms)."

      "content": "Instead of intentionally sending her something, do it on “accident.” This is going to be easier to pull off if you’ve used her address for deliveries in the past or if she has ever used your phone or computer to do some online shopping. Either way, play it up like you really don’t want her to open it. In all likelihood, she will. What will she find inside? [4] X Research source You could send her a small box with a flash drive in it. What’s on the flash drive? A folder labelled “hot girls.” When she clicks on it, all she’ll find is a single photo of her. Cute, right? It’s a little on the riskier side so far as pranking a girlfriend goes, but the glitter bomb is a classic. You can ship a package that shoots glitter everywhere when it’s opened. It’s a pain to clean up, but she might find it funny! Just ship her an empty box. You could even put a handwritten note at the bottom of the box that just says, “Gotcha!” If you want to just go random with it, you could put a tiny garden gnome or a decorative fedora in the box. Why wouldn’t you want her to open a package like this? Totally up to you!"

      "content": "Text or call her to share the news that you got some fresh ink. Let her know you decided to go with your friends to get a tattoo impulsively. When she asks what you got, pretend like you’re a little hesitant to tell her. This will pique her interest even further and she’ll feel compelled to pry. When she inevitably demands to see a photo, send her an image you find online of the ugliest tattoo you can find. [5] X Research source Alternatively, you could even search for tattoos of her name online. If she goes by “Sarah” just search for “I love Sarah tattoo” or “Sarah tattoo” and send her that."

      "content": "The anti-prank is a prank in its own category. Let her know that while you miss her, you thought it might be fun to spice things up with a prank. Tell her you’ve been planning this for months. When she asks you, “Why?” just tell her, “I thought it would be fun!” She’ll be on her toes all day waiting to see what happens. That’s the joke—nothing happens. [6] X Research source How long you keep this one up is totally up to you. If you want to keep it going, just say, “Oh, I decided today wasn’t the best day. Tomorrow!”"

      "content": "Make her think that you’re in a super confusing “emergency. ” Send something really worrying out of the blue, but make it seem like you’re genuinely dealing with something over at your place. When she responds asking what’s going on, just keep her on the hook and ask follow up questions. Keep her in the dark as long as you can until, but call it off if she seems genuinely worried. You could also try: “I need your help. Quick, can you let me know how much it is to fly to Russia. Need info ASAP.” “There’s a man at my door dressed as Pikachu. He won’t leave. What should I do?” “This is very time sensitive, and I need your help. How do you get egg out of carpet?” You could send her a photo of a possum and send it to her with the caption, “This really weird cat just showed up in my driveway. I gave it a treat, but now it won’t go away.”"

When she texts you back worried that you’re about to drop some crazy news, reply with something really mundane and pointless. Both of you should get a good laugh over this one! When she says, “WHAT?! Did you cheat on me?!” or, “Omg, what did you do…” you might reply: [7] X Research source “I’m actually not that fond of cheesecake. I apologize for leading you on all this time.” “I’ve never actually been to Wisconsin. I’m sorry I’ve been so dishonest with you.” “I cheated on you…with this pizza I just ate. Seriously, it was so delicious I’m in love.”"

      "content": "There are a few automated services that will leave funny voicemails. Some of these prank phone call sites are kind of nasty, but there are a few really fun options out there. Basically, you just enter your girlfriend’s number and choose a robot to leave a voicemail on her phone. There are tons of funny choices, like a pizza delivery guy who clearly has the wrong number, or a grandpa who thinks he’s calling his granddaughter, so choose one and give it a shot! [8] X Research source Prankdial is the original option here. They give you 3 free calls. You can even choose which number the call comes from to match her area code. Comedy Calls has some super goofy options. It will make it seem like the prank call isn’t going through after you hit enter (they want you to buy special calls), but it will work! Spoofbox has some extremely fun options. You do have to sign up for a free account or download an app for it to work, though."

      "content": "She’s going to recognize your voice, so borrow someone else’s if you’re calling! Have a friend or family member call her phone from a number she won’t recognize. Then, have them pretend to be someone they aren’t. You can come up with whatever scenario you’d like, just make sure it isn’t anything too serious. [9] X Research source You could have them pretend to be a neighbor calling to ask for toilet paper, or an “old friend” who is 100% convinced they’ve known your girlfriend for years. Don’t have anyone pretend to be a police officer, doctor, or anything like that. It’s usually illegal, and it’s just going to scare her. Don’t have a friend call her with your phone and tell her that you’re dead or something bad happened to you. This could scare her and make her worried."
