      "content": "Choose a shirt that fits you, then set it on top of the bigger shirt. Turn the smaller shirt inside out first, then tuck the sleeves in so that they are out of the way. Set the smaller shirt down on top of the bigger one. Make sure that the collars and shoulders match up. Make sure that the front of both shirts is facing up. You can also use a fitted t-shirt or a sleeveless shirt for this."

      "title": "Trace around the smaller shirt, adding seam allowances.",
      "content": "Trace around the smaller shirt, adding seam allowances. You'll need to trace around the armholes and the sides of the smaller shirt. Be sure to add a ½ inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. [3] X Research source It is best to use a dressmaker's pen (light colors) or a dressmaker's chalk (dark colors) for this. If you can't find one, use a washable pen. If the bigger shirt is too long, you'll need to trace 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) below the smaller shirt as well."

      "title": "Pin the bigger shirt, then cut it.",
      "content": "Pin the bigger shirt, then cut it. Set aside the smaller shirt, then pin the larger one, just inside the lines that you drew. Cut the shirt with sharp fabric scissors, following the lines that you drew. Remove the pins when you are done, but keep them handy for a later step. [4] X Research source The pins are there to keep the fabric from slipping around while cutting the shirt."

Sew the sleeves to the shoulders using a matching thread color, a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance and a stretch stitch. Remove the pins as you sew. [5] X Research source Backstitch at the start and end of your sewing to make it stronger. Trim the sleeves down if they are too wide for the shirt."

[6] X Research source Remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing. Use sewing pins to hold the shirt together, if needed, but remember to take them out as you sew."

Fold the sleeves/hem down at the mark. Sew using a matching thread color, ½-inch (½7-centimeter) seam allowance, and a stretch stitch. Trim off the excess hem, if needed, as close to the stitching as you can. [7] X Research source Remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing! For a more realistic shirt, add a second line of stitching just below the first one. Begin and finish sewing at a seam, not the middle of the hem. This will help disguise the backstitching."

Cut two rectangles based on that measurement. Plan on making the rectangles 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) on the bottom and 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) at the top. [10] X Research source If you cut the material from another shirt, make the bottom hem the 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) wide edge. Add 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) to the overall length for hem allowances. If you cut the material from store-bought fabric, add 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) to the overall length for hem allowances. You can cut the panels wider/narrower to suit your needs."
