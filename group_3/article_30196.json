I’m worried that his parents might be abusing him at home.” “Casey Perkins, a 12-year-old in my child’s class, frequently comes to school in dirty clothes, and she has an obvious body odor. My child also notices that she asks other students for part of their lunches—I’m concerned that she might be neglected at home.” “I volunteer at a summer camp, and I’m seriously concerned that Randall Ramirez, a 9-year-old kid there, might be getting sexually abused at home. They always seem to be in pain when they’re sitting down, and they tested positive for an STI at the infirmary.”"
