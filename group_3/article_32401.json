    {
      "title": "Review division, multiplication, and the order of operations.",
      "content": "Review division, multiplication, and the order of operations. Basic math concepts are still fair game on a math placement test. Go over long division, multiplication, and how to follow the order of operations. Make sure you know how to apply those to different math concepts and can do them long form as well as with a calculator. [1] X Research source You will most likely be allowed to use a calculator on a math placement test, but some problems might ask you to show your work."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go over conversions between fractions and decimals.",
      "content": "Go over conversions between fractions and decimals. Fractions and decimals can describe the same number, but they display it in a different way. Make sure you know how to convert from fractions to decimals and vice versa. Look out for fractions that are written as percentages. [2] X Research source For example, 24% indicates a fraction of 24/100. You may be asked to convert 24% to a decimal. Divide 24/100 to get 0.24."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make sure you know how to work with inequalities.",
      "content": "Make sure you know how to work with inequalities. Most often, these problems are given as 2 numbers and you are asked to put a “<” “>” or “=” in between them to signify if they are less than, greater than, or equal to each other. [3] X Research source For example, a problem might read -3 __ 6 Add a “<” to read -3 < 6"
    },
    {
      "title": "Look over scientific notation rules.",
      "content": "Look over scientific notation rules. Scientific notation is the standard for which long numbers, either whole or decimal, are written. Significant digits are the numbers that are significant. These usually exclude 0s. [4] X Research source For example, when writing 0.0000001, you would instead notate 1 x 10^-7. This signifies that to get the decimal number, you have to move the decimal point 7 times to the left."

    {
      "title": "Look over as many topics as you can before the test.",
      "content": "Look over as many topics as you can before the test. Most math placement tests will give you credit for proving that you understand most of each topic. Study a wide range of what you have learned in the past: algebra, statistics, geometry, and calculus are all fair game when it comes to a math placement test. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid trying to learn concepts you aren’t familiar with.",
      "content": "Avoid trying to learn concepts you aren’t familiar with. Everyone’s math level is different. If you didn’t quite make it to calculus in high school or you are still stuck on algebra, that’s okay! Don’t try to teach yourself new concepts. Instead, review the ones that you are knowledgeable in so that you do well on those sections of the test. Focus on reexamining rather than learning. [15] X Research source You can’t fail a math placement test. Just do the best that you can on the levels that you do know."

      "title": "Take practice tests and answer practice problems online.",
      "content": "Take practice tests and answer practice problems online. The best way to prepare for a placement test is to answer questions that are similar to the ones on the real test. [16] X Expert Source Arash Fayz Test Prep Tutor Expert Interview. 1 November 2019. Check to see if your college website has a practice test that you can print out and answer. Or, search online for a practice math placement test. Make sure it has a variety of concepts so that you can use all of your knowledge and skills. [17] X Research source If you can find out which specific placement test you will be taking, search practice tests for that specific test. Otherwise, just search for general math placement test questions."

    {
      "title": "Take your time when working through the problems.",
      "content": "Take your time when working through the problems. Don’t rush through your placement test, even if you think you are an expert. Work slowly through the problems and make sure to read each one carefully. Double check your work if you have time to make sure you are answering correctly. [18] X Research source Some math placement tests are timed, but others are not. If yours is timed, do the questions that take you the least time first and then move onto harder ones."

    {
      "title": "Complete the sample questions if your test gives them to you.",
      "content": "Complete the sample questions if your test gives them to you. Some standardized placement tests, like Accuplacer, give you 1 to 2 sample questions to prepare you for the section you are about to take. Use these questions as an example of what is to come and prepare yourself for questions that are similar. [19] X Research source Use these questions to think back on what you have reviewed and go over the general rules in your head."

      "title": "Skip the questions you don’t know and come back to them.",
      "content": "Skip the questions you don’t know and come back to them. If you get stuck on a question, leave it until the very end and focus on the problems that you do know how to answer. Be sure to mark your page or remember to come back to it somehow so you don’t leave it blank. Leave yourself enough time at the end of the test to complete the problems you were unsure about. [20] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 316 wikiHow readers how they manage their time while taking a test, and 59% of them agreed that the best strategy is to skip difficult questions and come back to them later.

      "title": "Try not to be disappointed if you place into a lower-level math class.",
      "content": "Try not to be disappointed if you place into a lower-level math class. A placement test is a way to gauge what level of math you are proficient in and what you need to learn still. Don’t be discouraged if you get your results back and they are lower than you expected. All that means is you might need a few more classes to boost your math skills. [22] X Research source Some colleges will not give you credit for your math class until you reach a certain level. Check with your course advisor to see how many math classes you need to take for your particular department or degree. Often, your score on each section of the test correlates to what math class you are placed into. If you did great on the geometry section but poorly on the calculus one, you will likely be placed into a lower-level calculus class. The level of math that you need to take in college varies based on your major. An English major might not need to take as many math classes as a chemistry student would. Check with your advisor if you are confused about how many credits you need."
