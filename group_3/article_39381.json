      "title": "Position your body to shoot.",
      "content": "Position your body to shoot. The proper stance is the foundation to your shooting technique. Keep your feet, arms, hip/shoulder-width distance apart and relax your knees. Your hips, shoulders, and elbow should be facing forward. Your body should be aligned no matter where you are around the post. Stand close to the ring. Have someone else watch you as you practice your stance. Another person can see any errors and help you make adjustments. Practice your stance in different positions around the post. Make sure your feet are always pointed towards the post."

      "title": "Place the ball in your hands.",
      "content": "Place the ball in your hands. Hold the ball with your dominant/shooting hand and keep your fingers soft. Hold the ball as high as you can in both hands. Use your other hand for balance, but do not apply any pressure to the ball with this hand. Your fingers should be touching the ball, but leave a little space between the palm of your hand and the ball. If you are a younger player or a new player, it may be easier to hold the ball with two hands. Holding with two hands will give you more power when you are shooting. Once the ball is firmly in your hands, hold the ball high above your head. Your elbow should be by your forehead. You should not be able to see the ball when it is above your head."

      "title": "Shoot the netball.",
      "content": "Shoot the netball. Bend your elbows and your knees at the same time. Keep your elbow by your forehead and only move the top part of your arm. Straighten your elbow and your knees and then release the ball. Toss the ball up in an up-and-over motion toward the ring. Aim at the center point above the net as you shoot and flick your hand forward with your shooting arm. It is important that you bend your knees before you release the ball because the power of your shot comes from your knees. Flicking your hand will cause the ball to spin backwards after you release it. This helps with the accuracy of your shot. Keep your back straight as you release the ball. [1] X Research source If you are shooting with two hands, both of your hands will go through the shooting motion. Think of your elbow as a lever when you are shooting and only move the top portion (i.e. forearm area)."

      "content": "Stand a little further back, bend your knees and jump then throw to perfect your technique from further away. To be a good Goal Attack or Goal Shooter, you don't have to be able to get goals from a long way away from the ring, it's great if you can though."

      "content": "Remember the BEEF acronym. The shooting technique can be overwhelming. There are so many things to remember. BEEF can help you remember the key aspects of shooting a netball. [2] X Research source B for balance. Keep your feet hip/shoulder width apart and pointing towards the goal. E for eyes. Keep your eyes focused on where you want the ball to go. E for elbow. Keep your elbows close to your ears as you shoot. F for follow through. Always flick your hand and wrist at the end of your shot."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shoot by yourself.",
      "content": "Shoot by yourself. Shoot by yourself and really focus on your technique. Take shots from different angles around the post. Focus on the quality of the shots you are taking and not the number of shots. Evaluate each shot and ask yourself some questions: [3] X Research source Did I flick my hand at the end of my shot? Did my elbows touch my ears throughout my shot? Did I bend my knees? Did I keep my arms stretched above my head? Did I release the ball above my head? [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Shoot with a defensive partner.",
      "content": "Shoot with a defensive partner. It is much easier to shoot when you have no one defending you; however, this is an unlikely scenario when you are playing netball. Have a partner defend you as you practice your shooting. Practicing with a defender in front of you will simulate game pressure and teach you to shoot the ball over the defender. Ask your partner to point out any mistakes in your technique during this drill. [5] X Research source This drill can help you build confidence in your shooting abilities."

    {
      "title": "Combine shooting and cardio.",
      "content": "Combine shooting and cardio. Your technique may suffer when you become tired. Incorporating cardio into shooting practice will help you build endurance and stamina. Place a ball anywhere in the semicircle. Sprint to the sideline, sprint back to the ball, pick up the ball, and then shoot. Try to get in 10 shots as fast as you can. [6] X Research source You will need a partner to retrieve balls for you during this drill. Your partner should place the ball in a different spot in the semi-circle each time. Focus more on your technique as you become tired."

    {
      "title": "Use your fingers when shooting.",
      "content": "Use your fingers when shooting. Keep your fingers relaxed and rest the ball on the pads of your fingers. If your fingers are too straight or stiff, you will not be able to hold the ball in the correct position. Also make sure that your fingers are spread out on the ball. Be careful not to apply pressure to the ball with your opposite hand. This can change the trajectory of your shot. It will take practice to correctly balance the netball. You want to cradle the ball and make sure that it is stable [7] X Research source , but you do not want to hold too tightly and have trouble releasing it either."

    {
      "title": "Maintain the correct shooting stance.",
      "content": "Maintain the correct shooting stance. Make sure your feet are in a good position. If your feet are not hip width apart, you may be off balance when you shoot. Keep your feet parallel and do not let one foot be too far in front of the other. You do not want to be too close to a defender while you are shooting. Your hips and shoulders should be in a straight line. Many people allow their shoulders to move forward which will cause the whole body to move forward. Leaning forward when you shoot will change the trajectory of your shot. If you are having trouble keeping your hips and shoulder aligned, have someone hold your shoulders back as you shoot so that you can feel what the correct position is."

    {
      "title": "Practice in a focused way.",
      "content": "Practice in a focused way. Try to practice shooting for 15 or 20 minutes each day, even on the days that you have a team practice. Shooting will eventually become second nature to you. You will be less affected by fatigue or a defender in front of you if you are comfortable with your shot. [8] X Research source You only have three seconds to shoot when you are in the game. Try not to hold the ball too long even when you are practicing. Whether you are practicing alone or with a partner as a defender, focus on the back of the ring as you shoot. Try to practice with a coach or a more experienced shooter. Constructive feedback can help you grow as a player."
