      "title": "Choose your heritage.",
      "content": "Choose your heritage. GTA V lets you choose four grandparents that will affect how your parents will look. These generated parents will then define what your character will look like. This makes sense, since it simulates the natural method of how our physical appearance is affected by our roots. You can also adjust the degree of your resemblance to your parents."
