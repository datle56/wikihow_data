      "content": "Hairs that are repeatedly pulled tight are more likely to fall out. Tight ponytails, buns, pigtails, cornrows, and braids can cause a condition called traction alopecia—which is basically when individual hairs start to fall out from being pulled too tight for too long. Use these hairstyles only sparingly and opt for more relaxed hairstyles the rest of the time.

      "content": "Use heat sources and chemical treatments on your hair sparingly. Hot blow dryers, curlers, irons, and combs strip moisture from your hair and weaken the individual strands. Similarly, chemical treatments like perms, straighteners, relaxers, and colorants can significantly weaken your hair. Save such treatments for special occasions, not for frequent use.

      "content": "Having high stress levels can lead to particular types of hair loss. It feels like a vicious cycle: hair loss can cause stress, and excessive stress can cause hair loss. But you can help break the cycle by managing your stress levels . Try meditating, taking long walks, doing yoga, breathing deeply, journaling, or doing whatever other healthy activities work as stress-busters for you. Reducing your stress can help control the following types of hair loss: [6] X Trustworthy Source Mental Health Foundation UK charity working towards good mental health for all. Go to source If you have telogen effluvium, significant stress pushes large numbers of hair follicles into a resting phase. Within a couple months, affected hairs fall out suddenly when you comb or wash your hair. With trichotillomania, you have an irresistible urge to pull hair from your scalp, eyebrows or other areas of your body. You might do this to deal with stress, tension, loneliness, boredom, or frustration. Stress also can cause patchy baldness (alopecia areata). With this condition, your immune system attacks your hair follicles, which causes hair loss."

There's little specific evidence to support these claims, but it's true that your hair follicles do contain water [10] X Research source and that proper hydration is critical to your overall health. [11] X Research source So drink up! How much water should you drink?

Choose a carrier oil like jojoba or coconut oil and add a small amount—roughly equal to the amount of shampoo you use in your hair—to a small bowl. Add 2-3 drops of pure peppermint oil (3% concentration) and stir the mixture with your fingers. Massage the oil into your thinning hair once per day for at least 4 weeks, preferably in the evening so it can stay in your hair overnight.

A few drops of peppermint oil may not seem like much, but it’s potent stuff! Resist the urge to use undiluted peppermint oil—it can cause a strong burning sensation and scalp irritation. This treatment is likely to be more effective for patchy baldness (alopecia areata) as opposed to male or female pattern baldness.

If you’re showing clear signs of hair loss and want a professional diagnosis and treatment plan, see your doctor. Even if you’re not sure you’re losing hair but are feeling worried that you might be, pay your doctor a visit to discuss your situation. They’ll likely do a physical examination, medical history, and family history, and possibly some other diagnostic tests. From there, the two of you can talk about your current situation, your future potential for hair loss, and your particular treatment options. [20] X Research source Your doctor may perform a hair pull test to see if you have active hair loss. This involves grabbing 40–60 hair fibers close to the skin and lightly tugging them. If 6 or more hairs pull out easily, then you may have active hair loss."

The first, minoxidil (Rogaine), is a non-prescription (OTC) liquid or foam that can be used by men and women. Rubbing the product into your scalp 1-2 times per day works to grow new hair and prevent additional hair loss. Finasteride (Propecia) is a prescription drug in once-daily pill form that should be used only by men. Many finasteride users experience slowed hair loss and may have new hair growth. With either drug, you must continue to use the product for the effects to last. [21] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Possible side effects of minoxidil include scalp irritation, undesired hair growth on your face and hands, and a rapid heart rate.
