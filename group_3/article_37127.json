You may state that you are reporting the violence anonymously and withhold your name. Do not give your name or any other identifying characteristics. If someone on the other end asks how you know violence is occurring, say, “I heard it.” Don’t say, “I live next door and can hear it.” That detail can give away your identity. Instead, simply state the address, details of the abuse, and a description of the abuse you witnessed."

In the broad sense, domestic abuse is any act of a controlling and abusive nature that takes place in the context of a domestic relationship, including dating relationships. Abuse can be sexual, physical, emotional, verbal, psychological, or economic. It can happen to anyone, regardless of age, race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Domestic Violence Hotline Organization providing lifesaving tools, support, and resources for victims and survivors of domestic abuse Go to source Each state defines domestic violence differently. For example, most states require a physical or sexual manifestation which can be as little as a bare touch without consent. Some states, however, require that the perpetrator use enough force or intimidation that the victim is in fear of their physical safety."

      "title": "Determine whether you should report the violence.",
      "content": "Determine whether you should report the violence. Your first instinct may be to report any domestic violence that you suspect. However, doing so can create more problems for the victim than solutions. If the victim hasn’t created a safety plan, then getting the police involved could limit the victim’s options. Furthermore, police involvement could anger the abuser, leading to increased abuse. Instead of reporting domestic violence, you might want to reach out to the victim and ask what they want. You could help the victim come up with a safety plan, or you could put the victim in touch with agencies that help victims of domestic violence. Nevertheless, if the victim is in imminent danger, then you should call the police. If you hear physical fighting, objects being broken, or violent threats like “I will kill you!” then you should call the police immediately."

      "title": "Consider the benefits.",
      "content": "Consider the benefits. Many people who want to report domestic violence anonymously wish to do so because they fear the abuser. You may fear the abuser because you live in the same house, have had threatening contact with the abuser, or because you fear the victim. By reporting the abuse anonymously, you can protect yourself from potential payback. You may also not be entirely sure if domestic violence is occurring. In this situation, you may be embarrassed if you are wrong. By reporting anonymously, you can avoid a later confrontation with the suspected victim or abuser."

      "title": "Weigh the negatives.",
      "content": "Weigh the negatives. If you report anonymously, then the police will not have your name and they probably cannot use your report in court. An abuser charged with a crime has a right to confront witnesses in court. Accordingly, it may be difficult for the prosecutor to bring charges, especially if the victim refuses to testify. If you are reporting abuse committed against yourself, then you should know that you will probably need to publicly accuse the other person of violence if you hope to see the abuser jailed. If you are being abused and you want help on how to leave your abuser, then you should call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 with questions. The organization also has a website with links to resources, such as contact information for state agencies and brochures on how to create a safety plan."

      "content": "Choose to come forward at a later date. Know that if you report domestic violence anonymously, you can still identify yourself at a later date. If you hear abuse and fear that the victim is in imminent harm, you can report the violence anonymously and then reach out to the victim. If the victim wants help putting the abuser in prison, then you can choose to come forward and identify yourself to police. At that point, you can share with police your documentation of all the abuse you have observed."
