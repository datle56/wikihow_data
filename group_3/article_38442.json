If you add the barbecue sauce too early, your chicken may end up over-flavored. If you add it too late, your chicken may not be flavored enough. Here are some guidelines: If you are baking or grilling the chicken, apply the barbecue sauce at the very end, just as the chicken finishes cooking. If you are cooking your chicken on a slow roaster or in a crock pot, add the barbecue sauce when the chicken is halfway done. Consider adding a little bit of honey mustard to your barbecue sauce for an added kick. Consider using barbecue sauce as a marinade if you are planning on grilling the chicken."
