      "content": "Turn a thermostat dial to a higher number to lower the temp. Find the temperature dial inside your fridge on the top or side. Start with a setting in the middle of the range since that’s usually what manufacturers recommend. If you need to turn the temperature a little warmer, spin the dial to the left instead. The temperature dial may have a range of numbers from 1–5 or 1–10, or it may simply be a range from “cold” to “coldest.” While the highest number on a dial is usually the coldest setting, double-check your fridge’s manual to be sure since the settings can vary between brands and models."

      "content": "Push a sliding temperature gauge to the right for a colder fridge. Look for a horizontal sliding gauge at the top of your fridge’s interior near the hinges. Use your finger to push the slider to change the temperature. Typically, moving the slider to the right will make your fridge colder, and pushing it to the left will raise the temperature. [1] X Expert Source Aaron Beth Appliance Technician Expert Interview. 14 July 2020. Most fridges have “warm” and “cold” labels on the ends of the sliding gauge so you know which way to move it. Look for a small tick mark in the middle of the sliding gauge since that’s usually the recommended temperature setting for the fridge."

      "content": "Use the arrow keys to adjust the temperature on a digital keypad. The keypad may be on the front of your fridge near an ice dispenser or on the inner edge of the fridge door. Try using the arrow or “+” and “-” buttons to adjust the temperature until it’s the temperature you want. If that doesn’t work right away, look for a button that says “Temperature” and hold it down for a few seconds until the display changes. Then, you should be able to make your adjustments with the arrow buttons. [2] X Research source Check your fridge’s manual if you’re having trouble changing the temperature since there may be a specific sequence of buttons you need to press for the thermostat controls."

When you put large portions of hot food in your fridge, it could raise the temperature inside or cause the food to cool unevenly. Use shallow, air-tight containers to split up the portions so they’re less likely to affect your fridge’s temperature. [10] X Research source You can leave your food out to cool, but move it into your fridge within 2 hours since it may reach unsafe temperatures and develop bacteria. If you want to quickly cool food before putting it away, put it in a container and chill it in cold water or an ice bath."

If you feel cold air around the outside of your fridge door or see any visible damage, replace the seal with a new one to stop your fridge from running constantly or warming up.
