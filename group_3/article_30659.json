To get the most accurate measurement, get a flexible plastic measuring tape and bring it around your torso to the fullest part of your breasts. [3] X Expert Source Kpoene Kofi-Bruce Couture Bridal Designer Expert Interview. 28 January 2021. Position the tape directly over your nipples and relax your arms at your sides. If possible, get someone to help you take the measurement so you’re able to keep your arms down. [4] X Research source If you don’t have anyone to help you take your measurement, you can do it on your own. Just hold the measuring tape in both hands, bring it around your bust, and put your elbows down at your sides. Make sure the measuring tape is not too high or too low. You should be measuring right where the most protruding part of your bust is, not underneath. That is a completely different measurement. It is recommended to use a flexible plastic measuring tape instead of a fabric one. They tend to stretch over time and give you an inaccurate measurement. [5] X Research source If you’re going to wear a bra under your dress, make sure it fits properly. A good fitting bra fits snug around the torso and the straps stay in place. As for the cups, your breasts should fill them perfectly without any gaping or spilling. [6] X Research source The bra should be unpadded, as well.

[8] X Expert Source Mia Danilowicz Master Tailor Expert Interview. 8 January 2021. The measuring tape should be parallel to the floor. To ensure that it is level, stand in front of a mirror and turn sideways. Then you can see if the measuring tape is straight and level.

      "content": "Hold the tape measure so it is snug around your bust. The tape measure shouldn’t squeeze your bust too tight or slip down because it is too loose. [10] X Expert Source Mia Danilowicz Master Tailor Expert Interview. 8 January 2021. This will result in a measurement that is too big or too small, and ultimately your dress won’t fit correctly. Your tape measure shouldn’t suffocate you, but you should not be able to fit a finger between it. [11] X Research source Don’t hold your breath while you’re measuring. This might make the measurement might come out too small."

      "content": "Read the number on the tape measure and round to the nearest whole number. Your bust measurement will be at the place on the tape where the zero meets the slack end of the tape measure. The number that you see should be rounded to the nearest whole number. If the measurement falls at the ½ inch mark, round up. That will be your bust measurement. For example, if your bust is 34.5 inches (88 cm), then you should round up to 35 inches (89 cm)."

      "title": "Place the measuring tape under your armpits to measure over your bust.",
      "content": "Place the measuring tape under your armpits to measure over your bust. Some dressmakers may need the measurement above your breasts, depending on the dress style. To take this measurement, wrap the measuring tape around your chest directly under your armpits. Try to keep the tape measure above your breasts, and level at the same time. It should be snug, but not too tight that it squeezes your chest. Record the number on the tape measure after you have exhaled. [12] X Research source Make sure your arms are down while taking this measurement. [13] X Expert Source Mia Danilowicz Master Tailor Expert Interview. 8 January 2021. If your arms are raised, the measurement will come out smaller than it really is. Ask a friend to help you if you’re having trouble keeping your arms down while taking the measurement on your own. Remove all clothing aside from the bra or undergarments you plan to wear under your dress. If you plan on wearing your dress without any undergarments, take the measurement against your bare skin. This will ensure the best fit."

      "content": "Wrap the measuring tape around your rib cage to measure under your bust. Take the measuring tape and position it directly under your bust right where the breast tissue ends. Make sure your body is relaxed and your arms are down at your sides. Breathe normally and inhale slightly, then record the measurement after exhaling. This will ensure your chest is completely relaxed and give you the most accurate measurement. [14] X Research source Make sure the measuring tape is level to the ground. Check this by looking in the mirror. The measuring tape should be applied loosely and not too tight that it pinches the skin."

      "content": "Record the number on the measuring tape and round to the nearest even number. You can read the tape measure to find under and over bust circumferences. The size will be at the place on the tape where the zero meets the slack end of the tape measure. The number that you see should be rounded up to the nearest even number. For example, if your underbust measurement is 27.7 inches (70 cm), round up to 28 inches (71 cm). These measurements can also help you to determine your correct bra size."

      "content": "Place one end of the tape measure at the top of your shoulder. Put the end of the measuring tape right at the top of your shoulders. The best place to start is right where your shoulder meets your neck. You can complete this measurement on either the left or right shoulder; whichever is the most comfortable for you.

      "content": "Bring the tape measure straight down to the center of your bust. Now, make a straight line with your tape measure so it stops directly in the center of your breast right at the nipple. Before recording the measurement, make sure the measuring tape is straight; not crooked or twisted. [16] X Research source Your neck and shoulders should be relaxed. If you are tense or if you bring your arm or shoulder up, you’ll get an inaccurate measurement. Do not raise your arm that’s on the side you’re measuring at any point. It should be down at your side the entire time."
