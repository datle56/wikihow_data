      "content": "Get your guinea pig neutered if he doesn't like living with males. Guinea pigs are social creatures, but sometimes, a male guinea pig won't get along with other males. If that's the case, you'll need to neuter your male guinea pig so he can live with females. [1] X Research source Neutering your male guinea pig will keep him from getting your females pregnant."

      "title": "Neuter your male guinea pig if you've lost the other males.",
      "content": "Neuter your male guinea pig if you've lost the other males. Sometimes, your guinea pig's male companion may pass away, and you're not ready to add more males to your household. In that case, you need to move the guinea pig in with any females you have for companionship, and he needs to be neutered. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Do the procedure as early as 6 weeks.",
      "content": "Do the procedure as early as 6 weeks. Typically, guinea pigs can come home from a rescue, breeder, or pet shop at this age. However, they can reproduce even when they are this young, so you should get your guinea pig neutered before putting him in with females. This rule also holds if you have babies from your guinea pigs. Some veterinarians won't do the surgery this early. If that's the case, keep your guinea pig separate from females until you can have the surgery done."

      "title": "Avoid neutering your guinea pig if you don't need to.",
      "content": "Avoid neutering your guinea pig if you don't need to. Guinea pigs are a bit more difficult to neuter than a dog or cat, so getting one neutered requires a vet who works regularly with guinea pigs. [3] X Trustworthy Source Animal Humane Society Leading animal welfare nonprofit organization providing medical care, training education, and resources for animal owners Go to source Either way, the procedure carries risks, and guinea pigs don't always respond well to anesthetic. [4] X Research source Neutering won't change your guinea pig's temperament nor will it help him get along with other males better. While neutering will prevent testicular cancer as it does in dogs and cats, guinea pigs aren't as likely to get as dogs or cats. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Find a veterinarian who specializes in small animals.",
      "content": "Find a veterinarian who specializes in small animals. Because guinea pigs are a little more difficult, you want a veterinarian who has as much experience as possible. Search for a veterinarian online who notes that they have worked on many small animals and check the reviews for that veterinarian to make sure they're positive. You can also call the office to see what they specialize in and ask other questions you may have. [6] X Research source You can also ask for recommendations from your friends or family members who have small pets. Some humane societies offer low-cost neutering for guinea pigs, so check your local society."

      "content": "Expect to pay $80-$120 USD for neuter. Unless you get the surgery done with a rescue or a human society, the surgery will likely run you this much. Of course, the price can be higher or lower based on what area you live in. [7] X Research source Some rescues have the guinea pigs neutered before adopting them out, and then it's included in the adoption fee."

      "title": "Leave your guinea pig at the veterinarian for the day.",
      "content": "Leave your guinea pig at the veterinarian for the day. Typically, the surgery is just a day procedure, meaning you drop him off in the morning and pick him up at night. The vet will provide anesthetic, do the procedure, then stitch up your guinea pig with dissolvable stitches and surgical glue. [8] X Research source The vet will also need to shave the area to perform the surgery. The hair will grow back, though!"

      "content": "Ask the veterinarian if your guinea pig needs probiotics in addition to antibiotics. The vet may give you a round of antibiotics for your guinea pig to ward off infection. However, because guinea pigs are sensitive to antibiotics, you may want probiotics, too, to help combat the side effects of probiotics. [9] X Research source Sometimes, antibiotics can upset your guinea pig's stomach, which is where the probiotics come in."

      "title": "Talk to your vet about pain reliever, if your pet needs it.",
      "content": "Talk to your vet about pain reliever, if your pet needs it. In some cases, your vet will provide your guinea pig with a liquid pain reliever after it gets neutered. To administer the pain reliever, you'll likely need to use a syringe without a needle to put a few drops of the medication into your guinea pig's mouth. Make sure you read and follow all of the instructions on the pain reliever. Don't give your guinea pig too much pain reliever. Follow the dosing instructions carefully. Your vet may decide that your guinea pig doesn't need a pain reliever."

      "content": "Encourage your guinea pig to rest after surgery. Expect your guinea pig to be sleepy and unsteady when you bring him home. The veterinarian will likely use a breathable anesthetic, but your guinea pig will still need time to recover from it. A breathable anesthetic is one your guinea pig breaths in rather than one your veterinarian injects into the guinea pig. [10] X Research source Place your guinea pig in a small cage with clean towels to help it stay quiet. [11] X Research source Keep your guinea pig away from the other guinea pigs to help keep him quiet. Make sure your guinea pig eats within 24 hours of its surgery. If it won't eat, contact your vet immediately, as this can be an emergency."

      "title": "Give your guinea pig the antibiotics or pain relief according to your vet's directions.",
      "content": "Give your guinea pig the antibiotics or pain relief according to your vet's directions. Draw the amount recommended by your vet up into a syringe. Insert the syringe into the bottle, and turn the bottle upside down to draw the medicine into the syringe with the plunger, filling it to the appropriate line. [12] X Research source Hold the guinea pig against your chest with 1 hand, cupping 1 finger in front of and 1 finger behind his front legs. Use your thumb and pointer finger to guide his head. Insert the syringe in the front of his mouth until you're just behind his front teeth. Slowly push the medicine in his mouth, allowing him to drink it as you do. To give your guinea pig probiotics in addition to the antibiotics, buy a tube of probiotic gel recommended by your vet. Then, give your guinea pig a drop from the tube once a day, but make sure to separate it from the antibiotic dose by 4-6 hours. The probiotics are flavored, and the guinea pig will latch on and eat the drop. [13] X Research source"

Typically, though, you boil water on the stove for 10 minutes and allow it to cool. Dip a cotton pad into the water and gently wipe down the wound once a day until it is healed.

They'll check your pet's incision to make sure it's clean and healing. Expect these followup visits to take place on the 3rd and 10th days after the operation. Ask your vet when you need to bring in your guinea pig for a checkup. If your pet appears to be ill or might be having complications, take it back to the vet immediately."
