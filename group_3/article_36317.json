      "content": "Empty all your cabinets. Plates, silverware, pots, pans, and anything else stored in your cabinets must go before you start the job. These could break during the removal process if they aren’t stored away safely. They will also add extra weight to the cabinets and make them much harder to remove. [1] X Research source Don’t just put these items off to the side. Move them into a different room entirely so they won’t get in the way. Cover these items with a sheet if you’re doing a lot of construction in your home. This prevents dust and debris from getting on your belongings."

      "title": "Turn off the water to the sink.",
      "content": "Turn off the water to the sink. Base cabinets are usually connected to the countertop, meaning you'll have to remove the counter. The first step in removing the countertop is pulling out the sink, so turn your sink's water supply off to prevent floods. [2] X Research source Look under the sink for a shut-off valve. This is a metal knob on the side of the pipe leading to your sink. Turn this knob clockwise until it stops to turn off the water supply. Always double check that the water is off. Turn on your kitchen sink and make sure no water flows out. Turn the valve further if water still flows from the sink."

      "content": "Cut off the electricity to the room. While removing the counters, you’ll be working around electrical outlets and may have to move some wires out of the way. Keep yourself safe by turning off the electricity to this area. Go to the breaker box in your home. Open it and find the circuit breaker that controls your kitchen electricity. If it was installed properly, the breakers should be labeled. Turn the fuse that powers your kitchen to the \"Off\" position. [3] X Research source Breaker boxes are usually in the basement or laundry area. If the breaker for your kitchen isn't labeled and you don't need power in the rest of your house, turn off the main breaker to turn off the electricity for the whole home. This breaker is a double-wide switch on the top of the service panel. If your kitchen is old, you may discover hidden wires and outlets during this job. If you come across wires, cover them with rubber plugs. You can find these at a local hardware store."

      "title": "Cover the countertops if you’re keeping them.",
      "content": "Cover the countertops if you’re keeping them. If you plan on keeping your countertop and reusing it with your new cabinets, make sure it’s protected. Put a thick sheet over it to keep dust and debris off it. Also, lay a flat piece of wood on top of the blanket to protect the counter from dents if you drop a tool. [4] X Research source If you’re not reusing your countertop, then no need to protect it. Let it get dirty and damaged while you work."

      "title": "Remove any trim or molding on the cabinets.",
      "content": "Remove any trim or molding on the cabinets. Decorative trim and molding is usually loosely-fastened with staples or small nails and should come off easily. Use either a crowbar or the claw of a hammer to remove these. Insert the blade in between the trim and cabinet. If the space is tight, give the crowbar a few taps with a hammer to drive in into the crack. Then pry until the trim comes off. [5] X Research source [6] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 7 April 2021. Check the wall and base cabinets for trim. Sometimes this wraps around corners and can be difficult to spot. Trim and molding can’t be reused, so don’t worry about damaging these pieces. They sometimes crack while you pry them off. If you plan on reusing the cabinets, be careful when prying the trim off. You could dent or scratch the wood. Wear gloves when handling the trim to avoid splinters or staples."

      "title": "Place support blocks under the wall cabinet you're working on.",
      "content": "Place support blocks under the wall cabinet you're working on. These prevent the cabinet from crashing to the floor if your hand slips while you remove it. Measure the distance between the countertop and the bottom of the cabinet. Then cut 4 pieces of lumber to that length and place 1 under each corner of the cabinet you’re removing. [7] X Research source For the lumber size, use something thick enough to support the weight of the cabinets. Blocks measuring 2 in × 4 in (5.1 cm × 10.2 cm) or 4 in × 4 in (10 cm × 10 cm) should do the trick. These supports are easily removable, so simply move them from cabinet to cabinet as you work. These supports are only meant to hold the cabinet momentarily while you regain your grip. They aren't stable enough for you to rest the entire weight of the cabinet on it."

      "title": "Remove the cabinet doors.",
      "content": "Remove the cabinet doors. The doors are connected to the cabinet with screws through their hinges. Open the door and find the hinges. Then use a screwdriver or drill to remove all the screws fastening the door to the cabinet. The door will then come off easily. [8] X Research source Hold on to the door when you remove the last screw. If it falls, it could damage your countertop or land on your foot. If you don’t plan on reusing the cabinets, then there’s no need to be gentle. On most cabinets, if you open the doors too far and push, they’ll simply break off. Save time by using this method if you’re getting rid of the cabinets anyway. If you plan on reusing the cabinets, save the door hinges and screws you remove. Place them in a plastic bag or container to keep all the pieces together. Wear goggles and gloves if you use a power drill to avoid injuries."

      "title": "Take out the shelves.",
      "content": "Take out the shelves. These shelves will get in the way when removing the cabinet, so take out all shelves before you start. Different cabinets have different mechanisms for securing their shelves. In most cases, the shelves rest on top of plugs in the cabinet wall. In this case, just lift the shelves off these supports and guide them out of the cabinet. [9] X Research source If the shelves are screwed in place, then find all the support screws holding the shelf down. Use your screwdriver or drill and remove all the screws. Remember to hold on to the shelf when you remove the final screw so it doesn’t fall out. You'll need the plugs and screws you remove here if you want to reuse the cabinets. Keep track of all the pieces by storing them in a plastic bag or container."

      "content": "Remove the screws holding the cabinets together. Cabinets are sometimes screwed together after they’re installed. Look inside the cabinets and see if there are one or more screws in the sides. These hold the cabinets together. If you see these screws, remove them before detaching the cabinets from the wall. [10] X Research source [11] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 7 April 2021. Screws attaching cabinets are usually placed around the door hinge, so look here first. [12] X Research source However installers don't always follow directions, so there may be screws in different locations. Use a flashlight and feel around with your hand to locate any remaining screws."

      "content": "Unscrew the cabinet from the wall. The cabinet should be fastened to the wall with drywall screws through the back. Look for a row of screws inside the cabinet running across the top. This is the most common place where cabinets are attached. Use either your power drill running in reverse or your screwdriver and take out each screw. If using a screwdriver, remember to turn screws counterclockwise to remove them. [13] X Research source [14] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 7 April 2021. Also look on the bottom of the cabinet, as extra screws are sometimes here as well. If you have a partner, have them hold onto the cabinet while you unscrew it to prevent the cabinet from falling to the ground."

Remove each cabinet one by one and put it in a safe place where no one will trip on it. You may be tempted to start working faster or less carefully as you remove more cabinets. Resist this temptation, because a wrong move could result in an injury."

      "content": "Pull out the cabinet drawers. Base cabinets usually have drawers instead of shelves. Empty the drawers before removing them. There are several types of drawers. Free-rolling drawers should come out easily. First pull the drawer all the way out until it stops, then lift up. This should pull the cabinet out of its socket, allowing you to slide the drawer completely out. [17] X Research source Unfasten drawers that use a different mechanism by unscrewing the brackets or pressing a release tab on the side. Keep any brackets or support pieces you remove if you plan on reusing the cabinets and drawers. Place the old drawers out of the way so you don't trip on them while you work."

[18] X Research source Double check again that the water is turned off before doing any work on the sink. Any mistake can result in a flood if the water is on. Wear gloves to avoid getting cut if the sink has jagged edges. If you're getting a new sink, don't worry about damaging the sink. If you're reusing the sink, then be careful and avoid damage while you remove it."

Look inside the base cabinets and see if there are screws drilled through the top. These screws connect the cabinets to the counter. Take out each one to free the countertop. Test the countertop after to see if it lifts easily. If it feels stuck, you missed a screw. [19] X Research source A kitchen counter may have a layer of caulk connecting it to the wall. If your counter has this, cut through the caulk with a razor blade to free it. Wear gloves to avoid cutting yourself. Be careful if you plan on reusing your countertop.
