      "content": "Old money style is associated with families who inherited their wealth. The old money aesthetic is a fashion statement that values expensive, tailored clothing, good manners, and sophistication. People with old money tend to hold an appreciation for tradition and quality over quantity, which comes out in their fashion. [1] X Research source Families who come from “old money” have inherited their wealth over generations, and tend to use it to maintain their social status. [2] X Research source This is different from the style of newly rich families—instead of spending money on Corvettes and Gucci handbags, old money families might focus on lavish vacations and real estate. However, that doesn’t mean you have to be upper-class to rock this style! This trend is more of an emphasis on quality craftsmanship than expensive luxury items. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "The old money style is about curating a neutral and elegant wardrobe. The old money aesthetic is about quiet luxury—instead of wearing flashy items with Gucci labels, you accessorize your outfits with care and pay attention to the small details. Instead of gold and neon pink, old money clothing is in neutral shades that don’t stand out in a crowd. [4] X Research source For example, you might wear cufflinks engraved with their family’s name or jewelry that was passed down from their grandparents. The neutral colors are so that each high-quality piece is timeless and can be worn interchangeably with other items."

      "content": "Put on linen, Oxford, or Egyptian cotton button-down shirts. Dreaming of hot summer days on the Italian Riviera? Look for light-weight, half-unbuttoned button-down shirts to feel like you’re about to jet off on your next vacation in Europe. Best colors: White, off-white, cream, black, beige, light blue, and gray. Complete the look: Put on a pair of loafers or sandals and dress pants or shorts.

      "content": "Use polo shirts for a pop of preppy color. Nothing is more traditional (and effortlessly preppy) than Ralph Lauren’s classic polo shirts. Not only do they come in tons of different colors, there are also tons of knock-off brands you can buy to mimic the look without draining your wallet. Best colors: Experiment with different colors, or stick to the classics—dark blue, light blue, white, and dark green. Complete the look: Pair any polo with light-colored dress pants or dark-wash jeans and brown dress shoes or sandals."

      "content": "Go with a turtleneck during cold weather days. Solid-colored turtleneck sweaters can make an effortless and timeless look—if they fit properly. Professional stylist Susan Kim says to “find a turtleneck that hugs and shapes your body as you want your body to be framed. Loose fitting, wrong fitting, over-worn turtlenecks can give an immediate unflattering look.” Best colors: Black, beige, cream, and brown. Complete the look: Kim says to wrap a colorful sweater “around your shoulders so the sleeves only show in the front for a pop of color and pop of personality.”"

      "content": "Use dress pants to complete any old money look.

Best colors: Khaki, beige, brown, white, black, and navy blue. Complete the look: Dress down with a polo or dress up with a button-down shirt, tie, and a light sweater with the sleeves draped over your shoulders."

      "content": "Incorporate jeans for a more modern, casual look. Although you wouldn’t think of jeans as old money, jeans can look high-class when paired with a clean button-down or a cable knit sweater. Try to stick to solid-colored jeans like white, though—these tend to look more formal than worn or distressed jeans. [6] X Research source Best colors: White, dark wash, and black. Complete the look: To elevate white jeans, image consultant Elle Monus suggests wearing “a collared button down in a high contrast color or in a neutral color… Unbutton at least the top two buttons and skip the tie. Leave [it] untucked or half-tucked for an effortlessly cool look.”"

      "content": "Wear blazers over formal and casual outfits. According to image consultant Alice Wu, you can make cheaper clothes look more expensive by adding “something with a little bit of structure” like a blazer. She says that “structure adds a little bit more pop to your outfit and makes you look more mature.” Best colors: Black and dark blue. Complete the look: Go with a white t-shirt or a button-up, and dress the bottom half with a pair of sensible shoes and dress pants or jeans."

      "content": "Wear tweed jackets, trench coats, or overcoats on top of your ensemble. Personal wardrobe stylist Paul Julch says you can wear overcoats with “anything because it's basically a super versatile piece” that can “slightly dress up what you're wearing underneath.” When you’re about to walk on the door in your new ‘fit, grab a wool or tweed jacket to protect you from the cold. Best colors: Grey, beige, brown, and black. Complete the look: Throw your jacket over a sweater, a pressed button-down shirt, or a chunky turtleneck."

      "content": "Pick out shirts and sweaters with subtle branding. Think Ralph Lauren, Loro Piana, Hermés, or Burberry—their designer gear is all about luxurious fabrics with elegantly placed logos. If those options aren’t in your price range, try brands like J. Crew , Banana Republic , Brooks Brothers , or Express . Best colors: Steer clear of loud, colorful logos. Instead, look for items with branding that doesn’t stand out or overpower the rest of the outfit. Complete the look: Wear expensive-looking accessories like a watch or a leather belt."

[7] X Research source Best colors: Brown, dark blue, gray, and black.

[8] X Research source Best colors: Black, gray, and blue. Complete the look: Go with a pair of refined cufflinks and polished black dress shoes."

Best colors: Stick to black and brown. Some shoes also come with silver buckles or tassels to give your outfit more personality. Complete the look: Wear black crew socks (or no-show socks if you’re wearing shorts) and try to match the color of your shoes to an accessory, like a belt or jacket."

      "content": "Invest in quality scents like sandalwood or bergamot. Cedarwood, bergamot, sandalwood, and patchouli are all timeless, high-class scents that can help sell your new look. When shopping for cologne, Monus suggests finding “a great scent that is both light and masculine and spritz on just enough for others to smell you as you get close.” Fragrances can also help increase your confidence and adds to the impression that you’re a sharp, well-dressed person.

Wait until everyone has sat down to begin eating and say “thank you” to anyone who serves you. [20] X Research source Holding the door open and offering to help others carry items are also good practices. When you throw formal dinners of your own, greet your guests as they arrive and introduce everyone to each other so no one feels left out.
