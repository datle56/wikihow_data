      "content": "Stick the edge of the scraper underneath the edge of the film. Then, push against the film to see how easily it will come off. You can also use auto trim tools that are made of poly/nylon and are safe for the paint surface. Be sure not to use a metal scraper as it could scratch the paint finish."

      "content": "If you only get tiny pieces at a time, hold a heat gun over the section. Do not get the heat gun too close to the car, 8–12 inches (20.3–30.5 cm) works best. Hold the heat gun on the section for about a minute or two. If the film comes off fairly easily and in large strips, a heat gun may not be necessary but would help. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Gently push underneath the heated film to remove bigger strips.",
      "content": "Gently push underneath the heated film to remove bigger strips. It’s perfectly normal not to get everything off in each pass. Work in small sections at a time, repeating the process of heating then scraping. You will know when you need to heat again as the strips being removed will get smaller. This process will take some time so patience is a must! As long as you get the top layer of the film off the rest will come off easily with Goo Gone adhesive remover."

      "title": "Spray Goo Gone on a microfiber towel and gently rub it over the adhesive.",
      "content": "Spray Goo Gone on a microfiber towel and gently rub it over the adhesive. Work in small sections and spray more Goo Gone on the towel as needed. Rub over the areas until the adhesive has been removed. The plastic scraper can also help you remove any leftover adhesive. [2] X Research source If you want to ensure you’ve removed all the adhesive, use a clay bar kit. Just spray down a small area and rub the clay bar over it. [3] X Research source The clay bar will pull up the rest of the particles that are left and make a nice smooth finish. When all the adhesive has been removed, wipe the entire area down with another dry microfiber towel. Then, wax the entire area of the car where the invisible shield was."
