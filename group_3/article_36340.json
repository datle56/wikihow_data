      "title": "Soak the mastic in hot water.",
      "content": "Soak the mastic in hot water. This will only work on some types of mastic, usually in recent homes. It's worth trying first, as wetting the mastic can make other methods safer. You should notice the mastic loosening within 20 to 60 minutes. Mix the hot water with vinegar or citrus degreaser for extra strength. Old, black mastic may contain asbestos. Keep it wet at all times during removal, to prevent dangerous dust."

      "title": "Chisel the mastic off.",
      "content": "Chisel the mastic off. Once the mastic is wet, try to break it off with a hammer and chisel. If it's soft, scrape it off with a wide putty knife. Use a long-handled edge scraper on floors to save bending over."

    {
      "title": "Use a heat gun cautiously.",
      "content": "Use a heat gun cautiously. Some modern mastics or mastics containing linseed oil will soften when heated. However, these are also flammable. Wear heat-resistant gloves and use the heat gun for no more than a few seconds at each spot. Scrape up with a putty knife as you go. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Purchase mastic remover.",
      "content": "Purchase mastic remover. This is available online or at hardware stores, but may cost over $100 per 5-gallon (19L) bucket. Products made from citrus or acetic acid are safer than other mastic removers. If you are removing mastic from wood sub-floor, look for a product that is designed for use on wood. Overuse of removal chemicals can make it difficult to bond future flooring."

      "title": "Open all of your windows and doors.",
      "content": "Open all of your windows and doors. Use as much ventilation as possible. Limit your time in the area while the chemical reaction takes place. Check the label of your chemical for more safety instructions. Some products may recommend a face mask."

    {
      "title": "Apply a thin layer of mastic remover.",
      "content": "Apply a thin layer of mastic remover. Load the mastic remover into a sprayer if possible, or apply it to the top of the mastic with a mop. If you are applying it to mastic that is above wood flooring, use rags instead. Start at the far end of the room and work back to the door. Clean your footwear whenever you leave the area."

      "title": "Scrape up the mastic.",
      "content": "Scrape up the mastic. Wear gloves and scrape up any stuck-on mastic. You can use a razor scraper or putty knife. Place by-products in a bucket for disposal at a hazardous waste facility. You can instead use a floor machine equipped with a 3M black scrubbing pad, with a speed no higher than 175 rpm. Using a different setup or letting the floor dry may expose you to asbestos."

      "title": "Test for asbestos",
      "content": "Test for asbestos . Old, black mastic can contain asbestos, which causes illness or death when inhaled. Using tools to break up the mastic send the asbestos fibers into the air, which makes it more dangerous than the chemical method above. If asbestos is present, this method is not recommended, and may violate workplace safety regulations. Consider hiring a professional, or use the chemical method above."

    {
      "title": "Wear safety equipment.",
      "content": "Wear safety equipment. Even if there is no asbestos, you should protect yourself from debris. Wear safety glasses, a paper mask, and work gloves. If asbestos is present, this method is not recommended. If you continue anyway, use a tight-fitting respirator mask, safety goggles, and disposable rubber gloves. Wear old clothing, and throw it away at the end of the project. Turn off all air circulation to the rest of the building."

      "title": "Attach a mastic removal block.",
      "content": "Attach a mastic removal block. This is a round base that attaches to your floor machine. It should have several blades at the base, to cut the mastic. [3] X Research source This is typically safe for hardwood floors, but check with the tool rental service. [4] X Research source You can also use a base intended to remove thinset from concrete. Avoid titanium blocks, which may melt the mastic and make removal messy."
