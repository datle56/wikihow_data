      "content": "Roll the fabric into a damp towel. If you don't want to make any drastic changes to your rayon garment, shrink it in a more subtle way.

If you want it shrunken more, you can always resort to one of the other methods for your second attempt."

      "content": "Press out the water and hang dry. You can dry your wet rayon by gently pressing out excess water and then hanging it on a clothes line to let the outdoor air dry it. Avoid squeezing the water out because this could potentially create wrinkles and stretch the fabric out unevenly. This method may make the fabric stretch the most lengthwise."

      "content": "Dry rayon fabric in the dryer. Put your wet rayon garment in the dryer on the gentle setting until it's completely dry. Drying your fabric in this way will most likely allow for the greatest possible amount of shrinkage."
