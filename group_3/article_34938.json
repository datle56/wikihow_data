      "content": "Flush out your sinuses. If sinus problems cause your puffy eyes but an antihistamine doesn't reduce those bags thoroughly enough, consider using a neti pot to flush out the extra fluid building up beneath your eyes.

Pour this solution into a clean neti pot, then tip your head to the side and use the neti pot to pour half the solution into one nostril. Tip your forehead lower to help the solution drain out of your other nostril. Repeat the same process using the other half of the solution, swapping sides to cleanse your sinus passages more thoroughly. You can also clear out your sinuses using a saline nasal spray."

Retinol eye creams are a popular choice. While these creams work well in the long run by promoting collagen production, they may not provide immediate results. A better option for fast relief might be an eye cream with caffeine in it. [6] X Expert Source Christin Birckhead Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 14 April 2020.

      "content": "Remove any makeup. Before going to bed, thoroughly wash off any makeup you applied to your face earlier in the day. Eye makeup can cause your eyes to water while you sleep, which will increase the amount of puffiness you wake up with. If possible, try to use actual makeup remover to strip cosmetics from your skin before bed. Removers are specially formulated to cling to the makeup particles and lift them away, making them more effective than plain soap and water. If you don't have makeup remover, though, regular facial cleanser and plain water will still work. Just make sure that you keep washing until all eye makeup is completely gone."
