      "content": "Know the difference between a medical mask and an N95 respirator. An N95 respirator is a device used by health practitioners to block 95% of very small particles. Unlike medical masks, N95 respirators fit more securely on your face and against your skin, and are able to filter airborne particles. [4] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source While an N95 respirator can block 95% of very small particles — very small being considered 0.3 microns — there is still a 5% chance harmful particles can penetrate the respirator. N95 respirators are not designed for use by children or by people who have facial hair. Some N95 masks come with an exhalation valve that is designed to reduce condensation build-up inside the mask and allow the wearer to breathe easier. These masks, however, should not be used in a situation where a sterile field is required as the exhalation valve allows unfiltered (and possibly contaminated) air to leave the mask. [5] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source In general, each type of N95 mask should come with detailed instructions from the manufacturer explaining how to put on and take off the mask. In order to ensure proper protection for both you and your patients, these instructions — above all others — must be followed. The Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) also requires that users are trained how to fit and use N95 respirators.

Once you’ve applied soap to your wet hands, you should rub your hands together to wash them for at least 20 seconds before rinsing them off.

      "title": "Orient the top of the mask properly.",
      "content": "Orient the top of the mask properly. In order for the mask to fit as close to your skin as possible, the top portion of the mask will have a bendable, but stiff, edge that can be moulded around your nose.

      "content": "Place the mask on your face. There are many types of medical masks available, each with different methods of attaching the mask to your head. Ear Loops — Some masks have 2 ear loops on either side of the mask. These loops are normally made of an elastic material so they can be stretched. Pick up this type of mask by the loops, put 1 loop around one ear and then put the other loop around your other ear. Ties or Straps — Some masks comes with pieces of fabric that are tied around the back of your head. Most masks with ties come with upper and lower ties or straps. Pick up the mask by the upper ties, place the ties around the back of your head and attach them together with a bow. Bands — Some masks come with 2 elastic bands that are placed over and around the back of your head (as opposed to around your ears). Hold the mask in front of your face, pull the top band over the top of your head and place it around the crown of your head. Then pull the bottom band over the top of your head and place it at the base of your skull."

      "content": "Tie the lower band of the mask if needed. If you’re using a mask with bands that tie on the top and bottom, you can now tie the bottom band around the base of your skull. Because adjusting the bendable nose piece can impact the fit of the mask, it is best to wait until after the nose piece is in place before tying the bottom straps. If you’ve already tied the bottom straps, you may need to re-tie them more tightly to get a snug fit."

Do not touch the front portion of the mask which may be contaminated. Ear Loops — Use your hands to hold the ear loops and remove them from around each ear. Ties/Straps — Use your hands to untie the bottom straps first, then untie the top straps. Remove the mask while holding onto the top ties. Bands — Use your hands to bring the bottom elastic band up and over your head, then use your hands to do the same with the top elastic band. Remove the mask from your face while holding the top elastic band."
