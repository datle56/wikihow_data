      "content": "Turn off the water supply valves. [1] X Expert Source Allen Lee Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 10 July 2020. Look under the sink to find both the hot and cold water lines. Twist the valves counterclockwise by hand to shut off the flow of water. If the shutoff valves aren’t under the sink, look in the basement. If you still can’t find a way to shut off the lines directly, use the main water line valve. It’s where the water line enters your house and will either be on the inside or outside. It’s usually by the water heater and has a red handle. If you have city water, look for the valve near the water meter by the usage gauge. You can turn it off with an adjustable wrench. If you have well water, the valve by the pump can be turned off by hand. The water utility company can also help you shut off the water supply. If the water hasn't been turned off in some time, these valves may start to leak. If this happens you'll need to replace the valves yourself or hire a professional.

      "title": "Disconnect the water supply lines with an adjustable wrench.",
      "content": "Disconnect the water supply lines with an adjustable wrench. The water lines are fastened together with a small metal connector. Use an adjustable wrench to spin the connector counterclockwise in order to free the lines. If your pipes are made of copper, hold the copper lines to prevent them from twisting or breaking while you remove the supply lines. Try to keep all the parts together in a safe spot, such as inside a bucket. Label the parts with tape as needed so reconnecting them later is easier."

      "title": "Turn off and unplug the garbage disposal if you have one.",
      "content": "Turn off and unplug the garbage disposal if you have one. Find the power supply leading to the garbage disposal unit and turn it off. This is done by flipping the room’s circuit breaker, which will be in the fuse box on the lowest floor of your residence. Then, pull the unit’s plug from the outlet to ensure it’s disconnected from the electrical circuit. [4] X Research source If your disposal is hardwired, turn off the electrical supply to it (and your entire kitchen if necessary) at your main circuit panel. Even if you have a plug-in disposal, it's best to shut off the power to the outlet in the sink cabinet since there will be water dripping from disconnected pipes."

      "content": "Remove the sink’s drainpipe and p-trap with pliers. The pipes will have metal fittings, which look like rings, over them. Twist them counterclockwise with a pair of pliers to loosen them. You’ll be able to pull the pipes apart and set them aside. [5] X Research source If the pipes and fittings are plastic, loosen them by hand to avoid damaging the plastic with pliers. Remember to place a bucket under the pipes. Leftover water will spill out of them."

Also wash any parts you’ll use when installing your new sink, such as the faucets or drains. If the sink is made of a particularly heavy material, have a friend help you lift it.

      "content": "Check that the new sink fits. Try to lower the sink into the hole where it’ll rest. If it doesn’t rest in there comfortably, you’ll need to make adjustments. You can cut away part of the countertop to fit a larger sink, but a smaller sink should be returned to the store and replaced. [9] X Research source To fit a larger sink, flip the sink upside down over the hole and trace the outline. Then, cut the countertop to size with a jigsaw, router, or other cutting tool. To purchase the right size of sink, measure the length and width of your old sink."
