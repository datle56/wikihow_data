      "content": "Use a hydrating shampoo. There are many different kinds of shampoo on the market, but choose a shampoo that specifically contains moisturizing properties aimed at restoring dry hair. Look for shampoos that are labeled as “hydrating,” “moisturizing,” or “replenishing.” [1] X Research source Shampoos that contain oils hydrate hair really well. Some shampoos contain cleansing ingredients such as alcohol and sulfates that can effectively clean your hair, but can also cause your hair to dry out. Try to avoid shampoos that have sulfate ingredients or buy shampoos that specifically are labeled “sulfate free” and “alcohol free.” [2] X Research source You could also try using a gentle shampoo made for babies. Baby shampoo has a gentle formula that can cleanse your hair without washing away your natural hair oils. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply a deep conditioner to your hair. Using a deep conditioner a few times a month can add even more moisture to your hair.

Drying your hair roughly with a towel can cause damage to the outer layer of your hair strands. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid brushing wet hair. Use a wide-toothed comb to detangle your damp hair.

If you do brush your hair, brush your hair when it’s dry, and use a boar bristled brush. [19] X Research source Boar bristled brushes do a good job of bringing hair oils from the top of your head downward, effectively moisturizing dry ends."

      "content": "Avoid using hot tools. The temperature from styling tools can cause heat damage to your hair. Try styling your hair in other ways that don’t require you to use a blow dryer, flat iron, or curler. Consider styling your hair in braids, buns, or twists so you can give your hair a break from the heat. [20] X Research source If you must use hot tools to tame your hair, consider lowering the heat settings. Some hot tool heat settings go all the way up to 450°, which is significantly high considering water only has to reach 210° to boil. [21] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid damaging hair treatments. Any kind of chemical hair treatment (including dye jobs, highlighting, lowlighting, perms, relaxers, etc.) causes damage to your hair. [22] X Research source This chemical damage can, in turn, cause your hair to become fragile and dry. If you can, avoid chemical treatments altogether, especially if your hair has had more than one treatment at a time. Giving your hair a break from the chemicals will allow your natural hair to grow out which should be healthier and more hydrated. If you must dye your hair, consider using a dye with either low amounts of ammonia, or no ammonia at all."
