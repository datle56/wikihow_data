This man, her \"wali,\" technically \"gives\" the bride to the groom. [2] X Research source Some mosques suggest that both the bride's father and brother (if she has one) attend the ceremony with her. In addition to her father, some mosques require the bride to have an additional family member present to serve as her guardian or \"wakeel.\" [3] X Research source"

They are simply there as legal witnesses to the signing of the marriage contract. Traditionally, you need 2 male Muslim witnesses—although some venues allow 1 man and 2 women. [4] X Research source Some mosques require that your witnesses personally know both the bride and the groom, or at least the bride. [5] X Research source The bride's wali normally cannot also serve as a witness. But if the bride's brother is also present, he could be a witness."

      "content": "A gift to the bride from the groom This gift, the \"Mahr,\" is a symbol of the groom's promise to care for and provide for the bride. Traditionally, it's a lump sum of money, but it could also be property or an agreement to pay for education or a similar experience. The groom might physically give the Mahr to the bride during the Nikah, or it might be deferred to some time in the future. [6] X Research source The recommended Mahr is modest and limited by law in some countries. For example, in the UAE, Mahr is limited to AED 20,000 (or AED 30,000 for deferred Mahr). Talk to your betrothed about the Mahr well before the Nikah and make sure you're both on the same page about what it will be. Your families might want input as well—traditionally, the bride's family has some say in the size of the Nikah."

The contract simply lists the promises that the bride and groom make to each other. [7] X Research source What you promise in the contract is totally up to you.
