Although little is known about the origins of trypophobia, some scientists have speculated that the phobia may have an evolutionary basis. Some venomous or poisonous animals have clustered hole patterns on their skin, so the reactions that some people have may be a survival response. For example, the blue-ringed octopus, and several venomous snakes have visual features that may help explain trypophobia.

While your first reaction to a clustered hole pattern may be to get away from it or shut your eyes and try to think of something else, this will only reinforce your fear. Instead, force yourself to confront the source of your fear and the way it makes you feel. This type of therapy is known as exposure therapy and it is the most effective way to treat a phobia, but it requires repeated exposure. Over time, you should become less sensitive to the things that trigger your anxiety. [8] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source For example, if you come face to face with a cluster of holes that causes you to feel anxious, take a deep breath and then examine your feelings. What does the object make you want to do? How does it make you feel? What is irrational about your feelings? Try writing out your response to trigger objects and reframing them as normal thoughts and feelings toward the object. For example, you might record something like, “I feel nauseous and anxious when I see a honeycomb. It make me want to throw up.” Then, recognize that this thought is irrational and rewrite your reaction as it should be if you did not have the phobia. For example, “I feel amazed by the pattern of the honeycomb and I want to eat the honey.”"

A therapist can help you to better understand your trypophobia and help you find ways to minimize its impact on your life. Keep in mind that dealing with a profound fear takes time and effort. It can take a while before your fears become manageable, but some people see a dramatic improvement in just 8-10 therapy sessions. Some of the strategies that your therapist might use include: [12] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Cognitive Behavioral Therapy If you are afraid of holes, you may have certain thought processes that intensify your fear. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a method that therapists use to get you to challenge your thoughts and identify the emotions associated with those thoughts. For example, you may think to yourself, “I can’t go outside because I might see a flower that has holes in it.” Your therapist will challenge you to realize that this thought is unrealistic, perhaps by pointing out that the flower can’t hurt you. Then, you will be challenge to revise the thought so that it is more realistic, such as, “I might see a flower with holes in it if I go outside, but it can’t hurt me. I can always look away if it bothers me.” Everything is learned through association. So in the subconscious mind, you might have created an association, for instance, that dogs are painful. Therefore, when you see a dog you react and respond. By reframing that by creating a new association through exposure or repainting a past trauma, you can shift that to have a different outcome. Exposure Therapy If you are afraid of holes, you may start avoiding certain situations, activities, and places that intensify your fear. Exposure therapy will force you to slowly confront that fear head on. In this type of therapy, your therapist will either ask you to imagine that you are in the situation you have been avoiding or they will ask you to actually put yourself into the situation. For example, if you have been avoiding going outside because you are afraid you might see something with holes in it, your therapist may ask you to imagine that you are outside and surrounded by holes. Later, your therapist may challenge you to actually go outside and look at things with holes in them. The process of visualization can help you create a new and positive image that can be reached, that can help reframe the past associations and make you overcome fears and phobias. Medications If your fear of holes is causing you to have severe anxiety or panic attacks, your therapist may refer you to a psychiatrist who can prescribe medicine that may help you. Keep in mind that the medicines used to treat anxiety associated with fear will only reduce your anxiety temporarily. They will not take care of the root cause.
