      "content": "Tight hairstyles put stress on your hair that can cause it to fall out. While the occasional ponytail probably isn’t going to do any serious damage, tying your hair back every day or keeping it tightly braided will certainly lead to hair loss over time. Opt for looser hairstyles whenever possible, and avoid tying your elastic bands too tightly. You won’t see the benefits today, but your hair will thank you in the future! [3] X Expert Source Courtney Foster Certified Hair Loss Practitioner Expert Interview. 9 December 2019. If you’re noticing the hair in the front of your head is thinning or falling out and you often braid your hair or wear tight ponytails or pigtails, this is probably the main source of your problem.

      "content": "High heat can wear your hair down and weaken it enough to fall out. Heat strips your hair of the proteins that keep it strong. Over time, constant heating can turn hair brittle, which may cause hair loss that would not have occurred otherwise. Avoid using a flatiron whenever possible, use the coolest setting on your hair dryer, and skip the sauna if your hair is a little thin. If you need the heat on the hair dryer, keep it at least 8 inches (20 cm) away from your hair and move it constantly to keep heat from building up.

      "content": "These products put a lot of stress on your hair and scalp. If you want the best shot at a full head of hair later on, keep your natural hair color. There are some whacky ingredients in certain hair dyes and coloring formulas, and it’s hard to know how your hair will react to a given product or ingredient. There have even been cases where people have experienced massive and immediate hair loss due to an allergy to an ingredient, so skip the dye jobs if you can. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you have a professional stylist putting highlights in every year or so, it’s probably not a big deal. But frequent use of hair coloring chemicals increases the chances that you accidentally do some serious damage.

Bleaching is especially harmful for your hair, since it strips the nutrients in your hair and scalp.

      "content": "Stress can have a huge impact on your hair, so self-care is a must. This is one of those stereotypes that has some truth to it—if you’re under a lot of stress, your hair can fall out. It’s especially problematic if you’re under stress every day. If you’re having a hard time at school or work, set aside time when you get home to do something you enjoy. Take a bath, read a good book, or pursue something you’re passionate about. The more stress you can relieve, the slower your hair will fall out. [10] X Expert Source Courtney Foster Certified Hair Loss Practitioner Expert Interview. 9 December 2019. The other problem with stress and hair loss is that it’s a compounding problem. You lose hair when you’re stressed, and realizing that your hair is falling out can make you even more stressed. Emotional distress will also cause hair loss. If you’re dealing with depression or some other kind of mood disorder, getting some help should relieve the hair loss.

It’s unclear why heavy drinkers tend to lose hair—it could be that alcohol throws your hormones out of whack, or it may simply be that heavy drinkers tend to engage in behaviors that lead to hair loss.
