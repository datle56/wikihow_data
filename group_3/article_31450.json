Hot water with a tablespoon of honey, a tablespoon of cinnamon, a teaspoon of lemon juice, and a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar. Each of the ingredients in the hot water mixture above (honey, cinnamon, lemon juice, and apple cider vinegar) have been suggested as naturally soothing remedies for a sore throat, and also potentially helpful at clearing out the infection more quickly. It is not the most tasty of mixtures, but it is worth a shot to see if it helps your throat feel better! Note that you can take the honey part on its own too; eating honey on its own has been scientifically shown to help reduce cough, and to help with wound healing which may be soothing for a sore throat as well. Note that honey should never be given to children under 12 months, as this puts them at risk of infant botulism."
