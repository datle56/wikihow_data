      "content": "Make a new cut to shape the bush. Don't be mistaken by the size of the cut, you can whack off a much larger section to achieve any shape you want to. Remember that the larger or more \"woody\" the cut you make, the less chance you will have for new growth from the next lower node on the stem. Tecomas will send up new growth from the next node and even from the base (soil level) of the plant. On each stem at the point of any leaf are two leaves. It is at those leaves that new growth will appear (note the new growth in the next image).

      "title": "Look at this older cut.",
      "content": "Look at this older cut. This is how the plant should look in a few months. Notice how two stems have grown on two sides of the cut that was made. If you want to \"shape\" your bush to grow outward, just prune the inside growth. Do the opposite if you want a tighter plant. If you're trying to set a limit to height, prune it about 30-45 cm (12-18 inches) below the desired height. This will allow for new growth to the limit you wish to have."

      "content": "Finish shaping your Tecoma to the size/shape desired, and you will start to get new growth like that shown in this image below. Many new growths come out of large woody sections after severe pruning and new growth or stocks develop from ground level. These are leggy plants, but if you're interested in using them as a small hedge - say to 1.5 m (4 or 5 foot), they can be trained to be full/thick bushes."

      "content": "Look at the finished trim job! This height is about 1 m (3 foot) tall. After it grows back, you can see, in another picture to show how it fills out. Remember it will still grow leggy as new growth appears, but it will also add new growth at the lower limbs."
