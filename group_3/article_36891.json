      "content": "Use pipe repair tape to quickly patch up cracks and leaks. Pipe repair tape helps compress the crack, which helps stop leaking. Cut off a long section of tape and wind it around the crack. Continue looping the tape to the left and right of the crack to make sure the leak is totally covered. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Cover the damage with a sticky patch as a simple solution. This product is basically a heavy-duty band-aid for your pipe. Remove the sticky patch from its packaging, and peel away a clear sheet—this is covering the sticky side. Press the patch over the crack, pressing your thumbs along the edges to hold it in place. [2] X Research source You can find this type of patch online, or at a home improvement store."

      "title": "Seal the crack with fiberglass tape as a temporary fix.",
      "content": "Seal the crack with fiberglass tape as a temporary fix. Fiberglass tape uses water to create a hard surface over the pipe. Wet the surface of the pipe with a damp towel so the resin tape sticks better. Then, wind the fiberglass resin tape over and around the crack until the leak is completely covered. Give the resin 15 minutes to harden all the way. [3] X Research source Unlike the other options listed here, fiberglass tape isn’t a permanent fix—however, it’s a good solution if you’re in a pinch."

      "content": "Follow the packaging directions to form the putty. Pick up a package of epoxy from your local hardware store. Epoxy often comes in a stick made with a hardener and a resin. Grab a pair of scissors and cut off the amount of epoxy you need to repair the crack in your PVC. Then, knead the resin and hardener together until it molds into a consistent color. [7] X Research source Double-check the packaging for specific directions on how to knead the putty. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Saw off the broken section of PVC pipe. Measure how long the crack in your pipe is. Add 1 in (2.5 cm) to each side, and cut off this entire length with a ratchet cutter or hacksaw. This helps ensure a thorough, sturdy repair. [13] X Research source As you remove the piping, some leftover water might leak out, even if the water lines are shut off. That’s perfectly fine—just blot it with a clean towel. A PVC cutter is a great way to cut your pipes, but a simple hacksaw also works just fine. [14] X Research source"

Using this measurement, cut a new section of PVC pipe that’s about the same size as the pipe you just removed. Cut this new section of pipe so it’s a few millimeters smaller than the gap—this way, you can slide the new pipe into the fittings easily. [16] X Research source You could also measure the old piece of PVC that you just cut off."

      "content": "Grab 2 straight PVC pipe coupling joints and file one down. Most PVC pipe fittings have a groove or “stop” along the inside, which helps hold the fitting in place. Grab a half-round file and sand down this groove, so your fitting slides easily onto the pipe without stopping. [17] X Research source Removing the inner groove offers a bit more flexibility as you install a new section of pipe."

Align the center of the unused, filed fitting next to where these 2 pipes meet. Mark off where the end of the PVC fitting lines up along the old section of PVC pipe, so you have a reference point. [23] X Research source Since you’ve sanded this fitting down, there are no grooves to automatically “stop” the coupling from sliding too far down the pipe. This mark helps you know how far the new fitting needs to slide onto the old piping."
