      "title": "Know the facts.",
      "content": "Know the facts. As mentioned earlier, Fanny is considered to be the hardest hero to master in Mobile Legends, with a difficulty rating of 100% Also, instead of Mana, she will carry Energy as her power bar. Energy fills faster than Mana, so if you are thinking of buying Demon Shoes, you may have to exclude them from your equipment."

      "title": "Use her Passive (Air Superiority).",
      "content": "Use her Passive (Air Superiority). This skill will enhance her second skill and will leave a mark when an enemy is hit with Steel Cables. When damage is dealt with by the enemies, she will regen Energy per prey mark from enemies (10, and then 20 when with two prey marks). This is however decreased if this is continuous, but this should make the second skill continuously used when timed rightfully. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Try her 1st skill (Tornado Strike).",
      "content": "Try her 1st skill (Tornado Strike). Her first skill will make her spin and whirl with her blade, and deals damage to enemies nearby, Use this when you are close to an enemy per her Steel Cables, and use it as secondary damage. [2] X Research source This skill is also repeated from Steel Cables when damaging enemy heroes, so only use this skill when needed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Master her 2nd skill (Steel Cables).",
      "content": "Master her 2nd skill (Steel Cables). This skill will let her throw a cable that can be thrown and can let her move when an obstacle is hit (and decrease the energy cost by 1 per successful use). While it may look simple, hitting an enemy can also use Tornado Strike (if she has enough energy), so this is an important skill for Fanny. [3] X Research source Also, if you manage to launch 2 cables, she will launch in the current direction and switch if with one cable, but with 3 cables or more, the newest two cables will be followed instead. [4] X Research source In the case someone uses Displacement Crowd Control (Pull, Knockback, Suppress, and Airborne), this will interrupt her skill and stop at her current location. However, when someone uses a different Crowd Control (Stun, Immobilize, and Taunt) skill, she will continue to drive in the direction she is directed to do so (excluding Silvanna's ultimate). Exercise caution when using this skill in a team fight. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Finish the enemy with her Ultimate (Cut Throat).",
      "content": "Finish the enemy with her Ultimate (Cut Throat). This will initiate a quick attack on the enemy and will deal massive physical damage. If a Prey Mark was made from her passive, it will be increased by 20% per mark. This should be used as a last resort when the enemy is low on HP, and you would be able to finish enemies to earn a kill."
    },
    {
      "title": "Know her equipment.",
      "content": "Know her equipment. As with all assassins, you should make her a jungler and take care of the creeps. Add in jungling equipment, and with some spell vamp (Bloodlust Axe), this should be a good starter to enhancing Fanny. You can also add Rose Gold Meteor due to her increased damage when at a low HP, and adding in Sky Piercer, Blade of Despair, Corrosion Scythe, and Blade of the Heptaseas can also be a good thing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check out her emblems.",
      "content": "Check out her emblems. While it may be obvious that using the Assassin emblem can work, using the Fighter emblem can also help out. For the Assassin emblem, use Rupture (increases Adaptive Penetration), Master Assasin (dealing damage to one enemy hero increases), and Killing Spree (recovers HP/Movement Speed when killing a hero). You can replace one of the first two talents with Festival of Blood (she earns extra spell vamp). For her Fighter Emblem, don't use the majority of that emblem by itself. Use Rapture and Killing Spree, then use Festival of Blood to sustain during team fights."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do her combos.",
      "content": "Do her combos. Try using her Steel Cables (while coupled with Tornado Strike), and finish it off with Cut Throat. Using this combo while soloing is a must (if focusing on squishy heroes), as it kills enemies quickly in the early game. You can also use it during team fights, and show the enemy team as a killer."
