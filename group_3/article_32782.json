      "content": "Have a discussion with them regarding the matter. It's very likely an older child will be embarrassed about their parents and older siblings being involved in private matters such as these. As children get older, they desire and expect more privacy. Before the diapers are put on for the first time, it would be a good idea to have this conversation with the child(ren) a few days beforehand, such as after the diapers and plastic pants are ordered. Put their mind at ease and let them know that in some cases even incontinent adults need assistance diapering themselves for various reasons. Let the child know that the reason you're diapering them is that using diaper pins can be somewhat tricky—it can be difficult using the pins and they could hurt themself. Tell them that over time they'll be able to do this on their own."

Let them see and touch the cloth diapers and plastic pants they are going to wear, and let them ask any questions they may have and listen to their concerns."

For parents new to using diaper pins, these seem like the most hassle free methods. Each of the methods are described below."

      "content": "Cover the diapers with a pair of plastic pants (or “rubber pants”, as some people incorrectly call them). There are a couple of ways to do this, you can put them on the child while they are lying in bed or on the changing pad—in this case you have the child lift up their legs and bend them in a 90 degree angle, slide the leg holes of the pants over the child's feet then pull the pants up over their bent legs, have them lower their legs, slide the pants up, have the child lift up their bottom, then slide the pants over the diaper. After the pants are put on, turn the child over and make sure the pants are completely covering their diaper in order to prevent the diapers from leaking and getting the bed all wet. Or you can have the child stand up, step into the plastic pants, then pull them over the diapers. Some kids want to put on their own plastic pants as it gives them a feeling of some control over being diapered for bed."
