      "content": "Select the online database to which you have access. LexisNexis and Westlaw are the primary online databases used by lawyers and law students for conducting legal research. Both are equally useful for Shepardizing cases, though subscribing to either service as an individual consumer can be prohibitively expensive. For this reason, most lawyers and law students use the one to which they have free access through their law school or employer. As a law student, you will likely be given free access to both LexisNexis and Westlaw through your law school. Try to get familiar with both of them, as you may have access to only one once you begin working. [1] X Research source If you do not have access to either LexisNexis or Westlaw, look into cheaper online legal research databases, like Loislaw, FastCase, Casemaker and Bloomberg Law. These databases offer fewer search tools than LexisNexis and Westlaw, but do provide Shepardizing functions. [2] X Research source Be wary of free online legal research databases, such as Google Scholar, which while useful for basic case search, are still not considered reliable for Shepardizing cases."
