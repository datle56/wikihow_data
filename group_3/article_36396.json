      "content": "Use a Dremel rotary cutter to cut a slot across the screw’s head. A Dremel is a handheld rotary cutter. Fit the Dremel with a small circular saw attachment, then use the Dremel to cut a slit straight across the screw’s head. Line up the slit with the ridges of the one-way screw, so that a screwdriver has something to “push” against in the next step. [1] X Research source Hold the rotary saw perpendicular to the screw’s head so that you cut straight on. Cut the slit deep enough so that a screwdriver can get some traction within the groove, like with any ordinary screw. Always wear safety goggles and safety gloves when using a Dremel tool. Alternatively, use a hammer and chisel to chisel a slit in the head of the screw to do this manually."

      "content": "Use a flathead screwdriver to remove the screw. Now, just remove the screw like you would any other. Place a flathead screwdriver within the slit you cut, press firmly but gently, then turn the screwdriver counterclockwise. The screw will come out, no problem! [2] X Research source If it’s an older screw, though, the metal may be worn and stripped. In that case, check out our guide on removing a stripped screw ."

      "content": "Spread a wide rubber band across the screw’s head with your fingers. Colmenares says that in a pinch, a rubber band can often get the job done. Just use your fingers to cover the screw’s head with a wide, sturdy rubber band, so that the head is completely covered. [3] X Expert Source Lui Colmenares Licensed Contractor Expert Interview. 18 August 2020. This method may not always work, but it’s a good idea to try using a rubber band early on before you resort to more involved methods."

      "content": "Use a flathead screwdriver to unscrew the screw. “Use a bit that would fit the groove of the one-way screw and then the rubber will help remove it,” Colmenares explains. “It will help grip it.” [4] X Expert Source Lui Colmenares Licensed Contractor Expert Interview. 18 August 2020. Press the flathead screwdriver into the screw, through the rubber band. Be firm, but gentle enough not to snap the rubber band. Then, twist the screwdriver counterclockwise to remove the screw."

      "title": "Flatten 2 opposing sides of the screw head with a file.",
      "content": "Flatten 2 opposing sides of the screw head with a file. Scrape a hand-held file back and forth across 2 opposite sides of the screw head. The abrasive file will flatten 2 portions of the round screw head. This will allow your pliers to have a firm grasp on the flattened portions of the screw. [5] X Research source Before you do this, see if you can loosen the screw at all with a flathead screwdriver. Sometimes, you’ll get lucky and you won’t need a pair of pliers. If you don’t file flat portions into the screw head, your pliers may just slip off when you try to remove the screw."

      "title": "Fasten a pair of locking pliers around the screw head.",
      "content": "Fasten a pair of locking pliers around the screw head. Take a small pair of locking pliers and squeeze the pincers snugly around the head of the one-way screw. Twist the small knob at the base of 1 of the pliers’ arms until the pliers are set to lock at the exact diameter of the screw head. Then, squeeze down on the handle so that the pliers clamp shut around the screw head. [6] X Research source These pliers are called “locking” because one of the arms contains a knob which, when turned, sets how far the pliers can open. The other arm includes a bar that, when clenched against the arm of the pliers, will “lock” the head of the pliers in place."

      "title": "Unscrew the screw by slowly twisting the pliers counterclockwise.",
      "content": "Unscrew the screw by slowly twisting the pliers counterclockwise. Once you have a good grip on the screw head, rotate the screw head to the left to loosen the screw threads. Once you’ve made 6-7 complete rotations, you should see the threaded body of the screw emerge from the hole. [7] X Research source If the screw slips out from the head of the pliers, simply put the pliers back in place and continue unscrewing. If the screw continues slipping out from the pliers, place a rubber band around the head of the screw. Then try to use the pliers again. The rubber will help the pliers better grip the screw."

      "title": "Fit the proper-sized bit into your drill with the burnishing side out.",
      "content": "Fit the proper-sized bit into your drill with the burnishing side out. Every extractor kit comes with a size guide to help you choose the proper bit. “The instructions will tell you what size bit to use for a given screw,” Zakar says. [8] X Expert Source Barry Zakar Handyman Expert Interview. 16 July 2020. Models and sizes vary, so consult this guide to select the proper bit. Then, fasten the bit into your power drill with the stub, or burnishing side, out. [9] X Research source These bits are 2-sided. One end has the burnishing side, and one end has a spiral extractor."

      "title": "Place the bit over the screw and reverse the drill.",
      "content": "Place the bit over the screw and reverse the drill. “Place it over the screw and push fairly hard, following the direction that the diver or drill needs to go in order to remove the screw,” Zakar tells us. [10] X Expert Source Barry Zakar Handyman Expert Interview. 16 July 2020. Often, that direction is reverse or counterclockwise, but consult your kit’s manual for specifics, as it may vary. Use firm pressure to drill into the head. Again, each kit is different, and the instructions will tell you how far to drill. Usually, you’ll drill to the base of the short bit. This burnishing bit makes a grip for the second bit. Sometimes, though, the burnishing bit will reverse and remove the screw itself."

      "content": "Swap the bit’s sides and reverse the screw from the hole. Now, take the bit out of the drill and replace it with the spiral side facing out. Press the spiral side firmly to the pre-drilled screw head and drill counterclockwise (or whichever direction the instructions indicate). The bit will grip the screw and pull it out as you drill.

      "title": "Select a drill bit that’s ¼ the width of the screw head.",
      "content": "Select a drill bit that’s ¼ the width of the screw head. This will ensure that the drill bit is roughly the same diameter as the screw shaft. [12] X Research source You’ll use this drill bit and a power drill to drill through the screw head and down to the shaft of the screw. This method will destroy the head of the screw, but is effective at removing the screw, Zakar says. [13] X Expert Source Barry Zakar Handyman Expert Interview. 16 July 2020."

      "title": "Drill counterclockwise into the center of the one-way screw.",
      "content": "Drill counterclockwise into the center of the one-way screw. Position the center of the drill bit over the middle of the screw head, and begin drilling straight into the screw. [14] X Research source Be sure that you’re drilling counterclockwise. Most drills have a switch you can flip to alter the direction that the drill bit rotates. Keep drilling until the drill bit passes through the screw head and into the part of the screw that has threading, about 0.25 in (6.4 mm) down. Since you’re drilling counterclockwise, the drill bit will catch the screw threads and begin to extract the screw. This process is messy and will leave a pile of metal shavings below the spot where you’re drilling. Wear gloves and shoes—these shavings can be sharp."

      "title": "Slow down once you’re about 0.25 in (6.4 mm) deep.",
      "content": "Slow down once you’re about 0.25 in (6.4 mm) deep. Once you’re past the screw head, lower your drill speed by pressing more lightly on the trigger. Apply gentle pressure toward the screw, and ever so slightly apply sideways pressure. This heats the screw, helping the bit catch. Eventually, the screw will reverse out. [15] X Research source Keep reversing the screw until it’s far enough out to grip with a pair of pliers."

      "content": "Remove the screw shaft with locking pliers. Take a pair of locking pliers, and fasten them securely around the top of the screw’s shaft. Turn the screw counterclockwise so that it begins to loosen. Continue unscrewing the shaft until you can fully withdraw it from the hole. [16] X Research source Clean up any mess made from drilling once you’ve extracted the screw. Sweep up the shavings and dispose of them in a sturdy plastic bag."

      "title": "Set the tool’s steel pins against the rounded edges of the screw head.",
      "content": "Set the tool’s steel pins against the rounded edges of the screw head. A 2-pin extractor looks like a screwdriver but has 2 metal pins at the end of the rod. They’re a bit tough to find, not guaranteed to work, and cost about $25, so they’re not our first choice. If you have one, though, hold the tool as if you were holding a typical screwdriver, and set its pins in the open slot on top of the screw’s head. It should fit into position against the screw head’s rounded sides. [17] X Research source One-way screw removal tools come in different sizes based on the size of the screw itself. Common extractor tool sizes include sizes for #6-8 size screws, for #10-12 size screws, and for #14-16 size screws. So, you’ll need to find the size of the screw and purchase the removal tool that corresponds to that size. For example, if the screw was driven into wood or screwed in with a power driver, you probably will not be able to remove it with the extraction tool. Try drilling through the head to remove the screw."

      "title": "Turn the extractor tool counterclockwise to remove the one-way screw.",
      "content": "Turn the extractor tool counterclockwise to remove the one-way screw. Press the 2 steel pins forward into the screw head while you’re twisting. As you’re twisting the extractor, you’ll need to maintain substantial pressure on the handle to keep the extractor tool from slipping out of the screw head. [18] X Research source Once you’ve extracted the screw head by about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm), you may be able to grab it with your fingers and finish unscrewing by hand."
