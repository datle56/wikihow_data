      "content": "Purchase your favorite fabric from your local craft store. You do not have to limit yourself to a certain type of fabric to make a great tie, but heavier fabrics do tend to wear better. For one tie, you'll need at least 1 1 ⁄ 2 yards (1.4 m) of fabric for the front of the tie and about 5 x 6 inches of fabric for the back liner. Silk is a popular choice for tie liners. For a casual tie, go for patterned cotton, linen or denim."

      "title": "Buy interfacing for the inside of the tie.",
      "content": "Buy interfacing for the inside of the tie. Ties are made with a material called interfacing, which is sewn or ironed into the inside of the tie as a liner. It allows fabrics to keep a firm shape. You will need 1 1 ⁄ 2 yards (1.4 m) of interfacing in a color that matches the tie fabric. For fusible interfacing, you will put the glazed side face down on the tie fabric to permanently adhere it to the tie. Be sure to buy sewable, fusible interfacing because you will be sewing the tie later on. [1] X Research source Interfacing that is sewn-in does not have a glaze on it. It is sewn to the inside of the seam line so there won't be visible stitching on the outside of the tie. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick out a pattern.",
      "content": "Pick out a pattern. There are many tie patterns available for you to choose from. Once you find a style you like, you can print the outline for it online for free. The alternative to printing a tie outline would be to use a ruler to trace another tie out yourself. [3] X Research source When tie outlines print, they will continue onto more than one page because the length of the tie will be longer than a standard sheet of printing paper. Simply tape the paper together when you trace them onto the fabric. You will need about 3/8in of additional space outside of your trace line that you will later use for the inseam."

      "content": "Start with the classic tie pattern. This pattern is a simple and versatile style. You can find different variations of outlines that range in width and length. Simply print out the one you prefer and make sure that it is the classic tie pattern and has a diamond cut at the bottom."

      "title": "Beware of your fabric shrinking.",
      "content": "Beware of your fabric shrinking. If you're using a fabric other than silk, you should preshrink it by washing and drying it before you iron. This will ensure the fabric doesn't shrink if you have the tie steamed or washed. If the interfacing has not been preshrunk, preshrink it by soaking it in hot water for 10 minutes, then letting it dry and running an iron over it. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Prepare the fabric.",
      "content": "Prepare the fabric. Before you begin cutting, be sure to iron the back of the fabric on a low setting to remove any wrinkles, folds or ripples that will cause you to cut the fabric unevenly. To iron, lay the fabric flat on your work surface, \"wrong\" side up, and move the iron in small circles along the material."

      "title": "Lay out the tie pattern on the fabric.",
      "content": "Lay out the tie pattern on the fabric. It is important to cut the fabric for the tie on the bias (diagonally across the grain) which will allow the tie to have more elasticity. [5] X Expert Source David Pew Professional Tailor Expert Interview. 5 January 2021. Remember to make sure the fabric is laid out smoothly with no creases. If the fabric is patterned, envision how the pattern will look once you cut the fabric out. Rearrange the layout of your pattern to make sure it will show nicely."

    {
      "title": "Trace the pattern of the tie.",
      "content": "Trace the pattern of the tie. Use a weight or pin to hold the pattern outline down. Then, use a piece of chalk to carefully trace around the outline onto the \"wrong\" side of the fabric. Chalk is a safe and easy tracing tool for this type of project."

    {
      "title": "Cut the fabric carefully.",
      "content": "Cut the fabric carefully. Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors to cut the fabric about 3/8in around the outside of the chalk line. This will leave room for you to sew the inseam.If you're using a fabric that's more difficult to work with, you might want to use a rotary cutter instead. Cut slowly to avoid making a mistake and wasting fabric."

      "title": "Repeat the process by now tracing the interfacing.",
      "content": "Repeat the process by now tracing the interfacing. Lay the tie outline on the interfacing and use chalk to trace the outline. Then, carefully cut out the interfacing using sharp scissors or a rotary cutter. The interfacing will end up having the same shape as the fabric you cut, but it won’t need added seam allowance so cut directly on the chalk line."

    {
      "title": "Cut the back liner.",
      "content": "Cut the back liner. You will need to measure out your back liner to fit the bottom diamond of your tie. This will be used to cover the back of your tie that will be left exposed after your tie is folded over and sewed. It is also a nice place to tuck in the back tail of the tie. It will be cut straight across on top, and then follow the bottom cuts of the tie pattern."

      "title": "Check your interfacing.",
      "content": "Check your interfacing. Before applying your interfacing to the fabric, double-check that it has been been preshrunk either by the manufacturer or by you. Also, depending on if you purchased sewable or fusible interfacing, be sure to follow the specific instructions for that type."

    {
      "title": "Iron on the interfacing.",
      "content": "Iron on the interfacing. If you purchased fusible interfacing, now is the time to iron it to the fabric. You will iron the glossy or bumpy side of the interfacing to the \"wrong\" side of the fabric. The best way to do this is to lay down the fabric with the front side facing the table. Then, lay the glossy side of the interfacing on top of the fabric. Instead of directly ironing on the interfacing, lay a thin towel on top of your interfacing to protect the materials from sliding around or sticking to the iron. [6] X Research source Be sure the interfacing is smoothly ironed onto the entire tie surface."

    {
      "title": "Sew on the interfacing.",
      "content": "Sew on the interfacing. If you bought interfacing that has no glue, and was made to be stitched on, you will have to sew it to the fabric. This is a good option if you purchased a tie fabric that is sensitive to heat. You can sew on the interfacing by hand using a needle and thread or a sewing machine. Sew the interfacing to the \"wrong\" side of the tie fabric, and go around the entire edge of the tie. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Sew your tie closed.",
      "content": "Sew your tie closed. You can use a needle and thread or a sewing machine to do this. Like in most tie patterns, you will sew the point first. Then, you will fold over the back tie pieces to be sewn up the middle. Make sure the edges are aligned correctly and your stitches are straight. The tie should be sewn with the fabric folded inward so the seam doesn't show on the outside. It's best to sew a tie together by hand because the stitches are more flexible. Machine-stitched ties don't tend to last as long as hand-stitched ones. [8] X Expert Source David Pew Professional Tailor Expert Interview. 5 January 2021."

      "content": "Use a slip stitch to carefully sew along the middle seam of the underside of the tie. Sew the two edges of the folds closed from the top of the tie to the end of the fold. Be sure not to catch all of the layers as you stitch, since you don't want to be able to see the thread on the front of the tie."
