      "title": "Treat the Qu'ran as a holy book and approach readings with respect.",
      "content": "Treat the Qu'ran as a holy book and approach readings with respect. In Muslim culture, there are specific rules of etiquette when it comes to reading the Qu'ran, often referred to as tajweed rules. These rules mostly revolve around cleanliness, respect, and preferences about recitation. You don't have to follow these rules to read the Qu'ran, but you may want to consider them as part of your study to better understand the Islamic faith. If you attend religious services at a mosque or intend to explore the Muslim faith on a deeper level, it is helpful to be aware of and practice tajweed rules."

      "content": "Wash your hands, brush your teeth, and dress in nice clothing. Always attend to your hygiene before reading your Qur’an. Imagine you are getting ready for a job interview or to meet a very important person. Get yourself ready to start your day. If you cough up phlegm at any point during your reading, make sure to pause and rinse your mouth out with water."

      "title": "Sit up straight when you read the Qur’an.",
      "content": "Sit up straight when you read the Qur’an. Don’t slouch or lean back. Try sitting in a hard-backed chair or at a desk so you will be less inclined to lean back. Don’t sit in a chair that reclines or read your Qur’an in bed. You may hold your Qur’an on your lap or on a surface in front of you, but never place it on the floor. Also, make sure that you are facing in the direction of prayer before you read."

      "title": "Pause occasionally to consider what you have just read.",
      "content": "Pause occasionally to consider what you have just read. Whenever you encounter a passage that tells a story about people or that promises Allah’s blessing, pause and consider it. Reflect on the meaning of the story or passage before you move on. Never rush your readings of the Qur’an. If you do not have time to read at a leisurely pace, choose another time to read."

    {
      "title": "Close the Qur’an when you are finished reading it.",
      "content": "Close the Qur’an when you are finished reading it. Never leave your Qur’an open after you have finished reading it. Place a book mark or make a note about where you left off, and then close your Qur’an and put it in its place, such as on a bookshelf or table. Never stack other books on top of the Qur’an. This symbolizes that they are above the Qur’an."

      "title": "Scan sections by looking at any headings the text includes.",
      "content": "Scan sections by looking at any headings the text includes. Scanning chapters is a good way to prime your brain before you begin reading a section of the Qur’an. Read any headings in each section before you get started. Identify what the themes or topics are for the section you are about to read. For example, if the section heading indicates that it’s about God creating Earth, then the upcoming section probably tells the Qur’an’s version of the creation story."

      "title": "Break the text into small, manageable chunks.",
      "content": "Break the text into small, manageable chunks. The longer you read, the less you may comprehend, so try not to read for more than 30 minutes at a time. Identify how much you can read in this time frame and keep all of your readings to about this length. You can read for shorter spans as well, such as 5, 10, or 15 minutes at a time. See what works best for you and limit your reading sessions accordingly."

For example, if you have read the Bible before, then you might draw parallels between stories in the Qur’an and stories in the Bible."
