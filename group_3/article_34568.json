      "content": "Harvest oregano just before the plant flowers, or as needed. Oregano is most flavorful right before the plant flowers, so this is the perfect time to harvest if you plan to dry or freeze your herbs. However, you can also harvest small amounts of oregano to use fresh in your kitchen. [11] X Research source Keep in mind that the oregano may taste bitter after the plant flowers, so it's a good idea to harvest the remaining stems before your plant flowers. You can dry them by hanging them in bunches or using a dehydrator. Alternatively, you could freeze them. The best time to harvest oregano is in the morning after the dew dries. The flavor of your oregano will be strongest during warm weather."
