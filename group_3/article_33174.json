[1] X Expert Source Aaron Asghari Professional Guitarist & Instructor Expert Interview. 15 February 2019. To make this easier, we're going to number them both. The strings on your guitar are numbered like this: Vertically, the strings are numbered 1 through 6, from highest pitch to lowest. Horizontally, the numbering is based on the fret positions. Note that when the directions say \"put your first finger on the 3rd fret,\" that means you actually place your finger between the 2nd and 3rd fret. It's the string itself that needs to be in contact with the 3rd fret."

      "title": "Learn the C chord.",
      "content": "Learn the C chord. The first chord we will cover is a C chord—one of the most basic chords in music. Before we do, let's break down just what that means. A proper chord, whether played on a piano, a guitar, or sung by well-trained mice, is simply three or more notes sounded together. (Two notes is called a \"diad,\" and while musically useful, is not a chord.) Chords can also contain far more than three notes, but that's well beyond the scope of this article. This is what a C chord looks like on the guitar: The lowest note is the 3rd fret of the A string: C The next note up is played on the 2nd fret of the D string: E Note there is no finger on the G string. This string remains \"open\" when strumming a C. The highest note is played on the 1st fret of the B string: C The highest and lowest strings on the guitar are not played for the basic C major chord."

      "title": "Try it out the notes.",
      "content": "Try it out the notes. Play each note in the chord, from low to high, one at a time. Take your time and be deliberate: press down firmly on the fret, and pluck the string. Let the note ring for as long as you can, then move to the next note: Press your 3rd finger onto the 3rd fret of the A string, as indicated above, pluck, and let it ring until it fades out. You just played a C note. Press your 2nd finger onto the 2nd fret of the D string, then do the pluck-and-ring to play an E. Break time! Simply pluck the open, un-fingered G string. Press your 1st finger on the 1st fret of the B string, and let that C note sound loud! Play the notes, one at a time, for a few times. When you're ready, sweep your pick or fingers across all four middle strings quickly. You've just played a C chord! It may sting a little the first few times you do it, but as you develop calluses, the pain goes away."

      "content": "Expand your musical vocabulary. Playing a C chord is nice, and it's definitely a gateway chord that will lead you into more interesting musical territory, but there's much more to music than that! Here are two other chords commonly used when playing in C Major. F, and G. Play a basic F chord like this: The notes in an F chord are F, A, and C. Note that the F and the C are being played by the same finger: the first finger is placed across the 1st fret of both the 1st and 2nd strings. Generally, chords are built so that the lowest note is the root of the chord, but in this case, the F is being sounded on the 1st fret of the 1st string. This is called an \"inversion.\""

      "content": "Play a G chord. Like the C and the F, the G chord is one of the Big Three in the C major scale. There are many ways to play it, and we'll show you two. The first way is easy: it's the exact same fingering as the extended F chord, only moved up two frets:"

Strum C four times, followed by F, two times, then G, two times, then back to C. Note that after each chord is a Roman numeral. These indicate what position the root note of the chord is on the scale—regardless of fingering. Once you know the basic chords in all the keys, it's easier to just show a chart than to have the chord spelled out every time. Practice that until your fingers are tired, then take a break, but come back: we'll also show you the basic chords in E and A!"

Here's the E chord: This is one of the easier chords to play, once you have your calluses built up. You can play all the strings at once. Crank up a Marshall stack to 11 with this chord, hit it hard, and you'll feel the beginnings of being a rock hero!"

      "content": "Play the A Major. This is another \"big chord,\" sonically. There are several ways to play this. You can use one finger across the 2nd fret of the B, G, and D strings (playing C#, A, and E, respectively), or any other combination of fingers. For this example, we'll use the 4th finger on the B string, 3rd finger on the G string, and 2nd finger on the D string. As you get better at playing, you will understand that moving quickly from one chord to another sometimes results in odd fingerings that still work. The key is to make the most efficient use of your fingers, and once you kick off the training wheels, don't be afraid to experiment."
