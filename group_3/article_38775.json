Be sure to review the form carefully before filling it out. If there’s a long line, it’s best to enter the line while filling out the form. By the time you’ve finished, you’ll have moved along quite a ways. If the line is short, or if there is no line, fill out the form at the table so you don’t inconvenience the people around you by holding up the line."

The cost of sending registered mail has risen in the past few years, but will likely be slightly above $10. [5] X Research source The post office accepts cash, credit and debit cards, and checks (with appropriate ID). The employee should provide you with a receipt of transaction, but if they forget, don’t be too shy to ask for it — it’s the whole reason you’re paying for this service! The receipt will prove exactly when the letter was sent, so you can’t be held accountable if it doesn’t reach its intended recipient."
