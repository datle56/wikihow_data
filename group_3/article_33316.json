If you’re the one sketching , try to quickly draw the prompt so your team can correctly guess what it is. Every other member of the person’s team looks at the drawing and tries to figure out what the word or prompt is. [1] X Research source"

Shuffle all of the cards so they’re thoroughly mixed together, and set them in the holder so they all face the same direction. [2] X Research source If some of the cards don’t fit into the holder, just set them aside to use later. Some Pictionary games have a deck of trickier prompts for adults and a separate stack of cards with easier prompts for kids. Choose the deck you use based on the ages of the people you’re playing with. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Split the players into even teams. You can play with up to 4 separate teams, but you’ll have more fun if you split into fewer teams that have more people. Split up your group of friends as evenly as possible to keep the game fair. [4] X Research source If you want to play Pictionary with only 3 people, then choose one player to draw. They’ll draw the clues for both of the other players."

Discuss if players need to say the full prompt to win a round or if you’ll accept shortened or partial answers. [7] X Research source Example: If the prompt is “bunk bed,” decide if someone answering “bunk” is OK. Example: You may decide “floss” is an acceptable answer for the prompt “dental floss.”"

[17] X Research source You can draw anything related to the prompt that you want. You can even use homophones and rhyming words, such as drawing a piece of mail for the word “male.” You cannot use letters or symbols or communicate with your teammates if you’re the Picturist.
