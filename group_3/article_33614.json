      "title": "Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and point your knees inward.",
      "content": "Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and point your knees inward. Keep your legs in a comfortable position where you can stand up straight, but still move your legs. Point your knees in toward each other while leaving the balls of your feet on the ground and rotating your heels outward. [1] X Research source The Plug Walk doesn’t take a lot of leg movement, so you can wear jeans or other pants that might normally be restricting to dance in. However, make sure you can at least move your legs comfortably in whatever you are wearing."

      "title": "Turn your knees outward, then inward again.",
      "content": "Turn your knees outward, then inward again. Turn on the balls of your feet so that your heels face inward and your knees face out toward the side. Keep your legs slightly bent so that it is easier to move. Quickly turn your knees back inward so they face each other again. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick up your left leg with your knee turned in and your foot pointed out.",
      "content": "Pick up your left leg with your knee turned in and your foot pointed out. Shift your weight over to your right leg, keeping your knees turned inward. Pick your left leg up with your shin parallel to the ground so that the bottom of your left foot faces outward, creating an “L” shape with your left leg. [3] X Research source This movement might feel a little awkward at first, but it gets easier as you practice it more and more."

Pick your right leg up with your shin parallel to the ground, keeping the bottom of your right foot facing outward. This time, create the “L” shape with your right leg. [5] X Research source Try to keep your knees together as much as possible as you move your legs around."

      "content": "Repeat the movements, increasing your speed to match the song tempo. Keep picking up each leg one at a time and put it back down again, moving your knees outward and then in again each time. You can add a bounce to the movements as you speed up to the tempo of the song you are dancing to. [6] X Research source You might need to practice before you can Plug Walk fast, and that’s okay!"
