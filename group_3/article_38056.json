While more download threads can mean a faster download, it will take up more resources on your computer and Twitch's servers. If these resources are maxed out, it can actually cause your download to stall, slow down drastically, or stop. Try lowering the number of download threads, and if possible, close any background programs and step away from your computer while the video downloads. This will allow your computer to use all of its available resources to downloading the file, instead of needing to spread them out between a number of different processes."
