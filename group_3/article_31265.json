      "content": "“Nape” is the term for the back of your neck. It’s most often used in the phrase “the nape of the neck,” but this is a bit redundant—if you just say “nape,” most people will understand what body part you’re talking about. [1] X Research source More specifically, the nape can refer to the area of the back of the neck just beneath the base of your skull. Medically, the nape refers to the uppermost part of your cervical spine (the part of your spine in your neck) that supports your head and neck. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Fun fact: “Nape of the neck” isn’t the only body part phrase in English that’s a little repetitive. Phrases like the “sole of the foot” or “palm of the hand” could be shortened to “the sole” or “the palm,” but many English speakers specify where they are out of habit. “Nape of the neck” has a nice ring to it because it alliterates (both emphasized words start with the same “N” sound). This might be why the phrase is so common."

      "content": "In beauty and cosmetology, the nape is where your back hairline is. As licensed cosmetologist Courtney Foster explains, “the nape area…is the lower part of the neck, the lower part of the hairline in the back.” Low ponytails or other long hairstyles often sit at the nape or brush against it as the hair moves throughout the day. Foster warns that the nape is prone to damage, just like your front hairline: “Make sure that low ponytails are not too tight or you're leaving that portion of the hair out. As you push-pull your hair back or pull it up, you are creating a lot of tension that essentially yanks the hair back.” The hair at your nape may also have a slightly different texture and be shorter, wavier or kinkier, and harder to style compared to the rest of your hair. A “nape piercing” can also refer to a surface piercing on the back of the neck just underneath the hairline. Unlike dermal piercings, they’re created with a base bar and have both exit and entry points. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "In other mammals, the nape is where mothers carry their young by the scruff. Technically, mammals like cats and dogs do have napes, but you’ll usually hear this area called “the scruff of the neck.” The scruff is a gathering of loose skin that a mother can hold in her mouth to transport her young before they’re able to move quickly on their own (called “scruffing”). Scruffing makes young mammals more passive and immobile (and therefore, easier to transport). [4] X Research source It’s not recommended to scruff your cats and dogs yourself, especially if they’re fully grown (their adult weight makes hanging from the scruff painful or unsafe). Fun fact: Studies have shown that rocking human babies mimics how animal mothers walk with their young by the scruff. The rocking motion has a similar calming effect on humans! [5] X Research source"

      "content": "In traditional Japanese culture, a woman’s nape was considered an attractive feature. It was one of the few areas left uncovered by women’s clothing (besides the face and hands). Traditional geisha makeup covers the entire face and neck with white foundation except for the area just beneath the hairline as well as the nape, which is outlined by a traditional W-shape to accentuate it. [6] X Research source As recently as 2022, some schools in Japan have banned ponytails because the exposed nape of the neck could “sexually excite” male students. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "In some Middle Eastern countries, a slap to the nape of the neck is insulting. In places like Iran, Egypt, Lebanon, and Turkey, a slap to the back of the neck is considered disciplinary and somewhat demeaning (although among friends it can be affectionate). For example, when an Egyptian talk show host was slapped in the back of the neck by a protester during a visit to Washington, DC in 2017, the news outlet The New Arab described the slap as “an extremely insulting form of assault in Egypt.” [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Yes, the nape is a sensitive area and is considered an erogenous zone. The back of the neck, from the nape to the sides below the jawline, is a popular erogenous zone for both men and women. It’s an easy area to stimulate with light touches or kisses, and the nape is also a target area in many neck and shoulder massages. [9] X Research source An “erogenous zone” is an area of the body that causes sexual arousal when touched or stimulated. [10] X Research source Some consider the nape highly attractive because it’s so sensitive and intimately located. It’s a common area to touch during foreplay, for example."

      "title": "The sensitive nape area responds well to neck massages.",
      "content": "The sensitive nape area responds well to neck massages. To give someone a good neck massage , therapist Rebecca Tenzer advises to “Apply a small amount of massage oil or lotion to your hands to reduce friction and make your strokes smoother…and begin with gentle, light strokes to warm up the neck muscles. Use your fingertips and palms to gently rub and knead the area. Spend time massaging the shoulder muscles and upper back to release any knots or tightness…then use your thumbs and fingers to apply gentle pressure along the sides and back of the neck, moving in an upward motion towards the base of the skull.” She continues, “Perform a kneading motion by gently squeezing and releasing the neck muscles between your fingers and thumbs. Be cautious not to pinch or press too hard…and avoid applying too much pressure on the front of the neck.”"

      "content": "The origin of the word “nape” isn’t entirely known. The word first appeared around the year 1300 and might come from the Old French word hanap , meaning “a goblet.” The “goblet” might refer to the hollow at the base of the skull where the nape is located. [11] X Research source Medically, the nape is called the nucha, coming from the Latin word for the nape or back of the neck. [12] X Research source"
