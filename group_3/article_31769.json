      "content": "Remove the snap-on holster. If the device is in a belt clip or other snap-on attachment, pop it off using the large tab on the side. This will make it much easier to take the rest of the case off, so it’s best to do it right away. [1] X Research source The process for removing a Defender Otterbox case will be the same for virtually all devices (iPhone, Android, etc.). The only differences will be the number and the style of tension clips. Use this method to remove an Otterbox case for cleaning or to replace it."

      "content": "Find an opening in the silicone slipcover. The most difficult part of removing the Defender case is peeling off the flexible silicone layer. Your best bet is to start at the camera opening, the charging port, or a corner of the screen.

      "content": "Wedge a thin tool or your finger under the cover. Use the tip of your finger to pry the silicone cover away from your phone. If you can't fit your finger into one of these openings, use an old credit card or a coin to help you out. Stick it underneath the slipcover, and wiggle it back and forth until you can insert your finger into the gap. [3] X Research source Make sure you’re not using a credit card you still use! If you wiggle too hard or too fast, your card could accidentally snap."

Use your fingers to pop the clips up one by one until the 2 sides separate and fall off your device. [5] X Research source If you can't get your finger under the clip, you may need to use a small flat-head screwdriver or a stiff credit card to get some leverage. If you’re using a tool to pry the clips open, lift towards the front of the case. Don't try to pull down, or you may break the plastic. Some clips may be easier to remove than others, especially when all clips are closed. If you're having trouble with one, move onto a different clip."
