      "content": "Find the point of attachment for this KO. The single size KOs and smallest of multiple KOs are generally secured in a single location. Press the edge of a screwdriver against the inner-most KO's stamped edge, away from this point of attachment, and press (or rap sharply if needed) to push the KO away from the wall of the box."

      "title": "Twist the KO back and forth with fingers or pliers to fully remove.",
      "content": "Twist the KO back and forth with fingers or pliers to fully remove. The smallest KO is usually a 3/8\" or 1/2\" trade size opening. Most modern connectors require a minimum 1/2\" trade size opening. If this is the size of the KO removed and the connector to be installed, skip head to step 10; otherwise continue to increase to the next step KO size."

      "title": "Locate the next KO ring point of attachment.",
      "content": "Locate the next KO ring point of attachment. The second ring of KO is much smaller and may be attached to yet a third (or more) KO ring. These KO rings are also often secured by two (or more) points of attachment. They will require slightly more effort and patience to remove without damaging any additional KO rings that are larger than needed. An over-sized opening will not support the connector without additional expense."

      "content": "Insert the blade of the screwdriver into the opening as shown so that the tip just extends beyond the opening. The tip should be as far away as possible from the point of attachment. The blade should not extend beyond the outer edge of the inner ring. Gently pry the screwdriver's tip into the box. Only the inner ring of the KO should bend inward. [2] X Research source"
