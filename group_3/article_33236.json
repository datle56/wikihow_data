      "title": "Understand what a chord is.",
      "content": "Understand what a chord is. A chord is three or more notes. Complex chords may have many notes, but you need a minimum of three. The chords discussed here will all be composed of three notes: a root, a third and a fifth. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Find the root of the chord.",
      "content": "Find the root of the chord. Every major chord is built on a note called the tonic, or root of the chord. This is the note that the chord is named after and will be the lowest note in the chord. [2] X Research source For a C major chord, C is the tonic. It will be the bottom note of your chord. You will play the tonic note with your thumb in your right hand, or with your pinkie in your left hand."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find the major third.",
      "content": "Find the major third. The second note in a major chord is the major third, which gives the chord its character. It will be four semitones, or half-steps, above the root. It is called a third because when you play a scale in that key, it will be the third note that you hit. For a C major chord, E is the third. It is four half steps above C. You can count them on your piano (C#, D, D#, E). You will play the third with your middle finger, regardless of which hand you‚Äôre using. Try playing the root and the third together, to get a sense of how that interval is supposed to sound."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find the fifth.",
      "content": "Find the fifth. The top note in a major chord is called the fifth because if you play a scale it will be the fifth note that you hit. It anchors the chord and makes it complete. It is seven semi-tones above the root. [3] X Research source For a C major chord, G is the fifth. You can count the seven semi-tones up from the root on your piano. (C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G.) You play the fifth with your pinkie in your right hand, or your thumb in your left."

      "title": "Understand that there are at least two ways to spell a chord.",
      "content": "Understand that there are at least two ways to spell a chord. All notes can be written at least two different ways, for example Eb and D# are the same note. Therefore, an Eb major chord would sound the same as D# major chord. The notes Eb, G, Bb create an Eb chord. The notes D#, FùÑ™ (F##), A# create a D# Major chord, which sounds exactly like an Eb chord. The two chords are called enharmonic equivalents because they sound exactly the same but are written differently. [4] X Research source A few of the common enharmonic equivalents are noted below, but otherwise the article presents only the most common notation of a major chord."

    {
      "title": "Review proper hand position.",
      "content": "Review proper hand position. In order to play a piece of piano music well, you need to consistently use the correct hand position, even when you‚Äôre just practicing chords. Keep your fingers tall and curved, as if they are diving into the keys. Use the natural curve of your fingers. Use the weight of your arms rather than the strength of your fingers to push on the keys. [5] X Research source Play on the tips of your fingers, including if possible the pinkie and thumb which tend to lie flat if you‚Äôre not paying attention. Keep your fingernails trimmed close so that you can play using the tips of your fingers."

      "content": "Use three fingers. Notice that you will only use fingers 1, 3 and 5 (thumb, middle, pinkie) to play the three notes of each chord. Your index and ring fingers may rest on, but not press down any keys. Notice that your fingers advance one half-step (one key) up the keyboard each time you change chords."

Start with a C major chord, then play a Db major, then D major and so on. Begin by doing this exercise with only one hand. When you feel confident, play both hands at once. Listen for false notes. The ratio between the notes should always remain the same, so if one chord suddenly sounds different, review whether you are hitting the correct notes."

To play a C Major arpeggio with your right hand, strike the C with your thumb and release. Strike E with your middle finger and release. Strike G with your pinkie and release. [6] X Research source When you have mastered this motion, try to make it fluid rather than choppy. Strike and release each note quickly, so there is scarcely any time between notes."
