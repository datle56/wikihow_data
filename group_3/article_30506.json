      "content": "‘50s ERF Dropside Lorry Although the toys had global appeal, Matchbox cars were originally produced in the UK by Lesney Products. That explains why the brand released models like the ERF Dropside Lorry, used in WWII by the Royal Army Service Corps. One lime-green model sold for almost $10 thousand.

      "title": "The value of a Matchbox car is determined by its age and condition.",
      "content": "The value of a Matchbox car is determined by its age and condition. The Matchbox cars that fetch the most money at auction are older models from the ‘50s and ‘60s. Identify your car’s age using an online database like the Matchbox Wiki . Unless a model is exceedingly rare, expect to only make top dollar off it if it’s in mint condition—the collector’s term for being like new. Here are other factors to consider when deciding your cars’ value: [17] X Research source Having the original box: If your Matchbox cars are inside their original boxes, or you have the original boxes, they’re more desirable to collectors. It’s easier to prove their authenticity. A factory error or pre-production model: The rarest Matchbox cars are the ones that weren’t meant to be sold. If your car has the wrong colorway or is a pre-production model, it’s probably pretty valuable. Beware of models that were restored or repainted to a new colorway. Pop-culture appeal: Some Matchbox cars, like the 1981 Ferrari 308 GTB, gain value in collectors’ eyes because of their association with pop culture. If your Matchbox model appeared in a show or movie, it could be worth more than the typical toy car. Early production year: Early production year refers to a model being part of the first issue of its kind. Most Matchbox cars are manufactured in multiple runs over several years. The first editions are usually the priciest."

      "content": "Create a detailed listing with clear photos of the car. Include as much detail about the car as possible in your listing. Mention the model, release year, condition, color, and any damage. Take well-lit photos of the car from multiple angles to include in your listing. Popular online marketplaces for selling Matchbox cars include eBay , Poshmark , and Depop . The exception is if your car is still in a sealed box or package. In that case, take pictures of the package, not the car itself. Removing it from its original case could lower its value."

Even if your Matchbox cars aren’t rare or particularly valuable, collectors who are just starting out may be eager to buy a large set. Consider listing a bundle of multiple Matchbox cars online to entice buyers. You could potentially earn more money than if you sold and shipped each toy individually."
