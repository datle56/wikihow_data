      "content": "Identify the cause. Ask yourself why you can't look at yourself in the mirror. Did you do something that conflicts with your values and you're upset about it? Do you feel unhappy with your appearance? Before you can overcome, you must be honest with yourself about what it is that is bothering you."

      "content": "Judge your actions, not yourself. It’s important to separate your actions from who you are. Guilt or feeling badly about your actions shows that you are a good person who acknowledges a mistake has been made. You can deal with unproductive guilt by accepting you did something wrong, learning from your mistake, and moving on. Guilt and shame can and do occur together. Shame is feeling badly about yourself, unworthy or wrong. To eliminate shame, avoid relationships with people who cannot see your self-worth based on yourself and instead foster relationships with people who recognize your intrinsic value.

There are a number of ways to help you love yourself for who you are: [3] X Research source Write down your strengths. Think about what you are good at. It could be that you are a nice person, that you are empathetic, or that you are great at tennis. If you are having trouble thinking of strengths, ask those around you what your strengths are. Speak to your best self. Imagine that you are having a conversation with your best or ideal self. Think about what kind of advice your best self would give you. You may find that a part of you has intelligent, kind, thoughtful things to say to you. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Forgive yourself. If you can't look yourself in the mirror because you did something you're not proud of, try to remind yourself that we all make mistakes. Although easier said than done, instead of beating yourself up for what you did, think about how you can avoid doing it in the future and how you can repair what you have done. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Stop comparing yourself to others.",
      "content": "Stop comparing yourself to others. Focus on yourself and how you can improve in ways that are important to you instead of thinking, \"Oh look at her, she's so much prettier than me, why can't I look like that?\" Feeling inferior is highly related to shame, depression, and social anxiety. [6] X Research source To avoid comparing yourself to other people try the following. Say you think about how someone is really good at cooking compared to you and this makes you feel envious and bad about yourself. Try to change your thoughts by focusing on something else that you are really good at. Then, instead of comparing yourself to someone else, compare how good you are at it relative to your skill level 2 years ago. Focus on how you have been growing and improving rather than how you compare to someone else."

      "title": "Keep in mind when we compare ourselves to other people, we are often idealizing the other person in unrealistic ways.",
      "content": "Keep in mind when we compare ourselves to other people, we are often idealizing the other person in unrealistic ways. Conversely, when we compare another person to us, we are not seeing a realistic version of ourselves. We are seeing a negatively biased version, where we are not giving ourselves the praise we deserve and allowing our inner critic to run amok in our heads. Taking yourself out of this dynamic and praising yourself in your mind for things you do really well will help alleviate this behavior. To diminish comparing yourself to others, first you have to catch yourself thinking of a comparative thought. For example, if you think, \"Gosh, I wish I was able to have a great career like Emily.\" When you catch yourself thinking these types of thoughts, you can say, \"I'll bet that she worked very hard to get where she is today. I wonder what I can do to get ahead in a career I love.\" Then you can make a list of actions you can take to further your career in the right direction."

Donate your time to a charitable cause you care about. Buy a nice warm blanket or meal for a homeless person. Spend time thinking about what makes someone in your life great.

While for the most part, your physical appearance is there to stay and it is psychologically important to learn to embrace yourself for who you are, you can in some cases take steps to actively change the way you look. If you are struggling with accepting the way you look and you are overweight, engage in steps to reduce your body fat. Try eating slightly smaller meals, say, by 10-15%; do your best to get regular exercise. If you do not like the way you look, you can also try giving yourself a make-over. Go buy some new clothes, get a new haircut, try out some new make-up. Take a peek in the mirror and see what you think!"
