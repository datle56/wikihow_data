      "title": "Say that you’re doing great.",
      "content": "Say that you’re doing great. If you’re talking to someone and they seem judgmental or like they’re prying into your personal life, just say that you’re doing fine. You don’t have to share anything you don’t want to. People who are nosy don’t necessarily need to know what’s going on in your life. It’s perfectly fine to pretend that you’re doing great. For example, if you go to family gatherings and get pestered by older family members, say things are great, even if they’re not. Even if you’re sad about things, pretend like life is going okay and don’t say much beyond that."

      "content": "Change the subject of conversation. If someone is talking about something you’re uncomfortable with, change the topic of conversation. Excuse yourself for a moment and come back in a bit. Shift the subject of the conversation away to something else without feeling too abrupt. [1] X Research source If someone asks how you’re doing and you’re not prepared to say how you really feel, shift the subject by saying, “I’m really happy to see that the sun is out today.” If someone asks, “How are you and your spouse?” and you’d rather not talk about your marital difficulties, change the subject. Say, “We’re doing fine. Did I tell you about my son’s recent karate match?”"

      "title": "Respond minimally.",
      "content": "Respond minimally. Avoid saying too much or getting into detailed stories. The point is to say as little as possible and perhaps even duck out of the conversation.

For example, if someone asks about your love life and you’d rather not get into it, say, “Great, thanks for asking.”"

      "title": "End the conversation.",
      "content": "End the conversation. If you can’t keep up your pretenses, end the conversation. Find a lull and speak up. For example, you can take a quick out by saying, “It’s been great talking” or “So glad we got to catch up,” and then make an exit. [2] X Research source"
