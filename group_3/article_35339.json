      "content": "Recession hair is dyed hair that’s grown out and faded to save money. Media outlets first used the term in 2009 to describe how people were letting their roots show and skipping color touch-ups to save money after the 2008 financial crash. TikTok users revived the trend in 2025, using the phrases “recession blonde” or “recession brunette” to refer to embracing a grown-out, low-maintenance look. [1] X Research source As of April 2025, the U.S. isn’t officially in a recession. However, people are tightening their budgets due to economic stress, leading to the return of so-called recession hair. [2] X Research source Hair stylists have reported clients choosing cheaper services and booking fewer appointments, as reported by Bloomberg. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Recession blonde is a dark, soft shade of blonde. People who aren’t naturally blonde have to visit the salon regularly to maintain a bright blonde shade. This can cost thousands of dollars annually. By growing out their natural hair—or getting a more subtle treatment, such as blonde lowlights, to emulate the recession blonde look—they save money in the long term. [4] X Research source Recession blonde is visually similar to bronde (the term for a brunette-blonde hybrid shade), or what TikTok refers to as ‘old money blonde.’ Celebrities with recession blonde hair include Jennifer Lawrence, Sofia Richie, and Margot Robbie. [5] X Research source The phrase “recession brunette” is used interchangeably with recession blonde. It refers to how the color is between light brown and dark blonde."

      "content": "Similar theories include the lipstick effect and the hemline index. The lipstick effect suggests people buy more lipstick during times of economic crisis because it’s an affordable luxury. [6] X Research source The hemline index suggests long skirt hems trend during periods of economic strain, while skirt hemlines rise when the economy flourishes. [7] X Research source Both theories are popularly touted as being true or proven, but they’re not backed up by historical economic data."

She joked that the length of the roots was her indicator that the economy hadn’t been good for a while. Media outlets began covering the trend in March 2025, drawing more attention to it.

It requires less upkeep to maintain its shape, which means fewer salon visits. Tiered layers look volumized and bouncy even when they grow out, and don’t require much heat styling.

      "content": "Choose lowlights instead of highlights to flatter your natural color. Lowlights are the opposite of highlights. Instead of adding lighter streaks, a stylist colors a few strands so they’re darker than your natural color. These strands give your hair a sophisticated, yet natural look, without requiring the costly maintenance of highlights or balayage. [11] X Research source If you have gray hair, lowlights help your hair resemble its darker natural color. Work with your stylist to find the right lowlights for your shade of gray and skin tone."

Ask your hair colorist to leave your roots alone (or lighten them, if you’re a natural blonde trying to go closer to brunette) so future grown-out roots can blend in. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "If you want to go blonde, choose balayage over full bleaching. Achieving a bright blonde shade is one of the most high-maintenance hair treatments. Balayage is a low-maintenance alternative that involves colorists hand-painting highlights to appear natural. In most cases, the highlights are focused on the mids and ends of your hair. You don’t have to worry about awkward dark roots because they blend naturally into the balayage. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Add deep conditioning to your hair routine. Use a deep conditioning treatment weekly on top of your regular shampoo and conditioner to help your hair stay hydrated and shiny. It’s especially useful if you have dry or damaged hair that needs the extra moisture. “A treatment is like a conditioner on steroids,” explains Pittman. Do a treatment about once a week by applying a deep conditioner or hair mask over wet, clean hair. Leave it in your hair as long as the product specifies—typically, 5-15 minutes. Next, rinse until the water running off your hair is clear. Pat dry with a microfiber cloth or shirt. [16] X Research source Put a shower cap on to keep the treatment from rinsing out if you’re applying it in the shower."

      "content": "Limit your use of heat styling tools to twice a week. Regularly straightening, curling, or blow-drying your hair with high heat can cause damage to your hair, making it dry and prone to breakage. [17] X Research source Try to limit how often you use heat tools on your hair to two or three times a week so your hair feels healthier in between salon visits. Pittman emphasizes that it’s important to use a thermal protectant spray every time you apply heat to your hair to prevent damage."
