      "title": "Acknowledge his effort in asking you out.",
      "content": "Acknowledge his effort in asking you out. Even if the man asking you out isn’t an acquaintance or a friend, try to remember the courage it takes for a guy to ask a girl out. This doesn’t mean you should say yes when you don’t want to; it’s simply a reminder to try and focus on being honest yet kind in your response. Some examples of acknowledging his effort follow here: “I'm flattered you thought of me, but...\" \"I know it takes a lot to get the courage to ask someone out..\" “I really appreciate your taking the time to ask me.” “It’s very nice to receive attention from someone as kind as you…” Keep a respectful distance from him, and smile slightly. Avoid getting too close to him, or using any body language that indicates you might be interested."

      "content": "Be clear and direct when saying no. The worst thing you can do when you're politely rejecting someone is to give him false hope. It might be hard for him to hear “no” at first, but it will be much better for him in the long run. Remain straightforward and polite throughout the interaction, and you’ll be able to reject him without breaking his heart . Some examples include the following: [1] X Research source “You seem like a nice guy, but I just don't like you that way. I appreciate that you thought to ask me.” \"Thank you, but I'm not interested in going on a date with you, though I’m sure some lucky girl will be.” “I’m just not feeling a connection, so I’m going to have to pass.” Don't make excuses—you don’t owe them an explanation. Unless it's true, don't tell him that you're in a relationship. Avoid saying, “I just got out of a relationship, and I'm not ready to date.” Even if this is true, it might give him false hope that you'll change your mind, and that's not fair to him. Keep it short; you don't need to give a long-winded rejection just to seem nice."

      "title": "Answer using a polite tone of voice.",
      "content": "Answer using a polite tone of voice. It’s possible to reject someone nicely by speaking with an open and warm tone, even while being firm in your answer. Try to make eye contact with him at least once when you are speaking. When you’re saying no to someone in person, it matters how you do it. Things like your expression, tone of voice, and body language can all affect how he perceives your answer. Find examples of a polite and thoughtful tone ahead: “I think you're a great guy, but I just don't feel the same way about you.” “Thank you so much for the invitation, but I have to decline.” Dating coach Christina Jay, NLP suggests something like, “‘Thank you for the gesture, but I'm not open to dating right now,’ as a good way to decline a date, as well as ‘Thank you so much for the offer, but I can't entertain it.’” [2] X Expert Source Christina Jay, NLP Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 February 2020. There is no need to feel defensive about saying no. You have every right to choose who you date. It’s ok to feel confident about giving him an honest, polite, and respectful answer."

      "title": "Let him know if you want to be friends.",
      "content": "Let him know if you want to be friends. If you genuinely would like to be friends with a guy who asks you out, tell him. This will soften your rejection and show him that you value his company, even if you're not interested in him romantically. If you do, make sure he knows that your feelings about the situation aren't going to change if you are friends; you don't want to give him any false hope. Examples focused on being friends follow here: “Sorry, I'm not interested in you in a romantic way, but I know someone else will be. I like talking with you, and I'd love to be friends.” “I don't see myself having romantic feelings for you, but I'd love to be friends!” “I don't feel we're a romantic match, but I think we’d make great friends.” If you don't actually want to be friends with him, don't say you want to be friends. Simply tell him you're not interested and that you hope he has a nice day, and walk away."

It’s better to respond in a timely manner (within a day of his message). Before you respond, first take some time to think about what you want to say and how you want to say it. [3] X Research source Don't give him the silent treatment and hope he gets the point. The polite way to handle the situation is to give him a response, even if it’s rejecting him over text ."

I just don't see you in a romantic way.” “I've really enjoyed getting to know you, but I don't see this developing into anything further for me.” “I'm not sure if we are the right match for each other romantically, and I don't want to waste your time.” “I don't think we are a match, but I want to wish you all the best.\" “I just don't see you that way, but thank you for asking.”"

Even if you normally text or type in a very casual manner, try to be a bit more formal in your rejection. For instance, include complete sentences and words instead of fragments and texting slang. [5] X Research source Instead of “Thx, but I just don’t see u like that,” say, “Thanks so much, but I don’t have romantic feelings about you.”"

It can be tempting to come up with excuses to let yourself off the hook, but it’s always preferable to be truthful. Stay honest by avoiding an open-ended answer. Make sure that he won't think you might be interested in the future, so give a guy an answer when he asks you out that is final, but end with something positive if possible. “I appreciate that you asked me because I've enjoyed talking to you, but I just don't have romantic feelings for you. I know you’ll find the perfect girl very soon!” Dating coach John Keegan includes responses like, “‘Hey, I really appreciate that you asked me that. I'm really flattered. But I'm not interested.’ It’s okay just to say ‘I just know we wouldn't be a match in that way. You seem like a wonderful person, but that's where I'm at on that. But thank you so much.’ That's the nicest way to do it.” [6] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 18 November 2019. Dating coach Mark Rosenfeld suggests rejecting a date over text with the following: “Hey, you know, I don't feel the connection between us, and I'm just going to be honest.” This way, “the guy can absorb your honesty rather than worrying about protecting his feelings.” [7] X Expert Source Mark Rosenfeld Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 29 July 2021."

Sometimes, though, it takes a date to figure out that you really aren't interested. Examples of how to say no after a first date follow: “I'm sorry. I just didn't really feel a connection on our date. Hope you find someone great!” “It was great meeting you, but I don't feel a spark.” \"I appreciate you taking the time to meet. I'm not sure we're a good match, but I wish you all the best.” “Hey. Just so you know, I don't think there's really anything here for me, but I'm glad we got the chance to go out.” Rosenfeld believes that “We focus a lot on not hurting people's feelings. But men need feedback as well. It's okay if their feelings are hurt sometimes, as long as you don't do it maliciously. If it does hurt his feelings, be okay with that.” [8] X Expert Source Mark Rosenfeld Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 29 July 2021."

The longer you wait to tell him you don't want to go out again, the more difficult it will become. If you've only been out on a date or two, it's fine to tell him you're not interested in a text message. If you know you're not interested at the end of your first date, go ahead and let him know. Be confident even if you let him down at the end of your first date. It can feel difficult to say no in person, but it’s important to do."

When politely declining a date online , simply let him know you’re not interested while saying thank you for getting in touch. [10] X Research source Keegan goes on to say that when someone asks you out, you don’t owe them anything.

Don’t feel as if you have to reply to every inbox message you get from a guy who’s interested in you. Dating apps are hit-and-miss, and some messages may not be worth responding to.

He may have unspoken expectations that you’ll eventually “come around” and take any ambiguity as an excuse to keep messaging you. If you’re direct, he’ll likely take the hint and move on. Try to avoid excuses like “I’m not ready yet” or “Maybe another time”; they’ll just prolong the rejection. [12] X Research source Dating coach Julianne Cantarella’s suggestions include “I think you're a really great person. I know you're going to meet someone special, but I just don't think that we're a match.” She mentions “keeping it very light and authentic.” [13] X Expert Source Julianne Cantarella Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 6 August 2021.
