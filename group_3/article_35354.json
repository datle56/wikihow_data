      "content": "Examine your skin for any irritations. Irritations on the skin can be caused by bites or by repeated scratching—both could be indicators of body lice. Be sure to check for sores on the waistline, upper thigh, pubic, and groin areas specifically. Some other species of lice that can infest your body, such as crab lice, may also get into your eyelashes. Inspect your lashes closely for any signs of lice or nits.

      "content": "Check the skin for lice. Sometimes you can see body lice on your skin. Although this is not very common, it’s still a good idea to examine your waistline, upper thigh, and armpit areas for lice. Adult body lice are the same approximate size, shape, and color as a sesame seed. Check any areas of the skin that are irritated, darkened, or calloused. A magnifying glass can help you find clusters of eggs, but it is not absolutely necessary. You can see the lice or their eggs with the naked eye."

      "title": "Turn an article of clothing inside out to look for lice and eggs.",
      "content": "Turn an article of clothing inside out to look for lice and eggs. Body lice live mainly in the seams of clothing. They’ll only move to your skin after they hatch and mature. If you suspect body lice, check your clothes carefully for the lice and their eggs (nits), paying special attention to the seams in the waistline and armpit areas. Mature lice cannot live longer than 5 to 7 days after falling off a host. Because of this, it is more common to find lice eggs, or \"nits,\" in an article of clothing. These eggs look like tiny yellowish or white ovals. These eggs hatch out in 1-2 weeks. Although it is rare, body lice can lay their eggs directly on the human body. Look for eggs directly attached to the shafts of body hair (for example, in the armpits or groin)."

      "content": "Maintain a regular personal hygiene regimen. Most cases of body lice will go away once the body has been cleansed of any nits or lice. Take regular showers and wash your clothes, bedsheets, and towels at least once a week. [3] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Unlike head lice or pubic lice, body lice only invade the body when they need to feed and are not consistently present on the skin. Nits are rarely laid on the body. Practicing good personal hygiene and regularly washing and drying your clothing on high heat settings are essential for getting rid of a body lice infestation."

      "content": "Visit your doctor to treat irritation and rashes. Typically, you won’t need any medications to treat body lice, since you can get rid of them with proper hygiene. However, your doctor can prescribe creams and body washes to help reduce any skin irritations or allergic reactions due to the bites or excessive scratching. [4] X Research source Let your doctor know if you think your skin might be infected in areas where you’ve been scratching a lot. They can prescribe an antibiotic or anti-fungal medication to clear it up."

Popular over-the-counter pediculicides include \"Clear,\" \"Rid,\" and \"Nix.\" Follow the directions on the packaging carefully when using these products on your body or contaminated clothes and furniture. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Pediculicides are designed to kill lice in one of two different ways: Ovicidal pediculicides kill nits and only need to be used a few times. Non-ovicidal pediculicides kill mature body lice, but not nits. You may need to use them multiple times to avoid re-infestation from nits that hatch."

Nits can lie dormant for up to 2 weeks, so it’s important to get rid of them so the infestation doesn’t come back or spread to someone else. Pair vacuuming with louse-killing spray to kill any lice and nits the vacuum doesn’t suck up."
