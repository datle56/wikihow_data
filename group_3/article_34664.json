      "content": "Try a scuffle hoe for new weeds. Scuffle hoes, also called hula hoes, are long metal tools with a small loop at the end. They’re great for getting rid of small, leafy weeds in medium to large patches, and you can buy ones with long handles so you don’t have to bend over. To use them, place the metal loop on the ground and go in a back and forth motion to scuffle the dirt and remove the weeds. [1] X Research source Scuffle hoes are not great for large, root-heavy weeds, like dandelions."

      "title": "Use a digger or a spade for small areas.",
      "content": "Use a digger or a spade for small areas. If you are hand pulling large, rooty weeds, like dandelions, you’ll need to use a dandelion digger or a spade to pull the roots out. This may require some bending and kneeling, so be sure you have knee pads as well. [2] X Research source If any of your weeds are prickly, grab some gardening gloves, too."

      "title": "Try a Hori Hori knife for long tap roots.",
      "content": "Try a Hori Hori knife for long tap roots. Large, well-established weeds tend to have long roots. To make sure you get all the roots out, purchase a Hori Hori knife, or a long, pointed spade. It will help you dig out the roots quickly and save you some time. [3] X Research source Hori Hori knives also have one serrated edge to cut things with."

      "title": "Use a hoe for large areas.",
      "content": "Use a hoe for large areas. If you have a lot of weeds you need to take care of quickly, a hoe is your best bet. This long-handled tool with a sharp metal blade will stir up soil quickly so you can rake the weeds out of it. Hoes work best on soft, loose soil with small, leafy weeds. [4] X Expert Source Ben Barkan Professional Gardener Expert Interview. 14 April 2020. If you have an extra-large area (like a farm), consider using a mechanical tiller."

      "title": "Pull weeds when they’re small.",
      "content": "Pull weeds when they’re small. Established weeds are much harder to pull than small, newly grown ones. As soon as you notice weeds starting to come in, grab your tools and get to pulling. [5] X Research source Most weeds grow very quickly, and some can even grow noticeably larger in just a few days."

      "title": "Wait until the soil is moist.",
      "content": "Wait until the soil is moist. Wet soil is much easier to work with than dry soil. If you have the time, wait until after it rains to start pulling your weeds. If you’re working in a small area and it hasn’t rained in a while, you can give the area some water with your hose. [6] X Research source It’s totally possible to pull weeds out of dry soil, it just might be a little harder to do."

    {
      "title": "Scrape your hoe or scuffle hoe along the dirt.",
      "content": "Scrape your hoe or scuffle hoe along the dirt. If you’re pulling weeds from a large area, grab your scuffle hoe or standard hoe and place the edge onto the soil. Move your arms back and forth to break up the top layer of dirt and remove the weeds. When you’re done, use a rake to collect all of the leafy weeds and put them into the compost. [7] X Research source Try to work in a straight line so you can keep track of where you’ve already weeded."

    {
      "title": "Push your spade or digger tool into the soil next to the weed.",
      "content": "Push your spade or digger tool into the soil next to the weed. For large, rooty weeds, you’ll need to use a Hori Hori, dandelion digger, or spade. Push the tool into the dirt next to the weed and angle it inward toward the roots. Gently wiggle the tool to loosen the soil before you start pulling. [8] X Research source If you are using a scuffle hoe or a regular hoe, you don’t need to insert your tool into the soil."

    {
      "title": "Pull the weed straight up.",
      "content": "Pull the weed straight up. Grab the weed by the base and gently tug upwards. Don’t shake the weed as you pull, since that could spread seeds. If you meet any resistance, stop and dig the root loose again. Keep pulling gently until you get the entire weed, roots and all. [9] X Research source If you leave any of the roots in the ground, the weeds will grow back very quickly. If the roots snap off, use a spade to dig into the ground and find them."

      "title": "Replace the soil once you pull out a weed.",
      "content": "Replace the soil once you pull out a weed. After you pull out a weed, tamp the dirt back down in the hole. Disturbed dirt makes a great habitat for new weeds, so it’s important to do this after you pull them out. [10] X Research source You could even plant new, native plants or grass over the now vacant area."

      "title": "Put cardboard over the soil to prevent new weeds.",
      "content": "Put cardboard over the soil to prevent new weeds. A large patch of dirt is the perfect area for weeds to grow. If you want to keep them out of your soil, place a few sheets of cardboard over the soil to cover the dirt entirely. As the cardboard gets wet, it will start to break down slowly and dissolve into the soil. However, it will also create a protective barrier that stops new plants from growing in the area. [11] X Expert Source Ben Barkan Professional Gardener Expert Interview. 14 April 2020. This is a great technique to use if you plan on starting a garden or growing crops in a big area."

    {
      "title": "Mulch the area to prevent new weeds.",
      "content": "Mulch the area to prevent new weeds. If cardboard isn’t your thing, add a 4 in (10 cm) layer of coarse-textured mulch to the area, like bark chips. Then, add 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of fine-textured mulch on top, like shredded leaves. The mulch will block the sunlight and keep weeds from growing in your lawn or garden. [12] X Research source Be sure to keep the mulch a few inches away from any plant or tree roots, as mulch can cause rot and disease."

      "title": "Add weeds to your compost pile.",
      "content": "Add weeds to your compost pile. To kill weeds, don’t just throw them in with your yard debris. Instead, add them to a compost pile and make sure the center reaches at least 55 °C (131 °F) for at least 3 days. The high heat will kill the weed seeds so you can safely use your compost in your garden. [13] X Research source If you don’t have a compost pile and you’re dealing with invasive weeds, you can either burn them, bury them, or take them to a waste disposal facility in your area."
