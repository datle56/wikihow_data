      "content": "Understand the salute is done on the behalf of the King. When an officer salutes another officer in the UK Armed Forces, he is in effect saluting His Majesty the King. So, if a subordinate airman salutes an officer, the officer will return the salute on behalf of the King."

      "content": "Salute with your right hand and an open palm. Officers in the Royal Air Force and the Army both salute the same way. When RAF and Army personnel do a hand salute, they display an open hand. They position their right hand so their fingertips almost touch the band of their hat. The RAF and the Army do not wear white gloves as part of their uniform, so they will salute with their palm facing forward."

      "content": "Acknowledge your superiors with a salute. Taking the word “salute” literally, it is a way of offering a salutation or a greeting. In the military, you must show respect by saluting your superiors, and your superiors must reciprocate by saluting you. If you are not sure who is your superior officer based on your rank, you can use this chart here to determine who you should be saluting in the RAF and the Army. In the RAF, a Corporal will always salute an Air Marshal, for example, and in the Army a Private will always salute a Major."

      "content": "Understand the origins of the Navy salute. In the 1800s, naval officers would salute by raising their cap or by touching the brim of their cap with their index finger and thumb. This became the standard Navy salute, done with the right hand. The salute was done with the hand at a diagonal to prevent exposing the palm, as naval officers did not want to show their tar-stained hands to their superiors. [2] X Research source In the Navy, officers can salute with their left hand if their right hand is engaged or occupied."

      "content": "Salute with your right hand and your palm facing down, towards your shoulder. Make sure your forearm and hand stay in a straight line. Tilt your hand so your palm does not show as you salute. Keep your hand to the side of your face, just below your cap. [3] X Research source"
