      "title": "“Aight” is an informal way to say “all right.”",
      "content": "“Aight” is an informal way to say “all right.” Pronounced as ah-ahyt , this slang term became popular in the ‘90s after originating in Black English through hip-hop music and culture. “Aight” (also spelled as “aiight” and “ight”) can be used in the same way that you’d use “all right.” [1] X Research source In the ‘90s, it was common to ask someone if they were “all right” or “okay” by using this slangy phrase, but it could also be used as a filler word, an adjective, or a way to express affirmative approval like “yes” or “sounds good.” Examples: “Aight, I’ll meet you there.” “These shoes are aight.” “You feeling aight?” Will Smith raps this phrase in the song “I'm Looking for the One (To Be With Me.” [2] X Research source"

      "title": "“All that and a bag of chips” implies that someone is arrogant or conceited.",
      "content": "“All that and a bag of chips” implies that someone is arrogant or conceited. To be “all that” generally means to be amazing (or “da bomb,” as a 90s kid would say). So, being “all that and a bag of chips” might mean that someone is “all that” plus a little bit more—just like how a bag of chips is that extra treat used to round out a perfect meal deal. While this phrase can be used as a compliment, it was usually used in the ‘90s to criticize boastful or vain people who THOUGHT that they were “all that and a bag of chips.” [3] X Research source Examples: “He’s got such a superiority complex, he really thinks he’s all that and a bag of chips.” “I’m really digging her vibe. She’s all that and a bag of chips!” “You ain’t all that and a bag of potato chips.” Dr. Evil says this to the president in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999). [4] X Research source"

[5] X Research source The slangy exclamation became popular through the 1995 movie Clueless , although writer-director Amy Heckerling credits the LGBTQIA+ community with coining and first using the term. [6] X Research source Examples: “He got a raise? As if!” “ I’m going to apologize to her ? As if!” “Ew, get off of me! Ugh, as if!” Cher Horowitz says this in Clueless when a boy she’s not interested in tries to grab her. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "“Bling!” is a slang term for expensive, flashy jewelry. If someone’s looking to get blinged out, they’re likely loaded up with a bunch of shiny necklaces, bracelets, chains, and other glitzy accessories. This term is also associated with people who like to show off their wealth through flashy bling (!), like B.G. does in his 1999 track “Bling Bling.” This hip-hop song is largely credited with popularizing this term as an essential piece of 90s slang. [8] X Research source Examples: “He turned up all iced out with lots of bling.” “That gold chain is a little too bling for my taste.” “Bling bling, pinky ring worth about fifty.” B.G. sings this line in the song “Bling Bling.” [9] X Research source"

      "content": "“Catch you on the flip side” is a casual way to say “goodbye.” You might also simply say “ I’ll see you on the flip side or even opt for the more flamboyant “catch you on the flippity flip.” Whatever informal phrase you use to say adiós to the people you’re hanging with, they’ll know that you’re telling them that you’re heading out, but you’ll see them later. Many people credit disk jockeys (DJs) with the creation of this term— they’d encourage radio listeners to keep tuning in after they flipped their record (“see you on the flip!”). [12] X Research source Examples: “I have to take this call, I’ll catch you on the flip side!” “Okay, I just wrapped up so I’m gonna sign off.

You might even use it to describe your current relaxed state, similar to “I’m chilling” or “I’m just hanging out.” While the slangy term definitely came about in the ‘90s, no one’s exactly sure who coined it! No need to worry about that though—we’re chillaxing. [15] X Research source Examples: “Chillax, bro.” “Let’s just chillax with a nice glass of wine tonight.” “She’s not worried, she’s chillaxing.”"

      "content": "Being “crunk” means to be exceedingly excited or energetic. In some contexts, it can also mean that someone is under the influence of alcohol and cannabis simultaneously. Crunk is also a subgenre of up-tempo hip-hop that emerged in the Southern U.S. during the ‘90s. As a slang term, “crunk” comes from the African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) verb “to crank.” Basically, when you’re “cranked up” (or “crunk”), you’re hyped, pumped up, and full of energy (among other potential substances).

      "content": "“Def” is a 90s slang term meaning “definite” or “definitely.” Apparently, the youth of the 1990s decided that “definitely” was a bit too long for their tastes, so they came up with the hip, cool, and relaxed abbreviation of “def.” While “def” actually originated as a slang term in the 1980s, it more commonly was used to describe anything hip or trendy (“That’s so def”), while 90s kids used it more as a shortened “definitely.” [20] X Research source Examples: “Oh, I’ll def be there!” “I can def pick that up for you later.” “She’s def way too good for him.”"

      "content": "“Don’t go there” is a way to shut down a subject that’s too unpleasant. When someone says “don’t go there” in response to another statement, they’re basically saying that what’s being brought up is so controversial or unnecessary that there’s no point in discussing it. Like a lot of 90s “sound bite” slang, “don’t go there” has unclear origins. But, it is credited by some as starting with Black drag queens and later being brought to the mainstream by popular sitcoms like Martin . [21] X Research source Examples: “We could just lend her the money.” “Don’t even go there, we’re not lending her squat.” “Don’t go there, he’s super old-fashioned and is just going to respond badly.” “Jake and Katie were having this huge fight, then she brought up his past and he told her ‘don’t even go there.’”"

      "content": "“Eat my shorts” is a rude way to tell someone to stop bothering you. While “eat my shorts” was also a common slang phrase in the 1980s (see: John Bender), it’s most commonly associated with the ‘90s thanks to Bart Simpson using it as a catchphrase on The Simpsons (1989 - present). [22] X Research source “Eat my shorts” can be used as a comeback, retort, or a taunt by someone who’s trying to seem extra rebellious or tough. Examples: “Your shoes look hella dirty.” “Eat my shorts.” “Eat my shorts, losers!” “You just started school and the path you choose now may be the one you follow for the rest of your life.

To break it down further, “fo” is just a shortened version of “for,” while “shizzle” combines “sure” and “izzle.” “Izzle” is a slang device popular suffix used by rappers, so it makes since that “fo’ shizzle” was popularized by Snoop Dogg himself!

Someone might say “I’m outtie” if they’re at a party, for instance, and are just about ready to walk out the door. [34] X Research source The phrase probably is an abbreviation of “I’m out of here,” but it also evolved to be spoken as “I’m Audi 5000,” referencing the car model.

When something is the “shiznit,” or even just the “shiz,” it’s probably the most impressive, interesting, or hip thing that anyone can think of. [58] X Research source Examples: “I can’t believe you just did that. You’re the shiznit!” “This pizza is the shiznit.” “Pepsi is nowhere near the best soda. Mountain Dew is the shiznit!”"

      "content": "“Veg out” means to relax and be purposefully lazy or inattentive. In modern times, you might say “I’m gonna rot all day,” meaning that you want to just spend the day laying in bed or lazing around your house. In the nineties, this same meaning was expressed with the phrase “veg out!” A little bit on the morbid side, this slang term’s meaning comes from the connection between vegetables and mental incapacitation, but it originated in the 1990 film Pretty Woman . [59] X Research source Examples: “Work was awful this week, I’m just gonna veg out this weekend and catch up on my shows.” “I’m not coming to the party tonight, I’m just gonna be vegging out.” “Let’s watch old movies all night and we’ll just veg out in front of the TV.” “Veg out?” “Yeah, be still like vegetables. Lay like broccoli.” Romantic leads Vivian and Edward have this exchange during a key scene in Pretty Woman . [60] X Research source"

      "content": "“What’s the 411?” is a way to ask for the latest info or gossip. The code “411” (pronounced four-one-one) became slang for general information in the 1980s, since callers would dial 411 to contact “information” or “directory assistance.” In the nineties, the phrase evolved into “what’s the 411?” and “give me the 411,” meaning that the speaker wants the latest updates (or “ tea ,” according to more modern lingo). [62] X Research source Examples: “It’s been so long since we last caught up! What’s the 411 with you?” “What’s the 411 on tomorrow’s party?” “She gave me the 411 on everything that happened last weekend.”"

      "title": "“Whatever!” is a way to dismiss something that someone else has said.",
      "content": "“Whatever!” is a way to dismiss something that someone else has said. Often considered a rude, bratty, or snide slang word, “whatever” is synonymous with a sardonic “whatever you say” or “I don’t care what you say.” Basically, you don’t want to listen to or do what the person asked, but you also don’t want to argue about it. [63] X Research source It was particularly popular among ‘90s teenagers who might dismiss their parents by tossing out this comment. Examples: “You need to do your homework before dinner.” “Whatever, mom.” “Nick said that? Whatever, he’s so annoying.” “Whatever, if she doesn’t do the assignment, I can’t do mine.” The character of Amber in Clueless (1995) makes this remark to Cher, dismissing the story she’s telling as stupid and irrelevant.
