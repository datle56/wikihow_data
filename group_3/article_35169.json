      "content": "Setting a super high goal can feel overwhelming rather than motivating. Sure, setting a goal to read 100 books in 1 year is great on paper, but it can be pretty daunting once you actually sit down and start. Instead, choose short-term goals that feel achievable for your current schedule, like: Reading for 20 minutes each day Reading 2 science-fiction novels each month Reading 50 pages each week [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Building a reading habit makes it easier to read more each day.",
      "content": "Building a reading habit makes it easier to read more each day. Put daily reading at the same priority as lunch or dinner—something important enough to sit down and set aside time for. Choose a time that works best for your schedule, whether that’s first thing in the morning or right before bed. [2] X Research source You might: Listen to an audiobook every morning on your commute to work Read for 15 minutes on the bus ride to school Read while you eat lunch"

      "content": "This is a great way to build your reading momentum. Yes, every journey starts with a step—but no one ever said it had to be a big one! A quick, easy read can get you back in the reading groove in no time. [3] X Research source Check out some short titles like: The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie Elevation by Stephen King The Boy In The Striped Pajamas by John Boyne [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Reading aloud changes up your routine and keeps things interesting.",
      "content": "Reading aloud changes up your routine and keeps things interesting. Ever find yourself dozing off while reading silently? Reading out loud could be just the solution you’re looking for. Try reading a few paragraphs out loud and see if that makes the reading process more enjoyable for you."

      "title": "Audiobooks let you read when you’re on the go.",
      "content": "Audiobooks let you read when you’re on the go. Going for a walk, driving to the store, or whipping something up in the kitchen? Put on an audiobook! You can make great progress in your reading goals just by tuning into an audiobook for a little while. [5] X Research source Audiobooks are great for multi-tasking, especially if you’re working on something that doesn’t require much brain power. Put one on while you’re at the gym, doing the dishes, or cleaning your room. The possibilities are endless!"

      "title": "It’s hard to find the motivation to read more if you don’t like the book you’re reading.",
      "content": "It’s hard to find the motivation to read more if you don’t like the book you’re reading. It’s tough to quit a book cold turkey; you feel like you’re somehow letting yourself down by stopping instead of seeing it all the way through. This couldn’t be further from the truth, though—your time is valuable, so it’s important to only spend time reading books that you genuinely enjoy. Plus, it’s easy to get burned out if you force yourself to read something you don’t like. [6] X Research source Give yourself a chapter or so before making a decision. Some really great books can start off slow in the beginning."

      "title": "You’ll be much more motivated to read a book that’s exciting to you.",
      "content": "You’ll be much more motivated to read a book that’s exciting to you. Plenty of people assume that “reading more” means “reading more classics,” but that just isn’t the case. Classic literature isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, and it’s totally fine if you stick to a different class of books. Besides, you’ll enjoy a book more if it covers a topic that you really like. [7] X Research source Don’t force yourself to read non-fiction books if you have a passion for fantasy and science-fiction. Don’t sit through a light, comedic novel if you’d rather dive into a gripping thriller."

      "title": "New genres help keep your reading list interesting.",
      "content": "New genres help keep your reading list interesting. There’s nothing wrong with sticking with books you know and love, but it can be just as fun to expand your horizons. Try reading a book from a different genre and see what you think. You might find a whole new world of literature waiting for you! [8] X Research source If you normally read non-fiction books, try reading a dramatic play or novella instead. If you’re a fan of classic mystery novels, try switching things up with a contemporary romance book."

      "title": "Discussing a book with others can be really rewarding and motivating.",
      "content": "Discussing a book with others can be really rewarding and motivating. In a book club, everyone reads the same book at about the same pace. This gives you a great opportunity to really dive into the book and come up with your own thoughts and opinions. Getting to share these thoughts and opinions can really get you going and motivate you to keep reading. [9] X Research source Visit your local library and see if there are any book clubs or groups going on. You can also check sites like “Meetup” to see if there are any independent book clubs in your area."

      "content": "A reading challenge encourages you to read multiple books in a set period of time. Reading challenges aren’t just for little kids—plenty of libraries, websites, and other organizations host them for people of all ages! Sites like GoodReads are great places to start. Here are a couple of challenges you might try: 52 Books in 52 Weeks: Read 52 books in the span of a year, with each book correlating with a specific prompt. [10] X Research source Summer Reading: Read a set number of books between early June and early September."

      "title": "Why check off one book from your reading list when you can check off 2?",
      "content": "Why check off one book from your reading list when you can check off 2? The key is choosing books that are unique enough from each other that you won’t get them mixed up. You might switch up the genres by enjoying a horror novel while reading a nonfiction biography; or, you can get to read books that are in totally different formats, like a poetry anthology and a play. [11] X Research source You could also read a book with a friend or book club, and then read a separate book by yourself."

      "content": "You never know when some free reading time will pop up. Whether you’re driving to the grocery store or heading to class, pack a book along in case you run into some free time. [12] X Research source You might do some extra reading if you finish a test or quiz before the rest of the class. You could read an extra chapter or 2 while you wait for your doctor’s appointment to start."

      "title": "You can read a lot more books by turning your commute into reading time.",
      "content": "You can read a lot more books by turning your commute into reading time. If you have a long drive or train trip to work, you’ve probably come up with different ways to pass the time. Why not add reading to your arsenal? Audiobooks are a great option if you’re in the car, while physical books or ebooks are great choices when you’re on public transit. Don’t forget about plane trips, too! Books are a great way to keep yourself busy on a long flight."

      "content": "This small adjustment adds a lot of reading time to your day-to-day routine. Between Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and other platforms, it’s all-too-easy to get sidetracked from your to-do list for the day. Whenever you sit down to read, turn off your phone or set it to “do not disturb,” so you can read without any distractions. [13] X Research source If you want, use social media as a reward for achieving your reading goal for the day."

      "title": "It’s much more motivating to read when you have a comfy place to do it.",
      "content": "It’s much more motivating to read when you have a comfy place to do it. Pick a well-lit spot in your home to serve as your designated reading area, or stick an extra lamp or 2 in a certain spot. Set up a bookshelf near your reading spot, so you never run short on reading material. [14] X Research source Don’t forget the blankets and pillows, too! Houseplants can also be a nice touch to a reading nook, along with a wheelable book cart."

      "title": "It’s easy to read more when you never run out of material.",
      "content": "It’s easy to read more when you never run out of material. Shop for paperback books on online marketplaces, like Amazon. However, instead of shopping for brand-new books, see if there are sellers offering “used” or “acceptable” versions of the same title. Getting pre-owned books is a great way to save money while you expand your reading collection. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Love books but just don’t have the space for them? E-readers and ebooks might be the answer you’re looking for. E-readers can store tons of books in a small space, and give you access to lots of titles just about anywhere you are. [16] X Research source Sites like Project Gutenberg have lots of free ebooks available. You can also download your favorite fan fictions to your e-reader or mobile device from a collaborative writing site like Archive of Our Own (AO3). You can get a good quality e-reader for less than $100."

      "title": "It’s easy to keep reading when you always know what’s next.",
      "content": "It’s easy to keep reading when you always know what’s next. As you make your way through your current book, decide which book you’d like to read next. That way, you can seamlessly switch to the next book on your list once you’re done. It can be hard to keep up your momentum if you don’t plan ahead. [17] X Research source Apps like Goodreads, Basmo, and Bookly can help you stay on top of the books you’ve already read. Plus, it can be pretty inspiring to see how much you’ve accomplished!"

      "title": "A short, 20-minute reading session prevents you from getting bored.",
      "content": "A short, 20-minute reading session prevents you from getting bored. It’s great if a book rivets you enough to keep you reading for 3 hours straight, but that shouldn’t be the expectation for your reading sessions. Instead, aim for short, 20-minute chunks at a time, so you actively enjoy what you’re reading without getting burned out. [18] X Research source"

      "title": "Constant reading is a surefire way to get burned out.",
      "content": "Constant reading is a surefire way to get burned out. There’s nothing wrong with reading multiple times a day, but don’t overdo it, either! Give yourself plenty of breathing room throughout the day so you don’t get tired of reading overall. For instance, you might read for 15-20 minutes when you first wake up and 15-20 minutes when you head to bed. Then, you have the rest of the day to focus on other activities."

      "title": "Book recommendations can be a great motivator for reading more.",
      "content": "Book recommendations can be a great motivator for reading more. Maybe your friend is gushing about a novel she just finished, or your co-worker is raving about a thriller that they just can’t put down. Recommendations not only give you new material to read, but they also help you look forward to seeing what all the hype is about. [19] X Research source Best of all, you can ask just about anyone for a book recommendation, whether it’s a friend, family member, co-worker, or a random stranger you pass in the bookstore."
