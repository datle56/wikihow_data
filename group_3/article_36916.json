      "content": "Turn on the sprinkler system. In order to locate the break or leak in the sprinkler system, you need to run water through it. Turn on the sprinkler system to activate the flow of water. [1] X Research source Allow the water to run for about 2 minutes before you check the lines. Do this in the daytime, when you'll have an easier time spotting the leak."

      "title": "Listen for the sound of running water.",
      "content": "Listen for the sound of running water. After you turn on the sprinkler system, walk through the area where the sprinkler system is installed. Listen for running water and walk towards where you hear the sound to locate the leak in your sprinkler line. [2] X Research source You may not be able to find the leak just by listening, but it can help you narrow down your search."

      "title": "See if there’s water spouting out of a section of the line.",
      "content": "See if there’s water spouting out of a section of the line. If you see water spraying out of the line instead of the sprinkler head, then there’s a crack or leak in the line. Once you’ve identified where the leak is, mark the location so you can find it when the water is turned off. [3] X Research source If the sprinkler line is exposed enough for you to see water spraying out of a break or crack, check the line for a visible crack, and use a marker to mark the location of the leak."

    {
      "title": "Check for water bubbling up from the soil.",
      "content": "Check for water bubbling up from the soil. If you see a pool of water or water coming from the soil, then there’s a leak in the sprinkler line buried underneath. Mark the general location of the leak or break so you can identify it when the water is turned off. [4] X Research source Place an item like a shovel or a rock on the ground near the leak."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for a series of sprinkler heads that aren’t working properly.",
      "content": "Look for a series of sprinkler heads that aren’t working properly. If you’re having trouble finding water leaking out into the ground, check the sprinkler heads. If you notice a row of them aren’t spraying water or are spraying much less water than other sprinkler heads, then the line is broken and the water isn’t reaching them. [5] X Research source The break or leak in the water line will be located between the last working sprinkler head and the first non-working one."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn off the sprinkler system after you’ve found the leak.",
      "content": "Turn off the sprinkler system after you’ve found the leak. If you’ve found the signs of a leak and located the region where the line is leaking or broken, turn off the water so you can repair the line. Use the shut-off valve in the control box to stop the flow of water through the system. [6] X Research source Wait 1-2 minutes to allow the water to finish flowing through the system. Be sure to shut the valve completely so there isn’t water flowing through the line when you make your repairs."

      "title": "Use a hand trowel to dig up the area above the sprinkler line.",
      "content": "Use a hand trowel to dig up the area above the sprinkler line. A shovel can break the sprinkler system even further. Use a smaller hand trowel when you dig around the damaged section of the line and make your repairs without damaging more of it. [7] X Research source A larger break in the system could mean a costly repair."

      "title": "Cut a square patch with a shovel over the break if the line is buried.",
      "content": "Cut a square patch with a shovel over the break if the line is buried. Use your hand trowel to cut the outline of a large square in the grass above the area of the line that is leaking or broken. Make sure the cuts are consistent so you can replace the patch when you’re done repairing the line. Cut a square or rectangular shape so it’s easier to fit back into place when you’re finished."

      "content": "Remove the patch with 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of dirt on the roots. If you’ve cut a square outline of grass, dig down enough to remove the roots with enough dirt to keep them intact so they can regenerate when you replace the patch. Use 2 hands to grip the grass and pull the patch off of the ground. Cut the roots with the hand trowel if they cling to the ground, but be sure to leave enough so they can regrow."

Once you’ve removed the patch of grass, you will be left with a clean square of earth above the break or crack in the sprinkler line. Take your time and dig down and around the line to expose it. [8] X Research source Make the whole wide enough so the pipe is exposed for 6 inches (15 cm) on each side. Dig about 3 inches (7.6 cm) below the line so it’s easier to remove. Pile the dirt you remove next to the hole so you can replace it when you’re finished."

      "content": "Saw off a 4 in (10 cm) section of pipe at the leak. You need to remove a large enough section to fit your slip coupling into the pipe. Once you’ve exposed the pipe where the leak or break is, use a hacksaw to remove the section that contains the leak or break. Use smooth, consistent sawing motions to cut the pipe so the edge is even. [10] X Research source Remove the damaged piece of pipe after you cut it."

After you’ve removed the damage section of pipe, slide a band clamp onto each end of the pipe. Don’t tighten the clamps yet so you can fit your slip coupling into the gap. [11] X Research source You can find band clamps at your local hardware store, department stores, or online."

Slide the end of the coupling into 1 end of the exposed pipe. Then, extend the coupling so it fits into the other end of the pipe. [12] X Research source Bring the damaged section of pipe to the hardware store so you can get a slip coupling with a diameter that fits into it. Use a slip coupling with a 1 inch (2.5 cm) slip. You can find a slip coupling at a hardware store or online. Extend the coupling as far as it will go into the pipe."

Turn on the system and inspect the slip coupling that you installed to make sure there isn’t any water leaking out. [14] X Research source Allow the system to run for 5 minutes so you can be sure the coupling and clamps won’t come loose."
