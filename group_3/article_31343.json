If the tall person in your life has an extra imposing or strong frame (in addition to being tall), go for a nickname that speaks to their impressive stature (without using words that might comment on their weight specifically). For example: Tall Titan The Mighty Oak The Mighty Mountain The Iron Pillar The Tall Tank The Brawny Behemoth Tall Timber The Mighty Monolith"

One easy way to do that is to choose an adjective or noun associated with height (like “altitude” or “vertical”) that starts with the same letter as their name. Here are some ideas for inspiration: Altitude Alex / Altitude Annie Colossal Chris / Colossal Cristela Elevation Eric / Elevation Evelyn Giraffe Greg / Giraffe Gia High Five Henry / High Five Helen Jumpin’ Jerry / Jumpin’ Jessica King Kevin / Queen Kim Long Tall Liam / Long Tall Linda Mega Milton / Mega Marian Pillar Paul / Pillar Penelope Redwood Ron / Redwood Rita Sky High Steve / Sky High Sally Towering Tim / Towering Tina Vertical Victor / Vertical Vicky Zenith Zach / Zenith Zoe"

      "title": "Steer clear of nicknames that comment on someone’s body type or build.",
      "content": "Steer clear of nicknames that comment on someone’s body type or build. Not all nicknames for tall people are taken so nicely. At the end of the day, someone’s height is a physical feature they can’t control (and might be self-conscious about). This is especially true for kids and particularly young girls, who may feel uneasy when they’re noticeably taller than their peers. [6] X Research source So, while your intentions may be lighthearted, avoid these nicknames that might trigger a little extra body insecurity: Beanpole, beanstalk, or string bean (used for someone who’s tall and skinny) Toothpick (another comment on someone’s height and weight) Bigfoot (insinuates someone is hairy and has big feet, like the monster) King Kong (another comparison to a hairy—though popular!—creature) Ball hog (implies tall people dominate sports unkindly) Giant, Gigantor, Gigantisaurus, etc. (unoriginal and implies someone is big all around) Daddy/Lady Long Legs (some guys may be weirded out by “Daddy” and/or long-legged arachnids) “Too Tall” (there’s no such thing!)"

Even if you meant for the nickname to be affectionate, there’s always a chance the person you’ve given it to doesn’t like it. If they don’t tell you outright, look for signs you may have offended them like: [7] X Research source A shift to closed-off body language or fake-looking smiles A switch to a more irritable tone or mood Short responses or the silent treatment when you engage them Sarcastic or passive-aggressive replies Avoiding future interactions with you"

      "content": "Offer a sincere apology if you’ve offended someone with a nickname. Calmly explain how you didn’t mean for your nickname to be insulting and that you were trying to be friendly. Then, offer a genuine apology and tell the person you won’t call them that name anymore. Try not to put yourself down for your mistake (“I’m an idiot” or “I should have known better”) since this puts the focus on you instead of the person you’re apologizing to. [8] X Research source You might say something like: “Hi John! I wanted to apologize for what I called you yesterday. I meant for it to be a friendly exchange, but I understand that you don’t like it and I won’t use that nickname in the future.”"

      "content": "Respect their boundaries if they don’t want to be called a nickname. Once someone lets you know how they prefer to be called, stick to what they said. It may be tempting to revisit an old nickname or come up with a new one (especially if that’s how you like to show affection, or if you call lots of people in your life nicknames). But, it’s important to respect how someone likes to be referred to—you probably wouldn’t like it if you got called something you found irritating or offensive either! Who knows? As your friendship progresses, you might be able to call them by a nickname in the future, but for now, just use their name."
