      "content": "“Muah” is the slang term for a kiss. The way it’s written, Muah imitates the actual sound you might make while kissing someone, which is why it has that meaning. It also references the sounds two people might make while kissing one another on the cheek in greeting; typically, their lips won’t actually touch each other’s skin, so they make “Muah” sounds instead.

      "content": "“Muah” can sometimes represent the beginning of an evil laugh. Remember how all those cartoon villains used to make a sound like “Muah ha ha” when they laughed in delight after (almost) foiling the hero’s plans? Nowadays, people pretend to laugh evilly over text using “Muah ha ha” or simply “Muah,” usually because they’re teasing or making a joke. [2] X Research source Person 1: “Omg, that prank of yours scared me!!” Person 2: “Muah ha ha! All according to plan. 😈” This version of Muah is less common than the main “kiss” definition, and context clues from the rest of the message can usually tell you which version is being used."
