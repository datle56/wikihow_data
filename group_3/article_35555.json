      "content": "Take the exterior cap off the perfume bottle and pull off the nozzle. Hold the perfume bottle on a level surface and use your fingers to pull straight up on the nozzle. Set the nozzle aside once it pops off if you plan on reusing it; if not, throw it out. [1] X Research source Only standard spritzer tops need to be disassembled. Plug-style perfume tops do not have a nozzle, since you typically dab the perfume on yourself. If you’re trying to recycle a plug-style cologne, you can skip right to cleaning the bottle."

      "title": "Cut off the plastic valve and loosen the metal around the bottle’s neck.",
      "content": "Cut off the plastic valve and loosen the metal around the bottle’s neck. Inspect the top of the perfume, and cut away any plastic encasing the metal with a knife or sharp scissors. Discard this plastic. Then, gently, use the edge of a knife or pliers to wiggle the base of the metal connector loose. [2] X Research source The metal part of perfume bottles can be difficult to take apart. Try prying the metal upwards as you wiggle it left and right to loosen it. Be gentle when applying pressure against the thin glass neck of the bottle. Too much force can cause it to chip."

      "content": "Use needle nose pliers to remove the metal around the neck. Hold your perfume bottle securely with one hand, and use the other to grip the loosened metal with a pair of pliers. Apply gentle pressure, and pull the metal straight up until it comes off the perfume bottle. Once the metal has been removed, discard it. [3] X Research source Try not to spill any remaining perfume in the bottle as you pull the metal connector off."

      "content": "Discard or reserve any remaining perfume. Pour your perfume into another glass container if you intend to save it. (If you do, screw the new bottle’s top on as tightly as possible.) Pour any perfume you don’t want to save down the sink and rinse the drain with hot water. [4] X Research source You can discard the remaining perfume in the trash if you like, but your garbage will have a strong scent until you take it out."

      "title": "Rinse the perfume bottle out with hot running water.",
      "content": "Rinse the perfume bottle out with hot running water. Turn your sink on about halfway, so the stream of water is gentle and not too fast. Fill the perfume bottle with hot running water, and then dump it. Repeat the process at least twice. [5] X Research source A strong stream of water may cause splashing and disperse the residual scent throughout your bathroom."

      "content": "Wash the bottle out with 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of warm white vinegar. To truly eliminate the scent and clean your perfume bottle , heat 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of white vinegar in a mug in the microwave at 20-second intervals until it’s warm but not hot. Then, over your sink, pour the vinegar into your rinsed perfume bottle until it’s about ¾ full. Plug the opening to the bottle with your finger, and shake the bottle for 30 seconds. [6] X Research source Once the bottle has been shaken, let the vinegar-filled bottle soak in the sink for at least an hour to remove its scent. After an hour, pour the used vinegar down the drain and rinse the vinegar away with water to dissipate any residual smell."

Submerse the bottle in the soapy bath for about 5 minutes or so. Then, rinse the bottle with clean water. Use a bottlebrush to clean the interior of the bottle with soap. Wear kitchen gloves while cleaning if the water feels too hot to the touch."

      "content": "Dry the bottle outside in bright sunlight. Place the bottle outside or on a sunny ledge indoors to dry for about a day. If the bottle isn’t dry in 24 hours, spray the rest of the interior dry with canister of compressed air . Follow the manufacturer’s directions on the compressed air canister, including any potential safety precautions. Direct sunlight can also help eliminate some of the leftover scent in your perfume bottle. However, don’t leave your perfume bottle out for more than 24 hours, as the sun can cause the glass, crystal, or plastic to warp over time. [7] X Research source"

[10] X Research source You can usually find the customer service number for your perfume by looking online. Just type “customer service number + [your perfume’s brand]” into your favorite search engine. The manufacturer may also accept their own bottles back for recycling. (Sometimes, they’ll even offer you a free perfume in exchange.) It’s fairly rare, but it doesn’t hurt to ask!"

Then, add 2 fluid ounces (59 ml) of alcohol and shake well. [18] X Research source Cap your bottle with a small cork from a craft shop. You can also skip the essential oil part and just use your old perfume bottles to store your alcohol. Amber-colored drinks like whiskey will look refined in a crystal or glass casing."

Simply pop off the cap of the perfume and place the near-empty bottle of fragrance in your drawer. Only use bottles that are about ⅓ of the way full or less as sachets.
