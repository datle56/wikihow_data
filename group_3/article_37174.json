This link will then ask you for personal information, claiming they need this information for your file, and then they can do whatever they want with that information. These links might also contain a long string of confusing numbers and characters so you can't tell where the link will actually take you. Don't fall for texts that claim that: You've won! A promise of free gift cards, prizes, or coupons is a false promise. You won't get those free things. You're eligible for a low/no-cost credit card! There's no credit card offer. You're eligible for student loan forgiveness! You could be, but this company is most likely just scamming you to get your personal information, like your bank account logins."

These scam texts also come with links that might look like whatever page they are trying to steal your information from: We've noticed some suspicious activity on your account. The link goes to a page that may look convincing as the real thing, but look in the address bar to see if the page is legit. There's a problem with your payment information. This link, while it looks like the PayPal website, exists only to get your PayPal login and credit card information. We're confirming your order but need something from you. This text is from a company you didn't purchase anything from, so don't fall for it. It can also look like \"Thank you for your $146, 976 order from Amazon!\" The delivery to your house failed. The link will also harvest your personal information and claim that you need to make a payment to try the shipment again. Don't fall for it!"

However, if you feel a text might be real, you should always call the company that sent the text (like Amazon or Best Buy) to see if they actually sent the message. Contact the company using a phone number you know is real, not one that's included in the text. For a real number, search the internet for their contact information. The number in the text will lead you to a spoofed line that pretends to be official."
