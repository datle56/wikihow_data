Introduce yourself to the people on your block, hang out outside and wave to folks as they walk by, and chat it up with the people in your neighborhood. Not only will it be easier to start programs and spot suspicious people in your neighborhood if you know everyone, but it will huge deterrent to criminals if they catch a glimpse of the unity in your neighborhood. [1] X Expert Source Saul Jaeger, MS Police Captain, Mountain View Police Department Expert Interview. 21 February 2020. Criminals don’t like to be challenged. If a burglar is driving around looking for houses to break into, they’re going to be put-off if they see a bunch of folks in the neighborhood chatting it up. There’s a strategy you can use here known as positive loitering. The premise is that if you hang out outside with people in the neighborhood, you can keep your eyes peeled and show criminals that they aren’t welcome. [2] X Research source The occasional block party or garage sale are a great way to get to know your neighbors!"

      "content": "Talk to your neighbors to see if anyone is interested. If you can get a few folks to volunteer, call your local police department to get the ball rolling. The police department will walk you through the process, which can differ from area to area. In most cases, the police will assign a liaison officer to work with you. Once the watch is established, start meeting regularly to establish objectives and decide where you want to focus your efforts. The first goal of a neighborhood watch is to report crime and suspicious activity. Outside of that, you could institute citizen patrols, clean up vandalism, or organize youth events. Remind everyone to stay reasonably cautious and not to get paranoid about crime. Some watch groups have resulted in racism and hysteria, because people started feeling like they were the cops. Keep everyone cool to make sure things don’t get carried away. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

Your local police have the lowdown on what’s going on in your area, and they can let you know ahead of time if there’s a spike in car theft, or burglaries. It may also encourage the police to patrol your area a little more often if you ask nicely enough! [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Do not hesitate to call the police if you see a crime taking place. If someone is talking to a child and you know they aren’t the parent, or if you see someone trying to get into your neighbor’s house, call 911. If there has been an ongoing issue or you want to call attention to suspicious behavior, call your local police department directly to report it. Getting law enforcement involved will send the message that crime isn’t tolerated in your neighborhood. [5] X Research source Don’t call 911 if there isn’t a crime taking place or the suspicious activity isn't an emergency or a crime in progress. For issues that are not so black and white if they constitute an emergency, check resources in your relevant area to see what issues they expected to be reported to 911. For example, in New York City, illegal marijuana smoking is an issue that they officially instruct citizens to call 911. [6] X Research source Don’t try to confront criminals yourself. You’re just putting yourself in harm’s way. Let the professionals handle it. [7] X Expert Source Saul Jaeger, MS Police Captain, Mountain View Police Department Expert Interview. 21 February 2020."

Tell them about any specific issues you’re facing in your neighborhood to raise the alarm. Even if they don’t have a plan yet, pushing your local politicians sends the signal that their constituents want more help fighting crime. [8] X Research source You could ask them to tear down vacant properties in your area. There’s a lot of evidence that abandoned buildings are linked to higher crime rates. [9] X Research source If you don’t have streetlights, ask for them! Street lighting can dramatically lower crime. If you’ve noticed an uptick in problematic loitering or public drinking around local businesses, you could let your local representative know [10] X Research source"

      "content": "If your area looks disorganized and unkempt, it may attract crime. Criminals are more likely to assume they can get away with something if it looks like people don’t care about the neighborhood. Host a block cleanup event where neighbors get together and clean up litter, or take matters into your own hand and mow the grass in that vacant lot down the street. By fixing the area up, you’ll deter criminals from hanging around in your area. [11] X Research source Cleaning up and painting over the graffiti in your neighborhood is a great way to make it look nicer. This is a phenomenon known as broken window theory. The premise is that small signs of decay—like broken windows—send a psychological message that law and order are not being enforced. It’s a hotly-debated idea, but there’s evidence that it has merit."

Contact local contractors and get some quotes before you get cameras installed on the front and back of your home.

[12] X Expert Source Saul Jaeger, MS Police Captain, Mountain View Police Department Expert Interview. 21 February 2020. This is really more of a personal crime prevention tactic, but if enough people in your neighborhood put cameras up, it will have a positive impact on the area as a whole.

You can also place “we call the police” signs in your yard and window and encourage your neighbors to do the same. Criminals are much less likely to hang around if they know the neighborhood is on the lookout for suspicious behavior. [14] X Trustworthy Source United States Department of Justice Official website of the U.S. Department of Justice Go to source You can throw a security company sign in your yard, even if you don’t have a security system installed. Even if you never got an official neighborhood watch off of the ground, you can still ask about putting the signs up! Criminals won’t know the difference. Consult your local government before nailing signs to electrical poles and such. In most cases they’re going to honor small requests like these."
