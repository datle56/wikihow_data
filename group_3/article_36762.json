Most toilets have plastic covers for the bolts so you can’t see them. If yours does, open these covers by prying upwards on them with your finger or a flathead screwdriver. [1] X Expert Source Dave Jones Master Plumber, Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup Expert Interview. 29 March 2021. Use light pressure when opening the bolt covers if you’re keeping the seat. If you use a lot of force, the cover may crack. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Grip the first nut under the seat firmly by hand. Jones recommends wearing gloves if you want to keep your hands clean. There are two nuts—one on the left, and one on the right. Each nut is screwed onto the threaded end of a bolt. Some nuts may have a shape similar to a wingnut, allowing you to hold it in place by hand. If you have a weak grip, the nut is not wingnut-shaped, or the nut is stuck, try gripping it with a pair of pliers or vice grips. [3] X Expert Source Dave Jones Master Plumber, Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup Expert Interview. 29 March 2021. The fasteners of your toilet seat are usually plastic. Use light to moderate pressure when removing plastic hardware to keep them from breaking. [4] X Research source"

Jones continues, “While holding the nut on the threaded end of the bolt, insert your screwdriver into the bolt head and turn it counterclockwise to unscrew it.” [5] X Expert Source Dave Jones Master Plumber, Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup Expert Interview. 29 March 2021. What if my hand can’t grip the nut? If the nut is so tight that the friction hurts your hand when you unscrew the bolt, use a wrench or channel locks to hold the nut still instead of your hand."

      "content": "Repeat the process on the remaining nut and bolt. After you remove the first nut and bolt, repeat the process on the second one. The toilet seat may rattle around a bit since there’s nothing anchoring the other side anymore, so it may help to rest your elbow on the seat or sit on it while you work."

      "content": "Remove the seat from the toilet. The seat will freely come up now that the nuts and bolts are off. Jones suggests you collect the nuts, bolts, and any loose plastic or metal hardware (like the bolt covers) that also go with the seat. Put these small pieces into a sealable plastic bag and tape them to the seat so they don’t become lost. Your toilet seat is removed, now you can install a new one .

      "content": "Seats where the bolts are directly under the hinge: Look for release buttons. Some “slow close” lids that automatically drop peacefully rely on an interlocking system where the bolts connecting the seat are hidden. For these seats, raise the lid up and look for small buttons near the junction where the bolts meet the seat. Press these buttons to unlock the seat and take it off. [7] X Research source Alternative: Some toilets with release buttons only have one button in the middle—not one button for each bolt. If you see a single opening in the middle of the hinge, try pressing on it. [8] X Research source"

If the bolts are hidden but there are no release buttons near the hinge, raise the seat up and try physically lifting it up out of the bolts. If you feel a little give, keep pulling until the seat comes off. [9] X Research source You do normally have to use a fair bit of force on these, but if you don’t feel any give at all and you’re pulling pretty hard, you probably don’t have a quick-release lid. Don’t pull so hard that you might damage the toilet."

There are a handful of “luxury” quick-release designs out there that try to hide all of their hardware. If you don’t get any give when you try to pull the seat up and there aren’t any buttons, try sliding the seat back to the tank to see if it unlocks. Alternative: You can also try raising the seat straight up and then twisting it clockwise or counterclockwise. You may be able to slide the seat off of the bolts that way."

Depending on your situation and the kind of fasteners used to attach the seat, you may want to tape the lid and seat together in a closed or open position. If your situation requires you to cut or drill off bolts to remove the seat, you may want to tape a cover material, like cardboard, in place to protect the porcelain of the toilet and the plastic of the seat as well.

Spray metal nuts and bolts that won’t come loose with this oil to make removing them a breeze. Wait about 5 to 10 minutes for the penetrating oil to seep into the narrow spaces of the hardware and break up corrosion. If you don’t have penetrating oil on hand, you can mix together a solution that is 90% vegetable oil and 10% acetone to make your own. [11] X Research source"

Some toilet designs may require a deep socket or socket extension for you to reach the nut. You can also use a basin wrench designed for this very thing. Turn the socket or wrench counterclockwise firmly to break the nut loose. [12] X Research source Apply steady moderate force with your socket wrench. If the nut doesn’t loosen, intensify the force on your wrench to high for a very short interval. Do this several times until the nut loosens. If the nut and bolt are already loose, the bolt may turn with the nut when you attempt to loosen it. Insert a screwdriver into the head of the bolt to hold it in place, then loosen the nut with your socket wrench."

Then, slide your hacksaw in between the putty knife and the bolt. Cut away at the hardware fastening the seat to your toilet a little bit at a time with the hacksaw until you saw through the bolt. [13] X Research source A regular hacksaw will be able to cut through unmoving toilet seat hardware, but a mini one will be easier to use in the narrow space. Depending on the hinge of your toilet seat and the hardware connecting the seat to the toilet, you may have to cut through the hinge mounts and remove the seat with the bolts attached. Then, you can cut through the bolts."

[14] X Research source Drill into the bolt with firm, steady pressure where the nut and bolt meet. Drill through the nut completely, then use increasingly larger drill bits to widen the hole. Remove the nut when it comes loose. Warning: Save this technique as a last resort because there is a possibility that the drill bit might slip, causing damage to the porcelain or the seat. When you’ve almost drilled through the entire nut, be very careful. Drilling into the porcelain or the seat may cause unsightly damage. Drilled metal may have burrs or jagged edges that can cut you. Handle drilled metal with gloves. Use pliers to try to pull the bolt off. Continue enlarging the hole as necessary and pulling at the nut with pliers until it comes free."

For this reason, you should clean it regularly with a suitable general purpose bathroom cleaner. [15] X Research source Check cleaners before using them on toilet porcelain or the seat itself. In many cases, abrasive cleaners should not be used on toilet seats. Check the labels of cleaners to verify their suitability."

Slide the circular, rubber bushings up the threading side of the bolt with the tapered side of the bushing facing up at the toilet. Then tighten the nut with the tightening tool that came with the bushings. [16] X Research source Many hardware stores will sell this product under a name like \"Toilet Seat Tightening/Fastening Kit.\" Alternatively, you can apply clear silicone to the areas where the seat attaches to the bowl. This will prevent the seat from sliding around."

Replacing these before they degrade could save you a lot of trouble. [18] X Research source"
