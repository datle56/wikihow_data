Then, place the deck face-down in the center of the table.

[2] X Research source If any kings come up, move them to one of the corners (the open spaces between the 4 cards of the cross). Fill the space left by the king with a new card from the deck, face-up like the others. The piles created by these 4 (non-king) cards are called the “foundation piles.”"

      "title": "Discard as many cards as you’re able.",
      "content": "Discard as many cards as you’re able. There are 2 ways a player can discard. First, if a player has a king, they place the king in an empty corner to start a “king’s corner.” Kings can only be played in the corners, but you don’t have to play a king immediately, if you have one. Second, a player may discard a card that’s the opposite color and 1 number lower than the top card of any pile, placing the discarded card on top. [5] X Research source The sequence of cards in the game is K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A. Aces may only be played at the end of a sequence, and don’t begin a new sequence. For example, on a black king, you may only place a red queen. On a red five, you may only place a black four, and so on. Just like playing Solitaire! If the last (or only) card in a foundation pile is an ace, nothing can be played on this card; the pile can only be merged with another pile."

      "title": "Merge any piles, if you’re able.",
      "content": "Merge any piles, if you’re able. When it’s your turn, you may merge piles on the table if the bottom card of one pile is a different color and 1 value lower than the top card of another. Once a foundation pile has been moved, the player who moved it may fill the empty space with any card or card sequence from their hand. For example, you may merge a pile that begins with a black 6 onto another pile that has a red 7 as the top card. If you choose to move a pile, you must move the entire pile, not just some of the cards within the pile As an optional rule, gather and set aside any completed piles (piles that include all cards from king to ace) to make room for a new pile."

The next player to the left then draws a card, and discards or moves whatever piles they can. [6] X Research source Always remember to pick up 1 card at the beginning of each turn. If a player cannot make any moves on their turn, the turn passes to the player on their left. When the center deck runs out, continue playing without drawing cards. [7] X Research source"

For example, if you have 5 cards left in your hand when the round ends, write down 5 points. Play a few more rounds and compete to be the player with the lowest score. [10] X Research source Also allot 10 points for every king left in a player’s hand. The game ends once a player reaches or exceeds a certain score, such as 25 or 50 points. When a player reaches or exceeds the given score, the player with the fewest points wins."

The first player to hold 100 chips wins the game. [11] X Research source If any player cannot discard any cards on their turn, that player pays another chip into the pot. Alternatively, play so that players have to pay a chip for each card left in their hand at the end of each round, similar to the point system (paying 10 chips for a king and 1 chip for every other card)."
