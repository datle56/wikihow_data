      "content": "Think only of the person's good attributes, and ignore the bad ones. Think of what good characteristics they have in them- are they funny? Smart? Caring? This is helped a lot by Step #1- you can 'choose your attributes'. But if you can't choose your person, and you dislike that person, try to be a little more accepting of his/her ways. It'll be a lot easier if you can start off with a relatively good relationship with your 'love'. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Draw more attention to yourself when that person is around. When people have crushes on other people, they tend to be louder to try to get the attention of their crush. You'll want to imitate this. Talk louder, laugh louder, smile more, move a bit more when you're talking to other people. Make this change obvious to any looker-on."

Even if you aren't interested in the person romantically, you can still be friends. It'll make it seem much more realistic."
