      "content": "Remove your upper body clothing to get an accurate measurement. Clothing can get in the way of measuring reach properly. It can also make the measurement inaccurate or inconsistent. To get accurate, consistent measurements every time, take off your upper body clothing whenever you are measured. Females can still wear a sports bra, as this won't interfere with the measurement."

      "content": "Stretch your arms across your body to reach your peak flexibility. Lift 1 arm at a time and stretch it across your body until you feel a comfortable stretch. Hold your arm parallel to the floor as it crosses over your body and then repeat the exercise with your other arm. This provides a good stretch for both your arms and shoulders, which helps you to maximize your reach. [2] X Research source Stretching your arms and shoulders is the best way to release any tension in your shoulder joints and to prepare for the measurement."

      "title": "Straighten your arms against the wall at a 90° angle to your body.",
      "content": "Straighten your arms against the wall at a 90° angle to your body. Lift your arms up to create a straight line from your shoulders to your elbows and aim to get both of your arms at a right angle to your body. Make sure that your arms are parallel with the floor and that your shoulders feel loose and relaxed. It can be helpful to get your friend to check for you if your arms are parallel to the floor, as this is difficult to do without seeing. Alternatively, stand in front of a mirror while you are measuring your reach so that you can check your posture."

      "content": "Get your friend to mark the points that your middle fingers reach on the wall. Your friend needs to use a piece of chalk or a pencil to make the markings on the wall. Ensure that the points where your middle fingers hit the wall are measured and not any other fingers, as otherwise, this will give an inaccurate result.
