      "content": "Say, “Oh Allah! You are most forgiving, and You love to forgive, so forgive me.” There are no specific duas (prayers) for Laylat al-Qadr. [1] X Research source However, this particular dua about forgiveness is especially popular during Laylat al-Qadr. Allah is Al-Ghaffar, the Most Forgiving One, and since Laylat al-Qadr honors the moment Allah first revealed the Quran, it’s an ideal time to ask Him for forgiveness. [2] X Research source In Arabic, this supplication translates to “Allahumma Innaka` Afuwwun Tuhibbul` Afwa fa’fu Anni.” Alternatively, many people prefer to say, “Allahumma innaka `afuwwun tuhibbul `afwa fa`fu `annee”Allahumma innaka `afuwwun tuhibbul `afwa fa`fu `annee.” In English, “Oh Allah, You are pardoning and You love to pardon, so pardon me.”"

      "content": "Offer other devotional duas to Allah. Any prayer that brings you blessing on Laylat al-Qadr will be amplified 1,000 times, so make duas to Allah that demonstrate your desire for His mercy and love. Any dua that emphasizes your devotion will be heard, but these duas are especially popular for the holiday. [3] X Research source “Rabbanaa aatinaa fid dunya hasanah, wa fil aakhirati hasanah, waqinaa ‘adhaaban-naar.” In English, “Our Lord! Give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and save us from the torment of the Fire!” “Rabbanagh-firlee wa li waalidayya wa lil mu’mineena yawma yaqoomul hisaab.” In English, “Our Lord! Forgive me and my parents, and all the believers on the Day when the reckoning will be established.” “Rabbanaa innanaa aamannaa faghfirlana dhunoobana waqinaa ‘adhaaban-naar.” In English, “Our Lord! We have indeed believed, so forgive us our sins and save us from the punishment of the Fire.”"

      "content": "Make duas on the last 5 odd days of Ramadan to maximize blessings. It is unknown which specific day actually represents Laylat al-Qadr, since Allah took the knowledge from Mohammed after he received it. But we know that Laylat al-Qadr falls on an odd day. Pray on each of the 5 odd dates that occur in the last 10 days of Ramadan to amplify your blessings and sing His praise. Any supplication you make of Allah will be heard, so speak from the heart. [4] X Research source It is said that praying on the day of Laylat al-Qadr is better than praying for 1,000 months. This is why Muslims stay up so late during Laylat al-Qadr and pray so often. [5] X Research source Most Muslims will honor Laylat al-Qadar on one specific, symbolic day, but the 5 odd dates are all observed as holy days."

      "content": "Reflect on His blessings while reciting duas for Laylat al-Qadr. Laylat al-Qadr is the Holiest eve in all of Islam. On this night, Allah communicated the first verses of the Holy Quran. Meditate on everything that Allah has given you as you articulate each dua. Be thankful, ask for forgiveness, and pray. Your relationship with Allah is your own, so take this time to honor it in whatever way makes the most sense to you. [6] X Research source For duas you recite on the nature of mercy, consider how you have been shown compassion by Allah in the past year. As you are saved by Him, reflect on the various ways Allah has intervened in your life this year to save you from sin or harm."

Then, engage in your morning adhkar by reciting duas and praying at the break of dawn to honor Allah. Starting your morning on a pious note will ensure that Allah’s blessings are reflected upon you. [7] X Research source Adhkar will also protect you from evil throughout the day, which is especially important on Laylat al-Qadr.

Allah said that feeding a fasting person will send you rewards, and on Laylat al-Qadr, your blessings are multiplied! If you cannot practically feed someone, purchase food on their behalf and send it to them. [8] X Research source If you do not have anyone in your life you can purchase iftar for, donate to a charity that provides iftar for poor Muslims in need."

You might donate your time at a local Muslim organization, donate money to an international Islamic non-profit, or reach out to your elders to ask what you can do to help. Even the smallest act of kindness counts, so don’t hesitate to lend a hand to your brothers and sisters. [9] X Research source Remember, the Prophet said, “Your smile for your brother is a charity. Your removal of stones, thorns or bones from the paths of people is a charity. Your guidance of a person who is lost is a charity.” [10] X Research source"

If you have to work, go to school, or spend your day fulfilling other obligations, stay quiet and reflect on Allah’s presence and blessings. Meditate as you go about your day and let Allah into your heart. Even if you cannot actively recite duas, you might say them in your head to keep the words close to your heart. If you are going to interact with others, keep it as short and straightforward as possible."

It’s okay if you don’t spend multiple days there, but try to spend as much time at the mosque as you can. This practice is known as l’tikaf, and it’s a kind of spiritual retreat that should help you grow as a Muslim. Show up for communal prayer as often as you can."
