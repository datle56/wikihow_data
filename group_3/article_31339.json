      "content": "Pick a nickname with sentimental value that fits her personality. When considering a nickname, be considerate of your girlfriend's feelings. Use one that reflects your affection for her. And if your girlfriend doesn't like the nickname, respect her wishes and stop using it. Keep the nickname between the two of you as well; don't use it around other people. A good nickname should be: Personalized. Instead of something generic, consider your girlfriend's personality and what sorts of words come to mind when you think about her. Is there a nickname that captures a piece of her personality or one of her traits? Genuine. You love your girlfriend, so choose a nickname that shows it. Even if it's a little silly (or spicy), the nickname should be an expression of your true feelings for her. Specific to the relationship. Think about the inside jokes you have with your girlfriend or unique things you've done together and talked about often. A great nickname could also reference some part of your relationship. Kind and appropriate. It's okay to be funny or tease her a little as long as it's coming from a place of affection, but don't call her anything mean-spirited or actually make fun of her; it's disrespectful. Also, don't call her anything too inappropriate; it should be something you could say in public without causing a scandal!"
