      "title": "Take your cuttings in late summer or early fall for the best results.",
      "content": "Take your cuttings in late summer or early fall for the best results. Wait for the weather to be cool and dry, with nighttime temperatures averaging around 60 °F (16 °C) or higher. This is usually between the months of August and October. [2] X Research source Cactus cuttings are mostly likely to thrive in sunny climates with warm daytime temperatures. Don’t try to root a cactus if you live in a place that’s cold all the time."

      "content": "Slide on a pair of gloves to protect your hands. Since you’re handling a fully-grown piece of cactus, protect your fingers from pricks or cuts by wearing a pair of sturdy gloves. If you don’t have gloves on hand, wrap your fingers with medical tape instead. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut off a healthy 4 in (10 cm) stem at a 45-degree angle.",
      "content": "Cut off a healthy 4 in (10 cm) stem at a 45-degree angle. Wipe down the surface of a serrated knife with a diluted bleach solution to get rid of any germs or bacteria, then slice off a short piece of cactus that’s a little over 4 in (10 cm) long. If you’re using a padded cactus, slice through the joint that’s connecting both of the pads. [4] X Research source The bleach solution needs to be a 1:10 ratio of bleach to water. Don’t use pruning shears to remove the cutting, as this could make it harder for the cactus to grow and propagate in the long run. Trim away any smaller leaves attached to the bottom of the cutting so you can plant it more easily."

      "title": "Slice off any offsets growing from the cactus.",
      "content": "Slice off any offsets growing from the cactus. Note that some cacti plants sprout pups or offsets, which are small growths emerging from the side of the plant. Use a knife to cut this smaller growth, or “pup,” from the main plant. Try to leave at least a few millimeters of stem attached to the main plant whenever you remove a pup. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Dust the exposed end of the cutting with a rooting compound.",
      "content": "Dust the exposed end of the cutting with a rooting compound. Visit a gardening store or online shop to purchase a special rooting compound or powder, which helps the cutting to heal properly. Dip the freshly cut end of the cactus in a bowl of rooting hormone (also known as rooting compound). [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Let the cutting sit for a week or so until a callus forms.",
      "content": "Let the cutting sit for a week or so until a callus forms. Find a flat, dry space to place your cactus cutting so it can air-dry. Monitor the plant on a regular basis to see if a hardened coating or callus develops along the cut end. As you check, make sure that the bottom is completely dry before doing anything with the plant. [8] X Research source You can leave your cactus in a well-lit or dark area, as long as the plant stays dry. Don’t be alarmed if you don’t see a callus form right away! In extreme cases, it might take months for a full callus to form. The callus will look very light green and be completely dry to the touch. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Fill a planting pot with a special propagation mixture or cactus medium.",
      "content": "Fill a planting pot with a special propagation mixture or cactus medium. Mix equal parts of perlite or pumice with compost or peat to create a healthy growing environment for your cactus cutting. Once you’ve created this mixture, pour it into a planting pot. [10] X Research source Unlike other plants, succulents need some inorganic material in the soil to root successfully."

      "title": "Insert the bottom third of the cutting into the soil and gently pack soil around it.",
      "content": "Insert the bottom third of the cutting into the soil and gently pack soil around it. Place the cutting so it stands upright in your planting pot. Aim to cover the bottom third or half of the plant with soil mixture to prevent the cactus from tipping over. Lightly press soil around it to keep the cutting standing upright. [11] X Research source If you’re working with a columnar cactus, you might need to cover even more of the plant with soil."

      "title": "Place the pot in an area that gets indirect sunlight and partial shade.",
      "content": "Place the pot in an area that gets indirect sunlight and partial shade. Find an outdoor area with indirect sunlight, preferably near overhanging trees. If possible, arrange your cutting beneath the branches of a tree, which provides an equal amount of shade and sunlight. [12] X Research source Make sure that your cactus cuttings get a consistent amount of partial sunlight throughout the day."

    {
      "title": "Water the cutting once every few days when the soil feels dry.",
      "content": "Water the cutting once every few days when the soil feels dry. Pour water over the base of the plant to nourish the new cutting. Try to use fresh or distilled water for this, as this can help bacteria from developing around your plant. After this, water the plant every 3-4 days to keep the soil lightly moist. [13] X Research source If your water has a lot of chlorine in it, use distilled water instead."

      "title": "Wait several weeks for signs of new growth.",
      "content": "Wait several weeks for signs of new growth. Keep an eye on your cutting to see how much progress it has made. Wait 3-4 weeks for your cutting to develop substantial roots. Specifically, check the top of the plant to see if it looks any taller or wider than when you first planted it. [15] X Research source You can leave the cuttings in the container for up to 1 year.

      "content": "Transfer the rooted cactus to a new pot. Fill a pot with a mixture of a gritty planting substance, like pumice, as well as some compost. Use a spoon and a pair of tweezers to lift and remove the developing seedling from its original location and plant it in the pot. If needed, fill in the area around the cactus with soil.
