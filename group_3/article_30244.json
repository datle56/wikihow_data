      "content": "Juice the lemons and limes. Cut the lemons and limes in half. Use a citrus reamer or juicer to remove the juice from all the citrus halves. Transfer the juice to a large plastic or glass drink pitcher. [1] X Research source Each lemon or lime contains about 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of juice, so you'll need roughly eight lemons and eight limes to produce a cup (235 ml) each of juice. [2] X Research source Instead of fresh juice, you can also use drink crystals to flavor the sports drink."

      "content": "Dissolve the sugar and salt in the citrus juice. Pour the sugar and salt into the pitcher with the freshly squeezed citrus juice. Stir the mixture to combine the ingredients, and set the liquid aside for about 10 minutes. This will give the acid in the juice time to dissolve the sugar and salt. Most commercial sports drinks contain about 6 percent carbohydrates, which is why you need this specific quantity of sugar per 2 liters (2.1 quarts) of liquid. This concentration helps your body absorb the water faster."

      "content": "Zest the lemons. Rinse the lemons under running water and scrub the peel with a vegetable brush or cloth. Pat the lemons dry. Use a vegetable or citrus peeler to remove the yellow zest. Avoid removing the white pith, as this is very bitter. Transfer the zest to a small ceramic or metal bowl. You can also use a sharp knife to zest the lemons if you don’t have a vegetable peeler. You can use any type or combination of citrus zest in place of the lemon, such as a combination of orange and grapefruit. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Combine the sugar and lemon zest. Pour the sugar into the bowl with the lemon zest and stir the mixture to coat the zest with sugar. Pound the zest gently with a pestle or muddler for about five minutes. This will help the citrus to release its oils. After five minutes of muddling, set the bowl aside and let the zest marinate in the sugar for an hour. The citrus oil and sugar mixture liquid this will produce is called oleo-saccharum, which was often used in cocktails in the nineteenth century. [6] X Research source"

[8] X Research source Instead of dried ginseng root, you can also use ginseng tea bags. It’s important to add the caffeine and taurine powder to the tea now, because you want them to dissolve in the boiling water. [9] X Research source"

[11] X Research source When divided into four servings, each one-cup (250-ml) serving of caffeinated energy drink contains 80 mg of caffeine and 1 g of taurine, just like the commercial version.
