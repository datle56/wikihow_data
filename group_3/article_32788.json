The Ping command operates virtually identically on all systems. If using Windows, you can open Command Prompt, Windows PowerShell, or Terminal (depending on your Windows version). If you're on Windows 10, right-click the Windows icon in your taskbar and click Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell . If you're on Windows 11, right-click the Windows icon in your taskbar and click Terminal . If you're on an older version of Windows, type cmd into the taskbar search bar or Start menu and open Command Prompt . This also works on Windows 10 and 11. If using Mac OS, open the Terminal. Open your Applications folder, and then open the Utilities folder. Select Terminal . If using Linux, open a Terminal window. It is most often found in the Accessories folder in your Applications directory. In Ubuntu and most other Linux distributions, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + T to open the Terminal."

If this fails, your TCP/IP is not functioning correctly, and your network adapter needs to be reconfigured. [6] X Research source Check your wireless connection or the connection from your PC to your router, especially if it was working previously. Most PC network ports have an indicator light that indicates a good connection and one that blinks as data is transferred. As the ping command transmits packets at about 1 per second, you should be able to see the data light blink. Check that the router has the proper indicator lights (and no faults), including the one that indicates a good connection to your PC. If a fault indicator is on, follow the cable from your PC to the router to make sure it is properly connected, then call your cable or broadband provider if necessary."

It does require all of the hardware, gateways, routers, firewalls, name servers, and intermediate hosts to be working. If the ping is successful and you cannot access the target host with a browser or other application, it's most likely not your problem."

On Linux and macOS, this sends the number of packets and then stops. The other way to stop a ping is to press Control + C . This option is convenient for scripts that periodically check network behavior. On Windows, use ping -n instead. ping -t <ip address> . Runs the ping command continuously until you stop it. ping -w <timeout in milliseconds> <ip address> . Specifies how long to wait for a response before the packet is declared to be timed out or lost. Ping with a longer timeout to identify latency problems, for example, ping -w 10000 . ping -s <packet size> <ip address> . Specifies the size of each packet sent (in bytes). This option is not available on Windows. ping -f <ip address> . Flood with packets as fast as possible. This is used to stress test the performance of a network. This option is not available on Windows. ping /? (Windows) or man ping (Mac/Linux). Displays additional ping options, syntax, and help."
