If you’re playing in teams of 2, take turns throwing the ball each time you get a turn. [1] X Research source Beer pong can be played on a table of any size, but if you want to make your own , tables are traditionally 8 feet (2.4 m) long x 4 feet (1.2 m) wide."

Then, pour beer into the cups until each one has been filled about halfway. To drink more responsibly and avoid spreading germs, consider filling each cup up with water instead. Then, take a drink from your own beer can each time a shot is made. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill a bucket with clean water to rinse balls before throwing. While sanitation isn't exactly the cornerstone of beer pong, nobody wants to drink a tainted cup of beer. Have a bucket of clean water handy so players can rinse their balls before throwing and keep paper towels nearby to soak up spills. [3] X Research source You can also designate 2 additional 16 oz (450 g) cups as “water cups” and keep one on either side of the table. But label the water cups clearly so players don’t accidentally sip them after they’ve had a bit to drink."

      "content": "Arrange the plastic cups into a 10-cup triangle at each end of the table. Assemble the triangles so each top point is facing the opposing team. There will be 1 cup in the first row, 2 in the second row, 3 in the third row, and the base of the triangle will have 4 cups. Pack the cups cups closely together so they’re all touching. Do not tilt the cups. [4] X Research source The base of each triangle should start about 1 in (2.5 cm) from each edge of the table. You can play with 6 cups or 15 cups instead, depending on how long you want the game to last."

      "content": "Determine who goes first. Many games are started by a member of each team playing rock, paper, scissors. Winners go first. Another variation to choose who goes first is playing “eye-to-eye.” To do this, try to make a cup while maintaining eye contact with your opponent. The first player to land a cup goes first. You can also flip a coin . [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Take turns throwing the balls into cups. Each team gets to throw one ball per turn. The goal is to throw the ball into a cup of the opposing team. Throw the ball directly into a cup or bounce a ball off of the table into a cup. Just keep your elbows behind the table when you throw, otherwise the point won’t count! [6] X Research source Try to arc the ball when you throw. It is more likely to land in a cup. Aim for a cluster of cups as opposed to the edges of the triangle. Try throwing underhand or overhand and see which works best for you."

If you’re playing in teams of two, alternate the drinking between you and your partner—if you drink the first cup, let your partner drink the second. Set the cup aside once you drink it. [7] X Research source Do not throw again until a player has finished all the beer in their cup and removed it from play."

This process, called “re-racking,” will make shooting easier for everyone. Only re-rack if your side has lost the appropriate amount of cups. Re-racks often occur at different turns for each side, depending on how many balls have been sunk by each player. Some players include an additional re-rack each game. The re-rack may be when there are 6 cups remaining (with a triangle in a 3-2-1 formation) or in whatever shape the player requests. Check with your game’s players beforehand to determine what works for you. [8] X Research source"

The first player or side to do this wins the game. [10] X Research source Sometimes, players will offer a “redemption” after a team makes a winning shot. In “redemption,” the losing team is allowed to toss once more. If they land the ball into a cup, the winning team’s toss is canceled and the game resumes. A redemption is different from a “rebuttal,” which is another rule variation."

After the turn is completed, the opposite team throws at the first team's cups, and the process repeats. [11] X Research source If both your team’s balls land in the same cup, remove an extra cup from your opponent’s side."

If you miss your target and it goes in the wrong cup, it counts as a miss, and that cup remains on the table. [12] X Research source Another variation on this style, called “Island,” allows players to call 1 cup per game. If you make the cup you call, remove 1 extra cup from your opponent’s side. If you miss, do nothing. [13] X Research source"

In this variation, give the opposing team 1 last turn; this turn is called a “rebuttal.” The opposing team keeps shooting until they miss, at which time the game is over. If the opposing team makes the ball into all of the winning teams’ cups in their last turn, then a 3-cup overtime is played. Now, the teams compete in sudden death to figure out the final winner. [14] X Research source In a 3-cup overtime, arrange your 3 cups into a triangle shape with 2 cups at the base and 1 cup at the point."

If you land your beer pong ball into a cup by bouncing it, choose which additional cup you would like to be removed. [15] X Research source A lot of players use this rule variation, with the additional rule that players are allowed to swat the ball away after it has bounced on the table. Some rule variations count each bounce as an additional cup to be removed. Therefore, if your ball bounced twice before landing in a cup, you would select 2 cups to be removed. If it bounced 3 times, you would select 3, and so on."
