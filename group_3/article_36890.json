If your lens has heavy/severe discoloration with apparent scratches/imperfections, this requires a rougher grit sandpaper, like the 600 grit. If the headlight lens has light discoloration with no apparent scratches, start with at 2500 grit. Whichever grit you use, you want to wet the sandpaper in a bucket or cup of soapy water. [5] X Research source Wet the rag with a commercial plastic lens cleaner or degreaser. Make sure you wet the rag instead of spraying the headlight; this keeps the spray from getting on the paint. Wash the lens with a clean rag or a shop towel."

Fold the sandpaper in three around the Soft Hand Pad Or Sanding Sponge. Dip the sponge and sandpaper into the soapy water.
