      "content": "Go over the stain with a dry erase marker. Trace over the entire permanent marker stain with a dry erase marker. Let it sit for a minute or so, then wipe over it with a whiteboard eraser or microfiber towel . This should take off most, if not all, of the permanent marker. If any remains, rub it with some rubbing alcohol to remove it. [1] X Research source This method works on most non-porous surfaces, including whiteboards and stainless steel. It should also work to remove permanent marker from metal water bottles. Board cleaner or permanent marker remover can also get rid of permanent marker stains on whiteboards ."

      "content": "Apply rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover. Dampen a microfiber towel or cotton ball with a bit of alcohol or nail polish remover, then rub the stain to wipe it away. If the stain is particularly large, put your chosen cleaning agent in a spray bottle and spray the area, starting from the top and wiping to catch any drips. [2] X Research source Rubbing alcohol wipes or alcohol-based hand sanitizers also work for this method. Another option is to apply essential oil extracts, like lemon or eucalyptus . Rub the area with oil and let it sit for a few minutes before wiping away. Note that concentrated oils can potentially damage painted or dyed surfaces. Cooking oil is a gentler option."

      "content": "Spray hairspray on the stain. The ingredients in alcohol-based hairsprays are often effective at dissolving stains. Simply spray the affected area, then blot it clean with a cloth or paper towel. Repeat the process as needed until the permanent marker is completely gone. [3] X Research source While this is safe for most metals and plastics, the chemicals in some hairsprays may damage certain polymers. Test it in an inconspicuous area before using."

      "content": "Make a baking soda paste. Add a few drops of water to some baking soda to create a thick paste. Scoop some onto a toothbrush and scrub the stained area. Then, rinse with clean water and pat the surface dry. Repeat as needed until the stain is completely gone. [4] X Research source For tough stains on hard plastic, dampen a cloth with hydrogen peroxide and sprinkle the stain with baking soda. Rub and blot the stain until it’s removed, then wash the plastic in warm, soapy water. Wear gloves and work in a well-ventilated space when handling hydrogen peroxide."

      "title": "Try dishwashing liquid.",
      "content": "Try dishwashing liquid. Dish soap can break down the components of permanent markers so they can be washed away with soap and water. Rub some liquid dish soap directly onto the stain on a non-porous surface. Dampen a clean cloth or towel and scrub the area until the stain lifts. This will likely take some elbow grease, so repeat the process as needed. If the stain is particularly stubborn, mix 1 tbsp of dish soap, 1 tbsp of white vinegar, and 2 cups of cold water. [5] X Research source If you try this repeatedly and fail to wash it away, it could potentially damage metal. For another gentle option, try rubbing the stain with a pencil eraser. This won’t always be enough for stubborn stains, but it might make them a bit lighter."

Spray sunscreen seems to work best, but bottled sunscreen can also work well. Simply spray or squirt a little of the sunscreen over the stain and use a clean cloth to work it into the stain. [6] X Research source Other ways to remove permanent marker from plastics include commercial products like Goo-Gone or magic erasers."

      "content": "Spray most fabrics with hairspray. If your everyday clothes or fabrics got stained with permanent marker, an easy solution is to spray the stain with an alcohol-based hairspray. Apply the hairspray directly onto the fabric and let it soak in for a few minutes. Then, wash the item in the washing machine. [7] X Research source Be sure to check the care tag on your clothes. If they can’t be washed in a washing machine, hand wash them with cold water. If they’re dry-clean only, take them to a dry cleaner."

      "content": "Use rubbing alcohol or acetone on sturdy fabrics. Stains on sturdier fabric, such as towels and sheets, can be removed with a little acetone or rubbing alcohol. Simply pour a little of either of these liquids onto a clean cotton ball and use this to dab at the stain until it disappears. Wash the items immediately. [8] X Research source This method may also work on softer fabrics, like clothing. Blot the stain from the back to avoid spreading it more deeply. Rubbing alcohol wipes are another effective option."

[10] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source For more fragile fabrics, dilute the citrus juice to half strength with water first.

      "title": "Use bleach to remove permanent marker from white fabrics.",
      "content": "Use bleach to remove permanent marker from white fabrics. Bleach discolors dyes and other colors, making them lighter or white, so this method should only be used on white fabrics. Dilute a very small amount of bleach in water and dip the stained part of the clothing into the liquid. The stain may come off immediately or may require soaking. Once the stain is gone, wash the item immediately as you normally would. [11] X Research source If you need to soak the item, just keep an eye on the fabric to ensure the bleach doesn't begin to dissolve it."

      "content": "Try rubbing alcohol, nail polish remover, or oil-free hairspray. Dampen a clean, white cloth with your choice of rubbing alcohol, nail polish remover, or oil-free hairspray , then gently dab—don’t rub—the affected area until the stain is completely removed. When the cloth becomes saturated in ink, swap it out for a clean one to prevent the ink from spreading. Repeat as needed, then dry the area with a clean, dry cloth. [12] X Research source While these are typically safe to use on carpet and upholstery, test them in an inconspicuous area first to make sure they don’t damage or discolor the fabric. Rubbing alcohol works well with canvas, chenille, corduroy, cotton, linen, and velvet upholstery. Hairspray works particularly well for leather upholstery. Once the stain has disappeared, clean off any hairspray residue with a clean, damp cloth and work a little leather conditioner into the furniture. In some cases, Windex can also remove permanent marker stains from upholstery. Just be sure to test it in a hidden area first."

Then, for natural fibers, wait 15 minutes, then dab the area with warm soapy water. Wait another 15 minutes, then blot it dry with a warm, wet cloth. For synthetic fibers, use a cleaning solvent or acetone-based nail polish remover in place of the soapy water.

Wipe away the residue with a damp cloth and repeat as needed. [19] X Research source If you don’t have toothpaste to spare, mix some baking soda with a few drops of water to create a similar paste. Apply it the same way. Toothpaste that already contains baking soda also works. House cleaning expert Guy Peters says, “Toothpaste is my favorite method for removing permanent marker from hardwood, and it works well for both finished and unfinished wood. Stick with toothpastes that include baking soda (Arm & Hammer is the best) and avoid gel toothpastes since they won’t work at all.” Peters also says, “While toothpaste is pretty mild, you’ll still want to test it in a hidden area first.”"
