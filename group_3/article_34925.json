Explore any challenges they’ve faced and what they’ve done to get where they are today. Show them you’re genuinely curious about them and want to learn from their experiences! [2] X Research source What professional experience(s) led you to your current position? What first got you interested in this field/industry? What’s one thing you wish you’d known when you were just starting out or at the level of experience I am? What skills have been most valuable to you throughout your career?

Express interest in them beyond just their career. The goal is to establish an amicable relationship and treat the mentorship as more than a transaction without getting overly personal. [3] X Research source How are you feeling today? What’s new since the last time we met? What do you do to stay motivated? Are you currently working toward any goals? Is there anything new or exciting going on right now? What do you find inspiration in? What sort of goals are on your bucket list? What sort of hobbies do you enjoy outside of work hours?"

Ask questions that’ll help you determine the goals you need to meet for career success and questions that’ll tell your mentor where you ultimately want your career to go. For example: [4] X Research source How did you define your goals at the start of your career? What’s your idea of career success? Knowing my career goals, how would you recommend I prioritize them?

A mentor can help you pinpoint those weaker areas or which skills you’re currently lacking and might want to improve on. They can also help you further develop those skills and may give you some especially valuable insights. What are my strengths? How can I use them to further my career journey? What are the most sought-after skills in the industry right now? What skill gaps do I need to address most? How can I apply and practice skills in my current job?

Odds are they’ve had to deal with a similar problem themselves—so they can act as your guide and coach you through the issue. They might even help you find a solution you haven’t thought of yet. I’ve been given a job offer. Do you think I should accept it? I want to transfer to a new job within my company. What should I do? How should I ask for a raise? I know some of my coworkers are being paid more than me. I’ve been trying to navigate a problematic coworker, but I’m having trouble. How would you approach the situation?

And the more open you are, the better the feedback you’ll get! What could I do to improve my communication skills? (Or any other skill—organization, time management, productivity, etc.) How often should I ask my supervisor for feedback? Based on the goals I shared, what areas do you recommend I work on and improve? What weaknesses have you noticed I have? How could I work on them or turn them into strengths? What could I have done differently in [this situation] that could’ve led to a better result? Can you recommend any books or guides to help me hone a skill I’m struggling with?"

What should I know about this organization that could help me advance my career? Is there someone at this organization you find particularly inspiring? Why?

If they have a professional profile on LinkedIn, check it out! See what comes up when you search for them on Google or the website of the company they work for. This research can give you a better picture of their experience and what sort of knowledge they can offer that’ll help you, specifically.

We’ve already talked about goals a little—but it’s essential to consider them before the mentorship even begins, at least when it comes to what you want your mentor to help you with. Why do you need a mentor? What do you hope they can coach you on, and how does that align with wherever you ultimately want to take your career? [8] X Research source For example, you might want a mentor to help you in your current role at work or to help you get a promotion (or teach you how to be more of a leader). Maybe there’s even a particular skill your mentor can teach you that’s integral to your desired career. When you know what your career goals are, it can help you ask more helpful questions—and it can help your mentor better understand how to guide you."

Hold yourself responsible for the relationship between you and your mentor; you’re asking them for help, so it’s also your job to drive the mentorship forward. Consider when (and how often) you want to meet, how you want to keep in touch, and how long you want the mentorship to last. Once you’ve nailed down the details, also communicate them to your mentor. [9] X Research source For example, do you want a mentor for a month or so? Do you want their help with a specific issue, or do you want the mentorship to continue for longer? How do you want to check in? Can you meet somewhere to chat, such as their office or a cafe, or would you prefer a virtual video call?

It can be a little uncomfortable to hear feedback from someone else, but when it’s coming from your mentor, remember that they have your best interests at heart. They’re trying to help! Rather than getting defensive, accept and implement the feedback they give you. Try to think of constructive criticism from your mentor as an opportunity.

      "content": "Ask open-ended questions. Open-ended questions require an answer longer than “yes” or “no,” which creates a longer and more open discussion between the two of you. You don’t have to force a conversation, and it won’t help to ask questions you already know the answer to—so try to ask informative questions that’ll help you learn and listen to your mentor’s answers earnestly.

Mentorship is “very important because it allows you to form a connection with someone you trust who has gone before you and can provide some pathway for you to move forward,” says Pachence. In short, a mentor can set the wheels of your career in motion and define its future. Other benefits include: Advice and insights. A mentor can point out any weak spots you might need to improve to make progress—and help you do exactly that. Support. Whether you need to make an important decision or work toward a big career goal, a mentor can offer guidance that’ll help you navigate any challenge. Connections. Mentors naturally have many industry connections. When you have a mentor, they can introduce you to professionals you might not have known otherwise—people who may be able to offer additional guidance. Leadership experience. On the mentor’s end, having a mentee can be great for them, too! They’ll gain experience in instructing others and learn more about younger generations of professionals."

What are your goals for this mentorship? What would you want the legacy of your career to look like? What motivates you at work? What are the greatest challenges you’re dealing with right now? Where do you see yourself professionally in 5 years? What are your greatest professional challenges right now?"
