      "content": "Turn the power off at the circuit breaker for safety. Locate your circuit breaker, likely either in the basement, a closet, or even outside the house. Open the circuit breaker and turn the power off for the room where you’ll be working with the ceiling fan to make sure electricity isn’t still flowing when you’re removing the fan’s parts. If you’re not sure which switch is for the room with the ceiling fan, turn off the main power just to be safe."

Unscrew the light bulbs carefully and place them on a towel nearby. If the ceiling fan has any sconces or globes, remove these as well by unscrewing them or using a screwdriver to remove any screws.

The ceiling fan’s fixture, or the main housing where the wiring is stored, will be held together with a few visible screws. Use a screwdriver to take out these screws, loosening the fixture to see the wiring and switch. [2] X Research source Set the screws and detachable fixture piece aside in a safe place to reattach them later. If there are no visible screws, look for spring clips or a “U” shaped metal wire. Pinch the two ends of the clip together to remove the light fixture."

      "content": "Pull out the switch to inspect the chain more closely. Now that the switch is loosened from the fixture, look at it up close. If the wiring of the switch is broken, replace it completely. Leverage the switch open using a screwdriver to see if the chain just needs to be replaced with a longer piece, or if it would be best to get a new switch all together. [4] X Research source If the chain looks replaceable, use a longer length of chain you already have to fix it instead of purchasing another one. If the switch looks broken, visit a local hardware store to buy a replacement."
