Meat and poultry can be frozen in the store packaging but it is advisable to over-wrap the packaging to make sure no air can enter the package. Use plastic bags and heavy-duty aluminum foil specially designed for freezer use (the label will tell you) to over-wrap.

[2] X Research source Vacuum sealers come in a variety of models and prices and use special bags (sold separately) to store food. [3] X Research source Use air-tight containers such as plastic or freezer-safe jars and cans. Use wraps such as heavyweight aluminum foil, plastic freezer bags or polyethylene wrap and bags. Remove as many bones as possible before freezing as bones take up space and can contribute to freezer burn.

Uncooked ground meat can only be kept safely for 3-4 months. Cooked meat can be stored for 2-3 months. [6] X Research source Hotdogs, ham, and lunch meats can be frozen for 1-2 months. Poultry (uncooked turkey and chicken, as well as cooked turkey and chicken) can be kept for 3-12 months. Wild game can be kept for 8-12 months. Make sure to maintain a freezer or cooler temperature of 0 °F (−18 °C) or below."

      "title": "Be sure to label all containers and packages.",
      "content": "Be sure to label all containers and packages. You need to know what is in the freezer and how old it is. The label should contain the type of meat (chicken breast, steak, ground beef, etc.), whether it is raw or cooked, and the date it was frozen. To help you find things later, it is a good idea to group like items together. For example, put all the chicken together, all the beef together, all the pork together. Use the oldest items first to avoid having to discard out of date or freezer-burned food."

      "content": "Use an electric freezer to store meat. [7] X Research source This is one of the easiest ways to preserve meat. You can use the freezer compartment that is attached to your refrigerator or use a stand-alone freezer. Stand-alone freezers are larger than the compartment on a refrigerator. Be aware that a freezer does use electricity so your energy bills will be higher if you use a stand-alone freezer in addition to your refrigerator. The cost increase will depend on the size of the freezer and how energy-efficient the model is."

      "content": "Use a cooler if you do not have an electric freezer. [8] X Research source Coolers can be used anywhere as they do not require electricity. You can use a cooler if you are camping or if you need to store meat during an electrical outage. You will need to fill the cooler with ice to make it cold. Place some ice on the bottom of the cooler, put in the meat, then cover the meat with more ice. Make sure the meat is surrounded by ice to ensure complete and even freezing. If you use a cooler you will need to replace the ice as it melts to make sure the meat does not thaw before you are ready to use it."

      "title": "Know how to thaw meat.",
      "content": "Know how to thaw meat. Thawing properly will help reduce the chance of food-borne illness. Thaw meat in the refrigerator. Plan ahead as large items such as turkeys will take about 24 hours to thaw this way. Thaw by submerging the meat (in air-tight packaging) in cold water. Change the water every 30 minutes until completely thawed. You can thaw meat in a microwave but be sure to cook it immediately. Microwaves thaw unevenly and may start to cook parts of the meat. Before cooking, look for freezer burn. Freezer burn is the discoloration of meat due to freezing and does not necessarily make the meat inedible. Cut off freezer-burned portions before consuming. Use common sense. If the meat or poultry looks or smells “off” do not eat it."

[9] X Expert Source Jillian Fae Downing Private Event Chef & Chef Educator Expert Interview. 2 September 2021. Use curing salt which can be purchased online through retailers such as butcher-packer.com, mortonsalt.com, and sausagemaker.com. Place pieces of meat in air-tight storage jars (or plastic storage bags), making sure to fully cover the meat with salt. Alternate layers of meat and salt to ensure all parts of the meat are covered in salt. [10] X Research source Keep the jars/bags in a cool place (36-40 degrees Fahrenheit) for a month. Do not allow to freeze. [11] X Research source Determine how long to salt cure meat using this formula: 7 days per inch of thickness. For example, a 12-14 pound ham which is 5 inches thick will need to cure for 35 days. Salt cured meat can last 3-4 months without refrigeration if kept in air-tight packaging such as plastic bags. You will want to rinse the excess salt off the meat before cooking. [12] X Research source"

[15] X Expert Source Jillian Fae Downing Private Event Chef & Chef Educator Expert Interview. 2 September 2021. Smoke the meat in a smoker at 145 °F (62.8 °C) for 7 hours or 155 degrees Fahrenheit for 4 hours. Do not exceed 155 °F (68.3 °C) as this will cook the meat, not dry or smoke it. Some cuts of meat will take longer. For example, a brisket may take 22 hours to smoke thoroughly. [16] X Research source Use a meat thermometer to make sure the meat reaches a safe temperature before removing from the smoker. Poultry should reach an internal temperature of 165 °F (73.9 °C); pork and ground meats should be 160 °F (71.1 °C); steaks, roasts and chops should be 145 °F (62.8 °C). [17] X Research source Commercial smokers use gas, electricity, charcoal or wood. [18] X Research source Add wood such as mesquite, hickory, oak or cherry to add flavor to the meat.

      "content": "Use the proper tools for canning. Make sure you have a pressure canner and canning jars. Use a pressure canner (also known as a pressure cooker) to regulate the pressure during the canning process. [20] X Research source Use good quality canning jars such as Mason jars. [21] X Research source Hot, high-pressure steam cooks, seals and sterilizes the meat in the canning jars. Fill the canner with 2-3 inches of water. Start timing the canning process once the pressure gauge reaches the desired level. Once the process is complete, remove the canner from heat and allow to cool. Do not open until fully cool and depressurized naturally. Forcing cooling by running cold water on the canner can result in food spoilage and warping of the canner lid. Canned food stored in a cool, dry place can last up to a year.
