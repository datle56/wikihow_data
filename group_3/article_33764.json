      "content": "Determine where you want to construct a concrete patio, how large it will be, and its exact dimensions. The size of the patio determines the amount of concrete required and whether you will need a mixer. If the patio is too large in area, it might not be an easy DIY job. The location is also important. You want to choose a mostly even area so you don't have to level the uneven ground before you lay the concrete. Check local building codes to find out if a permit is required, how far the patio has to be from property and house lines, or any other county or city regulations. Before you dig anywhere in your yard, find out where septic tanks, underground lines, or other utilities are located."

The stakes and string will give you a good picture of how the patio will fit in your back yard. Adjust the area if needed. Cutting the stakes to a pointed end may make them easier to drive into the ground. [1] X Research source If the ground is uneven, you have two choices: build up the low side or dig the high side out.

      "content": "Decide if you want your patio to be level with the ground or raised. Dig 4 inches (about 10 cm) deep for raised and 8 inches (20.3 cm) deep for level. Compact the earth if necessary. If you're planning on having something extremely heavy such as a brick barbecue on your patio, your first step will be to pour a concrete foundation for added stability."

[3] X Expert Source Alberto DeJesus Construction Specialist Expert Interview. 15 December 2021. Ensure the gravel or crushed rock is compacted and laid evenly. Fluctuation in the height of the base can cause shifting or cracking in the patio over time."

      "content": "Drive stakes around the new perimeter of your patio, spaced at least 2 feet (.6 m) apart. These stakes should be slightly outside your original stakes. They will be used in a later step to help support the outer edge of your patio. Make sure the stakes are firmly embedded in the ground. Patios need to slope to allow for water runoff. The standard slope is 1/8\" per foot. Check your local building codes for the exact slope dimensions. Don't underestimate the heaviness of wet concrete. Use very sturdy wood or it could bend or even break under the weight. Consider using steel concrete forms to avoid this problem."

      "content": "Nail the 2x4 to the stakes. The stakes are the form's support so it doesn't bend against the concrete. Make sure the stakes, nails, and forms are sturdy. Use nails that are long and strong enough. You can also use screws instead of nails. This requires a screwdriver. While you are nailing each four forms to the stakes, make sure the forms are level. Use the string or a level to ensure the forms are level. If the forms are not level, you might end up with uneven concrete."

If pouring concrete next to a house, other slab of concrete, or other structure, place an isolation joint between the concrete and the existing surface. [5] X Research source An isolation joint allows the concrete to move and minimizes cracking. Isolation joints are usually made by adhering asphalt-impregnated fiber sheeting or Iso-strip-off to the wall or surface your concrete will touch. The adhering asphalt-impregnated fiber sheeting and Iso-strip-off can be found at most home improvement stores. [6] X Research source"

Multiply the thickness, the width, and the height of the area to determine how many bags you will need. You can also use a concrete calculator like this . If mixing by hand, you can put the concrete mix into a mortar tub or a wheelbarrow. Mix with a shovel or a hoe. Make sure that when mixing concrete by hand you wear gloves and protective eye wear. If using a mixer, make sure you can move the mixer into the area where you are building the patio. Do this before you begin the project. The amount of concrete needed for the project should determine whether you can mix by hand or with a mixer."

Make sure the ramp does not move or disturb the forms. Ramps can be made with 2x4s or other long pieces of wood. Getting help from others will help with this step. Have someone shovel out the concrete as you hold the wheelbarrow."

When the concrete can support your weight, cut grooves in the concrete every 8 feet (2.4 m). These are control joints that help if the concrete shifts or changes over time. The final step is to hand float the concrete with a steel or magnesium float to finish smoothing the surface out."
