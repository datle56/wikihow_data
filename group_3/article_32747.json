      "content": "Get help if your dog is heavy. Most people should avoid lifting a dog of 40 pounds or greater by themselves. Every person will have his own weight limit for lifting , so please think of the safety of your pet and yourself when deciding to pick up your dog. Animals will struggle more if they feel like they may fall because they are not supported properly or you are fumbling to hold body parts."

      "content": "Pick up small dogs properly. Even if your dog weighs less than 20 pounds, it's important to pick him up carefully. Locate your dog's chest right behind the dog’s front legs. Support the dog here when you start to lift. Use your right hand to hold on to the dog’s collar or leash. This keeps him from running away and lets you control his head. Bring your left arm over the top of your dog’s back and lift him from under the chest. Bring the dog under your left arm or “wing.” Hold him to your body to minimize wiggling."

      "content": "Lift heavier dogs with care. If your dog weighs more than 20 pounds, pick him up with one hand under his neck and the other scooped under his rump. At the same time, lift like you're lifting a board. For dogs over 40 pounds, get another person to help. One person will be at the head of the dog with one arm under the neck and the other under the chest. The other person gets a hand under the belly and their other hand scoops under the rump. Lift at the same time. The person at the head of the dog will “call the shots” and give directions when to lift at the same time. For instance, you can count to “three” and lift the dog together on “3.”"

      "content": "Learn how to lift a dog in a special circumstance. For a dog in advanced pregnancy, one that has an obviously distended abdomen, avoid the belly area. Lift from under her neck/chest and under the rump. Or, if you suspect your dog has an injured back, lift the dog keeping its back completely level and straight from under the neck and the rump. Definitely get another person to help. This will keep everyone safe."

      "title": "Keep your body in the correct position when lifting.",
      "content": "Keep your body in the correct position when lifting. Don’t forget to bend at the knees and lift with your legs. Don't bend over the dog to protect your back from injury. Place your arms around your pet to securely lift the dog. Bending your knees will bring you closer to the dog’s level. This means you won't be leaning over the dog which most dogs find frightening."

      "content": "Pick up your dog when he's relaxed. Try to avoid picking up your dog when he's jumping all around and wiggly. You may have to work on training your dog to be calm. Establish a routine and begin short training sessions. Begin by keeping your dog in a seated position for several minutes. Gradually teach him to lie down . Practice having these calm periods of time. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a towel or short leash.",
      "content": "Use a towel or short leash. If you have to pick up a wiggler, use a short leash to keep a hold your dog. Or you could place a towel over his head and use it to hold his limbs. If your dog is actually injured, protect yourself by muzzling the dog (with an actual muzzle for dogs or use a leash to wrap around the snout). At least use a towel over the dog’s head before you pick up the dog."
