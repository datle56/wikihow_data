Use warm water and a gentle facial cleanser, such as Cetaphil, to cleanse the skin. Then pat your skin dry with a towel. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Dermatologists recommend washing your face twice a day, in the morning and before bed. If you only have time for one though, wash your face before bed. This removes all of the dirt that got on your skin throughout the day. Avoid washing more than twice daily, since this can make acne worse. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Don’t rub your face with a washcloth or towel after you’ve washed it. This can push oil into your pores and clog them. If your face wash isn’t strong enough to prevent your breakouts, speak to your dermatologist for a prescription-strength type. Exfoliating your skin twice weekly with a mixture of baking soda and facial cleanser may also be helpful for removing dead skin and preventing sebaceous cysts from forming."
