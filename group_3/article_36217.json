      "content": "Pour 1 cup (240 mL) of water per 1 gallon (3.8 L) of gasoline into a safe container. For your safety, put on nitrile gloves and place the empty gasoline container on the ground in a ventilated area -- outdoors is best. Pour the gas into the container first, followed by the water. Pour slowly to avoid splashing. [1] X Research source While working to separate the gasoline, make sure to use a container designed for storing gasoline, which should create a tight seal when closed. Also, don't fill the container more than 95% full, as the gasoline needs room to expand. If you try to hold the container while pouring, you can cause the vapors to ignite from static electricity. [2] X Research source If you want, you can add a few drops of food coloring to the water first to make it easier to see the layers of water/ethanol and gasoline when you're done.

      "content": "Shake the water and gasoline together. Place the cap on the container, ensuring it's tightly sealed. Shake the mixture together thoroughly. You want to shake it for a good 15 to 30 seconds to make sure the water and gasoline are thoroughly incorporated. [4] X Research source Do not be anywhere near an open flame when performing this maneuver. Vapors can ignite."

      "content": "Use a device like an Ethanator. Once you shake the mixture, pour it into the Ethanator to sit. When the water has settled out, use the valve at the bottom of the bottle to drain off the water and the ethanol into a container. [5] X Research source When you're done, remove your gloves, and wash your hands thoroughly. You'll need to leave the mixture to settle for at least 3 to 4 hours, but you may want to leave it overnight or as long as 12 hours. Once the mixture is ready, it will be perfectly clear without cloudiness, and you'll see 2 distinct layers. The gasoline will settle on top and the water and ethanol mixture will settle on the bottom. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Pour off the gas after the mixture settles, instead.",
      "content": "Pour off the gas after the mixture settles, instead. If you don't have an Ethanator, you can carefully pour the ethanol-free gasoline layer into another fuel-safe container, after it's been left to separate for several hours. Tip the container over another one to pour off the gasoline. This will be easier to do if you added the food coloring to the water, as you'll be able to see the layers better. This method probably won't be quite as easy or as safe as the Ethanator, as it's easier to spill gasoline this way. You may also waste a bit more fuel (by leaving it behind with the ethanol) than with the other method."
