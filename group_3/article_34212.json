      "content": "See if you’re predisposed to having RLS. Certain people are more likely to get RLS, either because it runs in their families or because they have a condition that causes RLS to occur. Knowing which RLS risk factors affect you can help you figure out the best way to prevent and lessen the symptoms since you’ll be able to address the cause of your RLS. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Iron-deficiency anemia, varicose veins, diabetes, and lung disease can all cause RLS. If you have one of these conditions, getting appropriate medical treatment may also help to prevent RLS from occurring. Twenty-five percent of pregnant women experience RLS, but it usually goes away at the end of pregnancy. During pregnancy, there are lifestyle changes you can make to prevent or ease the symptoms. If any of your close family members have had RLS, your chances of having it may be increased. There’s nothing you can do to alter this risk factor, but you can make changes to prevent or lessen the symptoms. Being overweight or obese can predispose you to RLS more readily. Taking steps to lose weight may help prevent RLS."

      "content": "Get active. Those with a sedentary lifestyle seem to be more prone to getting RLS. Include more exercise in your daily routine but start gradually, especially if you've not exercised for a while. The kind of exercise that is most beneficial is anything moderately strenuous, and doing it regularly. [2] X Research source Try swimming, cycling, walking fast, running, gym work, yoga, and so on. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Brisk walking four times a week for 30 minutes at a time has been shown to lessen the severity of RLS over a few months. Intense leg workouts can help. Try a week of daily intense leg exercises lasting around 20 to 30 minutes; cycling or fast walking are excellent choices. Swimming is a very gentle way to stretch leg muscles, especially if other forms of exercise cause you to cramp when stretching. Exercise not only helps to prevent RLS but can also help to reduce symptoms if they are already present."

[12] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Low iron (measured as ferritin in the blood) has been shown to be correlated with increased symptoms of RLS. Therefore, for people with low iron levels (as shown on blood tests), taking iron supplements can be helpful in the prevention of symptoms. However, doctors do not advise to take iron supplements by symptoms alone, without first getting a blood test confirming low values, as it can put you at risk of elevating your iron levels too much. Always talk to your doctor before proceeding with iron as a means of preventing RLS."

Going to bed at a good hour that will allow you to wake up when your alarm goes off, and not to sleep in any longer. If you need more sleep, go to bed earlier, rather than waking up later as wake-up time is the most important factor in consistent sleep habits. Keep your wake-up time the same on weekends as on weekdays (for consistency). Avoid \"screen time\" (televisions, computer screens, and/or cell phones) right before bed as they wake your brain up with the radiation they emit, making it more difficult to fall asleep. Keep in mind that good sleep helps to prevent symptoms of RLS, both in the daytime and during subsequent nights. Therefore, the benefit is twofold - not only does \"sleep hygiene\" help you to fall asleep better (as a common symptom of RLS is trouble sleeping), it also diminishes and prevents the presence of symptoms in subsequent days.
