The stickman (the person who retrieves the dice using a long, curved stick) offers the shooter a selection of (usually) five dice from which two are chosen. In street craps, usually only the two dice necessary are provided. Dice used for casino craps typically feature sharp edges and carefully marked so that each face weighs the same as each of the other faces."

      "content": "Place the initial bets. The shooter is required to bet on the outcome of the first roll before rolling the dice, while other players are allowed to bet as they see fit from the available betting options, provided they make their initial bets when a betting round starts. Initial bets include the following: Pass: An even money bet that a “right” or winning number will be rolled before a “wrong” or losing number. A pass bet is placed on the Pass Line when playing at a marked craps table. This is one of the options for the shooter’s required bet. Don’t Pass: An even money bet that a “wrong” or losing number will be rolled before a “right” number. (This is sometimes called “playing the dark side” and considered by some to be in bad taste.) A don’t pass bet is placed on the Don’t Pass line when playing at a marked craps table. This is the other option for the shooter’s required bet. Some casinos also require the other players to make a pass or don’t pass bet before the first roll. Odds (or Free Odds): This is a bet that can supplement a pass, don’t pass, or come bet. It is paid at the actual odds of rolling a given roll instead of whatever odds the house normally offers for one of the other bets. [2] X Research source This bet is usually placed adjacent to or overlapping the bet it is supplementing instead of directly on top of it. [3] X Research source Laying odds on a pass bet usually involves making a smaller bet to win big, while laying odds on a don’t pass bet usually involves making a larger bet to win small, although the casino can set a maximum of what multiple of a pass or don’t pass bet can be made as an odds bet. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source Proposition/service bets: These are bets on a specific roll outcome, such as a specific total or range of totals, or a specific combination of face values on the two dice. These are generally long-odds bets, as they are less likely to come up than the pass or don’t pass values. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Roll the dice. The first roll is known as a “come-out” roll. The outcome of this roll determines which bets are paid, lost, or held over for subsequent rolls. If the come-out roll is a 7 or 11, pass bets win and don’t pass bets lose. The next roll becomes a come-out roll for a new round of play. If the come-out roll is a 2, 3, or 12, pass bets lose. Don’t pass bets win if the roll is a 2 or 3, while they are returned to the player (“pushed”) without winning money if the roll is a 12. (In some casinos, a roll of 2 is the “push” number, while other casinos allow the player to choose which of the two numbers is the “push” number.) [7] X Research source If the first roll is anything other than one of these results, the number rolled becomes a “point” that will win if rolled, and the round continues. Pass and don’t pass bets are carried over. In casino craps, the shooter is required to roll both dice with one hand and have them hit the far wall of the table for the roll to count. If one of the dice flies out of the table, the shooter may either select one of the unchosen dice originally offered by the stickman or ask for the die back. (In such case, the boxman, the person who manages the table and its bets, will inspect the die to make sure it has not been milled or loaded.) [8] X Research source In street craps, players may elect to use a backstop such as a curb, wall, or chair-edge, stretch a blanket to contain the dice, or do without a restraint."

Don’t come: Betting that the shooter won’t make a 7 or 11 on the first point roll or will roll a number other than the point and then roll a 7 before the point can be made.

If a 7 is rolled before the come point is rolled, the don’t come bet wins and the come bet loses. If the original point is rolled before the come point is rolled, pass bets win, don’t pass bets lose, and the come and don’t come bets carry over while a new round of play starts to establish a new come-out point.

The lead player for the round determines how many times the other players may roll by the number of times he or she rolls the dice. The other players may roll fewer times than the lead player, but not more times. The results are ranked, high to low, according to the following system: A roll of 2 – 1, read as “21.” (The higher face value is read as the tens digit of a two-digit number and the lower face value as the ones digit.) This is called “Mexico,” from which the game takes its name. A roll of doubles, ranked downward from 6-6, or “66,” to 1-1, or “11.” Another mixed roll, ranked first by the higher face value, or tens digit, and then by the lower face value, or ones digit. Thus, 3-1, or “31,” is the lowest possible roll. Roll values are not cumulative; if a player rolls 34 on the first roll and 31 on the second, they are not added to make 65. If the lead roller rolls Mexico in any of his or her allotted rolls, the dice immediately pass to the next player, who may make up to three rolls (and so determine how many rolls subsequent players may make if he or she chooses not to make all three). If that player rolls Mexico, the next player gets the dice to make up to three rolls, and so on. The leader’s roll of Mexico also doubles the stakes for the losing player. Players should decide before starting play if additional rolls of Mexico during a round further increase the stakes and by what method. However, if any player other than the lead player for a round rolls the first 2 – 1 combination, it is not treated as Mexico and the stakes are not increased. If two or more players tie for lowest score after everyone has played, they play a round of Mexico among themselves to determine who is the loser."
