      "title": "Learn how games work.",
      "content": "Learn how games work. Understanding games is more important than a fast trigger finger. All games, if properly designed, should follow a set of \"rules\", which define how the game should be played. Get in the mind of the game and the developers who designed it. These rules are often unwritten but invaluable to the way you play. For example, a tactical FPS (first-person shooter) will often require that you not stand in the open if you want to succeed. And in an FPS, learn where to aim in the body with each weapon. Often, you'll find that you must aim for the head. But shotguns are more effective in the chest, in most games. Rocket launchers should be aimed at the feet."

      "title": "Stay calm.",
      "content": "Stay calm. If you panic in any game, you'll either die, send your army or teammates to their deaths or you'll find that you are useless to your teammates. A good way to learn skills like not panicking and about the \"rules\" of a game, is to play the old classic, Tetris . If you panic in Tetris, you fail. If you learn rules such as \"do not create gaps\", \"do not create 'channels'\" and \"early on in the game, go for four lines at a time\"."

      "title": "Configure your controls the way you like them.",
      "content": "Configure your controls the way you like them. In first-person shooters, do not use the arrow keys! They look temptingly simple, but the best keys to use are WASD (W forwards, A left, S backpedal, D right). Occasionally ESDF or ESCF are used instead for more room. This is because, with the arrow keys, there are no other buttons nearby to use. Imagine the scene. You're playing an FPS, and you need to jump. There is no nearby suitable \"jump\" button. Or if you need to reload, where is the reload button? You would have to take your hand off the movement keys, which is bad in a firefight. Don't forget Ctrl and Shift, as these keys are easily pressed by your pinky finger, excellent for functions you are likely to use when you are moving e.g a crouch button or sprint button. Jumping is good with the spacebar. In a strategy game, your buttons will often be laid out logically enough already. For example, in most strategy games, to build a Barracks, you tap the B key."

      "content": "Learn the environments. This is key to forming strategies and learning where you are likely to get attacked."

      "title": "Communicate.",
      "content": "Communicate. Even if you don't know the people you are playing with, it is still good to type basic information like \"Enemy incoming\" or \"Guard this area\". But when you are playing with your team or with your friends, you really should learn how to communicate efficiently. Using TeamSpeak, Xfire voice or Skype is necessary. You will notice that in most games, the player without the voice chat is the one who dies first. The different voice clients all have advantages and disadvantages. Xfire of course lets you type into the conversation in-game as well, so posting a strategy that people can check at any time is easy with Xfire. TS creates the least lag for the players. If you cannot use voice, learn to type quickly and use any in-game auto-sayings quickly. When typing messages, do not be a fool and use the global chat! Use TEAM chat! Global chat is for chatting, swearing when you die and congratulating the enemy on a fantastic shot. In strategy games, discuss strategy. Call for help. Use Beacons. Co-ordinate attacks."

    {
      "title": "Bend the rules when you can.",
      "content": "Bend the rules when you can. Do not downright break them, but bend them to give yourself the advantage. For example, you know not to stand out of cover? What if you found a ridiculous piece of cover that no one would think of checking? You've tried the big guns? What about taking down an entire army with a knife? For example, me and my friends like to, when we run into enemies in a corridor, throw ourselves to the ground and shoot the ankles. unorthodox, but it catches them off-guard. Do not break the rules of a strategy game. The outcome of a battle is never determined by some crazy plan involving using one unit to dispatch an army."

      "title": "Develop a style.",
      "content": "Develop a style. This is not necessary, but it is so much more fun in a game to have a play style. Are you the sniper who'll kill the enemy no matter what range? Will you send a rush early on, not to win, but to mock the enemy? Are you the maniac with a crowbar? Enjoy the game, and play with style!"

      "content": "Win. Winning games is great and the effort to reach and get. Do whatever it takes. But if you lose don't get angry. Try harder the next time. Retry or see what is the thing keeping you from winning; once you understand the boundary, you might surpass it.."
