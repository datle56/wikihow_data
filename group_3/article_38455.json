      "content": "Clean a brand new griddle with soap and water. If you just bought a brand new griddle, it’s important to wash it with soap and water before seasoning. To do this, fill a small bucket of water and pour in some mild dish soap. Mix it together and slowly pour a small amount over your grill. Scrub the soapy mixture on the grill with a sponge, and then rinse it off with a bundle of paper towels. [1] X Research source Do not use soap on a used or older griddle. It may damage the surface."

      "content": "Remove any leftover food or debris from an older griddle . If you want to season a griddle that has already been used, make sure the surface is clean and clear of any food or debris. Use a metal spatula or scraper to remove any stuck on mess. Then wipe away any debris from the surface. [2] X Research source Scrape off food while the griddle is still hot. This will make it easier to remove than if the griddle is cold. Use table salt and hot water for extra tough food that’s hard to remove. To do this, pour 1 cup (240 mL) of salt on a warm griddle, scrub it with a towel, then remove the salt and rinse with water."

      "title": "Heat the griddle on high for 10-15 minutes.",
      "content": "Heat the griddle on high for 10-15 minutes. Now that your griddle is clean, turn it on all the way up to the highest setting, and let it heat up for about 10-15 minutes. If this is a new griddle, wait for the surface to blacken. This will allow the oil to burn on the surface."

      "title": "Pour cooking oil on the griddle and spread it with a paper towel.",
      "content": "Pour cooking oil on the griddle and spread it with a paper towel. To season a griddle, you’ll need to add oil to it. Use 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of oil per 11 inches (28 cm) of griddle. Cooking oils that are rich in fatty acids are best because they will bond to the griddle plate. Once your spread a good amount of oil on the griddle, use multiple layers of dry paper towel to spread it evenly on the surface. [3] X Research source The best oils for seasoning are olive oil, sesame oil, canola oil, vegetable oil, coconut oil, and flax oil. Be careful not to burn your fingers. You can use tongs or heat resistant gloves to hold the paper towel if you’re worried about the heat. Be sure to spread the oil around the edges and corners."

      "content": "Let the oil sit on the heated griddle for about 20 minutes. Let the oil sit for at least 20-30 minutes, or until it burns off the griddle top. During this time, you’ll notice smoke coming off of the surface. Once the grill stops smoking, the oil is finished burning and you can turn off the griddle and let it cool. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Repeat the process of adding and spreading oil at least 2 times.",
      "content": "Repeat the process of adding and spreading oil at least 2 times. It takes more than just one coating of oil to properly season a griddle. To ensure that the griddle has a good nonstick plate and is fully coated, heat up the griddle again and add more oil. Repeat the previous step to add oil and spread it with a paper towel. [5] X Research source Do this 2 or 3 more times, or until the griddle surface is permanently dark brown."

      "content": "Turn the griddle on to high heat and let it sit for 20 minutes. Before attempting to remove rust from your griddle, turn the heat on high. This heat will loosen up any stuck-on food or corrosion before you even begin scraping. This will make it easier to remove. [6] X Research source"

If it is stuck on the surface, scrape it off with a metal scraper. You can also use a metal spatula if you don’t have a grill scraper. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Let the griddle cool down and begin scraping off the rust. Turn off the heat on the griddle, and then use your scraper to begin taking off that rust. You’ll need to use a lot of force to do this, as rust is not easy to remove. Scrape as much off as you can before moving on to the next step. Do not use any water with the scraper during this step. Water and moisture is the main cause of rust, so you don’t want to make the condition worse."

Once you have scraped off as much of the rust as possible, pour some cooking oil on the griddle plate. Then, use a grill stone block to scrub all around the rusted surface. A grill stone can be found at most home improvement stores. [8] X Research source If you don’t have a grill stone, try using steel wool or sandpaper."

This will further remove any rust on your griddle. If there’s still rust on your griddle, add more oil to the surface and then wipe again with more dry paper towels. Keep repeating this step until there is little to no residue after you wipe it with the paper towels."
