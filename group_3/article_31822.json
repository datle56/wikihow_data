Unlike popular retailers like Target, Walmart, and Sam’s Club, Costco does not provide a curbside pickup service for their members. [1] X Research source However, they do offer a workaround: customers can order their items through Instacart and request curbside pickup. Check our how-to on this process here . Costco also offers in-store pickup from their warehouses for Costco members (although you’ll have to call your local Costco warehouse to make sure this service is offered). [2] X Research source Eligible items for warehouse pickup include laptops, tablets, wearable technology (smart watches), cell phones, hard drives, earrings, rings, bracelets, necklaces, and watches. We explain how to use the in-store pickup program below ! As an alternative option, Costco offers same-day or two-day delivery for groceries when you order online. If you’re okay with having your groceries delivered to your door, you can check out this set of steps to schedule a delivery."
