      "content": "Ojou-samas usually have unique traits according to their subtypes. Ojou-sama characters are usually loved by others due to their wealth and status, with some even having entire entourages willing to defend them at any moment. While ojou-sama characters tend to have strong, commanding personalities, the specific characteristics depend on the subtype of ojou-sama they fall under. [3] X Research source The proper lady tends to be portrayed as the perfect woman. She is usually gentle, but has an inner strength that keeps her secure. She often has incorruptible morals and is portrayed as pure. She may be a bit unaware of how the world works, but that doesn’t dissuade her kindness.This is similar to how the characters are portrayed in Sailor Moon . The ice queen is a woman who tends to have a cold heart and demeanor. She often takes the role of the antagonist due to her cold heart and demeanor. She is usually considered hard to love since she doesn’t love back, often has low enthusiasm when it comes to helping others, and tends to have no qualms about not being liked by people. The royal brat is usually young, rich, and immature. She also tends to be demanding and boisterous. Since they tend to grow up surrounded by wealth and people at their service, royal brat characters often have little wisdom about the world and usually expect other people to bend to their whim. Think of characters like Bulma from Dragon Ball Z ."
