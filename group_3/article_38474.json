      "title": "Refrain from giving out the network password.",
      "content": "Refrain from giving out the network password. As paranoid as it may make you seem, refusing to give out your network's password lowers the chances of people who you don't trust finding out your network's password. Instead of giving out the password, offer to sign in friends and family when they visit rather than allowing them to sign into the Wi-Fi themselves."

      "content": "Place your router in the middle of your home. In addition to making your router coverage more balanced, doing this will limit the router's reach beyond your home's walls. This means that would-be network intruders won't be able to sit outside of your home and still connect to the network. [1] X Research source Your home's size and layout may make this impossible; if so, just try to keep your router well-away from windows and external doorways."

      "title": "Disconnect the router when it's not in use.",
      "content": "Disconnect the router when it's not in use. If you plan on leaving your home for a weekend or more, unplug your router and/or modem. This is more of a safety precaution than an active security measure, but it will prevent any potential attackers from connecting to your Internet while you're powerless to stop it. Even if you're going to be gone for a standard 8- or 9-hour work day, disconnecting your router will prevent any chances of your network being compromised while you're gone."

      "content": "Use a boring network name. It may sound stupid, but changing your clever Wi-Fi network name to a boring one will decrease the odds of it being picked out as a potential target. [2] X Research source For example, using the router's manufacturer and its number (e.g., \"Belkin-3030\") as the name will make the network stand out less than if its name is \"Bill Wi the Science Fi\" or something similar."
