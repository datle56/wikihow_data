      "content": "Seeing angel numbers may indicate your ex’s desire to be with you. For example, if your ex was born on 10/12 and you keep seeing 10:12 on the clock or your total rang up to $10.12 at the grocery store, your ex could be trying to get your attention through the power of the universe. Try looking up whatever number you keep seeing to determine what relationship advice your angels may want you to hear. [4] X Research source Angel numbers like 777 or 222 can suggest that love is near . Consider whether you still love your ex and want to be with them.

[7] X Research source Sometimes, couples have to go through periods apart to learn they were right for each other. If you and your ex have grown as people since your breakup and would be better able to handle a relationship together after all the lessons you’ve learned, rekindling your flame could be a positive thing."

Like a storm, powerful reminders of the past can swirl around you and make you feel overwhelmed, but do your best to be patient with yourself and allow your feelings to settle before making any snap judgments, like contacting your ex."

[8] X Research source Consider what inviting them back into your life through conversation could mean. Are you really ready to speak with them, or are you just feeling lonely? Remember, it doesn’t have to be a romantic thing—you can just be friends. Breaking up doesn’t mean you can't hold on to some form of a relationship with them."

[9] X Research source For example, you might hear their name called out at a coffee shop, rent a library book with their name in it, or hear two strangers discussing someone with the same name as your ex.
