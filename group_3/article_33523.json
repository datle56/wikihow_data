For casual gatherings, a smaller amount might be appropriate. Likewise, if it’s just a silly game for kids, it will probably be more fun with small, inexpensive toys than bigger items.

Once you have three or more participants, a person who loses their gift to a thief now also has the option of stealing from someone else.

Similarly, a person can only be stolen from three times before they get to keep what they have. If you have a large group or you put a limit on the number of steals, you may want to tell those who have been stolen from just to choose a new gift from the pile. Otherwise, it could prolong the turn indefinitely, because whoever they steal from could steal too, and so on."
