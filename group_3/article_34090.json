      "content": "Dehydrate petals with silica gel. Silica gel, which can be purchased at most craft stores, can easily be used to preserve rose petals. You'll need a large package of silica gel and an airtight, sealable container. Place an inch of silica gel at the bottom of an airtight container. Then, add the rose petals. [1] X Research source Add about another half inch of silica gel, completely covering the flowers. Place the lid on the container and set aside in a safe place away from pets or children. [2] X Research source It can take anywhere from two to seven days for flowers to dry completely. At this point, they can be removed and used in crafts. Wetter, larger petals will take longer to dry than smaller, dryer ones. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Dry out petals with borax and sand. Borax and sand can also be used to preserve rose petals. As silica gel can be a hazard to pets and children, you may feel safer with this method. You'll need to buy fine sand and borax powder at a local craft store. Once again, you'll also need a container. However, you'll be leaving the container uncovered so it does not need to be sealable or airtight. Sift the borax first, making sure to remove all the lumps. Then, mix the borax and sand. You should use a mixture of 2 parts borax, 1 part fine sand. [4] X Research source Line one inch of the borax/sand mixture on the bottom of your container. Add the rose petals. Then, cover them completely with borax and sand. You'll need about half an inch. [5] X Research source This method takes slightly longer to work than the silica gel method. You'll have to set your open container aside for 14 to 17 days before the petals dry completely. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Preserve petals using cat litter. A plain, dust-free cat litter can also help preserve rose petals. You would use the same layering process as you used with silica gel. Line the bottom of an airtight, sealable container with an inch of cat litter. Then, add the rose petals. Then, add another half inch of cat litter. Seal the container and set aside for two to seven days. [7] X Research source If you have cats, make sure to place the container out of their reach. If they see a container full of litter, they may assume it's for them and try to get into it."

To start, heat your oven to 180 degrees Fahrenheit. [9] X Research source Arrange the petals in a layer on a cookie sheet. Make sure the petals are not touching. [10] X Research source Place the cookie sheet in the oven. Heat the roses for at least 3 hours, keeping the oven door open the entire time. [11] X Research source Remove the tray and set it aside in a safe place where it's unlikely to be disturbed. Leave overnight. There should be no more moisture on the flowers by morning.

If you don't want to distort the shape, you may want to try another method. To start, heat your iron to its lowest setting. Do not add water to the iron. If there is any water in the iron, empty it. [13] X Research source Place the flowers between two sheets of absorbent paper. Use a book to flatten them slightly. Then, press the iron on top of the absorbent sheets for 10 to 15 seconds. Do not make any gliding motions. Simply press the iron down. [14] X Research source"

However, pressing flowers under a microwave can cause them to brown. You should buy a professional microwave flower press, which you can buy online or at a local craft store, for the best results. However, if you don't have a professional flower press you can make one by placing the petals between two ceramic tiles. From there, you can tie the tiles together with non-flammable string or twine. [15] X Research source Place the press in the microwave. Heat it for 30 to 60 seconds at a time. Allow the press to cool off completely between sessions. [16] X Research source Check the flowers periodically. Once they appear completely dry, you can remove them and use them for craft purposes. [17] X Research source"

[20] X Research source Set the petals across the surface, making sure they're not touching each other. Then, find a warm and dark place to set the petals aside. Choose a place out of reach of children and animals. You do not want the petals to get disturbed during the drying process.
