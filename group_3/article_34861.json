In Great Britain, the address is positioned in the bottom left corner on the front of the envelope. When positioning the first line, be sure to plan ahead so that you leave enough room for the next lines of text. You should also plan to leave a generous margin of about 1/2 an inch (1.3 cm) around the entire address. [1] X Research source"

If you are handwriting the address, use a pen or ink that is clear against the color of the envelope. Do not use pencil or anything that could be easily smudged or rubbed off during the journey. If you are printing an address label, be sure to use a font that is easy to read and a color that stands out against the label. For both handwritten and printed addresses, make to size the text so it can be ready easily, with a text size comparable to a font size of 10 - 15."

There are three types of localities in Great Britain, and in order for mail to get sorted properly the post town has to be included. There are two other locality elements that you can include as well, but only the post town is required. Each element needs to be included on separate lines. Each locality should be written in normal letter case, except for the post town, which should be all uppercase letters. You do not need to include the county name. For example: [5] X Research source Locality line 1 is the double dependent locality (i.e., the neighborhood or borough): Otterley Locality line 2 is the dependent locality (i.e., the town or civil parish): Hedge End Locality line 3 (or line 1 since it is the only one required) is the post town (i.e., the county town): OXFORD"
