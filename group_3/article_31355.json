      "content": "A weak jawline looks soft, rather than sharp or defined. If you’re not sure whether or not you have one, Dr. Turner mentions a few things to look out for. “Generally, if a patient notices sagging fat, lacks a prominent chin, or dislikes their profile in the mirror, these are good indicators. If the chin doesn’t project forward or the jawline isn’t visible, these are also signs,” she explains. If you think you might have a weak jawline and you’re unhappy with its appearance, Dr. Turner suggests meeting with a dermatologist, who will be able to take some measurements of the angles and width of your jaw to assess the situation. From there, you and your doctor can discuss your goals and treatment options."

      "content": "Genetics According to Dr. Turner, weak jawlines can be hereditary. “Sometimes, people are simply born with a weak jawline. It’s a trait that can be inherited at birth,” she says. “If one or both parents have a weak jawline, this is a strong predictor, so you can look to your parents to see how you might age and consider preventative steps accordingly.”"

      "title": "Aging",
      "content": "Aging Dr. Turner explains that most of the patients she sees who are concerned about weak jawlines developed the issue over time. “As we age, we can see a loss of jawline definition due to several factors. Things like gaining fat in the area, losing muscle tissue, and even bone loss in the mandibular region can contribute to the appearance of a weak jawline.”"

      "title": "Speak to your dermatologist to find the right treatment for you.",
      "content": "Speak to your dermatologist to find the right treatment for you. Dr. Turner explains, “When approaching jawline aesthetics, the first step is to assess the patient’s goals. Are they male or female, and what kind of jawline do they want? For men, a squared-off, angular jawline with wider mandibular angles is often desired. For women, something softer, with a ‘sweetheart chin’ look, is typically the goal. Once that’s established, there are a number of options,” she says. “We now have instantaneous treatments, such as injectables—specifically hyaluronic acid-based fillers—and biostimulatory fillers that mimic bone. These are simple, same-day procedures. We also have devices that improve muscle quality and eliminate fat cells. Additionally, there are injections specifically for dissolving fat in targeted areas.” “My favorite results come from a combination of treatments, using both devices and injectables together. This can achieve surgical-like outcomes without the downtime,” Dr. Turner explains. We’ll go over these non-invasive dermatological treatments, as well as a few surgical options, below."

      "title": "Dermal fillers",
      "content": "Dermal fillers According to Dr. Turner, a weak jawline can be caused by bone resorption in the mandibular and maxillary bones, which often occurs with aging. Dermal fillers can help replace what’s been lost structurally, which is what makes them so valuable for a more defined jawline, she says. “Dermal fillers are definitely the hot item right now. The newer generation of fillers has a property called G-prime, which refers to the filler’s viscosity. This makes it act more like bone, which is perfect for jawline sculpting,” says Dr. Turner. “Some popular options are Volux, Radiesse (though this one is not FDA-approved specifically for jawline use), and Restylane Lyft. These are capable of giving structure to the bony area, which helps lift the submental (under-chin) region,” she adds. Dermal fillers in this area also last a relatively long time. “Compared to other areas of the face, where there’s more movement, jawline filler can last longer, between 18 months to three years,” Dr. Turner explains."

      "title": "Kybella",
      "content": "Kybella Dermal fillers aren’t the only injectable option for a more defined jawline. “We also have injectables like deoxycholic acid (brand name Kybella), which works by triggering fat cell death in targeted areas,” says Dr. Turner. “Used in the submental region alongside jawline fillers, it creates a beautiful, sculpted result. It’s been on the market for years and can be used effectively in combination treatments.”"

      "title": "Botox",
      "content": "Botox “Botox can also be used in the jawline, though it’s a different approach,” Dr. Turner says. “If you inject Botox right under the jawline, it can produce a tightening effect, and the idea is to tighten the muscle under the jawline to enhance definition.” Dr. Turner explains that this use of Botox is technically off-label, but it can still be very effective. “A small amount—say 5 to 10 units—can go a long way. You can use Botox Cosmetic, Dysport, Xeomin, or similar neuromodulators,” she says."

The technology is like doing micro-massages—20,000 little exercises in one session.” According to Dr. Turner, the treatments are so effective that they can be used to “avoid more invasive options like a surgical neck lift down the line.”"

      "content": "Neck liposuction Neck liposuction is a surgical procedure that removes fat around the neck and jaw area, which gives your jawline a sharper, more defined look. [6] X Research source This procedure can have great results, but it’s important to note that it’s surgical, rather than dermatological. “It’s an invasive procedure for more extreme cases, and it will have a longer recovery time, ” explains Dr. Turner."

      "title": "Chin augmentation/chin implants",
      "content": "Chin augmentation/chin implants Many people who have weak or receding jawlines opt for a chin augmentation. This is another invasive procedure that involves surgically molding an implant to your chin bone to create a more defined look. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Like neck liposuction, this treatment has a longer and more involved recovery process. “Surgery may require six weeks of not moving your neck, which would even affect your ability to drive,” and with this in mind, “many patients find the idea of non-invasive procedures like EMFACE and four syringes of Volux or Radiesse very appealing,” Dr. Turner explains. “I’ve had some patients with well-done chin implants, but you have to be careful,” Dr. Turner adds. “Gravity and aging change the face over time, and if you get the wrong implant, it might look fine at 35, but not at 65.” Beyond this, Dr. Turner stresses that surgery is a serious decision that should be made with care. “Once you've been cut, you can’t undo it. You have to go through that recovery, wherever it takes you,” she says."

      "content": "Fat grafting Fat grafting involves injecting fat into the chin or jaw area to define it more. To achieve this, a plastic surgeon performs liposuction on another area of your body, then injects that fat into your chin. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Dr. Turner explains that this option has become less popular due to the advances that have come about with dermal fillers. “The issue with fat grafting was that the results were unpredictable. Dermal fillers changed everything. The fillers today are incredible and reliable— you know what result you’ll get. Plastics have improved fat grafting over the years, but dermal fillers dominate now for a reason,” Dr. Turner says."

      "title": "Thread lifts",
      "content": "Thread lifts Thread lifts are a type of procedure that involves using temporary sutures to create a subtle “lift” in the skin. Thread lifts can address sagging or drooping skin around the neck and jaw, which can in turn create a sharper, more defined appearance around your jawline. [9] X Research source Dr. Turner notes that “Patients love it, and downtime is minimal—just 3 to 4 days.” “There are two main types of thread lifts, Silhouette InstaLift and PDO thread lifts. Silhouette InstaLift is made of a sugar-based material formed into a thread, with cones along its length. These dissolve over time and stimulate new collagen. Biopsies show this skin-smoothing effect can last up to four years. The lifting effect, however, lasts about a year to 18 months,” Dr. Turner explains. Dr. Turner tends to recommend InstaLift over PDO thread lifts because they last longer and require less follow-up and maintenance—PDO lifts only last about six months, she says."

      "content": "There isn’t enough scientific evidence to prove that jaw exercises work. Dr. Turner explains that you’d likely have to do thousands of facial exercises to see actual results, and it isn’t possible for someone to do that manually. However, many people claim that certain DIY techniques have helped them sculpt and sharpen their jawline. These include: Mewing: “Mewing is the idea that tongue posture—pressing your tongue to the roof of your mouth—can define your jawline,” explains Dr. Turner. Unfortunately, there isn’t much evidence to back up this claim, and according to Dr. Turner, it likely doesn’t work. Jaw exercises: Some people claim that jaw exercises (opening and closing the jaw, moving it side to side, biting down on a jaw exerciser, etc.) can sharpen the jawline, but research suggests that these types of exercises have limited effects. [10] X Research source Lymphatic massage/Gua sha: “Lymphatic massage can help some people, especially if they have specific underlying issues, but for most people, the concern is more about fat, muscle, or even bone structure,” says Dr. Turner. “Those are better addressed with medical treatments—whether invasive or non-invasive, depending on severity.”"

Because a weak jawline is often genetic, Dr. Turner explains that there aren’t specific actions you can take to prevent it from developing. However, aging can exacerbate the appearance of a weak jawline, so Dr. Turner recommends always wearing sunscreen for its anti-aging effects. “It’s the number one preventative skincare measure everyone should be doing every single day,” she says."

      "content": "Can chewing gum sharpen your jawline? You might have seen the claim that chewing gum sharpens your jawline on the internet, but unfortunately, there’s not much evidence to back this up. In fact, Dr. Turner says that excessive gum chewing might create a fuller look, rather than a slimmer, angular one: “It will actually increase the masseter muscles on the sides of the jaw, so if someone wants to bulk up those muscles, then sure, chew gum. But most people don’t want larger masseters. Most people are aiming for a more contoured look. So no, chewing gum isn’t advisable if you’re going for that slimmer look. I usually say don’t chew gum—get a breath mint,” explains Dr. Turner."

      "content": "Can you be attractive without a strong jawline? Dr. Turner says the answer to this question is a resounding yes. “We look at different face shapes every single day, and there’s not just one ideal look. There isn’t one standard that says a strong jawline is essential. It’s really about how all your features come together as a whole,” she says. However, if you are feeling a little insecure about your jawline, Dr. Turner recommends playing up some of your other features and working on your confidence . “Find your best feature—maybe it’s your eyes, lips, hair, skin—and whatever it is, focus on that and play it up. Confidence is key. When someone walks in with confidence and a smile, that is what draws people in,” says Dr. Turner. “No one’s going to be zeroing in on your jawline. They’ll be responding to your energy. So play up your favorite features and walk into the room like you belong there. That’s what people notice!”"
