      "title": "Ensure the area chosen for prayer is clean and free of impurities.",
      "content": "Ensure the area chosen for prayer is clean and free of impurities. This includes your body, your clothes, and the place of prayer itself. Perform wudu . You must be ritually pure before you go start praying. If you're not, it's required to perform wudu (ablution) before you do. If since your last prayer, you have urinated, defecated, passed gas, bled excessively, passed madhy (seminal fluid), or fallen asleep leaning/laying down, you need to perform wudu. [1] X Research source If you are praying in a masjid (mosque), which is highly encouraged for men, enter quietly—other Muslims might still be praying and you don't want to disturb them. Many Muslims families keep a dedicated area for salah in their home. If you are unsure of the cleanliness of your area, spread a mat on the floor for good measure. This prayer rug is very important to Islamic culture."

      "title": "Perform ghusl",
      "content": "Perform ghusl (full shower) if needed. Certain circumstances will require that you perform ghusl instead of wudu to be fully cleansed by removing najas (impurities) before praying. You need to perform ghusl if you wish to pray after having sexual intercourse, ending your menstruation period or postpartum bleeding, giving birth, having a wet dream or ejaculating with sexual pleasure. [2] X Research source To perform ghusl, you must wash your entire body and hair with water. It is recommended that you wash 3 times, making sure every part of the skin has been run under water. Note that when you perform either wudu or ghusl, anything that prevents water from touching the obligatory areas of the body must be removed, including things such as nail polish, accessories, and waterproof mascara. [3] X Research source If you do not perform wudu or ghusl when required by the Shariah then the prayer will not be valid and will not be accepted."

This rite involves using clean soil or dirt or a natural rock that has not been used before to perform tayammum. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Face the Qibla . This is the direction all Muslims face to turn in prayer towards the Holy Ka'bah. The Holy Mosque in Mecca is the most revered place of worship for Muslims around the entire world. All Muslims are required to face the Ka'bah five times every day when offering their prayers. If you are traveling on a ship or airplane and fear that the time of prayer will end before you reach someplace where you can determine the direction of Ka'bah then, in that case, you can offer Salat without facing Ka'bah. It is Mustahab (recommended) that one face the Ka'bah at least during the takbeer of ihram (saying \"Allahu Akbar\" at the beginning of Salat). [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Pray at the proper time.",
      "content": "Pray at the proper time. The five prayers of each day take place at very specific times according to one's geographic location and the time of year. [11] X Research source \"Indeed, the prayer is on the believers prescribed (at) fixed times.\" Quran 4:103 For each one, there is a brief period of time it can be performed, determined by the rising and falling of the sun. Each fard salah takes about 5 to 10 minutes from start to finish, but should never be hurried. Try to pray the prayers at the start of the appointed time, as Allah will appreciate your enthusiasm to pray. The five prayers are Fajr, Zuhr, Asr , Maghrib, and Isha. They are at dawn, afternoon, in the mid-afternoon, at sunset, and at night, respectively. They are not at the same time each day, as they are timed by the sun, which changes path throughout the seasons. Each of the five salah contains a specified number of rak'ah (units), as follows: Obligatory prayers: - Fajr prayer (2 units (Rak'ah)) - Dhuhr prayer (4 units (Rak'ah)) - Asr prayer (4 units (Rak'ah)) - Maghrib prayer (3 units (Rak'ah)) - Isha prayer (4 units (Rak'ah)) Additionally, many Muslims chose to follow the example of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) by praying additional optional prayers around the obligatory prayers, giving a daily cycle as follows: Fajr - Two rak'ah sunnah mu'akkadah (optional but highly recommended), then two rak'ah fardh (obligatory); Zuhr - Four rak'ah sunnah mu'akkadah (optional but highly recommended), then four rak'ah fardh (obligatory), then two rak'ah sunnah mu'akkdah (optional but highly recommended), then two rak'ah nafl (optional); Asr - Four rak'ah sunnah ghayr mu'akkadah (optional but spiritually beneficial), then four rak'ah fardh (obligatory); Maghrib - Three rak'ah fardh (obligatory), then two rak'ah sunnah mu'akkadah (optional but highly recommended), then two rak'ah nafl (optional); Isha - Four rak'ah sunnah, then four rak'ah fardh (obligatory), then two rak'ah sunnah mu'akkadah (optional but highly recommended), then two rak'ah nafl (optional), then three rak'ah witr (optional but highly recommended), then two rak'ah nafl (optional). Whilst there is no penalty for not performing the sunnah and nafl prayers, they are a gift from Allah that should be embraced to improve one's connection with Allah and earn extra rewards."

      "title": "Learn to say prayers in Arabic.",
      "content": "Learn to say prayers in Arabic . Salah must be performed in the Arabic language because this is the language that the Qur’an was revealed in. It also allows Muslims outside of Arabic-speaking countries to recite the prayers and understand what is being said. Speaking all prayers in the same language avoids the confusion of translating words into other languages. Use online sources to help you pronounce the obligatory prayer words, such as Rosetta Stone [7] X Research source , Salaam Arabic [8] X Research source , hosted by Pangaea Learning, Madinah Arabic [9] X Research source or Youtube [10] X Research source sources. Take a course in Arabic at your local college. Learn and practice the correct pronunciations with an Arabic speaker as the prayer may be invalid if it is not recited correctly. Non-Arabic speaking children will benefit from attending evening or weekend madrassa classes to learn Arabic and study the Qur'an."

      "title": "Cover yourself.",
      "content": "Cover yourself. Men and women must both cover themselves with material that covers the skin throughout the prayer. While women must cover everything but their faces and hands, men must keep the area between their navel and knees covered. [11] X Research source The material must cover the body during prayer movements. So if, for example, bending causes a piece of material to slip and expose skin on a woman’s neck, she would need to ensure that her clothing is tucked in properly or put more clothing on before she can start her prayer."

Place your hands either on your navel, on your chest, or between the two; there's a difference of opinion between Islamic schools of thoughts. Keep your eyes focused on the ground. It helps to keep your sight fixed on where your head will rest when prostrating later. Do not let your eyes wander. Recite the optional Istiftah Du'a (opening prayer): Subhanakal-lahumma Wabihamdika watabarakas-muka wataaaala Jadduka wala ilaha ghayruk. A’auodu billaahi minash-shaytaanir rajeem Bis-millaahir rahmaanir raheem Follow it with Surah Al-Fatiha (this Surah is recited in each Rak'ah): Bismillaahir Rahmaanir Raheem Alhamdu lillaahi Rabbil 'aalameen Ar-Rahmaanir-Raheem Maaliki Yawmid-Deen Iyyaaka na'budu wa lyyaaka nasta'een Ihdinas-Siraatal-Mustaqeem Siraatal-ladheena an'amta 'alaihim Ghayril-maghdoobi 'alaihim wa lad-daaalleen Recite any other surah or any part of the Qu'ran, such as Surah Ikhlas: Qul huwal laahu ahad Allah hus-samad Lam yalid wa lam yoolad Wa lam yakul-lahu kufuwan ahad Reciting a surah after Al-Fatiha is only done in the first 2 units (Rakaa's) of fardh salat while in sunnah mu'akkadah it is done in all units (Rakaa's).
