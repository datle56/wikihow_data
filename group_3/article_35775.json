If you haven't yet come up with potential names that you like, take 10 to 15 minutes to think about your topic and write down words and phrases that are associated with it. Then, go through those words and phrases to attempt to build a creative and unique name. [2] X Research source You might also consider a podcast name that includes your own name, particularly if you are an expert on the topic of your podcast or already have a significant following online. Ideally, your title should be brief, memorable, and easy for people to say. Try to come up with several alternatives in case someone else is already using one of them."

A fan-suggested name also connects you to your fans and signals that you have their interests at heart. [3] X Research source Even if you don't already have an online following, you can get your friends or colleagues to weigh in on podcast name ideas. One of your friends might come up with something you hadn't thought of before or inspire a new mental connection for you."

You can also search on podcast platforms and directories, such as iTunes, to see if there are any existing podcasts with the same or similar name. [4] X Research source Keep in mind that none of these searches are perfect or exhaustive. There's still a chance that a podcast with a similar name will slip through the cracks. For example, if you only do a search on iTunes, you might miss a podcast that isn't distributed through iTunes. Search multiple directories and the internet generally to cover as much ground as possible."

Even if you're confident there's not another podcast with the same name as the one you've chosen, you still need to make sure it doesn't infringe on anyone else's trademark. Search online for your country's trademark database. Since podcasts can typically be downloaded globally, you might also want to check databases in other countries. [5] X Research source The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) maintains a database that allows you to search the individual databases of more than 100 countries. Go to hhttps://www.wipo.int/en/web/madrid-system/how_to/search/index to use it. It would be difficult to make sure your podcast name doesn't infringe on any trademark in the entire world. However, you should at least check countries that are geographically close or share the same language. For example, if your podcast is based in the US, you might check the Canadian and British trademark databases."

Go to the website of any domain registrar â€” you can simply search online for \"domain registrar\" if you don't already have one in mind. Enter your podcast name in the registrar's search bar to see if you can register the domain. If your podcast name is more than 2 or 3 words, you might also try a shortened version. Ultimately, you want a domain that will be easy to remember and share with others. [6] X Research source You probably also want to check for social media account names. While your podcast doesn't necessarily need a presence on every social media platform, having accounts on 2 or 3 will help you spread the word about your podcast. Avoid using hyphens or complicated spellings, which don't look as professional and are easy to forget. Aim for a .com or .org address. Although there are numerous other domain extensions, they don't have the search engine power that a .com or .org address does."

While most of them offer basically the same services, some have webpages that are easier to navigate, while others may have stronger customer service. Typically, you'll register your domain for at least a year at a time. Some registrars allow you to register for several years at a time. However, keep in mind that you have no way of knowing if that particular registrar is still going to be in business after 3, 5, or 10 years. You don't know if your podcast is going to be around for that long either."

You might also try WordPress hosting if you're planning on creating a WordPress site. WordPress is popular with podcasters because it automatically creates an RSS feed, which you'll need to submit your podcast to directories, such as iTunes. [9] X Research source"

While the application itself isn't extremely complicated, it does require that you know a little about trademark protection. If you're not comfortable with this, you might want to get a lawyer to complete your application for you. If you're filling it out yourself, make sure you correctly identify the trademark class for your podcast name. Trademark classes are based on the Nice system and are used throughout the world.
