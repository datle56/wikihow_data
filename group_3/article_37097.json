      "title": "Disconnect the negative terminal",
      "content": "Disconnect the negative terminal on the battery. Turn the car off if you can, pop the hood, and locate your battery. The battery is the black box with a positive (+) and negative (-) post sticking out of the top of it. Use a wrench to loosen the nut holding the cable on the negative (-) terminal and then slide it off the post. [1] X Research source You don’t need to remove the positive cable from its terminal. Tuck the negative cable to the side of the battery to make sure it doesn’t accidentally come into contact with the terminals."

      "title": "Remove the trim around the steering wheel.",
      "content": "Remove the trim around the steering wheel. There are likely a number of plastic pieces covering up the cylinder holding your ignition switch. Remove them carefully by either popping them off of their plastic clips or removing the screws and bolts that hold those pieces in place. [2] X Research source Refer to a vehicle specific repair manual for guidance on how best to gain access to the ignition switch. This process is a little different on every make and model. Set all trim pieces aside somewhere safe where they won’t get stepped on or damaged. Don’t get overwhelmed by all of the wires and components you’re exposing; you aren’t going to damage anything by taking the dash panels off."

      "title": "Take the steering wheel out if it covers the top of the ignition.",
      "content": "Take the steering wheel out if it covers the top of the ignition. In some vehicles, you may be able to replace the ignition switch without removing the steering wheel. However, if you’re unable to get access to the top of the ignition switch with all the interior trim pieces removed, take the steering wheel out. Refer to a vehicle specific repair manual for guidance on how to safely remove your steering wheel from the vehicle. [3] X Research source It’s important to get vehicle-specific guidance on steering wheel removal to avoid damaging the steering column or airbag. If you don’t have your manual, go online and download the manual for your specific vehicle. On some vehicles, you'll need a special tool called a steering wheel puller to remove it. These tools often come in kits with specialized tools for removing trim pieces as well."

      "title": "Release the clips on the ignition module cover.",
      "content": "Release the clips on the ignition module cover. There may be a plastic cover surrounding the ignition cylinder in your vehicle. If so, press the release clips found on either side of the cover (it’s round, so they’ll be 180 degrees opposite of one another). You may need to press the top release with a screwdriver if it’s too difficult to access with your fingers. [4] X Research source With the releases pressed, slide the cover out over the ignition module. Set all your pieces aside someplace safe until you need to reassemble the dash."

    {
      "title": "Insert the key and turn it to the accessory position.",
      "content": "Insert the key and turn it to the accessory position. The ignition switch needs to be set to the accessory position before you can release it from the ignition module. The accessory position is before the starter is engaged, and would normally let you run the vehicle’s electronics without the engine running (when the battery is connected). [5] X Research source The key may be stuck in the ignition switch , but that shouldn’t stop you from turning it. If you don’t have a key, force the module to turn using a flathead screwdriver. It’s okay if you break the switch, you’re going to replace it anyway."
    },
    {
      "title": "Press the release pin inside the hole on the ignition cylinder.",
      "content": "Press the release pin inside the hole on the ignition cylinder. Look on top of the ignition module for a hole that’s slightly smaller in diameter than a pencil. Insert a screwdriver or thin rod into the hole to press down on the release pin inside. The ignition cylinder should unlock. [6] X Research source If you don’t have a small enough screwdriver, you can use anything long and thin enough to press the pin, including a paintbrush handle or even a kabob skewer. Don’t use anything brittle that may break inside the hole to try to press the pin. The ignition switch is connected to the ignition cylinder, which is the round module holding everything together. You’re going to replace the entire cylinder (replacing the switch alone involves electrical work, and the cylinder is likely to be the culprit anyway)."

    {
      "title": "Slide the ignition cylinder out of the steering wheel column.",
      "content": "Slide the ignition cylinder out of the steering wheel column. With the release pin pressed, pull the ignition switch straight out of its place beneath the steering wheel. It should come without any resistance, but it’s common for it to stick a bit in older vehicles that have accumulated a lot of dust and debris around the cylinder. [7] X Research source If the switch feels stuck, make sure you are pressing the release pin firmly enough with your screwdriver or similar tool inside the hole. It’s okay to use some force with the cylinder, but don’t damage the steering column."

      "title": "Get your ignition switch rebuilt if you want to keep the same keys.",
      "content": "Get your ignition switch rebuilt if you want to keep the same keys. Some dealerships will rebuild your existing ignition switch if you would rather not have to switch ignition keys. Rebuilding your switch can vary in price based on the application and may not always be available. [8] X Research source A rebuilt switch should work just as well as a new one. The only real benefit of a rebuilt switch is not having to use new keys. That’s the extend of it, though. If you plan on having the dealership rebuild your ignition switch, you’re probably best off just not disassembling the dash in the first place. Just have the dealer do all of the work."

    {
      "title": "Purchase a new ignition cylinder if yours can’t be rebuilt.",
      "content": "Purchase a new ignition cylinder if yours can’t be rebuilt. Buy a new switch from a manufacturer-specific dealership that will also provide you with new ignition keys to match. Provide the dealership with the year, make, and model of your vehicle along with the VIN number to be sure to get the right part. [9] X Research source You can sometimes get aftermarket ignition switches from your local auto parts store as well. You can find a ton of replacement switches and keys on eBay."

      "title": "Squeeze the release pin on the ignition switch so it’s flush with the side.",
      "content": "Squeeze the release pin on the ignition switch so it’s flush with the side. Press the same release pin that stopped the old switch from coming out. Then, slide the switch into place inside the ignition module. Install it at the same angle and orientation as your old cylinder was installed. [10] X Research source Hold the release pin in until you have the switch inserted. Some switches have an angled release pin that you don’t have to press down as you slide the switch in."

    {
      "title": "Slide the ignition switch into its hole if it’s separate.",
      "content": "Slide the ignition switch into its hole if it’s separate. If your replacement cylinder doesn’t come with the switch preinstalled, slide the switch into the cylinder. Align the shape of the cylinder and the location of the release pin with the coinciding grooves inside the ignition module. Keep pressing it in until you hear the click of the release pin setting into place. [11] X Research source If you don’t hear a click from the release pin, the ignition switch isn’t properly seated yet. You may need to push in on the switch a little to make it click into place. The vast majority of aftermarket cylinders will have the switches preassembled and connected."

      "title": "Reconnect the battery",
      "content": "Reconnect the battery and test the new switch. Test the switch before you completely reassemble the dashboard, just in case there’s an issue. Reconnect the cable to the negative (-) terminal on the battery, then insert the key into the ignition and turn it to start the vehicle. [12] X Research source If the vehicle doesn’t start, contact a mechanic to check your work or try and reinstall the cylinder and try it again."

      "title": "Shut the engine off and disconnect the battery again.",
      "content": "Shut the engine off and disconnect the battery again. Now that you know the new ignition switch works, you can start re-assembling your interior. Remove the cable from the negative terminal on the battery a second time. This will keep you from getting hurt as you work. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Put the dash back together in the opposite order of how it came apart.",
      "content": "Put the dash back together in the opposite order of how it came apart. Dashboards are notorious for the use of overlapping plastic. Start by installing the last parts your removed and go backwards from there. Every vehicle’s interior is different, so the order you install the parts will vary from model to model. [14] X Research source If you find yourself having trouble getting the pieces to fit back together properly, refer to a vehicle specific repair manual for help. Don’t force trim pieces together or they may break. If one of them won’t go on properly, take it off and look things over to see what’s stopping it from sealing properly."

      "title": "Reconnect the battery.",
      "content": "Reconnect the battery. With the dashboard completely assembled and the new ignition switch working, reconnect the cable to the negative (-) terminal on the battery and tighten it with the right sized wrench. [15] X Research source Make sure the cable is secure and can’t jiggle loose."
