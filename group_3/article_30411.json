      "content": "Mandem refers to a group of male friends. Mandem is a UK slang term that refers to a group of male friends, but it can also be used to refer to a group with female friends, too. The term is a combination of the words “man” and “them” and is commonly used by UK roadmen (young, wild guys from the UK). [1] X Research source Example: “I just called mandem to see what we’re doing tonight. We're going out and I’m trying to get lit!” Example: “See mandem down the street? I can’t believe there’s that many guys rolling around tonight.”"

      "content": "Use mandem to refer to your group of male friends. For example, if you and your friends are going to the beach, say something like “Me and the mandem are about to head to the beach.” Mandem is typically viewed as informal, so try to avoid using it around people of higher status, like your boss or landlord. [2] X Research source It’s best to use mandem to refer to your group of friends rather than just a random group of people that you don't know. For example, if you see a large group of your buddies walking down the street, say something like “Peep the mandem down the street. They’re rolling deep.” You can also use the term to refer to a group of female friends, but if you’d prefer to be gender-specific, say galdem instead of mandem."

      "content": "Mandem originates from Jamaican English. The slang phrase mandem is borrowed from Jamaican English, which refers to a group of men as “man dem,” a shortening of the phrase “man and them.” Use was first recorded in the early 2000s among multicultural working class youth in the East End of London. [3] X Research source Jamaican English is also known as Jamaican patois (or Jamaican creole), and is a mix of French and English spoken by Caribbean migrants who came to London after WWII.

      "content": "Using mandem can be considered offensive if you aren’t a Black Briton. Using mandem as a non-Black Briton is considered cultural appropriation in many spaces, as it originates from Jamaican English and is primarily spoken by Black Britons. [5] X Research source If you use mandem as a non-Black Briton, you may offend Black Britons, make them feel disrespected, and cause them to dislike you, which isn’t good for you or society. If you do use mandem to mock or imitate Black Britons, word can travel and cause people to write you off as culturally insensitive."

If you’d prefer to use a phrase that’s more gender-accurate, go with galdem (also known as gyaldem). Like mandem, galdem is used to refer to a group of friends—in this case, female friends.

      "content": "No, mandem always refers to multiple people, not one person. Since mandem is a combination between the words “man” and “them,” it cannot be used to refer to one person. If you were to refer to someone as mandem, they would likely understand what you mean, but it still wouldn’t be proper. To refer to one person using UK slang, go with a term like “bruv” or “bro.” [7] X Research source"

Depending on the context it’s used in, the term can also be an ironic way to say that someone is acting bigger than they actually are, similar to the U.S. slang term, hotshot.

Talk about a big man ting.” Example: “You came across a little coin and now all of a sudden you’re a big man ting, eh?”"
