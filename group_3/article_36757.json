      "content": "Try applying a cornstarch and boric acid mixture to the stain. For stubborn tear stains, combine equal parts of cornstarch and boric acid, along with enough water to make a thick paste, then set the mixture aside. Dampen your dog’s eyes with a clean washcloth, and use a cotton swab or ball to carefully apply the boric acid mixture to the stained area. [4] X Research source Be sure not to get the mixture in your dog’s eyes; just apply it to the stained fur. If your dog tolerates it without pawing at its eyes, let the mixture sit for a couple of minutes. Then thoroughly wipe the area with a damp washcloth. If you have any leftover mixture, refrigerate it and store it for up to a week. If you’d like, make a batch large enough to last you the full week.

      "content": "Clean your dog’s eyes daily, and expect to see results in a few weeks. Saline, pet shampoo, or boric acid and cornstarch may not work after a single use, but you should still keep trying. If you don't see immediate results, clean your dog's eyes daily and do your best to keep its eyes dry. You should see results within a month. [6] X Research source Boric acid will lighten fur, so it's your strongest method. However, saline or tearless shampoo should work over time if you don't have boric acid on hand. Try to be patient. Controlling tear duct stains may take time, but making sure your pet is happy, healthy, and looking its best is well worth the effort."

      "content": "Trim the fur around your dog’s eyes regularly. If possible, take your dog to the groomer every 4 to 6 weeks, or as often as recommended for its breed. Between grooming sessions, carefully, snip long fur around its eyes to keep staining in check. [11] X Research source Offer lots of praise and pea-sized treats to get your dog comfortable with grooming sessions. If it won’t sit still, carefully drape your body over it and secure it with your non-dominant arm. If necessary, recruit a helper to keep it still so you can safely trim its eyes. It’s wise to groom your dog after a brisk walk or playtime so it’s tired. If your dog yelps, gets aggressive, or otherwise seems stressed, give it a break. Don’t force it or handle it roughly if it’s anxious. You’re better off using treats and praise to encourage your dog to enjoy grooming."

Although grain-free diets are more of a trend than something beneficial for your dog that is based on science, it’s possible some dogs have allergies to grains and additives found in many commercial dog foods. In addition to tear stains, excessive scratching and licking or visible skin irritation may indicate an allergy. If you suspect your dog is having allergic reactions, ask its vet if they recommend switching to a grain-free option.

Starting by feeding it a half-and-half mixture of the old and new food, then decrease the amount of old food over the course of several days. Keep in mind that there may be negative health effects from putting your dog on a grain-free diet. Be cautious and talk with your dog’s veterinarian before making the switch."

      "content": "Ask the vet if they recommend allergy medication. Allergies are a common cause of excessive tearing, so the vet may recommend a prescription or over-the-counter oral antihistamine. To give your dog a pill, simply place the prescribed dose in a treat or pill pocket, then offer it to your pup. [15] X Research source Allergies may be the culprit if you notice your dog seems to tear up seasonally or in certain situations. When you notice excessive tearing, try to identify any potential allergens that could be causing the problem. Switching your dog’s food, using air purifiers in your home, and keeping your dog away from smoke and other irritants may help solve the issue."

      "content": "Apply a prescription ointment as directed by the vet. If the vet determines there’s an infection, you’ll need to administer antibiotic eye drops or ointment 3 to 4 times a day. Have a helper gently restrain your dog, carefully hold its eyelids open, then squeeze the prescribed amount of medication into the inside pocket of the lower lid. [16] X Research source Allow your dog to blink, which will spread the medication over the eye. Then, if necessary, repeat the steps on the other side. Take care not to touch the tip of the applicator to your dog’s eyes. Be sure to give your pooch plenty of praise and treats to help make the process less stressful. Never apply ointments, drops, or other medications to your dog’s eyes without consulting a vet."

      "content": "Discuss surgical options if your dog has ingrown eyelashes . Most of the time, tearing and tear stains are nothing to worry about. However, if your dog is diagnosed with ingrown eyelashes, it’ll need corrective surgery. Treatment involves removing small pieces of skin so your dog’s eyelids can sit against the eye without rolling inward and irritating the cornea. [17] X Research source At least 1 to 2 minor surgeries may be required, but most dogs recover without any issues and enjoy full lives free of discomfort. After eyelid surgery, your pooch will need to wear an E-collar for 2 weeks, and you may need to apply drops or ointment to its eyes to prevent infection. If your dog is diagnosed with ingrown eyelashes or inward-turning eyelids, it’s important to have the issue corrected. Eventually, the condition could lead to blindness. Typically, treatment costs $500 for 1 eye and up to $1500 (U.S.) for both eyes. If you need help covering the costs, set up a budget-friendly payment plan with the vet, look online for charitable organizations, or launch a crowdfunding campaign."
