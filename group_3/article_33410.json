[1] X Research source For the 9x9 Sudoku puzzle, answers will be any number between 1 and 9."

At the same time, ensure that every number is used at least once in each row. [2] X Research source So for example, a row filled in with the sequence (1, 3, 1, 4) is incorrect—because it excludes 2 and repeats 1. The sequence (1, 3, 2, 4), though, works for a single row."

To do this, eliminate all of the other possible squares that a certain number could be placed in. Examine the number's position in other columns, rows, and boxes to shed light on which columns, rows, and boxes this number can't be included in again (without repeating itself).

This step is optional, but moving on after narrowing down a number’s location to a few spaces can feel unsatisfying. So, feel free to leave yourself a note. If you determine that 4 has to fit in one of two squares in a given box, write the \"4\" in the top of both squares. [9] X Research source This way, when you find out another number fits into one of the two boxes, you'll know that 4 has to solve for the remaining square. Not only will this help you solve the puzzle faster, but it’s likely to make the puzzle feel less frustrating, too."

To ensure you're always making progress and avoiding going in circles, work through the puzzle one number at a time. Investigate all of the provided clues for a given number before moving on to another. [10] X Research source For instance, go through every clue provided for the number 2. If you find any surefire answers, fill them in. Run through this process once or twice. When you've filled in a good number of squares, more obvious answers will start to crop up (like, for instance, the last remaining square in a box, column, or row)."
