Keep in mind that you can always shred more if one shredded carrot is not enough. Some general equivalents include: [1] X Research source one large carrot = one cup of shredded carrot one pound of carrots = two and half cups of shredded carrots"

[2] X Research source [3] X Research source This will help remove any dirt, chemicals, or germs on the outside of the carrots. Make sure you use full-sized carrots. Baby carrots are hard to shred by hand and you also run the risk of shredding your fingers."

Then, using a vegetable peeler, remove the skins of each of the carrots in turn.. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source If you don't have a vegetable peeler, you can use a knife. Just be careful not to take too much of the carrot away with the peeling."

      "content": "Pick a grater. There are two common types of graters, the box grater and the plane grater. You may have one in your kitchen already, or you may need to pick one up at a kitchen store or at a department store. Box grater . The box grater is a larger grater with three or four sides and a handle on top. The sides have different sized holes. This is so you can have for different sized pieces when you shred the vegetables. Plane grater . A plane grater is a flat, rectangular grater with a handle on one side. You should use whichever one you need for the size of shredded carrot that you want. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Position your grater.",
      "content": "Position your grater. You will want to use your grater on a clean surface in your kitchen, such as on a counter or island. You may also want to place the grater on a cutting board or over a large bowl to catch the grated carrots. Make sure that whatever you use will catch the carrot shreds as you grate them."

    {
      "title": "Shred the carrots.",
      "content": "Shred the carrots. Once you have positioned your grater, grab a carrot and hold it in your hand. Put the bottom edge of the carrot against the side of the grater near the top. Gently apply pressure to the carrot and move your hand down the side of the grater. Once you get to the bottom of the grater, move your hand away from the grater and move the carrot back up to the starting position. Continue this motion until you finish shredding all the carrots. When you get to the very end of a carrot, watch your fingers as you shred. The edges of the grater are sharp and will cut you if you rub against them. You can also use a sharp knife to cut the small remaining piece into thin strips if you don't want to cut your fingers. Be careful not to push too hard on the carrots. You can break the carrot in two and possibly injure your hand. [7] X Research source"

However, if your recipe calls for a certain amount of shredded carrot without specifying how many carrots to use, then you may need to estimate. Keep in mind that one pound of carrots is about the same as two and a half cups of shredded carrots and one large carrot is about the same as one cup of shredded carrots. [8] X Research source"

Take a vegetable peeler and remove the skins of the carrots. Make sure to rub your hands along the carrots when you wash them to get off any excess dirt, germs, or chemicals that may be on the surface. If you don't have a vegetable peeler, you can use a knife instead. Be careful not to cut off too much of the meat of the carrot when you peel them this way."

This is to ensure that they are small enough pieces that they can easily fit in the food processor feed tube.

      "content": "Attach the food processor blade. Every large food processor comes with a shredding blade. Find the shredding blade for the food processor. It should be a large metal disk with raised grater marks on one side. Once you find it, fit it into the food processor. The blade will sit at the very top of the food processor bowl. This is so the shredded carrots can fall off underneath it into the bowl without building up under the blade."

Using the cylinder, push down the carrot against the shredding blade. Keep pushing it down until the whole carrot is shredded. Repeat until all of your carrots are shredded. Do not push down the carrots with your fingers. You can cut your finger or even lose a finger. Always use the plastic cylinder that came with the food processor. Once you are done shredding the carrots, turn off the food processor and wait for the blade to stop moving. Then, take off the top and remove the blade to get to the shredded carrots. [11] X Research source If you own a small food processor, you can still use it to shred carrots. Put the blade into the food processor and lock the bowl and blade into the processor. Then add the peeled and cut carrots. Secure the top and then pulse the food processor until the carrots are small enough for your recipe."

Next, cut one rounded edge off one side of the carrot to keep the carrot from rolling across the counter. Don't throw away the slice of carrot you just cut off.

      "content": "Julienne the carrots. Stack the carrot slices on top of one another so that they are even. Then, use a sharp knife to cut the pieces into small matchsticks. They should be the same width as the thickness you cut them into before so that they make even slices. Continue to cut until all of the carrots are in matchsticks. [14] X Research source Make sure you do this slowly. As you cut the stack of carrots, slowly move your finger back, keeping them away from the edge of the knife. This may prove more difficult as you get closer to the edge of the carrot slices. Just do it as best you can and keep your fingers as far away from the edge of the knife as possible. You can also buy a finger guard if you are worried about cutting your fingers. These are stainless steel tools that help you hold the vegetable while protecting your fingertips from being cut.
