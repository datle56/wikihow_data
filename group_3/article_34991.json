Was anything unusual going on at the time that could have had a lowering effect on blood sugar levels? What's more, stay relaxed . There may not be a bigger problem at hand.

Generally, the symptoms include dizziness, lightheadedness, unsteadiness, dimming or blurring of vision, weakness, fatigue, nausea, cold, clammy skin, fainting, and pale skin. [2] X Research source"

[4] X Research source Sports drinks containing electrolytes return lost minerals to the body, too. Drinking these or water will keep dehydration from happening. Another way of spiking blood pressure (temporarily, that is) is to drink caffeine. Scientists aren't quite sure how or why it does this, but it's thought that it either blocks hormones that widen your arteries or pumps up your adrenaline levels, directly causing a rise in blood pressure.

[6] X Research source Sodium is known to raise blood pressure (and sometimes greatly), so doctors generally recommend limiting it. Check with your healthcare professional before you up your intake -- if you consume an amount that's not good for you, it can lead to heart failure (especially if you're older).

If you have some readily available, consider adding it in this instance. [11] X Research source"

It's common for even healthy individuals to experience a dip in blood pressure when they rise after long periods of sitting. When going to stand (especially upon getting out of bed), sit up straight first and rise slowly. [12] X Research source If you're able, get regular exercise to promote blood flow. If it's a chronic issue, keep up the exercise and eat small meals often."

Do exactly what the physician suggests. In cases of dangerously low blood pressure, the physician may want the patient to go to the emergency room."
