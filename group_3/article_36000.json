      "content": "Find online resources that cover the topics you want to relearn. You don’t have to spend any money on textbooks or printed guides. You can find all the free math resources you’ll ever need online. Online guides will also help you break down topics into smaller parts, which will prevent you from getting overwhelmed. [1] X Research source Practice exercises are another advantage of online resources. Typically, when you get an answer wrong, the website will provide a detailed explanation instead of just giving the correct solution. While there are dozens of topic-specific websites, Math.com is an excellent resource for all areas of math: http://www.math.com . Khan Academy also covers all subject areas and allows you to create a free account. This enables you to set goals, track your progress, and review past lessons to keep them fresh in your mind."

      "content": "Use textbooks if you have them handy. If you have old school books or just prefer printed materials, divide lessons up so you can learn at your own pace. For instance, you could work on one chapter per week. After reading a section, look away from the book and summarize its main ideas out loud. [2] X Research source For example, after reading a section on subtracting negative numbers, you'd say, \"Two negative signs become a positive sign, so 6 - (-3) is like saying 6 + 3, which is 9.\" Reading and speaking out loud will help you reinforce new knowledge."

      "content": "Write formulas and concepts on flash cards. Write a key word or the name of a formula on one side of the card, then write out the formula or definition on the other. You can quiz yourself or have someone else quiz you. Plus, instead of carrying around a textbook or computer, you'll be able to easily study your cards on the go. [3] X Research source For example, write \"Order of Operations\" on one side of an index card. On the other, write \"PEMDAS,\" or the acronym used to help remember the correct order. Under that, write \"parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction.\" Then you could include a couple example problems, like 3 + (2 x 5) - (3 x 3) = 4."

The key to relearning math is to work at your own pace so you can make mastering concepts your goal. In school, it’s tempting to simply memorize formulas and techniques so you can pass a test. If you want to relearn math on your own, give yourself plenty of time to completely understand a technique’s logic before moving on to the next lesson. [5] X Research source For example, you might have memorized how to find the sum of a triangle’s angles in school. If you really get a feel for that formula’s logic, you’ll be able to break trapezoids, pentagons, and other larger polygons into triangles to find unknown angles."

Your online guides will provide you with plenty of problems, so set aside an hour or two per day to learn about a topic then complete practice problems. You’ll also have solutions on hand, but only use them to check your work once you’ve finished working the problems. [6] X Research source It might seem tedious, but practice and repetition will help you rewire your brain and develop mathematical fluency. [7] X Research source"

That way, you’ll reinforce what you’ve learned and prepare yourself to build on that knowledge. [8] X Research source For instance, if yesterday’s lesson was an introduction to the order of operations, take a few minutes to review your practice problems. This will prepare you for today’s lesson, which increases the topic’s difficulty by adding exponents to the mix."

      "content": "Brush up on pre-algebra and algebra. [10] X Expert Source Sean Alexander, MS Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 14 May 2020. Algebra is the gatekeeper for other maths, such as geometry and trigonometry. It might take some time, but digging deep into pre-algebra and algebra will be worth your while regardless of your goals. Algebra is a broad field, and you'll encounter topics ranging from solving for unknown variables to polynomials . Math Goodies is the best pre-algebra resource. Its topics are well organized, and it includes plenty of practice exercises (along with solutions): https://mathgoodies.com/lessons_categories/toc_vol7/ . After getting your feet wet, move on to Math Planet’s algebra section. It’s also well organized, and includes informative videos with each lesson: https://www.mathplanet.com/education/algebra-1 . IXL Learning’s algebra 1 and 2 section might seem a bit overwhelming at first, but it provides an exhaustive list of relevant topics. Clicking on a topic will generate practice problems that increase in difficulty when you give a correct answer. Further, incorrect answers prompt detailed explanations to help you understand where you went wrong: https://eu.ixl.com/math/grade-11 ."

For instance, if you were tiling your kitchen floor, you'd multiply the floor's length and width to find its area, which will help you buy the right amount of tile. Geometry involves lots of theory, formulas, and definitions, so a graphics-rich resource like Math Warehouse will come in handy: http://www.mathwarehouse.com/geometry . Like its algebra page, IXL Learning’s geometry section seems a bit intense at first, but it’s an excellent resource for practice exercises: https://eu.ixl.com/math/grade-10 ."

      "content": "Sink into statistics. From means and standard deviation to probability , statistics deals with the collection, analysis, and organization of data. Whether you're a scientist or a restaurant manager, brushing up on statistics will help you work with data more efficiently. For example, suppose you want to find out how many average daily customers visit your restaurant. You'd add and divide your guest counts for each day that you're open, so if you have 360 guests in a 6 day work week, the average would be 60 guests per day. You could figure out the daily averages over a long period of time to see if your business is growing. The Statistics 101 YouTube channel offers a complete video course: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHa8Yc-ViKWbcV6EQhm3OyBax4pli0mDD . You can then find practice exercises on Stat Trek, which offers practice tests that include solutions with detailed explanations: http://stattrek.com/ap-statistics/practice-test.aspx ."
