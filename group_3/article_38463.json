The second toe is the air toe, and a long second toe supposedly means that you’re in tune with the airs around you and thus able to communicate well. Perhaps you’ll be a great orator, politician, or teacher! [2] X Research source This toe is also associated with logic, power, and truthfulness. With all of these skills in your arsenal, you might be cut out for leadership roles!"

      "content": "Nobody really knows, but it’s almost certainly genetic. It doesn’t appear to be as simple as a lot of other genetically passed-down traits (like the cleft chin), but it does look like Morton’s toe has a big genetic component. If people in your family have a Morton’s toe, you’re more likely to have one. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Somewhere between 3% and 15% of the world’s population are thought to be born with Morton’s toe.

      "content": "Most people won’t experience any issues related to a Morton’s toe. While the human foot is probably more stable and flexible when the big toe is the longest, a little variation in toe length usually isn’t a big deal. The vast majority of people with a Morton’s toe won’t notice any side effects throughout the course of their life. [7] X Research source This is why a lot of people don’t even realize there’s anything unique about their feet when their second toe is a little longer."

      "title": "A Morton’s toe can lead to Morton’s neuroma in some cases.",
      "content": "A Morton’s toe can lead to Morton’s neuroma in some cases. Morton’s neuroma is a condition where you experience pressure and pain on the ball of your foot and tingling or numbness in your toes. It’s often compared to the feeling of having a rock in your shoe. Morton’s neuroma is caused by pressure on a nerve in your foot, and it’s more common in people with a Morton’s toe. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The reason this happens is that the first metatarsal bone (your big toe) is actually too short—not that your second toe is too long. This places an asymmetrical amount of pressure on the second toe, and the ball of your foot ends up compensating for it. Over time, this can cause pain and nerve issues. The other major contributing factor of Morton’s neuroma is wearing high heels, so it’s especially smart to stick to flats if you’ve already got a Morton’s toe. Treatment for Morton’s neuroma include taking it easy, corticosteroids, and surgery (in extreme cases)."
