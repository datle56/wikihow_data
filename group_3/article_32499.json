      "content": "Learn about shy bladder syndrome. If your fear of public restrooms makes it difficult to leave the house, you might actually have a medical condition known as paruresis. Commonly known as a \"shy\" or \"bashful\" bladder, this problem is classified as a general anxiety order. If fear keeps you from being able to pee comfortably while in a locker room, ask your doctor about paruresis. [1] X Research source In addition to anxiety, there can also be physical symptoms of shy bladder such as persistent pain and pressure in the bladder. If this sounds familiar, make sure to consult your doctor. You'll want to get professional advice in treating your condition."

      "content": "Rehearse success. The old saying \"practice makes perfect\" can actually help you pee more comfortably. When you are relieving yourself at home, note your ease and comfort level. Then, imagine you are in a public restroom, feeling equally relaxed. By rehearsing, you can help overcome your anxiety by training your brain to feel more relaxed. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use relaxation techniques.",
      "content": "Use relaxation techniques. You can also try using some common tricks to ease your anxiety. For example, when you are preparing to pee, take several deep, calming breaths. You can also use mental imaging. Try imagining yourself somewhere elseâ€”either a stop where you know you'd be relaxed or somewhere you would feel more comfortable peeing. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Seek help. If this problem is interfering with your daily life, it is time to talk to a medical professional. One option is to talk to your regular doctor about trying medication. There are many options for different types of social anxiety. Alternatively, you could see a mental health specialist. Ask about cognitive therapy for social anxiety disorders. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If you decide to try therapy, make sure you are working with a professional who makes you feel comfortable. It can be useful to ask your primary doctor, or a close friend, to refer someone they trust."

      "title": "Know the etiquette.",
      "content": "Know the etiquette. Maybe you do not have paruresis. Maybe you just have an aversion to locker rooms. In that case, you can make sure you are aware of proper locker room etiquette to try to make yourself more comfortable. For example, do not try to start in-depth conversations at the urinal. Also, do not urinate in the shower. For the most part, just use your manners."

      "title": "Time your visit.",
      "content": "Time your visit. Perhaps using the locker room is unavoidable, but you might be able to make your visits more bearable. For example, if you have issues using the locker room at your gym, try changing up your workout schedule. Go extra early in the morning or later at night to avoid the prime time crowds. The fewer people in the locker room, the more likely it is that you'll feel comfortable peeing."

      "title": "Use the toilet stalls.",
      "content": "Use the toilet stalls. Don't be afraid to use the stalls anytime you're in a locker room. While it's not the same as being in your own home, those cubicles can add an important layer of privacy. You'll also have more privacy in there to use the relaxation techniques you've been practicing. Just remember to wash your hands thoroughly after leaving the stall because they can have significant germs."

      "content": "Find an alternate bathroom. Maybe the locker room is necessary for a shower and a change of clothes, but that doesn't mean that you have to take care of all of your business in there. Chances are, there is an alternate bathroom somewhere on site. Take time to scope out the building. Is there a \"hidden\" restroom? Maybe it's tucked away on a floor that doesn't see much foot traffic. Don't be afraid to head there to relieve yourself. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Get some space.",
      "content": "Get some space. If you're male, the most sanitary and efficient option for peeing is at a urinal. While this can be less than ideal if men and boys are using the same restrooms, you can still make it work. Position yourself at the end of the urinal. Make sure to put an optimal amount of physical space between yourself and the other users. If the urinals are crowded, wait 30 seconds to a minute before you pee. Others will appreciate that you respect their space."

      "content": "Become an advocate. With the increasing number of openly transgender individuals, bathrooms have actually become an important political topic. There are movements to make sure that more buildings have private, comfortable restrooms. That could mean more enclosed stalls and mandatory urinal dividers! Become an advocate for more privacy, and use your voice. For example, write to your Congressman. Or to management at your gym. They might just solve the problem for you! [6] X Research source"
