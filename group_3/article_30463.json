      "content": "Try complimenting his style or the way he carries himself. Keegan says complimenting a guy on his style is a good place to start because it shows that you’re paying attention and appreciating the effort he put in. “That’s a nice thing,” Keegan explains. “It’s like saying, ‘I see you.’” You can also try complimenting specific aspects of his appearance to keep things interesting, rather than just calling him “handsome.” Here are some specific examples to try out: “You have such a cool sense of style. It’s so unique!” “You have such a strong, confident energy about you.” “I really love your vibe. Your outfit is super cool.” “That shirt looks incredible on you.” “I love that jacket. It really suits you!” “You carry yourself with so much confidence.” “You look really dapper today. I love the outfit!” “You look completely dashing tonight.” “You have a super self-assured, confident energy.” “You have such nice eyes. They’re really striking!” “You have a super infectious smile.” “I love that outfit. You look so fit and strong!” “Your style is so effortlessly cool and unique.” “You look so amazing tonight. I love the new haircut.” “You have such a magnetic aura. People are naturally drawn to you.” “Wow, you look incredible. I honestly can’t take my eyes off of you.” “You look so good today. I was totally blushing when I saw you.” “You carry yourself with a lot of strength and power.” “When you walked into the room, I could tell you were a confident person.”"

      "content": "Deepen your connection with a compliment about his personality. If you’re looking for something a little deeper and more meaningful, Keegan suggests picking a specific personality trait you really admire about him and complimenting him on that. He recommends something like, “Hey, you’re a really good listener. I feel like you really listened to me.” Here are some more examples: “You have the best sense of humor. I’m always laughing when we hang out.” “I appreciate your dependability so much. I know I can always count on you.” “You’re so charismatic and charming. You make friends wherever you go!” “You have such a fun, adventurous energy. I have the best time with you.” “You have such a grounded, calming energy. I feel so at ease in your presence.” “I love how passionate you are about your hobbies. It’s so cool to see.” “You’re so considerate of others. I’m lucky to know someone as kind as you!” “I love how easygoing you are. I’m never stressed out or anxious when I’m with you.” “You’re always there for the people who love you, and that’s such a beautiful thing.” “Thank you for always putting in an effort to make me feel special.” “I know I can count on you for anything, and that means the world to me.” “Thank you for always showing up for me. You’re so consistent and trustworthy, and I really appreciate it.” “I really appreciate how protective and supportive you are. I feel so safe when we’re together.” “I love the way you challenge yourself to try new things and have new experiences. You’re so brave and adventurous!”"

      "content": "Be as genuine and sincere as possible. “I think honesty is always the best policy,” says Felix. “It becomes disingenuous when you say it just to try to impress someone. So make sure that everything that you’re talking about is what you really think, feel, and believe, and stop trying to impress the other person with compliments.” In other words, don’t offer compliments just because you’re trying to flatter him or make sure your date goes well—in these cases, he might be able to tell your praises aren’t entirely genuine. Instead, take some time to get to know him, and offer sincere compliments about things you really do appreciate about him, whether they’re physical traits or personality traits. “If you think somebody has beautiful eyes, I think it’s okay to say it,” explains Felix. “Just keep it genuine.”"

      "title": "Don’t overdo it.",
      "content": "Don’t overdo it. Keegan explains that there’s a delicate push-pull dynamic in dating, so it’s important not to go overboard with your compliments right off the bat. A guy should think he still has to win you over after the first date, rather than thinking you’re totally enamored with him, Keegan explains. To avoid coming on too strong, start with just a handful of genuine, meaningful compliments, and don’t feel pressured to keep complimenting him all night."
