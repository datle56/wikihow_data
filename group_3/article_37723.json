      "content": "Many Roku remote problems are caused by low battery. \"The first thing I would do is check the batteries,\" Cathey advises. \"Make sure the batteries are in there, and that they're in there correctly.\" Even if they're inserted correctly, test the remote with a fresh new set. [1] X Research source If your Roku remote is hot to the touch, don't open the battery compartment. This could indicate battery corrosion. Place the remote on a hard, non-flammable surface, and allow it to cool completely before inspecting the batteries. [2] X Research source Once the remote control is completely cool, open the compartment and check the battery connectors for a white powder, which Cathey explains can indicate corrosion. If your remote doesn't have removable batteries, it may need to be charged. If you have an original rechargeable Roku Voice Remote Pro, a full charge takes 3 hours. For the 2nd edition Voice Pro Remote, charge it for 5.5 hours. Once the status light is solid green, the charge is complete. [3] X Research source If your remote has a microphone button, it is one of the voice remote models."

      "content": "Your remote needs an unobstructed path to your Roku device or TV. If you keep your Roku in a closed cabinet or behind the TV, you might experience delayed button presses, or buttons on your remote seeming to not work at all. The status light on your Roku must be visible to you when you use your remote. Place your Roku in front of or beside your TV so there's a clear path between the remote and the device. [6] X Research source If you have a Roku streaming stick and the included cable isn't long enough to move your device to a visible location, try using the advanced wireless receiver or long-range Wi-Fi receiver that came with your device. If you don't have it, or that doesn't work, you can order a free HDMI extender from Roku. [7] X Research source To place your order, fill out the form at https://my.roku.com/hdmi . Alternatively, you can buy an HDMI extension cable from Amazon or another retailer."

      "content": "A weak Wi-Fi connection can cause responsiveness problems with your Roku remote. If your remote feels slow or doesn't always respond to your button presses, a weak connection could be the culprit. If your remote works at all, you can use it to perform the following steps. If not, you can use the Roku mobile app on your Android, iPhone, or iPad. Just make sure your phone or tablet is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your Roku, open the app, and tap Remote to get started. Press the Home button and select Settings . Select Network . Select About . Check the signal strength value. If you see \"Fair\" or \"Poor,\" the connection to your Wi-Fi router is not strong enough. You can improve your wireless signal strength by: Moving devices that can interfere with your connection away from the router, such as microwaves, cordless phones, or baby monitors. Moving your Wi-Fi router closer to your Roku TV or streaming device. Adjusting the antennas on your router. Not using other devices on the network while streaming on your Roku. [8] X Research source"

As long as your TV supports CEC, you should be able to use your Roku streaming stick's remote to control the power and volume on your TV seamlessly. If the TV doesn't support CEC or it's disabled, your remote can only use IR, which is more sensitive to obstructions and interference. The steps to enable CEC differ on all TVs, but you'll usually find the option in your TV Settings or Setup menu. On Roku TVs, go to Settings > System > Control other devices (CEC) and enable \"System audio control\" and \"1-touch play\". [9] X Research source On LG TVs, go to Settings > All Settings > General > SIMPLINK (HDMI-CEC) and set \"SIMPLINK\" to \"On.\" On Phillips TVs, go to Setup > TV settings > Installation > Preferences . Select EasyLInk , and set all of the following options to On: Master EasyLink , Auto TV , and RC key . On Samsung TVs, go to Settings > System > Expert Settings > Anynet+ (HDMI-CEC) and select On .
