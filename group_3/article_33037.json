      "content": "The goal of Blackjack is to beat the dealer’s hand without going over 21. In Blackjack, every player is competing against the dealer—not each other. In a given round, the player’s ultimate goal is to get a hand that’s higher than the dealer’s (without being higher than 21, or \"busting\"). Only by beating the dealer can a player win their bet. Players determine the value of their hand by tallying up the point values of their cards: [1] X Research source 2 through 10: The number listed on the card (e.g., 2 is worth 2 points) Jack, Queen, King: 10 points Ace: 1 or 11 points (the player gets to choose) An Ace and a 10, Jack, Queen, or King equals 21 points and is known as a Blackjack."

If you have poker chips on hand, divide them among the players so everyone can make their bets.

If the total is pretty high (like 17 or 18, which is very close to 21), “staying” (leaving your hand as-is) is probably your best option; if your total is on the low end (like in the single digits), “hitting,” or getting another card added to your hand, could be beneficial. [7] X Research source Staying simply means that you don’t want the dealer to give you another card that’ll get added to your total. This is signified by holding your hand flat and waving it. [8] X Research source Hitting means that you’d like the dealer to add another card to your hand, and is signified by tapping the game table with your pointer and middle finger. You can hit as many times as you’d like until you reach or go over 21. [9] X Research source"

[11] X Research source Keep in mind that the dealer has to play by different rules than the rest of the players. If the dealer gets a Blackjack, all the players automatically lose the round, unless they have a Blackjack themselves. In this case, they push —in other words, the player who got Blackjack simply gets their original bet back. A push also occurs anytime the player’s hand matches the dealer’s."

Place the same number of chips down for your split bet, and then ask for the dealer to “hit” each of your hands. Think of splitting as just giving yourself an extra turn for the round—each hand is separate from the other. Even if one hand busts, you still continue playing with your other hand. [14] X Research source If you split 2 Aces, the player can only hit each hand one time. If you end up getting a point total of 21 on one of your hands, this isn’t considered a Blackjack (in terms of payout), but it still pushes if the dealer gets a Blackjack. Any 2 cards with the same point value can split, like a Queen and a Jack (which are both worth 10 points). [15] X Research source This rule varies by casino, though, so double-check with your dealer before you try this maneuver. Separate your pointer and middle finger into a “V” shape and place them on the table to let the dealer know that you’re splitting."

Doubling down only lets you hit once, but it can be a lucrative way to have a successful round if you feel that luck is on your side. [16] X Research source It’s best to double down when you have a lower hand, like an Ace/11, since getting a 10-value card would jump you up to a Blackjack. Signal to the dealer that you want to double down by touching an extended pointer finger to the game table. If you don’t feel like doubling your bet, feel free to bet a lower amount instead. [17] X Research source You can double down on any hand that’s lower than 21, including split hands. The main thing to remember is that you can’t hit after you’ve doubled-down."

This “insurance” bet can be equal to or less than your original bet. [20] X Research source If the dealer has a Blackjack: Your first bet loses (unless your hand is a Blackjack as well), but your side bet gets a 2 to 1 payout.

[23] X Research source Let’s say the dealer’s first card is a 6, and then their next card is a King (valued 10), giving them a total of 16. The rules would require the dealer to hit again, since their hand is lower than 17, but the chances of them getting an Ace, 2, 3, or 4 are low compared to the other cards.
