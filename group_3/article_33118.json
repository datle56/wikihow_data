      "content": "Buy 2 decks of cards. Double solitaire revolves around the 2 players building 4 piles of all the cards. This means 2 piles of all the hearts cards, 2 piles of all the clubs cards, 2 piles of all the spades cards, and 2 piles of all the diamond cards. You can buy decks of cards at your local supermarket, online, or in your local games store. Make sure each player has their own deck."

      "content": "Open the decks and remove the joker cards. Each deck of cards comes with 2 joker cards, 1 black and white and the other 1 in color. Joker cards are included in the deck because they are required for some card games. If you lose a card, you can use 1 of the jokers as a replacement card. Write the number and suit of the card you lost on the joker."

      "content": "Shuffle both decks before starting the game. Most decks are sold with the cards in order. If you and your friend play without shuffling the decks, the game will be pretty straightforward. You don't have to be a master of cards to shuffle the decks. Spread the cards out on a table face down and mix them up. Once you've mixed them well, reorganize the cards into a pile. [1] X Research source Shuffle each deck separately. You don't want 1 person having 2 duplicates of the same card."

      "content": "Set up the tableau with each deck. With the deck facing down, pull 1 card from the top and lay it down facing up. Moving from left to right, place 6 cards facing down. Next, place a card facing up on the second pile, and 5 cards facing down on the following 5 rows. Place a card facing up on the third pile, and 4 cards facing down on the next 4 rows. [2] X Research source Continue placing the cards down in the same manner. For example, place a card facing up on the fourth pile and 3 cards facing down on the next 3 rows. At the end, pile 7 should have 1 card facing up and 6 cards facing down. Set up 2 separate tableaus for you and your friend."

If you want to use the stock pile, you and your friend need to take the top card from the stock pile. Whoever has the higher card plays first. [4] X Research source If you and your friend use the top card from the stock piles, place the card back to the bottom of the deck."

To play a card, you must play a red card under a black card or vice versa. [5] X Research source For example, if 1 of the piles has a 7 of hearts on it and you pull a 6 of spades from your stock pile, you can place your 6 of spades below the 7 of hearts. You must place the cards sequentially. A 6 must be placed after a 7, a 3 after a 4, a jack after a queen. If you can't play a card from the stock pile, you can return it to the bottom of your stock pile. You cannot place a red suited card under a red suited card or vice versa."

[11] X Research source Don't mix more than 1 deck at a time in a single area. If you're spreading the cards out, it's very easy for them to get mixed together."

However, if you have a red 7 in your stock pile and a black 8 on the tableau, you can place the red 7 below the black 8.
