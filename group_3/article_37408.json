      "content": "“Sorry but you have the wrong number.” Be upfront with the sender to avoid more accidental texts. Let the sender know you’re not who they think you are immediately. This is a polite way to tell a stranger they’ve got the wrong number. [1] X Research source Talking to strangers can be dangerous, especially when they’re hiding behind a screen. Be cautious when responding to a text from someone you don’t know. If you text a stranger back, never tell them personal information. Keep your full name and where you live secret.

If you don’t want to play any trolling games, this is a great way to stop any more accidental texts. No need to go into details, just a simple “I’m not…” will suffice. [3] X Research source Be aware of scam messages. If you’re offered a free prize from a stranger and all you have to do is give them information or click a link, delete the text! Scammers will promise you a number of things to try and hack into your accounts.

      "title": "“Who’s this?”",
      "content": "“Who’s this?” Double check to make sure you didn’t lose a contact. It’s not likely, but you never know if you accidentally deleted a number or text thread. A simple question can let you know if you have received an accidental text from a stranger. [5] X Research source If it’s definitely someone you don’t know, have a little fun by sending them a meme or responding with a song lyric that matches their name."

    {
      "title": "“Hi.”",
      "content": "“Hi.” If someone random sends you a “Hey,” wave back. You never know where the conversation could lead next, so this is a sure way to have a little fun. Start up a conversation, making sure to tell the stranger you’re not who they’re looking for. Who knows? Maybe you’ll make a new friend! It may be tempting to try and pretend to be the person the stranger is looking for, but catfishing is never a good idea. [6] X Research source Remember that your feelings aren’t the only thing at play. Be considerate of the sender’s feelings and tell them they’ve got the wrong number."

    {
      "title": "“Nice to meet you.”",
      "content": "“Nice to meet you.” Send this message if they’ve sent you a scandalous picture or a friendly introductory text. You may not be the person they’re looking for, but maybe you want in on some of the action! You can play this one of two ways: flirtatious or buddy-buddy. Before responding though, make sure you tell this stranger you’re not who they’re looking for. Add a flirty emoji to your response like a simple “😉” or a more upfront “😏.” Simply introduce yourself as you would when meeting someone new. Try something like, “Hey! It’s nice to meet you. My name is…”"

      "content": "Send a picture. A picture can say a thousand words. Have some fun with this stranger and send them a picture they are definitely not expecting! Be silly or serious, the choice is yours. [7] X Research source Are they looking for someone? Send them a random selfie to say “I’m not who you think I am!” Did they send a pic of their latest 'fit? Replicate their pose and send it back to them, writing, “Wrong number.” Did they just confess their love for you? Take a picture of you pointing to yourself with “Me?” to let them know they’ve got the wrong number. Be careful when sending pictures to anyone online, especially if you’re underage. Before sending, think about if you would want the picture shown to your mother. Any and everything you post online, even through text, can come back to haunt you. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "“What’s for dinner?”",
      "content": "“What’s for dinner?” You’ve just got an invitation meant for someone else, so you might as well ask what’s cooking. Maybe they text you “Hey meet us at 6” or “Don’t forget the gravy.” Have a little fun and ask them what they’re eating!"

      "title": "“LOL don’t think this was meant for me!”",
      "content": "“LOL don’t think this was meant for me!” Have a good laugh with your friend about their mistake. Maybe they opened up the wrong text thread and sent you a flirty text meant for their partner. That’s embarrassing, but also hilarious! Let your friend know everything’s chill with a “😂” or “🙈.”"

    {
      "title": "“What?”",
      "content": "“What?” Answer a random question with a question. You might not realize you’ve received an accidental text until you're deep in conversation—and the sender might not know it either! Ask for more information if you're asked a question like, “How’s the new place?” or “What are you bringing tonight?” [10] X Research source"

      "content": "“OMG what happened?” If your friend has left you out of the loop, you must know what’s up. Did you just get sent a long message full of drama you didn’t know was going down? Replying with true shock will help your friend realize they’ve got the wrong number, and maybe they’ll fill you in on the tea."

      "content": "“? ??” Give them the heads up that you have no idea what they’re talking about. Maybe you got sent a long text about how someone broke up, or a message about making sure to grab something from the store. They probably opened the wrong text thread. A few question marks can have them checking the contact and apologizing for the mistake. If emojis are your thing, try “👀👀👀.”"

Maybe they sent a text about you to you instead of another friend. There’s a high chance this was no accident, and they meant for you to see the text so you’d know how they feel. Ask follow-up questions like, “Do you really think that?” or “What do you mean?” to get them talking. Throw a few “😂” into your response to keep things playful."
