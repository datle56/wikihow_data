      "content": "Look for green, brown, or orange mold spots on your ceiling. Usually, you’ll be able to spot mold on your ceiling from far away. Check for other indicators too, like cracked or peeling paint, discoloration, recurrent black streaks, bulging and/or a musty, damp smell. [1] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Examine the material used to construct the ceiling, too. If your ceiling is made of a porous material (popcorn ceiling, wood, drywall, etc.), the mold cannot be killed and will likely come back later. You will have to remove the affected portion of the ceiling and replace it. [2] X Expert Source Mike Kapur Certified Mold Assessor & Home Inspector, Sonic Home Inspections Expert Interview. 19 August 2020. Mold is different from “ghosting,” another phenomenon that can cause discoloration in your ceiling. Ghosting typically follows the pattern of the framing in the attic, and the discoloration is caused by dirt or soot sticking to the ceiling."

      "content": "Remove mold with vinegar, bleach, hydrogen peroxide, or borax. There are many natural solutions that you can make to clean mold and clean it up quickly. Choose one of these solutions and mix it in a large bucket to clean your ceiling with: [4] X Research source White vinegar: Pour undiluted white vinegar into a spray bottle. [5] X Research source White vinegar is a natural cleaner that will sink into the drywall, cleaning mold from the surface and the inside of the wall. Bleach: Fill a bucket with warm water, then add 1 c (240 mL) of bleach for every 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water. Keep in mind that while bleach removes mold from surfaces, it does not fully kill mold inside the drywall. Hydrogen peroxide: Pour undiluted 3% hydrogen peroxide into a spray bottle. Hydrogen peroxide is an antifungal and an antibacterial that kills and removes mold. Borax: Fill a bucket with water. Add 1 cup (240 g) of Borax for every 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water, then mix thoroughly. Borax is a natural cleaning product that does not emit dangerous fumes."

      "content": "Spray the cleaning solution onto the mold, then let it sit for 10 minutes. Pour your cleaning solution into a spray bottle, then spray a liberal amount of it onto all of the mold that you can see. Let the solution sit for about 10 minutes so it penetrates into the ceiling.
