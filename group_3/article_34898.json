      "content": "Wash your hair. Hair spray will work better in clean hair, so it’s best to start the process fresh from the shower. Also, mohawks and liberty spikes can last for a few days, so you want to make sure the product from the last styling is completely gone."

      "title": "Blow dry and remove tangles.",
      "content": "Blow dry and remove tangles. You’ll want your hair to be light and fluffy for the actual styling, and blow drying will help create some volume. Make sure that your hair is free from any knots and tangles by running a comb through it as you blow dry. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Tease your hair if you need more volume.",
      "content": "Tease your hair if you need more volume. If your hair is still flat without enough body to support a hawk, run a comb backwards against the grain of your hair to give it a little more texture. Pushing more hair down to your scalp will also create a better foundation for the mohawk or spikes to rest on."

      "title": "Look for a good hair spray.",
      "content": "Look for a good hair spray. While punks in the 80s used crazy products like glue and starch to keep their mohawks solid, there are plenty of sprays nowadays that won’t damage your hair. Use a hair spray with a tagline like “concrete”, “frozen”, or “solid”, or with a description of extreme styles with height. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Get a gel for the tips of your spikes or mohawk. To make the tips of your spikes pointier and resistant to fraying, grab a gel as well. Again, look for \"max hold\" or \"freezing\" gels. You can also use super hard gel. [3] X Expert Source Kana Ishii Licensed Cosmetologist Expert Interview. 22 December 2021."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use gel only on the tips.",
      "content": "Use gel only on the tips. Hairspray will form the basis of the hold for you style, but gel is only for the tips of your liberty spikes or outside edge of your mohawk. While gel gives a lot of hold to shorter styles, it's too heavy to use as a main product, and will cause your mohawk or liberty spikes to fall over."

    {
      "title": "Cut or trim your hair first.",
      "content": "Cut or trim your hair first. If you haven't already shaved the sides of your hair, you're going to need to do this for a real mohawk. You'll need clippers, the right size guard, and some rubber bands or masking tape."
    },
    {
      "title": "Map out your hair.",
      "content": "Map out your hair. Visualize the strip that will be left behind and what will be shaved. Make sure the strip is wide enough to support the finished style, usually about 2-3 inches in width, centered on your head. If your hair is shorter use tape to mark off where you want the mohawk: put the tape anywhere that you want hair to be left. If your hair is long, try using rubber bands. Use a comb to section off the hair that will make up your mohawk, then rubber band all of it into small ponytails or buns where the clippers can’t reach it."

      "title": "Clip the exposed sides.",
      "content": "Clip the exposed sides. Test the guard size to make sure it's the right length, then adjust if it's too long. Start shaving against the grain, starting with the front and moving to the back of your head. Shaving the front will be easy because you can see it as you shave, but for the back you’ll either need help, or a mirror positioned behind you."

Don’t be worried about using too much product: your hair will feel wet and sticky, but you're going to blow dry it soon. The bottom of your hair is going to hold the weight, so you want it to be extra stiff."

      "content": "Work towards the back. Use the same technique again for the final sections of your mohawk: lifting, spraying and then blow drying. But while you can see the front in the mirror, the back is a little trickier to manage. Position a mirror behind you, or take frequent breaks as you’re styling to check out the hawk from the side.

      "title": "Touch up the mohawk.",
      "content": "Touch up the mohawk. When you’re finished, check the mohawk out from both sides and make any adjustments that you need to. If there are big gaps or open holes in your hair, carefully close the sections together, apply more hairspray, and blow dry again. Repeat for any remaining gaps. Use some gel to solidify and connect the outside edge of your mohawk if you want."

      "content": "Section off your spikes. Once the hair is dry, you’ll want to decide how big you want your spikes to be: 2-3 inches is the norm. It’s really up to personal preference, but you’ll also want to make sure that the base of the spike can support the weight of the hair.

    {
      "title": "Lift and spray the first teased spike.",
      "content": "Lift and spray the first teased spike. Undo the rubber band, then lift the section up in the direction that you want it to face. Some wearers of liberty spikes have the first spike pointing straight up from their forehead, while others prefer it to be angled downwards. Once you’ve decided which you prefer, hold the hair out with your non-dominant hand and apply hair spray with your dominant hand. Apply extra spray to the base, then spray up along the length of the spike."

      "title": "Tease the next spike.",
      "content": "Tease the next spike. As with the first spike, comb your hair downwards to give it more texture and body, then sculpt it back up into the spiked shape you want. This will help it hold the spray better and have more structure on its own."

      "content": "Use mirrors to see the back. Once you get to your final few spikes, it might be hard to see what you’re doing. Position a mirror behind your head so that it reflects the back of your head to your main mirror, or turn your head every once in a while to look as you spray."

If they are, comb as much of the product out as you can, then lift it to the right angle. Re-apply the hair spray and blow dry again. Repeat your adjustments as necessary."
