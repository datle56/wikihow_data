OM Licensed Acupuncturist & Diplomate of Oriental Medicine Expert Interview. 25 August 2021. You should spend about 10 seconds on each point. [5] X Research source You can either use the tip of your finger or your knuckle to gently massage the points. Try to keep your nail away from the skin. Massage in small circles, not back and forth. Also, try to keep your finger straight if you're using a fingertip. These massage techniques apply for all the points around the eye. To help you find them, you might feel a slight pain or feel a depression at each point. Make sure that you're rubbing around your eye and not in your eye.

      "content": "Find the wind mansion. This point is directly at the base of your skull. It is directly in the middle. Massaging this point with the tips of your fingers helps some with eye fatigue. You can also try placing just the tip of your middle finger on this point and applying gentle pressure, as you tip your head backward to help apply that pressure. You can also use your thumb. This point supposedly helps with most areas of the head, including the eyes."

      "content": "Locate the heavenly pillar. This location is actually two pressure points on the back of your neck. Find the base of the skull (where the wind mansion is), then move an inch down. Now, move an inch out on each side into the muscles at the back of your neck. Gently massaging each of these spots with your middle finger helps some people with eyestrain. You can also apply pressure similar to the method for the wind mansion, except use both of your middle fingers."

[9] X Research source Use a thumb roll to apply pressure. Press down using your thumb pad. Let it roll down or up the knuckle as you bend your thumb. Move about 1/8 of an inch up and down as you bend and straighten your thumb. [10] X Research source"

It's not actually between the toes but on the top. Massage the area gently with your finger tips. To make it easier, you can also use the heel of your other foot to gently press into this point for 30 seconds. [11] X Research source"
