To get the radius of your inflated balloon, place a ruler on each side of the center of the balloon, measure the distance between them, and divide it in half. For instance, you place your balloon between two rulers and find that the distance is 10 centimetres (3.9 in). Divide this in half to get the radius, 5 centimetres (2.0 in)."

Plug the radius into the formula to get your sum. For instance,: V = 4 3 π 5 3 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {4}{3}}\\pi 5^{3}} , or about 523.33 cm 3 {\\displaystyle ^{3}} or 206.04 in 3 {\\displaystyle ^{3}} ."

Stop when the balloon is the same size as the balloon filled with gas. If you accidentally put too much water in, carefully pour some out. [2] X Research source It will be difficult to get the balloons to exactly the same size. To be more exact, wrap a cloth tape measure around the center of the water balloon to check its circumference. Adjust until it's the same as the gas-filled balloon's. Have someone help you measure the circumference of the water balloon while you hold it."

Record the amount of water that was in the balloon. The volume of water will equal the volume of gas in the other balloon. [3] X Research source If your water-filled balloon is the same size as the gas-filled balloon that you determined (via V = 4 3 π r 3 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {4}{3}}\\pi r^{3}} ) had a volume of 523.33 cm 3 {\\displaystyle ^{3}} , then you should measure about 523 milliliters (18 fl oz) of water poured out of it (1 ml = 1 cm 3 {\\displaystyle ^{3}} )."

      "content": "Set up a flask and beaker for a more accurate measurement. Get a flask that has a stopper with an outlet for tubing. Fill the flask with the gas you want to measure, with the stopper in place, and pinch the tubing so no gas escapes. Fill a beaker with water, place a shallow dish on top of it, and turn both upside down. Record the level of the water in the beaker using the measurement lines on its side. This technique only works for gases that are insoluble in water."

      "content": "Measure the volume of the gas using the beaker. Slide the tubing underneath the edge of the beaker, in the shallow pan that has now partially filled with water. Gas will escape through the tubing and bubble up, pushing some of the water out of the beaker. Once all of the gas has bubbled up, record the water level using the measurement lines on the side of the beaker. The difference between the water levels before and after the gas entered the beaker equal the volume of the gas. For instance, if the water level was at 55 milliliters (1.9 fl oz) before the gas entered, and 65 milliliters (2.2 fl oz) afterwards (remember that the beaker is upside down, so the levels will go up numerically), then there is 10 milliliters (0.34 fl oz) of gas in the beaker."

If you know what gas you are measuring, use the formula for mass (m) using the density (d) and volume (v) of the gas: m = d × v {\\displaystyle m=d\\times v} . You'll need to look up the density of the gas in a table online or in a textbook. [9] X Research source For instance, imagine you are measuring 523.33 cm 3 {\\displaystyle ^{3}} of carbon dioxide, CO 2 {\\displaystyle _{2}} , which has a density of 1.8421 kg/m 3 {\\displaystyle ^{3}} . The mass of your sample would be 1.8421 kg/m 3 {\\displaystyle ^{3}} (0.0018421 g/cm 3 {\\displaystyle ^{3}} ) x 523.33 cm 3 {\\displaystyle ^{3}} , which equals 0.96403 g."
