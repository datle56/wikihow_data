Make sure there is adequate space for names or initials in each of the squares. [2] X Research source Alternately, print off a football pool grid. These can be found doing an online search (look for \"printable football grid\" to find one) and can be printed off on an 8-1/2 inch x 11 inch (21.5cm x 27.9cm) piece of paper, consisting of 100 squares."

      "content": "Decide the pricing and winnings . You'll need to decide how much to charge per square and how to pay out the pot. Pricing the squares: A usual price is $1.00 per square, for a total pot of $100.00. Paying out the pot: The most common way is to pay something at the end of each quarter. You can decide what percent of the pot will be paid out each time. For example, 25 percent after the 1st quarter, 25 percent after the 2nd quarter and so on until 100 percent of the pot is paid out. Large Super Bowl Pools cost can $100 per square,(for a total pot of $10,000) and pay $100 for every score change. For example, at the beginning of the game, the person with 0-0 gets $100. If the first score is a touchdown, then the person with the correct 6-0 gets $100. If the PAT is good, then the person with 7-0 gets $100, and so on. You can pay $500 for the first three-quarter scores, then pay the handsome balance to the person with the correct final score."

Create 10 small squares of paper and then write one number (zero thru nine) on each piece of paper. Fold the 10 squares and put them into something to draw from, like a hat or an ice cream container. Choose somebody to draw one number at a time. As the numbers are drawn out, fill them in across the top, starting from left to right. Fold them back up and do the same for the left side, top to bottom. When finished, the numbers will be in random order across and down the grid."

      "content": "Decide how winners will be determined. A very common way is to use the \"last digit\" method. Basically, take the last digits of each team's score and find where those numbers intersect on the grid. For example, if the final score is A's 19 and F's 12, line up the 9 from the 19 of the A's and the 2 from the F's side. The intersecting square when you draw your fingers down and across from 9 and 2 is the winner. (This is the exact same method used for reading a street map.)"
