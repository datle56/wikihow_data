      "content": "Measure the width and length where you will hang the valance. To determine the dimensions of your valance fabric, measure the area where you will hang the valance. Measure the window from side to side to get the width of the valance, and measure from the curtain rod to the part of the window where you want the valance to end to get the length of your valance. Record these measurements. You can make your valance as long or short as you want, but they typically only cover the top quarter or third of the window. Therefore, if your window is 45 inches (110 cm) long, then your valance might be 12 inches (30 cm) to 15 inches (38 cm) long."

      "title": "Add 5 inches (13 cm) to the width and 3 inches (7.6 cm) to the length.",
      "content": "Add 5 inches (13 cm) to the width and 3 inches (7.6 cm) to the length. To ensure that you will have enough fabric to hem the edges, you will need to add onto the measurements you took. Add 5 inches (13 cm) to the width measurement and 3 inches (7.6 cm) to the length measurement. For example, if the width measurement was 23 inches (58 cm), then add 5 inches (13 cm) for a new total of 28 inches (71 cm). If the length measurement was 30 inches (76 cm), then add 3 inches (7.6 cm) for a total of 33 inches (84 cm)."

      "content": "Multiple the width by 1.5 if you want a gathered valance (optional). For a gathered look, multiply the width of your window by 1.5 and use this as your width measurement for the valance fabric. For example, if the width of your window is 30 inches (76 cm), then you could multiply by 1.5 for a total of 45 inches (110 cm). However, having a gathered curtain is a style choice, not a necessity."

Choose a lightweight fabric for a sheer valance, or opt for a fabric that is meant for home d√©cor for a heavier valance.Make sure that you purchase a little more fabric than you think you might need. Opt for cotton, lace, or a sheer fabric for a lightweight curtain. Choose brocade, flannel, or wool for a heavier curtain."

Then, measure and mark the inside of the fabric with fabric chalk or a pencil to indicate where you need to cut it. You can use a ruler or other straight edge to draw lines on the fabric. Cut along these lines"

Iron all along the folded edge until the fabric stays in the folded position without holding it down. Make sure that you use a setting on the iron that will not damage your fabric, such as a delicate setting for delicate fabrics. [1] X Research source Use the lowest setting if you are unsure. You can also place a t-shirt or towel over the fabric and iron over that to protect the fabric."
