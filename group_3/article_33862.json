      "content": "Parchment paper or foil prevents the bacon from sticking to the tray. Use a rimmed baking tray that has enough space for all of the bacon strips in the package. Rip off a piece of parchment paper or aluminum foil that’s large enough to cover the bottom of the tray. [2] X Research source If you’re using aluminum foil, wrap it around the edges of the tray. That way, you have an easy cleanup because the foil traps the grease without getting it on the actual tray. Avoid using wax paper since it will leave a waxy residue on your bacon once it cooks."

      "content": "Bacon strips that overlap will stick together when you cook them. Start laying a strip of bacon flat on one end of the tray. Line the strips across the pan so they’re touching each other but not overlapping. [3] X Research source If you want crispier bacon, put a wire rack on the tray and lay the strips on it. The heat will cook the bacon from all sides evenly and get a nice crispy texture. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Your bacon will get crispier the longer you leave it in your oven.",
      "content": "Your bacon will get crispier the longer you leave it in your oven. Once your oven is fully heated, set your tray of bacon on the center rack. After about 15 minutes, check on your bacon to see how crispy it is. If it’s still soft and you want it a little crispier, put it back in your oven for another few minutes before checking it again. [5] X Research source Keep the bacon a little on the softer side when you’re par-cooking it, especially if you’re using it to wrap around other ingredients. That way, it’ll still be flexible and juicy when you reheat it. If you have thick-cut bacon or want the strips extra-crispy, you may need to cook it for 25–30 minutes instead."

      "title": "Paper towels absorb the excess grease from your bacon.",
      "content": "Paper towels absorb the excess grease from your bacon. Line a plate with a few layers of paper towels. Pull your bacon out of the oven and transfer the strips onto the paper towels with a pair of tongs. Pat the bacon with another paper towel and let the strips cool to room temperature. You can save and store bacon grease if you want to incorporate it into other dishes, like eggs, potatoes, or veggies. If you’re throwing out bacon grease in the pan, wait for it to cool before wiping it up with a paper towel. Avoid pouring it down the sink since it could harden and clog your pipes."

      "content": "Refrigerating precooked bacon keeps it safe to eat. Keep your bacon in a resealable plastic bag, in an airtight container, or on a plate wrapped with foil. Label the container with the date so you know when to use it by. Your bacon will taste the best if you use it within a day of cooking it, but it will stay fresh and safe to use for one week. [6] X Research source Keep a paper towel inside the bag or container to help absorb the grease so your bacon stays crispy."

Wrap each strip in a piece of wax paper or parchment paper before putting them into a resealable plastic bag so the pieces don’t stick together. You’ll have the best flavors if you thaw and use the bacon within the next month.

You can use your stove, microwave, or oven to reheat your bacon to give it a delicious crispy texture. [8] X Research source Microwave : Put your bacon on a plate and cook it for 30–60 seconds on medium power. You can set the strips on paper towel to absorb any excess grease. Stove : Heat a skillet over medium heat and add your bacon. Let the strips warm up for 2–3 minutes until they're sizzling. Oven​​ : Set your oven to 350 °F (177 °C) and heat the bacon strips on a baking tray for 8–10 minutes. [9] X Research source"
