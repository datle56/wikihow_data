      "title": "Find the key and accompanying chords",
      "content": "Find the key and accompanying chords . Determine which key the piece is in, and learn the basic chords for each key signature. In a major key, the one, four, and five chords are always major, and together they make a common chord progression. For example, in the key of C major, you can play the C major, F major, and G major chords. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Play the root of each chord with your left hand.",
      "content": "Play the root of each chord with your left hand. The root of the chord is the note the chord is named after. Play this note with your left hand on any lower octave as you play the rest of the chord with your right. For example, cycle through the C major, F major, and G major chords in order, playing the C, F, and G on a lower octave with your left hand. [2] X Research source You can play the root note on your right hand as well, if you like."
    },
    {
      "title": "Invert the chords.",
      "content": "Invert the chords. This just means playing a different note of the chord in the bassline. So instead of playing the C in a C major chord with your left hand, play the E as you play the C and G with your right. Try play the same chord progression (C, F, G) as you alter which notes are played on the bass. Now you're changing the melody and the bassline at the same time. Here's as an example of a simple chord progression, with the steadily rising bassline in bold : [3] X Research source C / E G D / G B E / C G F / A C G / B D C / E G If you like, you can play the F an octave lower."

    {
      "title": "Hop octaves.",
      "content": "Hop octaves. So far, you've stuck to a walking bassline, meaning it changes on each beat. Now try a bassline with some rests, and that covers more than one octave. Here's another example in the key of C with four beats per measure. Once again, the bassline is in bold: low C / E G (hold chord for two beats) C one octave higher / E G low C' / E G repeat this pattern in second measure with G / B D repeat with F / A C"

    {
      "title": "Combine these approaches.",
      "content": "Combine these approaches. Combine the chord progression and the change in rhythm to construct more variations with the same basic tools. Here's a simple combination of the examples above: C / E G (hold for two beats) D / G B E / C G"
    },
    {
      "title": "Experiment with more complex basslines.",
      "content": "Experiment with more complex basslines. Here's a progression that emphasizes the bass line: Play a C chord (C E G) on each beat of the measure, or hold it down. Play C , D , D# , E with your left hand sequentially."

    {
      "title": "Insert other chords in the same key (optional).",
      "content": "Insert other chords in the same key (optional). If you'd like to make your bassline a bit less predictable, throw in a chord that belongs in the same key. Sticking with the key of C, try adding an A minor chord: A + Câ™®+ E."
    },
    {
      "title": "Adjust to your genre.",
      "content": "Adjust to your genre. Each genre has its own rules of music theory, and traditional ways to construct basslines. There's a lot more you can learn by listening closely to songs and talking to other musicians. Try a simple experiment emphasizing different beats of the bassline to see how it affects the piece. Classical piano basslines tend to emphasize the second and fourth beat of a 4/4 measure, while rock music and rhythm & blues emphasize the first and second beat. In triple time signatures such as 3/4, the first beat is usually emphasized."
