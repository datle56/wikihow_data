      "content": "Snuggling with you makes him feel guilty about his infidelity. You used to be able to sit on the couch together, cuddled up against him, but now he finds a reason to get up from where he’s lounging as soon as you try to join him. The stress of having other partners could be overwhelming for him to the point that he can’t decompress around you any more. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "With multiple partners, he can’t keep his story straight. Sometimes he corrects details about his day or omits small truths that you find out about much later. If he’s telling you about his life on a ‘need to know’ basis, this isn’t healthy for your relationship communication overall. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "He might mix up your romantic routine with someone else’s. You’re probably confused about why you barely have sex anymore and wondering if he’s exhausting energy on someone else. [3] X Research source It’s critical that both of you have been tested for STDs. Getting tested is always important, but it should be at the top of your to-do list if you’re questioning your partner’s monogamy. A lot of STDs can be present without exhibiting symptoms."

      "content": "Keeping your relationship secret lets him play the field. If your significant other hasn’t been taking you out, introducing you to others or tagging you on social posts, you might feel like a secret. A relationship that feels secretive can decrease relationship quality. You deserve someone who is proud to be yours! If they never mentioned in social media that they're in their relationship with anybody at all, it's probably because they're trying to keep their options open. If you're dating somebody or involving somebody or in a relationship with somebody, and they never post about you, it's because they don't want any of their prospects, people that are interested in them, saying that they may be talking to somebody else."

      "content": "His messages could reveal another lover, which he wants to hide. You see him bringing the phone with him everywhere. When you notice that he’s getting texts, he’ll seem jumpy or won’t fill you in on who is trying to reach him. Privacy is one thing, but it’s unusual if he’s obsessive about it. [4] X Research source You might see him consistently leave the room to answer calls or decline them when you’re together. If a lot of these calls seem mysterious — or if he brushes off your questions about them altogether — he might be talking to people behind your back. Reader Poll: We asked 674 wikiHow readers to tell us how they felt about checking their partner’s phone, and only 6% felt they didn’t need to check their phone since they trust them. [Take Poll] So, while that may not be a great strategy according to our readers, try to have a conversation about your concerns instead."

      "content": "He reserves parts of himself for his other partners. Doubts about loyalty mean you’re lacking trust in your relationship. You feel like you don’t know the full truth about him, but you don’t want to jump to conclusions. Either way, feeling jealous or insecure all the time isn’t healthy.

He might choose to dress the same around you but pull out all the stops to look his best for work and social events. [6] X Research source A similar sign could be if he has upgraded specific clothing, like his underwear collection. If he’s suddenly switched out his worn down favorites for fresh styles, the fashion show might be for someone other than you. [7] X Research source"

If you’ve noticed that he’s quick to rearrange plans with you — or has tons of excuses to drop out of them entirely — then he’s not making enough time for your relationship. Late nights spent working, unexpected appointments, or long sessions at the gym are all common excuses cheaters use to hide their routine. [8] X Research source Maybe you’ve noticed that he doesn’t like it when you surprise him or change your own plans. If this is the case, he might be relying on your predictable schedule to make secretive plans during the times that you’re busy."

He might answer questions about his day while watching TV or immediately turning to clean something so he doesn’t have to look right at you. [9] X Research source Other signs of lying can be rolling their lips into their mouth to prevent themselves from speaking more, sweating, fidgeting with their hands or gesturing with both hands, and raising the pitch of their voice.
