      "content": "Pull the latch to unlock the hood on your bottom left. In most vehicles, the hood release latch is under the dash on the driver's side, although its exact location may differ from make and model. Look for a handle with a popped hood logo on it. Pull this all the way out and you should hear your hood unlock. [1] X Research source If you’re checking any fluid levels, park on a flat surface. Otherwise, the fluids will pool up on one side and give you inaccurate readings. In some countries, the hood of the vehicle is called the bonnet!"

      "content": "Reach under the front of the hood and pull the latch. Get out of your car and walk to the front of the vehicle. Under the center of the hood, reach your hand underneath to feel for a latch or a lever. On some models, you’ll press this up to the bottom of the hood to unlatch the lock. On other models, you pull a lever away from the lock to open the hood. [2] X Research source Refer to your vehicle’s instruction manual if you need help getting the latch undone."

      "title": "Lift the hood up and prop it up if it doesn’t stay open.",
      "content": "Lift the hood up and prop it up if it doesn’t stay open. Most modern vehicles will automatically lock the hood in the upright position if you raise it. If the hood swings freely, look for a rod sitting horizontally along the front of the engine bay. This is the prop rod. Pull it up and insert the tip into the designated opening embedded in the hood over the hinge of the prop rod. [3] X Research source If this is your first time using a prop rod, test it by gently wiggling it to confirm it won’t slam down on you while you’re checking the oil or whatnot. Follow the same process every single time you’ve got to pop the hood and perform some maintenance ."

      "title": "Press down on the hood while engaging the interior latch.",
      "content": "Press down on the hood while engaging the interior latch. If the cable between the latch and hood is sticky or damaged, it may not disengage properly. On most cars, the cable releases when you press down on the front of the hood. Do this while a friend or family member pulls the release latch inside the vehicle. If it works, the hood will shift and raise slightly. Then, open the exterior latch. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Pull on the cable if the indoor lever is damaged.",
      "content": "Pull on the cable if the indoor lever is damaged. Behind your indoor latch, you may see a cable sticking out. This cable runs through your engine bay and connects to the latch. If the lever is broken or damaged, the cable should still work. Tug gently on this cable to open the hood. [5] X Research source If you feel no tension at all, the cable is no longer attached to the front latch and needs to be reconnected by a mechanic."

      "title": "Trip the latch manually with a screwdriver or other thin tool.",
      "content": "Trip the latch manually with a screwdriver or other thin tool. Your latch is located in the very center of the hood at the front. Reach in with a long, thin screwdriver, rod, or butter knife. If the gaps in the grille are small, use a wire coat hanger instead. Catch the latch with your tool and slide the latch open to release the hood. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Tug on the cable if you can see it behind your grill. Depending on your make and model, you may be able to see the cable connecting your hood latch to the release lever indoors. Look through your grill with a flashlight. If you can see the cable, grab some pliers and gently tug on it to open the latch. If this doesn't work, take the car to a mechanic to repair the cable."

If it turns out you can't fix the problem on the spot, you don't want to be stuck driving home with an open hood. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Test the interior release latch several times.",
      "content": "Test the interior release latch several times. It’s possible the latch is just sticking a bit. Find the release lever by sitting in the driver’s seat and looking at the bottom left of the vehicle’s interior. Pull the latch several times repeatedly. If you’re lucky, the latch will fully open and the hood will release. [8] X Research source If the hood does open partially, all you need to do is press the exterior latch at the front of the hood. This latch is usually at the center or just to one side, and may depress upward or to the side."

      "title": "Slap the hood gently to unstick it.",
      "content": "Slap the hood gently to unstick it. Stand outside the driver's seat and reach in to hold the interior release in the fully pulled position. With your other hand, slap the hood with an open palm. If you're lucky, the hood just needs a jolt. [9] X Research source Take care not to dent your hood. You may need to use force, but keep your hand in an open palm position. If you have a friend or family member helping you out, ask them to pull the release lever and try striking the hood where the latch is located."

      "content": "Open an old, rusty latch with a bit of pressure. Have a friend pull the interior release and keep it in that position. Stand at the front of the vehicle and pull up on the hood slowly but steadily. If the only problem is rust or grime, you can usually force it open. If the hood won't budge at all, don't use a ton of force. [10] X Research source Keep in mind, it’s possible you’ll break the latch if you do this. But if it needs to be repaired anyway, it may not matter."

      "title": "Inspect the latch after opening the hood.",
      "content": "Inspect the latch after opening the hood. Once you get your hood open, check for broken latch parts or a frayed cable, which may need to be replaced. If you don't see obvious problems, just clean any gunk off of the latch with water and a rag to see if that solves the problem. [11] X Research source If the latch is broken, take your vehicle to a mechanic for repairs. It may also help to lubricate the cable with a spray lubricant . Insert the straw nozzle at the cable's end, between the inner cable and outer sheath, and spray."
