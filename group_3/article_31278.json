      "content": "Natural release lets the Instant Pot release pressure on its own. This is by far the safest and most reliable way to release pressure from an Instant Pot because you do absolutely nothing to make it happen. That’s right! Simply wait for the cooking cycle to finish and the floating valve to drop. Natural release is perfect for low-maintenance meals, but it can take up to 40 minutes, depending on the recipe. Use a natural release with foods with longer cooking times or liquid bases, such as broths, beans, soups, stews, oatmeals, and chilis. Keep in mind that the cooking time doesn’t stop with a natural release. Think of it like leaving something in the oven after turning it off. The food will continue cooking using the residual heat. [1] X Research source Some recipes might call for an NPR, which is the abbreviation for natural pressure release. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Quick release forcibly gets rid of the pressure in an Instant Pot. This type of pressure release is great when you’re in a rush or want to avoid overcooking your food. Instead of letting the pot slowly release air on its own, you manually open the valve to let out a spurt of hot air. [3] X Research source The process usually takes between 1 and 5 minutes. Use a quick release when making pastas, steaming vegetables, or cooking seafood and meats. Avoid this release method in watery, starchy, or liquid-based dishes, as the liquid could squirt out of the release valve and cause a mess. Recipes may also call a quick release a QR, manual release, or steam release."

      "content": "Leave your Instant Pot alone after the timer goes off. The monitor will read “L000” and start counting up to “L001,” “L002,” and so forth with each minute. This number represents how long the pressure has been releasing. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Wait for the float valve to drop.",
      "content": "Wait for the float valve to drop. The metal tube to the right of the release valve at the top of the Instant Pot is called the float valve and lets you know how much pressure is in the pot. As the pressure is released, the valve will start to sink. [5] X Research source This may take up to 30 minutes. If you’re unsure if the valve has dropped all the way, notice if you can see any hot air coming out of the release valve. No steam means all the pressure is released. Do not stick your hand or face near the release valve, as excess steam could burn you."

[6] X Research source Pull the top of the lid towards your body to protect yourself from any excess steam. If you don’t turn the Instant Pot off, it’ll automatically switch to its “Keep Warm” mode after all the pressure is released. To avoid this, simply push the cooking method you’re using twice when turning on the pot. [7] X Research source"

Listen for the finishing beep, or look to see if the monitor reads “L000.” Then, turn off the Instant Pot. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a wooden spoon to open the Instant Pot’s release valve. The release valve is located on top of the Instant Pot and is shaped like a dial. Stand back before opening it, as quick releases cause a dangerous eruption of hot steam. Hit the valve from “sealing” to “venting” with the back of the spoon. Hissing, hot air will be released immediately. [10] X Research source Move your head away from the Instant Pot to avoid getting burned."

      "content": "Remove the lid once the float valve is down. The metal tube next to the release valve will start to sink as hot steam erupts from the pot. Wait for a maximum of 5 minutes for the valve to drop all the way down before removing the lid. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Try a 10-minute natural release when cooking grains, soups, or beans. A 10-minute natural release gives you the best of both worlds! When the cooking cycle ends, let the Instant Pot go into “Keep Warm” mode and count up to “L010” (which stands for a 10-minute NPR). After the 10-minutes are up, press cancel and flip open the release valve. [12] X Research source This method is great for when you’re in a rush but cooking something soupy or starchy, as slowly releasing the pressure before doing a QR can lessen the mess."
