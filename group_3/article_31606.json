      "content": "Submerge the glue bottle in 8 fl oz (240 mL) of hot water for 5 minutes. Fill a cup or small bowl with hot tap water. Don’t use boiling water as this may melt the glue container. Then, place the glue container into the water and let it sit for 5 minutes. When the time is up, use a fork or spoon to fish out the glue tube and try to unscrew the lid. If there’s a lot of glue around the cap, you may need to leave it in the water for longer or try another option. You can also try adding a few drops of dish soap or 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of white vinegar to the water. [1] X Research source Make sure to wash the cup or bowl and utensil thoroughly before using them for food after you do this."

If the glue container has lots of glue on the outside of the lid, you may also dip the top of the nail glue container into a small dish of acetone. Hold it there for about 15 seconds, remove it, and then let the container sit for about 3 minutes before you try to unscrew the cap again. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Read the instructions on the nail glue’s label. If you have a container of nail glue that has no premade opening in it, then you will probably need to puncture it. Check the instructions for opening the nail glue if any were included. You may also check the manufacturer’s website for information on how to properly open the nail glue."

      "content": "Insert a pin into the center of the nail glue tip or where indicated. Most nail glues only require a tiny opening that you can make with a pin. Remove the cap from the glue, locate the center or the glue container’s tip, and insert a pin into the center of the tip. Then, remove the pin from the container. Some nail glue products come with a lid that will puncture the top for you when you screw it on and this special lid will also keep the glue from drying out. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut the tip off of your nail glue if you cannot puncture it. If you cannot puncture the tip or if it is the kind of tip that you need to cut off, get a sharp pair of scissors and cut straight across the tip about 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) from the end. Hold the tube so that the tip is facing up when you do this to prevent glue from leaking out. [5] X Research source Discard the tip that you cut off and place the cap on the nail glue tube to keep the glue from leaking or drying out. This is not ideal for some types of nail glue containers since cutting off the tip can make a large opening in the nail glue. However, if the nail glue container indicates that you need to cut the tip off to open it, you can try this option."
