In recent years, the number of heterosexual young men between the ages of 18 and 30 who are having sex has dropped. [1] X Research source Contrary to theories that women have become more “promiscuous,” women’s sexual activity hasn’t really changed in recent decades. Most studies only cover guys aged 18 to 30 and don’t address guys who may have had sex prior to age 18—but a few studies address teen celibacy as well, and indicate a decrease in sexual activity compared to previous years. [2] X Research source Dating apps like Tinder make it easier to find sexual partners in general—but while a popular belief says it’s “20% of guys dating 80% of women,” the stats suggest otherwise.

A 2021 study analyzed sexual activity (including solo masturbation) among adolescent men (aged 14-17) between 2009 and 2018. The study found 42% of men had not engaged in sexual activity of any kind in 2018, which is up from 28% in 2009. [4] X Research source Comparatively, sexual inactivity among young women increased from 49% in 2009 to 74% in 2018. Keep in mind that this data was recorded prior to the pandemic—meaning the percentage of sexually inactive young men is likely to have increased even more. [5] X Research source Among high school students of all genders surveyed in 2021, 30% had never had sex. According to a 2023 study, 37% of gen-Z respondents reported being virgins.

With the rise of the internet and video games, more and more people are connecting virtually rather than in person, meaning there’s less opportunity to engage in sex.

[11] X Research source But in recent decades, people are waiting to get married, or just not getting married at all. This could be because more young people are too busy with school to get married. The economy has also gotten way worse, so there’s less financial incentive to get married and start a life together. Young people may also just feel less pressure than they used to to get married and may be more likely to wait to have sex until they’re ready , which is a good thing!"

The recent rise in depression and anxiety among young people may contribute to a lack of self-esteem and extroversion, meaning fewer young people are meeting up and having sex.

Different people and cultures may have varying definitions of what constitutes “sex,” though, making the term “virginity” a bit more fluid.

      "content": "It’s totally OK to be a virgin, male or female. It can be extremely hard to ignore societal messaging about when you should have sex, with whom, and how often—especially because those messages are often contradictory! Listen to your gut, and try not to worry about what other people say or think. Maybe you want to lose your virginity and are having trouble finding a partner . This happens to pretty much everyone at some point, regardless of gender, and it can be super frustrating—but know that you’re not alone, and it doesn’t have any bearing on your worth. Moore advises: “Remember that sex isn’t just about having an orgasm but about exploring pleasure in all aspects in your body…. [T]ake the time on your own to touch and caress your own body to simply notice what it feels like to be present in your own body.” Maybe you genuinely have no interest at all in sex—this is completely OK! Or maybe you’re interested in sex, but are waiting for the right person or moment. Regardless of where you fall, your desires and emotions are valid, healthy—and probably way more common than you even realize."

      "content": "Some people believe men should have sex early and often. In more patriarchal societies, sex is often seen as a sign of masculinity and dominance. Men are often treated across the board as exceptionally sexual people who “need” (heterosexual) sex. [19] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Guys who have never had sex (with girls) or who don’t care about having sex may be viewed as “weak” or “impotent.” In reality, a guy’s sexual experience or lack thereof has literally nothing to do with his character or value. On the other hand, it’s often considered taboo for a woman to have sex, or to at least be more sexually experienced than her (male) partner. [20] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source “Remember that sex is about you and not about getting someone else to like you,” Nicole Moore says. “Are you [having sex] to win someone’s approval, get back at your parents, or deal with your emotions by distracting via sex? …Any unresolved emotional issues, anger, fears, or insecurities are likely to get in the way of you having the healthiest sex life .”"

You may not always be able to avoid triggers, but if you know in advance that something or someone is likely to make you feel anxious, it can help you be more prepared and maybe lessen the amount of stress you might feel in the moment. Consider having a stress-relieving plan in your back pocket for when you know you’ll be in a potentially triggering situation. For example, try deep breathing exercises.
