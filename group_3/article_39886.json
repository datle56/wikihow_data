      "content": "Follow your tattoo artist's care recommendations about wrapping. Ask your tattoo artist if you need to keep the tattoo covered while you sleep and when you should remove the wrapping. They might advise you to keep their bandage on for the first night before removing it. To put a new bandage on at home, you may be told to put a sterile absorbent bandage on the tattoo. [2] X Expert Source Grant Lubbock Tattoo Artist & Co-Owner, Red Baron Ink Expert Interview. 22 October 2019. If the bandage doesn't have adhesive, use medical tape to secure the bandage around the tattoo. Ensure that you don't apply tape to the tattoo, which would be painful to remove. Avoid wrapping the tattoo with plastic clingfilm because it traps sweat and bacteria against the tattoo."

Then, replace the towel or sheet if it sticks to you during the night. If the sheet is stuck to a tattoo that's in a hard to reach place, such as on your back, get in the shower with the sheet stuck to you."

      "content": "Sleep alone for the first few nights after getting the tattoo. If you share your bed with a partner, ask them to sleep in another room so you can get good sleep. This is especially important if your partner is a restless sleeper or you're getting used to different sleep positions. You might find that your support pillows take up a lot of space and there isn't as much room for your partner. If you have pets that get into bed with you, try to keep them out of your bed for the first few days after getting your tattoo. This will prevent animal dander and germs from getting into your new tattoo."
