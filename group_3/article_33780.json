      "title": "Gather materials.",
      "content": "Gather materials. Are you doing a pencil drawing? Just scribbling? Generally, you'll want a piece of paper or a notebook. For a pencil drawing, just use a No. 2 since you are practicing. Also if you are using a pencil, get an eraser. If you would like to color, use markers, colored pencils, paints, pastels, or anything else you would like. Try to get thick drawing paper at an art supply or craft store. Canvas paper or a drawing pad is recommended, but if you're just learning you might want to start with regular sheet paper."

      "title": "Target specific drawing skills.",
      "content": "Target specific drawing skills. [1] X Research source Are you already good at drawing animals? Maybe you should focus on humans. If you're struggling with proportions you should try working on that during your practice. Figure out what it is that you want to improve so that you're not just drawing at random. Just drawing isn't necessarily going to make you better - you need targeted practice. Free drawing is fine too if you want to work on your ability to create in the moment. Graffiti artists often free draw for this reason."

    {
      "title": "Devote some time to drawing.",
      "content": "Devote some time to drawing. Imagine going to the gym and doing five sit-ups and then leaving. You’re not going to get in better shape doing that, and drawing for five minutes once a week probably won’t help you out either. Try to commit some serious time to drawing if you want to get better. Twenty minutes four days a week isn’t a huge time commitment but will be really beneficial."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stay consistent.",
      "content": "Stay consistent. The most important thing is that you keep drawing. Try to avoid falling into the trap of getting really into the activity for a few weeks and then tailing off. Make it a part of your daily routine."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a time every day when you draw.",
      "content": "Choose a time every day when you draw. Maybe it’s in the morning right after you get up. You can try to draw scenes from your dreams, and it’s a really relaxing way to start the morning. Maybe you prefer drawing in the evening before you go to bed. Whatever works, but choosing a time will help make establishing a routine easier."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw for 20 or 30 minutes each session.",
      "content": "Draw for 20 or 30 minutes each session. It’s important to spend a decent amount of time drawing. Keep looking for new exercises and things to draw so you avoid getting bored. The more time you commit the better you’ll be in the end."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take a class at an art school.",
      "content": "Take a class at an art school. Many local colleges allow people to enroll in single classes, but if you don’t want to go that route there are plenty of private art schools around. Look for one in your area. This will help you regiment your time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hire a private drawing tutor.",
      "content": "Hire a private drawing tutor. Try reaching out to local art teachers at colleges and high schools. They might have some free time and be willing to tutor you if you offer them a decent salary. Even if you only meet with them once a week for an hour they can help you focus your practice for the rest of the week. They’ll be able to track your progress better than you can alone too."

    {
      "title": "Look for free classes at local museums and galleries.",
      "content": "Look for free classes at local museums and galleries. [2] X Research source Many galleries and museums have free art classes. You won’t have as personalized experience but it won’t cost you any money either. You often get to hang out in a museum at night and try to draw their exhibits too, which is pretty cool."

      "title": "Draw monsters and doodle.",
      "content": "Draw monsters and doodle. Just scribble! Get your creative juices flowing this way. You’ll actually start to observe how things come together, and you’ll start to develop a steady hand. This will also help you hone your creativity because you’ll be drawing all your own ideas."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw from direct observation.",
      "content": "Draw from direct observation. This is a great way to learn how things fit together and how to draw common objects. Try to draw the couch in your living room, or the tree in your back yard, or anything else. It’s probably best to start with objects rather than landscapes. Landscapes can be tough because you're dealing with perspective. However, it is completely up to you!"

    {
      "title": "Use short lines.",
      "content": "Use short lines. [3] X Research source Short lines make it much easier to draw straight lines, squares, and circles. It’s much more natural for us to draw using short lines. Just try drawing using tiny dashes and you’ll find that you have much more control over your pen or pencil."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice proportions.",
      "content": "Practice proportions. Try to see proportions everywhere. Compare the size of your fingers to the size of your hand, the size of your backpack to that fence off in the distance, etc. Start by drawing the simplest things you can think of, like a square house and a person standing next to it. Once you start to feel comfortable with basic proportions you can move on. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Draw snakes.",
      "content": "Draw snakes. You don’t like snakes? Well, too bad! Drawing snakes is a great way to help you practice drawing parallel and concurrent lines more effectively. It’s a good way to free your hand. If you’re finding it really difficult, start by drawing circles next to each other in the shape of a snake. Make the first circle the largest, and then each one smaller after that. Now draw parallel lines on the top and bottoms of all these circles. That's the idea behind drawing a snake.
