      "title": "Place rice in a microwave-safe container.",
      "content": "Place rice in a microwave-safe container. Put the rice onto a plate or in a bowl, or just use a plastic container that is safe for use in the microwave. If the rice is in a cardboard take-out container and you want to leave it in there, be sure there are no metal staples or handles on the box."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add a splash of water.",
      "content": "Add a splash of water. The amount of water will depend on the amount of rice, but will typically be no more than one tablespoon of liquid per cup (340g) of rice. There should be enough moisture to steam the rice, but not enough that the rice is sitting in a puddle of water after heating. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Break up clumps with a fork.",
      "content": "Break up clumps with a fork. If there are large clumps of rice sticking together, they won’t heat as evenly as everything else, and the rice within the clumps won’t get the moisture it needs to be fluffy again. Use a fork to smash these clumps apart so that it’s all about the same size. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cover the container with a plate or towel.",
      "content": "Cover the container with a plate or towel. To keep the moisture in with the rice, cover your container with a lightweight plate or microwave safe plastic lid (but don’t seal it completely). Or try covering it with a damp paper towel to give it a bigger boost of moisture."
    },
    {
      "title": "Heat the rice.",
      "content": "Heat the rice. Use high heat as you warm the rice in the microwave. The amount of time will depend upon the amount of rice you have. About 1-2 minutes should be enough for one serving. If reheating rice that was frozen, heat for 2-3 minutes in the microwave. The container will likely be hot, so allow it to stand in the microwave for 1-2 minutes afterward, or use oven mitts to remove it."

    {
      "title": "Place the rice in a saucepan.",
      "content": "Place the rice in a saucepan. Dump the rice from its container into a saucepan. Any size pan is fine, though it should comfortably hold the rice without you needing to press it down for it to all fit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add a splash of water.",
      "content": "Add a splash of water. The amount of water will depend on the amount of rice, though a couple tablespoons should be enough for a single serving. Since the pan is on the stovetop rather than inside the microwave or oven, you can also add small amounts of water throughout the heating process if it's still looking too dry. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Add oil or butter.",
      "content": "Add oil or butter. Pour a splash of olive oil or drop a small amount of butter (less than a tablespoon) into the pan on top of the rice. This will restore more of the moisture and flavor that was lost in the fridge, and it will keep the rice from sticking to your pan. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Break up chunks of rice with a fork.",
      "content": "Break up chunks of rice with a fork. Use a fork to press down on the larger chunks of rice that may not heat as evenly when they’re stuck together. This will also help to stir and combine the rice with the water and oil. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid.",
      "content": "Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid. If you have the lid that came with the pan, place that on top to create a good seal to lock in the steam. If you don’t have a perfect match, use a larger lid to place on top of the pan so that all edges are still covered."
    },
    {
      "title": "Heat the rice on low heat.",
      "content": "Heat the rice on low heat. The amount of time will vary depending on the amount of rice in the pan, but about 3-5 minutes should be enough for a single serving. Stir often to keep the rice from burning. You will know it's done when all the water has evaporated and the rice is steaming and fluffy again."

    {
      "title": "Place rice in a baking dish.",
      "content": "Place rice in a baking dish. The baking dish should be oven safe and large enough to contain the rice without needing to press it down to squeeze it in."

    {
      "title": "Add a splash of water.",
      "content": "Add a splash of water. For a single portion, add about 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 ml) of water. For larger amounts of rice, add more water. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Add oil or broth.",
      "content": "Add oil or broth. Pour a splash of olive oil or any type of broth over the rice for an added boost of moisture and flavor. Stir the rice a little so the liquid evenly coats as much of it as possible. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Cover the rice with a tight-fitting lid or aluminum foil. If a lid came with the baking dish you’re using, place that lid on top of the dish before putting it in the oven. If you don’t have a lid, just rip off a large sheet of aluminum foil and wrap it over the edges of the dish. [9] X Research source"

If after 20 minutes you think the rice is still too dry, pull it out of the oven, sprinkle another tablespoon of water over the rice, and place the lid back on. Let the dish sit on the stovetop or a trivet and steam for about five minutes."
