      "content": "Socks will make it easier to glide across the floor. Though a pro can moonwalk even in hiking boots, it’s better to learn with as little traction as possible. Wearing socks will make it much easier for you to practice your moves and glide across the floor. [2] X Research source Once you’ve mastered the “sock walk,” put on some sneakers for added challenge."

      "content": "You'll have an easier time learning the move on solid, smooth floors. Smoothness is key, and while you can try it anywhere, it helps to be on a flat, non-stick surface, such as a hardwood or smooth-tiled floor. You don’t need a dance studio; your kitchen or dining room will do. Stay away from rough, uneven, or carpeted areas. [3] X Research source If you don't have any smooth surfaces in your home, then you're better off using flat-bottomed shoes on a rough surface than socks."

      "title": "Stand with your left foot flat, and raise the heel of your right foot.",
      "content": "Stand with your left foot flat, and raise the heel of your right foot. Position your right foot behind your flat foot, so that your heel and toe are about level, and you have about 3–6 in (7.6–15.2 cm) of space between your feet. This is your starting position. Keep your weight on the balls of your right foot, so that your flat foot is free to move. Use your arms to keep your balance, but don’t worry too much about their positioning just yet. Focus on your footwork for now. Place your raised foot slightly further back if you’re having trouble keeping your balance."

      "title": "Slide your left foot back across the floor.",
      "content": "Slide your left foot back across the floor. Keeping your weight on your raised foot, glide your flat foot backward along the floor, until your toe is behind your heel. During this motion, keep the heel of your right foot in the air, with your toes in place on the floor. [4] X Research source Perform a few exercises to improve your balance if you’re finding it difficult to coordinate your feet."

    {
      "title": "Shift your weight between your feet as you swap their stances.",
      "content": "Shift your weight between your feet as you swap their stances. In one motion, raise the heel of your right foot and lower the heel of your left foot, shifting your weight as you do. Now you are in a similar stance as you started with, only your feet have swapped positions. [5] X Research source To pull off the move, raise only 1 of your feet at any given time. Always 1; never both, and never neither. As you shift your weight to your right foot, lean slightly to your right to keep your balance."

      "title": "Repeat the previous 2 steps, switching the roles of your feet.",
      "content": "Repeat the previous 2 steps, switching the roles of your feet. Slide your flat foot, shift your weight. Slide your flat foot, shift your weight. Do this over and over in a mirror until the movement becomes easy and natural. [6] X Research source Focus on getting a feel for the pattern and rhythm first, then focus on smoothing out your movement to get a good, low-gravity flow."

      "title": "Move your head and arms to the rhythm.",
      "content": "Move your head and arms to the rhythm. Once you’ve finessed the footwork, incorporate other parts of your body. [7] X Research source As you slide your leg back, move your head forward as if it's being left behind in the movement. Then pull it back to the body as you switch to the other foot. Swing your arms with every step, or hunch your shoulders and grab your hat (if you're wearing one) like Michael Jackson did. Alternatively, keep your hands in your pockets for cool, casual moonwalk."
