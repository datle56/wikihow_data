Starting in the corner, pick at the Plasti Dip with your fingers to lift it away from the car. Avoid pulling it off the car immediately, or else you may end up with lots of annoying, small Plasti Dip strips on your vehicle! [1] X Research source If the Plasti Dip was applied correctly, it will be thick enough to peel off. Thinner layers shred, so they have to be washed off with WD-40 or another product."
