      "content": "Feminine energy One of the moon symbol’s most important and well-known connections is to that of the divine feminine . Tracing back to ancient cultures, the moon has long been a symbol of feminine energy, likely because of the parallels between the moon’s cyclical changes and the female body’s monthly cycle. In some traditions, the moon was also a symbol associated with goddesses of fertility and the night. [2] X Research source Further still, the moon’s symbolism is connected to feminine energy through the Triple Moon symbol . The Triple Moon symbol (or Triple Goddess) is a sacred image rooted and used in belief systems like Neopaganism , Wicca , and Celtic Paganism, as well as Greek and Roman mythologies. [3] X Research source The Triple Moon symbol is depicted as a full moon placed in between a waxing and waning crescent on either side. These three moons represent the three cycles in the life of a woman: birth, life, and death (or rebirth). These three phases are also personified by the Maiden, the Mother, and the Crone ."

Consider gazing up at the moon at night—if you had no scientific explanation for what it was, what would you think? It’s one of the brightest objects in the night sky, and its awe-inspiring luminance shifts from night to night as it moves through its phases. [4] X Research source As a result of the moon’s undeniably mystical appearance and behavior, many cultures have associated the moon with mystery, magic, and the supernatural. In particular, many belief systems connected the moon to the afterlife and personified it as a deity or messenger to the gods.

As the moon waxes and wanes, human beings are able to visually witness the beautiful and natural process of cyclical growth and decline. As a result, the moon has transformed into an important symbol of the cyclical patterns of life and death, growth and transformation, and change and renewal that occur throughout any person’s life.

      "content": "Astrology One of the most important parts of modern Western astrology is one’s moon sign , which is said to significantly shape and impact a person’s inner self—including their innermost personality, moods, and emotional responses. According to astrological beliefs, the position of the moon in the sky at the moment that a person is born will influence the way that they emotionally react to the world around them, as well as how they form attachments to loved ones and stable environments. [7] X Research source An astrological moon sign can also shape how someone approaches relationships and shows care to others. Someone’s moon sign can be any of the 12 well-known Zodiac signs: Aries , Cancer , Libra , Capricorn , Taurus , Leo , Scorpio, Aquarius , Gemini , Virgo , Sagittarius , and Pisces .

      "content": "Tattoos of the moon symbol may represent renewal and the cycle of life. Many people who get moon tattoos do so in order to acknowledge the changing phases of their life. They may particularly get a specific moon phase to embrace a specific meaning—like a new moon for a new beginning or a waning moon for a time of emotional release.

      "content": "The moon is the basis for world calendars and significant events. For thousands of years, the moon has helped people and civilizations track the passage of time (this was before you could just check the date on your phone, of course). One of the earliest known lunar calendars was called the lunisolar calendar , which used the lunar and solar cycles to divide the year into 12 lunar months. Each month lasted about 29-30 days, with a 13th month being added every 2-3 years to keep the seasons in sync. [20] X Research source Most modern calendars use the solar phases and the movements of the Earth around the sun to mark time. However, the Gregorian calendar—which is used in the vast majority of countries—still uses the “lunar months” to divide the calendar into 29.5-day cycles of the moon’s phases. Aside from the months and years themselves, important events and festivals have long been marked by the changing of the moon. In China, for example, the Mid-Autumn Festival is held on the full moon.

      "content": "The moon also has a strong effect on the tides of the Earth’s oceans. Ever explored some tide pools or been told to stay away from the beach due to a high tide? Well, you can thank the moon for all of that! The moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth’s oceans, creating a differential force between the water closest and farthest from the moon. As a result of this pull, the oceans’ waters bulge to create two high tides each day. [22] X Research source A tide is highest when the moon is placed directly overhead or directly underneath the Earth as it makes its orbit. This phenomenon is known as a “spring tide.” [23] X Research source Conversely, the tides are lowest when the moon reaches its first or third quarter phase, resulting in a “neap tide.”"

      "content": "The moon has four main phases: waning, new moon, waxing, and full. These phases are further divided into eight phases in a full lunar cycle, which repeats every 29.5 days: new moon, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous , full moon, waning gibbous, third quarter, and waning crescent. These phases are caused by the sun illuminating different parts of the moon as it orbits Earth. [24] X Research source The four principal phases of the moon also have symbolic meaning, as they’re said to represent the phases of an individual person’s life: [25] X Research source New Moon: Represents new beginnings, rebirth, and fresh starts. It’s a time to take the leap toward a new life and tackle your fears. Waxing: Represents growth, manifestation, and attainment. It’s a time to recognize and nurture your own positive growth. In the Triple Goddess archetype, this phase is represented by the Maiden. Full: Represents success, power, and fulfillment. It’s a time wherein you have reached (or about to reach) the obtainment of everything you’ve ever wanted. In the Triple Goddess archetype, this phase is represented by the Mother. Waning: Represents letting go, surrendering, and allowing for quiet. It’s a time to peacefully accept loss and other inevitable challenges. In the Triple Goddess archetype, this phase is represented by the Crone. If you’re curious about the spiritual meaning of each moon phase , read more here ."

Some gemstones carry the symbolism of the moon or are otherwise believed to harness the powers and energies of the moon. Wearing these gems as jewelry or keeping them in your pocket may imbue you with the special symbolic significance of the moon. Here are some of the most iconic moon-related gems: [26] X Research source Moonstone : As the name suggests, this gem is the one most strongly associated with the moon. The gemstone is translucent, white, or pale blue—similar to the light of the moon—and promotes peace and balance. Pearl : A pearl’s iridescent quality resembles the light of the moon, and this stone is said to represent purity, wisdom, and femininity. Selenite : The word “selenite” harkens back to Selene, an important moon goddess in Greek myth. The stone itself is translucent and white, and it’s said to have a calming energy that’s conducive to spiritual and meditative practices. [27] X Research source Labradorite : As the darkest stone on our list, the grey-blue or green labradorite stone is thought to resemble the shifting light of the moon. It’s most strongly associated with the moon’s mystery and magic, and is thought to enhance intuition and spiritual awareness. [28] X Research source White Sapphire : White sapphire is likely tied to the moon due to its clear and sparkling appearance. It’s thought to symbolize the moon’s feminine and nurturing qualities, as well as bringing balance and harmony to its wearers."

The Do Not Disturb option on iPhones, Macbooks, and other smart devices is represented by a crescent moon symbol that’s usually placed near the clock.
