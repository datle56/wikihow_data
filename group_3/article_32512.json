      "content": "Look for a smooth, shiny persimmon to tell when it is ripe. Grab your persimmon and feel the outside of it to make sure it is plump and smooth. Depending on the type of persimmon you have, the color could be deep orange or pale orange. Just make sure it doesn’t have any blemishes on the outside. [1] X Research source Only buy ripe persimmons if you plan on eating them within a few days."

      "content": "Rinse the persimmon with cold water. Gently scrub the outside of the persimmon with your hands to remove any dirt or debris that might have settled on it. Wash your persimmon for about 10 seconds all over. [2] X Research source Always rinse off fresh produce before you eat it to get rid of any dirt, debris, or insects."

Slice the persimmon in half, starting from the top leafy area and moving the knife downwards to the bottom. [3] X Research source You can take the leaves off the top of the persimmon before you start cutting if you want to, but you don’t have to."

      "content": "Split each half into 2 wedges. Pick up 1 half of the persimmon and hold it steady on the cutting board. Use your knife to cut it in half again lengthwise, and then do the same thing to the other half of the persimmon to make 4 wedge pieces. [4] X Research source Wedge pieces are easier to deal with than large halves."

      "content": "Slide a paring knife under the skin of the persimmon. Pick up 1 wedge slice and slide a sharp, curved knife under the skin at the top of the slice. Hold the persimmon by the bottom so that you don’t put your fingers in the way of the knife. [5] X Research source Paring knives are great for peeling fruits since they are short and can make precise cuts. The skin of a persimmon is edible, so you don’t have to cut it off if you don’t want to."

Slide the spoon around the rim of the persimmon to lift the peel off the fruit, and then use the spoon to scoop out the meat of the persimmon. Do the same thing to the other half. [9] X Research source You can also use the spoon to eat the fruit of the persimmon straight out of the peel if you’d like to."

      "content": "Eat your persimmon on salads, in smoothies, or on cereal. Since the taste of persimmons is pretty mild, you can pair them with almost any sweet flavor for some added taste. Use your wedges to sweeten up an almond and strawberry salad, or eat them with some goat cheese for a light snack. [11] X Research source You can also add persimmon puree to cookie or cake batters as a sweetener."
