      "title": "Trace the outline of your hand onto a piece of paper.",
      "content": "Trace the outline of your hand onto a piece of paper. Use a piece of paper that is long enough to create the size glove you want. Press your non-dominant hand on the paper with your fingers spread apart. For example, use your right hand if you are left-handed. Hold a pen or pencil in your dominant hand and use it to trace around your other hand. [1] X Research source Keep the pen or pencil close to your skin as you trace. Go around every finger as well as the sides of your hand. If you want to create fingerless gloves, trace only to the point on your fingers that you want the gloves to go. Then, add an extra 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) to the end of each finger for seam allowance."

    {
      "title": "Extend the sleeve of the glove to the desired length.",
      "content": "Extend the sleeve of the glove to the desired length. You can end the glove at the wrist if you want short gloves, or extend the lines down from the wrist to make the glove longer. Make sure to include an extra 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) for hemming the sleeve later. Press your forearm against the paper and continue to trace alongside your non-dominant arm. Trace along both sides of the glove and then draw a line to connect the ends of the 2 lines. This will indicate the end of the glove. [2] X Research source Try making a pair of gloves that go to your mid-forearm for a fancy pair of gloves, or make a pair that go up to your biceps for a dramatic looking pair of gloves."

    {
      "title": "Cut along the lines you’ve drawn on the paper.",
      "content": "Cut along the lines you’ve drawn on the paper. Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut along the lines of the paper pattern. Go slowly to avoid creating any jagged edges or cutting off part of the pattern. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold a piece of fabric that is large enough for the entire glove pattern.",
      "content": "Fold a piece of fabric that is large enough for the entire glove pattern. Fold the fabric so that the right (outer or front) of the fabric is facing in, and then smooth it out so that there are no lumps or bumps. Check to ensure that you can fit the whole pattern on the folded fabric and cut it out in 1 piece. [5] X Research source You may need to angle the pattern slightly to get it to fit on the fabric if you’re making long gloves."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pin the paper pattern to the folded fabric.",
      "content": "Pin the paper pattern to the folded fabric. Once you have the pattern in place on the fabric, insert pins along the edges of the paper pattern and going all the way through both layers of fabric. Insert 1 pin every 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) going all the way around the edges of the gloves. [7] X Research source For the each of the fingers and the thumb, insert 1 pin near the ends as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Trace along the edges of the paper pattern with a pen or fabric marker.",
      "content": "Trace along the edges of the paper pattern with a pen or fabric marker. Outline the paper glove pattern directly onto the wrong side of the top layer of your glove fabric. Trace right along the edges of the glove pattern. [8] X Research source Make sure to use a pen or fabric marker that will show up on the fabric since you’ll need to be able to see it clearly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the pins from the paper pattern and insert pins through the fabric only.",
      "content": "Remove the pins from the paper pattern and insert pins through the fabric only. Insert a pin every 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) along the edges of the fabric and 1 through each of the fingertips. This will help to keep the fabric together while you sew. [9] X Research source Make sure that the fabric is smooth and even on both sides when you do this."

      "title": "Sew a straight stitch",
      "content": "Sew a straight stitch along the lines except for at the glove opening. Set your sewing machine to the straight stitch setting and raise the presser foot. Then, place the fabric under the presser foot and lower it over the fabric. Begin sewing where the sleeve of the glove begins. Sew a straight stitch all the way up the side of the glove sleeve and around the sides and tips of the thumb and fingers. Then, sew back down and around to the other side of the sleeve. [10] X Research source Do not sew across the glove’s opening! If you're making fingerless gloves, leave the end of each of the fingers and thumb open as well."

    {
      "title": "Cut off the excess fabric 1⁄4 in (0.64 cm) from the stitches.",
      "content": "Cut off the excess fabric 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) from the stitches. After you finish sewing, raise the presser foot and pull the fabric away from the sewing machine. Snip the thread with a pair of scissors. Then, use a sharp pair of scissors to cut around the outside of the stitches and remove the excess fabric. Cut about 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) from the stitches and across the line at the bottom of the glove. [11] X Research source Be careful not to cut through any of the stitches or you will create a hole in the glove."

      "title": "Hem",
      "content": "Hem the opening of the glove. Fold over 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) of the fabric at the glove’s opening so that the wrong sides of the fabric are together. Then, sew a straight stitch about 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) from the folded edge going all the way around the end of the glove. [12] X Research source Cut the excess thread when you get back to the beginning of the hem. If you're making fingerless gloves, hem the ends of the fingers and thumb as well."

      "content": "Turn the glove right side out and try it on. After you finish sewing the hem, the glove is ready to wear. Just turn it inside out and slip it on to see how it fits. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Repeat the process to make a second glove.",
      "content": "Repeat the process to make a second glove. Make the second glove exactly how you made the first glove. You don’t need to create a new pattern. Use the same pattern to create a matching glove and follow the same process for tracing the pattern onto the fabric, sewing along the lines, and cutting it out. [14] X Research source"
