Let the baby’s siblings, your family, and friends know that you are expecting a new baby. This can help them prepare mentally for changes and offer you assistance during your pregnancy and after delivery. Send out pregnancy announcements if you like. Tell the baby’s siblings in person. If your other children are small, explain what having a new baby means. For example, “there is a baby growing in me that will be here with us soon. It’ll be exciting because you’ll be a big sister and can help me out and love your new sibling.” Explain that a baby sleeps, eats, and cries a lot and won’t be able to play right away."

Babies don’t take up a huge amount of space their first few months of life. Paint a separate room as a nursery or put up wall decals in the room or a space in an apartment. You can decorate with a gender-specific theme if you want, too. Remember to use non-toxic paint if you decide to use color in the room. Make sure the space has enough room for the bed you plan to use such as a bassinet, crib, or basket. Set aside some space in your kitchen or pantry for bottles and formula if you are using it."
