      "title": "Compare the cost of combo meals to individual menu items.",
      "content": "Compare the cost of combo meals to individual menu items. You’ll find several numbered “Value Meals” on McDonald’s menu, which typically combine a sandwich (or similar entree) with fries and a drink. These usually will save you money versus buying each component of a meal separately, but only if you really want all 3 parts of the meal. For instance, a Quarter Pounder Value Meal will cost you less than buying the burger, fries, and drink separately. However, if you'd prefer to just ask for a cup of water (which should be free), it's probably cheaper to order the burger and fries individually."

      "title": "Check the “$1, $2, $3 Value Menu” and “2 for $3” or “2 for $4” deals.",
      "content": "Check the “$1, $2, $3 Value Menu” and “2 for $3” or “2 for $4” deals. You'll find a wide range of burgers, sandwiches, fries, drinks, and treats sold individually as part of the Value Menu. You may be able to build your own meal combo for less than any of the numbered Value Meals. And, if you'd like 2 of the same item or are ordering for 2 people, look for any 2 for $3 or 2 for $4 deals. You have to buy 2 of the item to get the 2 for $3 or 2 for $4 price. Otherwise they'll charge you the regular menu price. If you’re feeding a larger group, many locations sell baskets of fries, 20-piece McNuggets, and sometimes bags of burgers or family combo meals that can save you money. Don’t be afraid to ask if there are any coupons or promotions available as well."

      "content": "Order a salad without dressing or a yogurt parfait for the healthiest options. Generally speaking, these are the healthiest standard menu items. However, many McDonald’s menu boards now contain calorie counts, and you can also ask them for additional nutritional information on every menu item. If you really want to eat healthier at McDonald’s, search online for “healthy McDonald’s menu items” before you head to the restaurant. [1] X Research source McDonald’s continues to expand their menu offerings in an attempt to appeal to more health-conscious consumers."

      "content": "Order a Happy Meal to reduce your calorie intake a bit. If you crave the classic McDonald’s taste but do want to eat at least a little healthier, consider ordering a Happy Meal (yes, they sell them to adults!). The small pouch of fries, kid-size drink, and fresh fruit will be slightly better for your waistline. Get the hamburger (instead of cheeseburger) or 4 piece (instead of 6 piece) McNuggets Happy Meal to shave off some more calories and fat. If you have no interest in the free toy, you can ask them to leave it out!"

      "content": "Order from the \"secret menu\" to make your meal ultra-customized. You’ll find many mentions online of McDonald’s so-called “secret menu,” but this really just involves making substitutions or combinations of existing menu items. Search online before heading to the restaurant to find some popular secret menu “hacks.” You can, for instance, order any burger “Big Mac style,” which means adding lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, and Big Mac sauce to the plain burger. You can also substitute a sesame seed bun on any sandwich. You can also request a “round egg” (a fresh egg cooked in a round form) on any breakfast sandwich instead of getting the scrambled egg sheet that’s made from a powdered egg mix. To make sure your fries are hot and fresh, just request “fresh fries.” If you want to make sure your Filet-o-Fish is cooked fresh, request it without cheese."

All the standard menu items at the McDonald’s you’re visiting will be listed on the series of menu boards that are above the counter where you’ll order. Pictures of the food accompany many of the menu items, while others are just text descriptions. Most McDonald’s now have digital menu boards that rotate through all the items on their ever-expanding menu. You may have to watch for a few moments to see the entire menu. If you have difficulty seeing or reading the menu boards, ask the person at the counter for a braille menu or other ordering assistance. They should be happy to help."

If you want your Big Mac without cheese, request it. If you want to know the cheapest way to get McNuggets and fries for 8 kids, ask. Be polite and speak clearly, though. The kinder you are, the more helpful the person behind the counter is likely to be."

After you pay, take your receipt and move to the side of the register or to the designated pickup area at one end of the counter. If you’re not sure where to wait for your food, just ask! Some McDonald’s will now deliver food to your table in the restaurant. If so, they’ll give you a numbered tag to display on your table, or an electronic tag to keep with you until your food arrives. [2] X Research source Many McDonald’s have self-service drink stands. If so, they’ll give you an empty cup so you can choose your drink at the stand."

Within a few seconds of pulling up to the speaker box beneath the menu board, you’ll probably hear “Welcome to McDonald’s, may I take your order?” If you’re ready to order, go ahead. If not, simply ask for a moment to look over the menu. The employee will probably tell you to take your time and just start speaking your order whenever you’re ready. The employee is listening on a headset at all times, so they’ll hear you whenever you start ordering. If you need help ordering off the menu, let the person know. The menu boards outside will match the ones inside, so take your time looking over the various value meals/deals and calorie counts. That way, you can get what you want, perhaps save a little money, and maybe even eat a little healthier!"

You don’t have to shout into the speaker for the person to hear you, but it helps to speak a bit louder and more deliberately than normal. If you have any questions or wish to make any substitutions or special requests, present these clearly as well. There may be a video screen that lists your order as you go. Check this over to make sure your order has been inputted correctly. If there isn’t a video screen, the employee should read back your order to you to confirm they got it right.

After your order is confirmed, the employee will tell you the total cost and ask you to either “pull around to the window,” “pull around to the first window,” or “pull around to the second window.” Simply follow the drive-thru lane to this window. Some McDonald’s have only 1 window, where you’ll pay and pick up your food. Others have 2, the first one for paying and the second for picking up your food. Sometimes, though, the first window will be closed and you’ll pay and pick up at the second window. McDonald’s drive-thru wait times have actually increased in recent years, due to expanding menu options and all the new ways to order (apps, touchscreens, etc.). So try to be patient!

Then either pull to the next window or (if there’s only 1 window) stay where you are and wait for your food. Once your food is handed to you, quickly scan through the bags to make sure you received everything you ordered. If you find a mistake while you’re still at the window, you can ask them to fix it right then and there. If you find the mistake after you pull away, you’ll have to either park and go into the restaurant or pull around the drive-thru again.

They look like flat-screen TVs mounted vertically, will be displaying ads for menu items on them, and should be labeled as an ordering kiosk. The plan is for practically every McDonald’s to eventually have ordering kiosks, but there are no plans to remove the walk-up counters for those who prefer to order from a human.

[5] X Research source You might also be asked to select your payment method before you begin ordering. If you want to pay with cash, you’ll typically have to walk up to the counter to pay after you’ve ordered.

[7] X Research source For instance, if you want your medium fries with ketchup, you’ll touch the “fries” tab, touch the “medium” tab, and select “ketchup” when the sauce and add-on options appear. If you make a mistake, look for a “remove” or “go back” tab as you’re ordering an item. Each time you select an item, there will be an “Add to Order” or “Confirm” tab for you to touch.
