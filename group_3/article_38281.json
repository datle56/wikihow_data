Your object will change size according to that number. If you use decimals, the thing you want to scale will become smaller. Voila! You're done! Alternatively, you can scale by moving your cursor around. When you find a size that you want, just left click on the mouse to enter. This step makes it very difficult to scale down though."

For this method you need two objects to work with. One could be a line/object/block/image/group and the other could be different (eg. one line and one image, or one block and one image). Or they could both be the same thing (eg. two lines or two images)."
