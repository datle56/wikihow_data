      "content": "Open an application from anywhere. The open command normally requires you to input the full file path from your current directory. However, adding -a followed by the name of an application instructs Terminal to open that Application, no matter where it is located. For example: [2] X Research source To open iTunes: open -a iTunes Use quotation marks if the application has a space in its name: open -a \"App Store\""

Just type in the file path followed by -a and the application name. If you're not sure how to enter file paths, see the Troubleshooting section below.

For example, enter this command repeatedly to open multiple instances of an alarm clock program: open -n -a \"Wake Up Time\" (Note: this is not a default OS X program.) This may cause unexpected behavior in other applications that interact with the duplicate application."

      "content": "Run an application inside Terminal. Instead of just opening an application normally, Terminal can host it. This is useful for debugging, as error messages and other console outputs will appear in that Terminal window. Here's how to do this: Locate the application in Finder. Right-click the application and select \"Show Package Contents.\" Locate the executable file. Typically, this is in Contents → MacOS , and has the same name as the application. Drag that file onto your blank Terminal command line. Hit Enter to launch that program. Leave your Terminal window open while you use the application. Quit the application to return to regular Terminal operations."

      "content": "Understand absolute file paths. If Terminal displays \"the file ... does not exist,\" you did not type the correct file path. An easy way to avoid mistakes is to drag and drop the file from Finder directly into your Terminal command line (after typing \"open,\" but before hitting Enter.) This will enter the absolute file path, which will always point to that file. [6] X Research source An absolute file path always begins with the symbol / . It describes the file path in relation to the root directory (usually \"Macintosh HD\")."

By default, this is your Home directory, named after your username. A relative file path begins with ./ or with no special characters, and describes the file's location in relation to your current directory. [7] X Research source If you're having trouble figuring this out, follow these steps: Enter pwd to check your current directory. The file you are trying to open must be within this directory, not at a higher level. Find your current directory in Finder. Open a series of folder until you reach the file you'd like to open. Type in the names of the folders you opened in order, separated by / symbols, then end with the file name. For example, open Documents/Writing/Novel/ch3.pdf . (You may start with ./ in front of Documents for the same result.)"

Or switch directories to the folder that contains the file. Enter ls into your Terminal command line to list all files in your directory. Or drag and drop the file into your Terminal window."
