These can be deep, personal questions or lighthearted, funny ones. Play until you’ve asked a total of 21 questions or until you lose interest in the game. [1] X Research source Check out our “Fun Things to Ask in 21 Questions” section for some interesting questions to ask! An alternate version of 21 Questions (or 20 Questions ) involves someone secretly thinking of a person, place, or thing.
