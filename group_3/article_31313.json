      "title": "Make sure the device has power.",
      "content": "Make sure the device has power. This may seem like an obvious fix, but it is a problem that is frequently overlooked. Make sure the frother is properly plugged in and powered on. Also, make sure the electrical outlet it is plugged into is working properly. If your frother is plugged into the same outlet as another appliance, such as a toaster oven or air fryer, running both at the same time may cause your breaker to pop. Check your electrical breakers and make sure they are switched on. Only use one appliance at a time."

      "title": "Make sure the magnetic whisk is clean.",
      "content": "Make sure the magnetic whisk is clean. You should clean the magnetic whisk and the inside of the frother after every use. If you don't, gunk will build up on the whisk and inside the frother, which will keep it from spinning properly. To clean the whisk remove the whisk from inside the frother. Place the whisk inside one-half cup of white vinegar and 1 tbsp of salt. Allow the whisk to sit in the solution for a few hours or overnight. Then rinse the whisk with cold water and brush away any remaining gunk with a soft-bristle brush or a toothbrush."

      "title": "Make sure the inside of the frother is clean.",
      "content": "Make sure the inside of the frother is clean. If there is build-up inside the frother (especially where the whisk connects), it could cause the frother to heat up too quickly or prevent the whisk from spinning properly. In addition to cleaning the whisk, you should also clean the inside of the frother. To clean the inside of the frother, make sure the device is turned off and unplugged. Remove the whisk and fill the frother with a solution of half water and half white vinegar. Allow it to sit for a few hours or overnight. Pour the solution out and rinse the inside with cold water. Scrub the inside with a non-abrasive sponge or brush. Dry it with a soft cloth. You should rinse the frother and whisk with cold water after each use. Then dry with a soft cloth. Do not put the frother canister in the dishwasher."

      "content": "Purchase a replacement whisk. If the whisk has too much wear and tear or has been damaged, you can purchase a replacement from a Nespresso dealer. However, it will probably be cheaper and quicker to buy one from Amazon ."

      "title": "Make sure you are using refrigerated cow's milk.",
      "content": "Make sure you are using refrigerated cow's milk. Milk alternatives, such as soy or almond milk, may not froth as well as traditional milk products. This is due to the lack of fat and protein. For best results, Nespresso recommends using refrigerated milk. [1] X Research source Milk that's fresh and cold works best. However, don't allow your milk to freeze, or it won't froth. [2] X Research source Shaking the milk before using it in the frother will also give you better results."

      "title": "Make sure the device has had time to cool down.",
      "content": "Make sure the device has had time to cool down. If you use the frother again after you just finished using it, it may get too hot too quickly. This will cause it to cut off before the heating cycle is complete. Make sure you allow the device time to cool down after each use. Rinsing the frother with cold water after use can help it cool down quicker. If you see a flashing red light on the frother, this means it is heating up too quickly."

      "title": "Clean any grease, gunk, or build-up on the metal connectors.",
      "content": "Clean any grease, gunk, or build-up on the metal connectors. The metal connectors are on the bottom of the frother canister and the base station. Gunk, grease, and grime can build up on the connectors over time and prevent them from working. This is especially true if you have milk overflow issues. To clean the metal contacts, make sure the frother is unplugged. Turn the frothing canister upside down. Scrub the metal connectors on the bottom of the cup and on the base station with soap and water using a brush until all the gunk is removed. Rinse the soap off and then scrub it again using isopropyl alcohol. Then for good measure, you can clean it using contact cleaner spray. To prevent milk overflow, make sure you are not filling the frother past the maximum fill line indicated inside the frother canister."

      "title": "Check the heating element and make sure it isn't burnt out.",
      "content": "Check the heating element and make sure it isn't burnt out. This is a more advanced repair, as you will need to take apart the canister and check the inside. You may need to do some soldering. You should easily be able to see if the heating element is burnt. To disassemble the canister, use a Torx screwdriver or Allen wrench to remove the screws from the bottom. Then pry apart the bottom of the canister. The motor and controller board sit on top of the heating element. You should be able to slide the motor and controller board right out. The heating element is a copper strip on a printed circuit board. If you see any burn marks on it, it is probably burnt out. You may be able to repair it by scraping away the burnt enamel. Then you might be able to solder some copper over the damaged copper. You should only attempt this if you are skilled at soldering electronics . Perform any advanced repairs at your own risk. Take it to an authorized repair shop if you are not comfortable with this task."

      "title": "Make sure the thermal fuse isn't blown.",
      "content": "Make sure the thermal fuse isn't blown. The thermal fuse is another common failure point for Nespresso frothers. To replace it, you will need to order a new one. You can use a multimeter to test it and see if it is blown. Replacing a blown fuse is another advanced repair job that should be done at our own risk and only if you are comfortable making such a repair. To replace the fuse, you will need to unscrew the screws from the bottom of the canister and take it apart. The thermal fuse is a small metal tube connected between two red wires inside a clear plastic tube. The type of fuse you need should be marked on the fuse itself. Unsolder the fuse from the red wires and use a multimeter to see if it is blown. If it is blown, solder a new fuse to the red wires and cover it with the plastic tubing. Then put the canister back together."

      "title": "Make sure the thermocouple isn't damaged.",
      "content": "Make sure the thermocouple isn't damaged. The thermocouple is the heat sensor that sits inside the canister to monitor the temperature and cut it off when it gets too hot. If the thermocouple is damaged, it will stop the heating cycle prematurely. It will start heating and then stop almost immediately. You may see flashing red lights indicating the heating cycle is stopping prematurely. Replacing the thermocouple is also an advanced repair job that should be done at your own risk if you are comfortable performing the repair. To replace the thermocouple, you will need to purchase a new one. Once you have a replacement, you will need to remove the screws from the bottom of the canister and open it. The thermocouple is attached to the board via a slip connector. Remove the thermocouple and insert the new one. Make sure you apply thermal grease so that it conducts heat well enough. Then put the canister back together."
