      "title": "Get a wireless remote presenter.",
      "content": "Get a wireless remote presenter. This device, commonly called a clicker, resembles a simple mouse and has at least two buttons, forward and back, that move forward or backward in the presentation. Many clickers also have laser pointers that you can use to point out certain aspects of each slide, as well as other embellishments, and most are small enough to comfortably hold in one hand. Choose a clicker you like. Using this clicker allows you to remove away from the computer, walk around the stage, and engage more closely with the audience, without giving up control of the computer."

      "title": "Connect the clicker to your computer.",
      "content": "Connect the clicker to your computer. Wireless presenters always come with a receiver, usually placed in a slot at the back of the clicker, or sometimes hidden behind the battery cover. Take off this receiver and connect it to an available USB port in your computer. Put in any necessary batteries or other requirements for your clicker. Once the receiver connects to your computer, it will automatically install the necessary driver. Wait until this process finishes before proceeding."

      "content": "Make sure the clicker works properly. It's always a good idea to test your technology well before your presentation so that you can solve any problems that arise without delaying or interrupting the presentation. To check that your clicker works, open any PowerPoint presentation and put it in presentation mode. Click all buttons on the clicker, especially the forward and back buttons, to make sure they work. Check the user manual for the maximum distance covered by the wireless presenter. When giving the presentation, make sure you do not move beyond that distance."

      "content": "Know when to use a Wireless Presentation Gateway, or WPG. Since most wireless presenters can only move forward and back, they are not suitable for a presentation where the presenter needs to be close to the computer, for example to toggle between files such as the presentation file, a spreadsheet, and a video. In this case, you need a wireless device that will replace the video cable between the computer and projector. This device is called a Wireless Presentation Gateway, or WPG, and it connects to a computer through WiFi. [1] X Research source"
