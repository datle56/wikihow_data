      "content": "Choose small leaf varieties for indoors and English ivy for outdoors. If you plan to keep your ivy growing indoors to add some greenery to your living space, opt for a variety with smaller leaves. Smaller leaves mean the plant will not grow as fast and won’t take up as much space. To grow ivy around a structure or use it as ground cover outdoors, choose the English or Boston ivy plant. [1] X Research source Small leaf ivy varieties include the Golden Curl, Parsley Crested, and Spanish Canary. Make sure you know what kind of ivy you’re planting beforehand so you know what you’re getting into. Look up the leaves online to identify an ivy plant. English and Boston ivy have larger leaves and spread very quickly."

      "title": "Use several cuttings from an existing ivy plant if possible.",
      "content": "Use several cuttings from an existing ivy plant if possible. Look for a section of an ivy plant that is old enough for the stem to be woody and strong, but young enough that it’s still flexible enough to bend. Take 3 or 4 cuttings to ensure at least 1 of them will develop roots and grow. [2] X Research source You can also purchase cuttings with well-established roots from a garden center, home improvement store, or nursery for convenience."

      "content": "Cut 5 in (13 cm) sections with a sharp knife just below a node. A node is a small bump where a leaf grows or has grown from the stem of an ivy plant. Take a sharp knife and remove a section of the ivy by cutting just below the node with as clean of a cut as possible so the stem isn’t too damaged and roots will grow.

You can also use a sharp pair of scissors or pruners to cut the ivy."

      "content": "Place the cuttings in a glass of water in a sunny location. Fill a clear glass with room temperature water about halfway. Stick all of your ivy cuttings into the glass of water and place the glass somewhere warm and sunny such as a windowsill or a kitchen counter that gets lots of sunlight. [5] X Research source Make sure the room temperature is between 60–80 °F (16–27 °C). Use a clear glass so you can see the roots when they start to form."

      "content": "Wait until you see roots growing before you plant the ivy. After a few days, you should see tiny white, hairlike roots sticking out of the ends of the cuttings of ivy. When you see roots forming, the ivy cuttings can be transplanted to an indoor pot or the soil outside to start growing. [6] X Research source Avoid moving or disturbing the cuttings so they can produce their roots. The ivy cuttings can survive in the glass of water for several weeks so you can plant them whenever you’re ready."

      "content": "Use a flower pot with drainage holes at the bottom. Ivy needs to be watered every so often, but if it sits in too much moisture for too long, the roots can rot and the plant can die. Choose a flower pot that allows for drainage so you don’t have to worry about overwatering your ivy.

Use an all-purpose potting soil and pour it into the flower pot to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top so the soil won’t spill or fall out of the pot.

Use your fingertip or a pencil and poke holes deep enough into the soil to allow the delicate roots of the cuttings to easily spread.

Make sure the holes are spaced out at least 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) from each other so their roots don’t have to compete. Insert the ends of the cuttings into the holes and pat down the soil around them so they’re propped up.
