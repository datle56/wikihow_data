Latin American culture in particular can be quite formal, so when in doubt, this is the best way to greet someone.

This gesture may not be necessary everywhere, but it will be seen as a sign of respect regardless."

      "content": "Move to more casual ways of saying \"hello.\" Just as in English, it's common for Spanish speakers to use different greetings when talking to friends or acquaintances, or when greeting one another in a more casual atmosphere. [3] X Research source \"¿Qué pasa?\" (KAY PAH-sah) means \"What's happening?\" \"¿Qué tal?\" (kay tahl) means \"What's up?\" \"¿Qué haces?\" (kay ah-says) means \"What are you doing?\" or \"What are you up to?\""

      "content": "Use \"¿Cómo estás?\" (KOH-moh ess-TAHS) as a greeting. Just as in English, Spanish speakers often skip the \"hello\" and move straight to \"How are you?\" as a greeting. You'll change the form of the verb estar depending on who you're greeting. [4] X Research source Say \"¿Cómo estás?\" when speaking informally, to someone your age or younger, or someone familiar. If you're speaking formally, to someone older than you or in a position of authority, you would say \"¿Cómo está?\" You can also say \"¿Cómo está usted?\" When in doubt, address the person formally and give them the opportunity to tell you that it's not necessary. When speaking to a group of people, say \"¿Cómo están?\" to address everyone."

      "content": "Switch up your greeting when answering the phone. In most places, if you answer the phone by saying \"¿Hola?\" you'll be perfectly well understood. But most Spanish speakers answer the phone by saying \"¿Aló?\" [5] X Research source In South America, you also might hear the phone answered \"¿Sí?\" This is especially common in business contexts. Spaniards typically answer the phone \"¿Dígame?\" or the shortened form \"¿Díga?\" This also means \"hello,\" but is only going to be used on the phone. If you're the one making the phone call, it's polite to respond to the phone greeting with a greeting based on the time of day. For example, if you're placing the call in the morning, you might respond \"¡Buenos días!\" (boo-AY-nohs DEE-ahs), or \"Good morning!\""
