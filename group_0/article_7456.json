Setting your goals will guide your dumbbell selection process. Heavier dumbbells are good for building muscle , while lighter ones are better for stabilizing muscle to support tendons and joints.

Go to source In general, the larger the muscle group, the more weight it can lift. Use small to medium dumbbells for your biceps , triceps and deltoids, and medium to large weights for working your chest, leg , and back muscles. Write your goals down before and during your dumbbells training. This way, you can stay focused and modify or adjust your intentions if a goal has been met. For instance, you might write, “I want to be able to do a set of eight bicep curls with 35 pound dumbbells in the next two months.”"

      "content": "Choose the dumbbell weight corresponding to the exercise and skill level. Depending on the exercise, you might want dumbbells of different weights. For instance, if you’re doing a basic curl, you might be able to curl 15 pounds (6.8 kg). If you’re doing a squat with your dumbbells, however, you might choose a 20 or 25 pound (9 or 11 kg) dumbbell set. Likewise, if you are learning a new exercise, you will want to start light and focus on building proper form before adding weight.

Ensure you have a range of different weights to accommodate the various exercises you want to perform. Most beginners should have three sets of dumbbells, a light one, a medium one, and a heavy one, to accommodate different types of exercises."

Increase the weight by 2.5 pounds (1.1 kg) until you get to a weight that is difficult to use for the exercise. Then, go down one increment. This will be the best weight for you to start at. [4] X Expert Source Steve Horney PT, MPT, MTC, CSCS Licensed Physical Therapist Expert Interview. 20 March 2020. Keep a journal recording how many reps of each exercise you did, the weight you chose for that exercise, and your feelings about whether it was too light, too heavy, or just right. Always choose the weight that’s right for you. Listen to your body to decide what’s right for you. Do not select a weight based on what others of your age or gender are lifting. The only person you should be trying to beat in a dumbbell-lifting competition is you.

      "content": "Know when to add weight to your dumbbell workout . Once you have found the right dumbbell weight for an exercise, start to increase one or two pounds at a time to meet the needs of your growing muscles. If you aren’t feeling a moderate to intense muscle strain after performing 15 reps of a given exercise, it’s time to add some weight or procure heavier dumbbells, or otherwise change the exercise. [6] X Research source Carefully monitor how many sets and reps you can do continuously and, if you find that you can do more than your target number of repetitions, increase the amount of weight you're lifting by one to two pounds. Incorporating different exercises for the same muscles can change how the muscle is targeted. If you are not feeling strain with one exercise, try another to develop more complete strength."

      "content": "Recognize when you’re trying to lift too much. Normally, this shouldn’t be a problem, since as a smart and safe weightlifter you’ve started out at the low end of your dumbbell weight-lifting range and worked your way up. Never start out with a heavy weight and work your way down to the weight you need to be at. When first starting with a particular weight, if you cannot do more than seven reps of a given exercise, it is too heavy for you. [7] X Research source Set the weight which is too heavy aside and select a dumbbell one to three pounds lighter, depending upon what is available. Adjust in small increments to get the best possible weight for your exercise. Picking a weight that is too heavy can cause you to develop bad form and, more seriously, injure yourself."
