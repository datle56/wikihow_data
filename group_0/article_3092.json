      "title": "Maintain and clean any shared spaces.",
      "content": "Maintain and clean any shared spaces. If you live in a duplex, townhome, or apartment, you might end up sharing responsibility for a hallway, entrance, or yard with your neighbors. Do your part to keep these spaces as nice as possible by removing or carefully storing your personal items, such as bikes or grills. Pick up any trash that you see, too. [1] X Research source For example, to maintain a lawn space, talk with your neighbor about rotating mowing duties each week."

      "title": "Care for your own yard and garden.",
      "content": "Care for your own yard and garden. To avoid unsightly, overgrown grass, stick to a lawn maintenance schedule that includes regular mows throughout the year. In the fall, make sure to collect and dispose of your leaves. Trim back any trees or bushes and clean up any flowerbeds. If you can’t do this maintenance on your own, consider hiring a professional lawn service."

    {
      "title": "Put your trash out at the right time and day.",
      "content": "Put your trash out at the right time and day. To keep your neighbors happy and your home clean, take out your trash according to the local schedule. Also, use the correct trash containers and follow any restrictions regarding chemicals or oversized items. If trash day passes and you notice that a particular item has not been picked up, call waste services for your area to ask why it was left behind. Most waste companies have very particular policies regarding what types of trash they will pick up and how it must be set out. For example, it may not be enough to simply place large branches by the curb of your house. You might need to cut and tie them into bundles. Following the local trash rules also helps to cut down on the presence of pests and vermin, such as mice."

    {
      "title": "Keep your pets quiet and under control.",
      "content": "Keep your pets quiet and under control. Closely follow all of your local laws regarding pet ownership. Have your animals fully vaccinated, licensed, and on a leash when in your front yard or neighborhood. If you have dogs, enroll them in training courses to curb outside barking and noisiness. If they persist in barking, then bring them inside. [2] X Research source Let your neighbors know that they can come talk with you if your pets are ever bothering them. For example, you might say, “If you ever hear my dog barking too much in the evenings, just let me know.” If you are walking in your neighborhood, practice common courtesy by picking up your pet’s poop, too."
    },
    {
      "title": "Follow your area’s noise regulations.",
      "content": "Follow your area’s noise regulations. Go to your city’s webpage and look up the rules regarding noise. You’ll find that certain noises, such as loud home repairs, are restricted to particular hours of the day. Keep this in mind as you go about your daily life and try to avoid being disruptive, especially during early morning or evening hours. [3] X Research source If you live in an apartment complex, the leasing company will usually provide you with a list of community rules, which usually includes a statement about noise. Go ahead and lower your noise level if you even think that you are being loud. Use what you know about your neighbors to determine what is appropriate, too. For example, if you know that the person next door works nights, then take that into account and adjust your noise levels accordingly."

      "title": "Introduce yourself",
      "content": "Introduce yourself . If you’ve recently moved in, go over to your neighbors and say “hello.” If you’ve lived in an area for a while, then take the initiative and reach out to new arrivals yourself. As part of welcoming someone to the area, feel free to offer them a small moving in gift. For a more informal approach, say hi to your neighbors when they (or you) are outside walking their dog or working on their lawn. When you first meet your neighbor you might say, “Hi! I’m Fred Thompson. I live 2 doors down from you and just wanted to come over and welcome you to the neighborhood.” You can also give you neighbor any friendly local tips, such as what time the garbage or mail carrier stops by. A welcoming gift can be anything from a friendly card to a basket filled with local foods or produce."

      "title": "Do your neighbors a favor when possible.",
      "content": "Do your neighbors a favor when possible. If you see your neighbor struggling with a package, offer to help them. If you notice that they do not have a mower, offer to let them use yours for a bit. If you are helpful to your neighbors, don’t feel ashamed when you need to reach out for assistance as well. [4] X Research source For example, if your neighbor is going out of town, they might ask you to watch over their home. Then, when you take a trip, you can ask them to return the favor."

    {
      "title": "Attend and host neighborhood events and associations.",
      "content": "Attend and host neighborhood events and associations. Invite a few of your neighbors over for a nice dinner or barbeque. Find out if your home makes you eligible to participate in a local community organization or watch group. If not, talk to your neighbors and create your own. These are great ways to get to know your neighbors whether you’ve been in the area for days or years. For example, a community association could work together to put on a local street festival or even small dinners."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stay calm when talking with your neighbor.",
      "content": "Stay calm when talking with your neighbor. If your neighbor comes to you with a concern or problem, it’s important to respond calmly and rationally. If you start to get frustrated, take a few deep breaths before answering. You can also ask to postpone the conversation until you have a bit of time to think. For example, to give yourself a few days to think everything over, you might say, “I understand where you are coming from, but I need to consider how to fix it on my end. Can we talk about this over the weekend again?”"

      "title": "Deal with any problems face to face.",
      "content": "Deal with any problems face to face. If you have any issue that involves your neighbor, it’s important to act fast. Go to them directly and tell them what is going on. Ask for their help in finding a solution that will work for both of you. Giving your neighbor a chance to come up with a solution is better than immediately reaching out to local authorities. [5] X Research source This doesn’t necessarily apply if you feel as if the safety of you, your family, or the neighborhood is at stake. In those situations, you might want to reach out to local officials for assistance. Avoid gossiping about any issues with your neighbor to other neighbors or people in the community. This only creates additional problems."

      "title": "Give your neighbors notice before parties.",
      "content": "Give your neighbors notice before parties. If you plan on having a large group of people come over, it never hurts to give your neighbors a heads up. This lets them determine if they’ll need to park elsewhere or move their cars for the night. It also alerts them that lots of ‘new’ people will be in the neighborhood and that it might get loud. The same goes for any other large, loud gatherings, such as ongoing construction."
