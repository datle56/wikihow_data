In the example above, the beta would be 5 divided by 6, or 0.833. The beta of the market itself (or the appropriate index) is by definition 1.0, as the market is being compared to itself, and any number (except zero) divided by itself equals 1. [3] X Research source A beta of less than 1 means that the stock is less volatile than the market as a whole, while a beta greater than 1 means the stock is more volatile than the market as a whole. The beta value can be less than zero, meaning either that the stock is losing money while the market as a whole is gaining (more likely) or that the stock is gaining while the market as a whole is losing money (less likely). When figuring beta, it is common, though not required, to use an index representative of the market in which the stock trades. For U.S. stocks, the S&P 500 is the index usually used, [4] X Research source although analysis of an industrial stock may be better served by comparing it against the Dow Jones Industrial Average. There are several other indexes that could be used appropriately. For stocks that trade internationally, the MSCI EAFE (representing Europe, Australasia, and East Asia) is a suitable representative index."

      "content": "Know how to interpret beta. Beta is the risk, relative to the stock market as a whole, an investor assumes by owning a particular stock. That's why you need to compare the returns of a single stock against the returns of an index. The index is the benchmark against which the stock is judged. The risk of an index is fixed at 1. A beta of lower than 1 means that the stock is less risky than the index to which it's being compared. A beta of higher than 1 means the stock is more risky than the index to which it's being compared. [9] X Research source Take this example: Say that the beta of Gino's Germ Exterminator is calculated at .5. Compared to the S&P 500, the benchmark to which Gino's is being compared, it's half as risky. If the S&P moves down 10%, Gino's stock price will tend to fall only 5%. As another example, imagine that Frank's Funeral Service has a beta of 1.5 when compared to the S&P. If the S&P falls 10%, expect Frank's stock price to fall more than the S&P, or about 15%."

      "title": "Know that risk is usually related to return.",
      "content": "Know that risk is usually related to return. High risk, high reward; low risk, low reward. A stock with a low beta won't lose as much as the S&P when it falls, but it won't gain as much as the S&P when it posts gains. On the other hand, a stock with a beta over 1 will lose more than the S&P when it falls but will also gain more than the S&P when it posts a gain. For example, pretend Vermeer's Venom Extraction has a beta of .5. When the stock market jumps 30%, Vermeer's only gains 15%. But when the stock market sheds 30%, Vermeer's drops only 15%."

If you make your beta calculations and find out the stock you're analyzing has a beta of 1, it won't be any more or less risky than the index you used as a benchmark. The market goes up 2%, your stock goes up 2%; the market goes down 8%, your stock goes down 8%."

A good mix of high- and low-beta stocks will help you weather any dramatic downturns that the market happens to take. Of course, because low-beta stocks generally underperform the stock market as a whole during a bull market, a good mix of betas will also mean you won't experience the highest of the highs when times are good."

We may want to project that volatility into the future, but that won't always work. A stock's beta can change drastically from one year to the next. That's why it's not a terribly reliable predictive tool."
