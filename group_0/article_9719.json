      "content": "Consider using a scale instead. This may be useful depending on what you are calculating your GPA for. If you are calculating one grade at a time to see how they will add up for your high school GPA, then you may not have to follow this exact formula because all grades will fall within a range anyway. For example, if your grade falls within the range of 83-86, then depending on your high school, then you will have a B, or a 3.0, whether it falls on the higher or lower part of the range or not. Check out your school's GPA system to figure out how to do this; some high schools have a slightly different range for what makes an A- vs. an A, a B vs. a B+, and so on."

The idea is that getting a \"C\" in AP Algebra is just as hard as getting a \"B\" in regular Algebra."
