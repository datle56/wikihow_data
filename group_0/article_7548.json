      "title": "Start your \"Works Cited\" entry with the author's last name.",
      "content": "Start your \"Works Cited\" entry with the author's last name. As with any other book, write the author's last name first, then a comma, then their first name and middle initial (if available). Close this section of your citation with a period.

      "title": "Include the title of the book in italics.",
      "content": "Include the title of the book in italics. After the period following the author's name, copy the title of the book using title case. In MLA style, you typically capitalize all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs. Place a period at the end of the title.

      "title": "Identify the publisher and year of publication.",
      "content": "Identify the publisher and year of publication. Your \"Works Cited\" entry typically closes with publication information for the book. After the name of the publisher, type a comma. Then provide the year the book was published. End your citation with a period. Example: Lane, Lois. Serially Saved by Superman: My Work with Clark Kent . DC Press, 2017."

    {
      "title": "Include page numbers if you are only referencing the appendix.",
      "content": "Include page numbers if you are only referencing the appendix. If the appendix of the book is the only thing you're using, close your \"Works Cited\" entry with the page numbers on which the appendix appears. This is similar to how you would cite a specific chapter or essay in an edited book. Use a comma instead of a period after the year of publication. Before the page numbers, use the abbreviation \"p.\" for a single page, or \"pp.\" for multiple pages. Example: Lane, Lois. Serially Saved by Superman: My Work with Clark Kent . DC Press, 2017, pp. 512-514."
    },
    {
      "title": "Treat the appendix as a separate work if it has a separate author.",
      "content": "Treat the appendix as a separate work if it has a separate author. Rarely, an author will write the appendix to a book or collection written or edited by someone else. When this is the case, write your \"Works Cited\" entry as though they are the author of a piece of the larger work. [3] X Research source Example: Lane, Lois. \"Appendix: Superhero Sidekicks.\" Heroes Through the Ages , edited by Stan Lee, DC Press, 2017, pp. 512-514."

      "title": "Use the word \"appendix\" in your parenthetical citation.",
      "content": "Use the word \"appendix\" in your parenthetical citation. Normally you would include the author's last name and the page number in the parenthetical citation in the body of your paper. If you're citing an appendix, the page number isn't necessary. [4] X Research source Example: (Lane, appendix) Some books have multiple appendixes. In that case, specify which appendix you're referencing with the same label used in the book (typically a capital letter). For example: (Lane, appendix A)."

      "title": "Mention in the text that you're looking at the appendix.",
      "content": "Mention in the text that you're looking at the appendix. Within the body of your paper, you can let your readers know that the material you're referring to is in the appendix of the main work, rather than in the body of the work itself. [5] X Research source Example: In the appendix to her book, Lois Lane lists key features of a superhero's ideal sidekick."

      "title": "Start with the author's last name and initials.",

If the work as a whole is a book, your full citation in your references list should provide the author's last name first, followed by a comma. Use the first initial and middle initial, if given.

      "title": "Type the full title of the book in italics.",

If the book has a subtitle, place a colon after the title and then type the subtitle. Capitalize the first word and any proper nouns in the subtitle. Place a period at the end. [8] X Research source Example: Lane, L. (2017). Serially saved by Superman: My work with Clark Kent."

After the colon, type the name of the publishing company that published the book. Place a period at the end of your citation. [9] X Research source Example: Lane, L. (2017). Serially saved by Superman: My work with Clark Kent. New York, NY: DC Publishing. For US locations, include the name of the city and the postal abbreviation for the state.

      "title": "Include the regular author-date citation in text.",
      "content": "Include the regular author-date citation in text. The in-text parenthetical citation for an appendix to a larger work is not that much different from normal. However, after the year of publication, add the word \"Appendix\" to point your readers directly to the appendix. [10] X Research source Example: (Lane, 2017, Appendix) If there are multiple appendices in the work, use the label provided in the work to point your readers to the correct appendix. For example: (Lane, 2017, Appendix A)"

      "title": "Identify the part of the work you are citing.",
      "content": "Identify the part of the work you are citing. The next part of your full citation would normally be the title of the work. However, since you're only citing the appendix, use the phrase \"Appendix to\" to introduce the title of the book. Type the title in italics using title-case. [12] X Research source Example: Lane, Lois. Appendix to Serially Saved by Superman: My Work with Clark Kent If there is a different author for the work as a whole, include their name after the title of the work. For example: Lane, Lois.

Use the abbreviation \"pp\" for multiple pages, or \"p\" for a single page. Place a period after the final page number. [13] X Research source Single author example: Lane, Lois.
