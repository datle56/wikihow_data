What you choose here will have a huge impact on how the game plays out, so choose wisely. There are a few suggested upgrades that you should pick to make this game easier: DNA Gene - ATP Boost. This will give you extra DNA points at the beginning. Travel Gene - Aquacyte. Basically required to infect difficult islands like Greenland, Iceland, and New Zealand. Evolution Gene - Patho-Stasis. This will make your upgrades much cheaper. Mutation Gene - Genetic Mimic. This slows the cure progression, offsetting the negative effects of the Patho-Stasis upgrade. Environment Gene - Extremophile. This boosts the infection rate in every environmental condition."
