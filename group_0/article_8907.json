    {
      "title": "Decide whether to come out to one or both parents.",
      "content": "Decide whether to come out to one or both parents. First, figure out whether you should address your letter to both of your parents or start by coming out to one. You might feel more comfortable writing your letter to one parent, who can then help you come out to the other. If you address one letter to both of your parents, it might be a good idea to make a copy of your letter, print two copies, or send each of them an email. That way, they'll each have their own copy to read at their own pace and in their own time. Before you come out to your parents, find a trusted friend, and come out to them first. Ask this person for support throughout the process so that you have someone you can rely on if you need it."

    {
      "title": "Use simple, approachable language.",
      "content": "Use simple, approachable language. Be clear and direct, but use terms that you're most comfortable with and that will be easiest for your parents to digest. Sometimes, telling your parents that you're attracted to men or women is easier than saying, “I'm gay.” Further, sometimes the most specific terms are hard for parents to understand. For example, they might be able to understand that you're transgender, but you might confuse them if you start by describing your specific trans identity using terms they've never heard."
    },
    {
      "title": "Explain that you know who you are.",
      "content": "Explain that you know who you are. Be confident, and let your parents know that discovering who you are has been a process. Tell them that you want to be honest with them, but you aren't asking their permission to be yourself. For example, you could write, “I hope you understand that this isn't just a phase, and that it's taken some time for me to discover and accept myself.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Tell them what you need from them.",
      "content": "Tell them what you need from them. After writing about who you are and how you've come to accept yourself, you should include specific, actionable steps that your parents can take. Let them know exactly what you want and need from them. For example, let them know that you want to have an honest relationship with them. Write that you hope you can continue to rely on them for support and guidance. If you're writing to one parent, tell them that you'd like them to help you come out to your other parent. You could also ask them to keep this to themselves and mention that you'd like to come out to other family members on your own time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Propose ways of continuing the conversation.",
      "content": "Propose ways of continuing the conversation. If you'd prefer to continue the conversation in writing, ask them to reply with letters of their own. If you're writing to a parent who lives far away, ask them to write back to you or to set aside some time to talk on the phone. If you don't have a preference, you could write, “I'm not sure what steps we should take next. You can write me a letter if it would help you make sense of all this, or we could talk face to face.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Reread and revise your letter.",
      "content": "Reread and revise your letter. After composing your letter, set it aside in a secure place and take some time away from it. Get a good night's sleep, then read it back to yourself. Look for spots where you could be clearer, more confident, or more respectful, and revise it accordingly."

    {
      "title": "Choose a stress-free time to give them your letter.",
      "content": "Choose a stress-free time to give them your letter. Coming out is hard enough, so avoid giving your parents your letter during an argument or during a period of crisis. Try not to use coming out as a weapon or way to shock them, and avoid using alcohol or drugs before giving them the letter or discussing it with them. For example, if a relative is sick or your sibling just got in major trouble, you might want to wait until things settle down before giving them your letter."

      "title": "Give them time and space to process your letter.",
      "content": "Give them time and space to process your letter. Give them your letter in person, mail it, or send your email, then let them digest the news on their own terms. Be patient, and understand that they might need a little while to process and, hopefully, accept what you've written. When you give them the letter, tell them, “I hope you can read this with an open mind, and I hope we can handle what I've written about patiently and honestly. Please take all the time you need to process it.” Reader Poll: We asked 1270 wikiHow readers to tell us how they would respond if someone reacted negatively to them coming out, and only 8% agreed they would ask someone close to them to help change their mind. [Take Poll] So, while that may not be a great strategy according to our readers, try to give them time to digest the news on their own terms."

      "content": "Try to follow up with a conversation. You and your parents might find that exchanging a few letters is the best way to handle the situation. Eventually, try to have a face to face conversation with them. Once you've broken the ice in writing, you might find it easier to talk to them in person.

      "content": "Try to anticipate their reaction. Pay attention to how your parents respond to LGBTQ issues in the news. Take note if they make homophobic remarks or talk negatively about issues like marriage equality and adoption. Getting a feel for their basic outlook can help you anticipate how they'd react if and when you come out to them. [5] X Expert Source Marissa Floro, PhD Counseling Psychologist Expert Interview. 18 February 2021. When and if you do tell them, understand that your parents might feel shocked, sad, angry, guilty, or afraid. It can take some people more time to process news than others. Try to respect their emotional response, and have faith that their emotions can change over time. If your parents react angrily or if they don't have the reaction you wanted, try not to lose hope. Remember that they cannot define who you are, and you have the right to live your life as you want."

      "content": "Hold off if you think they'd cause physical harm. In a perfect world, no one would have to live in the closet. However, your safety should be your number one concern. If one or both of your parents have ever threatened to harm you or any member of the LGBTQ community, consider holding off until you know you can come out safely. For instance, if you really need to be honest with them but are concerned about your safety, you could wait until you live on your own or are otherwise out of harm's way before sending them your letter."

In addition to physical safety, take your financial well being into account when deciding how, when, and if you should come out.
