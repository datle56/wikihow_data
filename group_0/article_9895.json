      "content": "Combine the ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl. Place 2 cups (500 ml) of boiling water, 1 cup (250 ml) freekeh, 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt, and 1/2 Tbsp (7.5 ml) olive oil in a deep, glass or plastic microwave-safe bowl. Mix slightly to moisten all the freekeh granules and to spread the salt and oil. You can use either cracked grain freekeh or whole grain freekeh. Either option will work. To boil the water , fill a tea kettle or small saucepan with water and heat it on the stove over high heat until bubbles start to form. Alternatively, you can boil the water by placing it in a separate microwave-safe dish and microwaving it in 30 to 60 second intervals until bubbles start to form. Place wooden chopsticks in the water to break the surface tension as you microwave it, thereby preventing the water from super-heating and breaking the dish."

      "title": "Cook on high.",
      "content": "Cook on high. Cover the dish and cook the freekeh on high until most of the water is absorbed. For cracked grain freekeh, this will take 10 to 15 minutes. For whole grain freekeh, this will take 30 to 35 minutes. If your microwave does not rotate, pause the microwave one to three times during the process to turn the dish manually. Doing so can ensure that the freekeh cooks evenly."

    {
      "title": "Let stand.",
      "content": "Let stand. After the cooking process finishes, remove the dish from the microwave and let the freekeh stand, undisturbed and still covered, for about 5 minutes. The grains of freekeh should absorb the remaining water during this time, causing them to plump up and soften even more."

      "title": "Combine the ingredients in a saucepan.",
      "content": "Combine the ingredients in a saucepan. Add 2 1/2 cups (625 ml) cold water, 1 cup (250 ml) freekeh, 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt, and 1/2 Tbsp (7.5 ml) olive oil to a medium or large saucepan. Mix slightly to spread the salt and olive oil and moisten all the grains of freekeh. You can use cracked grain or whole grain. The latter takes longer to cook, but either one will work. Make sure that the saucepan has a lid. The contents of the saucepan should take up half to three-quarters of the total volume. If the pan is much fuller than that, the water might boil over. Make sure that you use cool to cold water. Cool water will heat more evenly, so the grains of freekeh will cook more evenly, as well. Note that if the instructions on your box or bag of freekeh differ, it is advisable to use the instructions provided on the container rather than these."

      "title": "Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.",
      "content": "Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Use a mixing spoon to stir the contents of the saucepan occasionally as they come up to temperature. Once the liquid starts to boil, cover the pan with its lid. The lid is necessary because it traps the steam inside. This prevents the water from evaporating, leaving it nowhere to go but into the grains of freekeh."

      "title": "Let simmer.",
      "content": "Let simmer. Lower the heat to low or medium-low and let the grains simmer until the grains become tender. For cracked grain freekeh, this should take about 10 to 15 minutes. For whole grain freekeh, this should take 40 to 45 minutes. Stir the grains periodically during the process to promote even cook and limit the amount getting stuck to the pan. Stir the grains once more at the end of the process to make sure that all of the water has been absorbed and that the grains are adequately tender."

      "content": "Sauté the onions. Place the butter and olive oil in a large, heavy saucepan and warm them on the stove over medium heat. Add the sliced onions once the butter melts and Sauté until soft and brown. Sliced onion will take about 15 to 20 minutes to cook. You will need to stir the onions occasionally to prevent them from burning or sticking to the pan. If you want to distribute the onion flavor more evenly throughout the dish, you could use chopped onion instead of onion slices. Note that chopped onions will only take 7 to 12 minutes to cook."

      "content": "Soak the freekeh in cold water. Place the uncooked freekeh grains in a medium bowl and fill the bowl with cold water. Let soak for 5 minutes. It is recommended that you do this while the onions are cooking to minimize the amount of time it takes to prepare the dish overall."

The purpose of soaking, draining, rinsing, and re-draining is to help clean the grains. Make sure that the holes in the sieve are very small to prevent the loss of grains."

      "content": "Simmer for 15 minutes. Once the liquid begins to boil, reduce the heat to low and let it all simmer gently for 15 minutes. Cover the saucepan as the freekeh cooks to avoid losing water through evaporation. Losing too much water can cause the freekeh to be hard and undercooked."

      "content": "Let stand. Once the freekeh seems tender, remove the saucepan from the stove and let it stand for 5 minutes covered and 5 more minutes uncovered. Letting the freekeh stand while covered allows the grains to finish absorbing the water. Letting it stand uncovered lets the freekeh cool down slightly."
