      "content": "“Chess, not checkers” refers to making strategic decisions. This popular idiom comes from the idea that checkers is a simple, straightforward game, while chess requires much more forethought and strategizing. If you’re playing chess, not checkers regarding business or personal decisions, it means you’re planning ahead and thinking about the endgame rather than short term goals. [1] X Research source For example, if you choose a job that has great benefits and room for growth over a job that offers a tempting sign-on bonus, you’re playing chess, not checkers by considering how it will benefit you in the long-run. Playing checkers requires you to make quick decisions to capture your opponent’s pieces, which means you get results immediately. There are also fewer moves you can make and directions you can go than in chess. In chess , pieces move in different directions based on their individual role, and it’s often important to sacrifice pieces in order to win the game. You don’t always get results as quickly as you do with checkers. This highlights the importance of strategic thinking."

      "content": "When you’re thinking through business decisions and strategies Many business leaders and entrepreneurs adopt the “chess, not checkers” mindset and believe it is a great way to succeed. Think about your long term goals and what strategies you can use to reach them rather than focusing on what’s directly in front of you. Remember the unique skills that you and your coworkers or employees bring to the table, and use those qualities to your advantage. [2] X Research source “Each of my employees has unique skills and assets, so I try to assign them tasks that play to their abilities. Running a business is chess, not checkers.” “When choosing a job, think about your endgame. What legacy do you want to leave? Don’t choose something just because it’s easy.

Just like in business, it’s important to think about your long term goals and figure out how to work toward them. Don’t let the little things get in your way. “That guy might be flirting with my crush right now, but I’m not worried. He’s playing checkers while I’m playing chess.” “Some people don’t understand why I chose community college over a university, but I’m getting an education and saving money. I’m playing chess, not checkers.” “I suspect my partner might be cheating, but instead of accusing them, I’m going to let them tell on themselves. Chess, not checkers.”"

      "content": "When you’re outsmarting others Many people also use this phrase to indicate that they’re smarter than someone or to make fun of someone for not being as strategic as them. When used this way, it’s a way of saying that you’re a step or two ahead of someone in your current situation. It doesn’t necessarily have to be about important decisions, though it can be. “Look, you’re new around here. You’re still playing checkers while the rest of us are playing chess. You’ll figure things out eventually.” “I always beat my friends at video games because I strategize instead of blindly attacking. They’re playing checkers. I’m playing chess.”"

Whether you’re applying the “chess, not checkers” mindset to your business, relationship, financial, or general life decisions, consider what you’re ultimately working toward.

      "content": "Create an action plan. Once you’ve established your long term goals , think about what short term goals can help you get there. Break your goals down into actionable steps to help you stay organized. Create a timeline to stay on track, and check in on your plan each time you complete a step. Adjust your action plan as necessary to make sure you’re making the right decisions. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Be proactive, not reactive. Having a proactive mindset is extremely important to achieving your goals. Anticipate problems ahead of time and look for opportunities to overcome them—just like in chess, when it’s important to anticipate your opponent’s moves. Don’t wait for things to happen and react to them after the fact; take initiative to make things better. [7] X Research source For example, if you’re saving up to buy a house, expect setbacks along the way. Your car could break down or you may get injured, which would require you to spend some of the money you have saved up. Be proactive by having an emergency fund set aside so you don’t have to react by taking money out of your house fund."

      "content": "Be willing to reevaluate. In chess, it’s important to know how each piece works and moves so you can make the best decisions. If you jump right in without strategizing, it may cost you the game. Similarly, if you keep running into roadblocks while trying to achieve your goals, stop and think about what’s happening. If you keep facing the same problems over and over, it’s likely an issue with your strategy. Stop and reevaluate your plans before continuing. [8] X Research source"
