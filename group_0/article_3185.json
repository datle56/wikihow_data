To “harm none,” avoid doing harm to other people, animals, nature, and yourself. The rule of threes refers to witchcraft and spiritual energy. Whatever you put out into the world, you receive threefold. Some Wiccans memorize the Wiccan Rede. However, many find this unnecessary and choose to internalize the teachings instead."
