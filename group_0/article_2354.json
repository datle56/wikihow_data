      "content": "Wash your hair with a volumizing shampoo . If you're going for extreme body, this is a good first step. Pick a shampoo that is labeled as \"volumizing.\" [1] X Research source Shampoos labeled as \"clarifying\" are also a good choice when it comes to getting more volume. They'll clean away conditioning agents and oils that might be weighing your hair down. Don't use shampoos that are made for dry hair if what you want is volume. These contain conditioners that might make your hair flatter. However, if you have dry or damaged hair, use a moisturizing shampoo."

      "title": "Choose a section of hair to backcomb.",
      "content": "Choose a section of hair to backcomb. Determine what part of your hair needs volume. You can backcomb the top of your head, the crown, or your whole head. Use your fingers to section off the hair, and grasp a small section of hair in your hand. Hold the hair straight upward, and pull it taut so that none of the strands can escape. [4] X Research source A lot of people like to start with the section of hair on top, right above the forehead. Adding a little lift right there can make a dramatic difference."

      "title": "Tease the hair backward.",
      "content": "Tease the hair backward. Place your brush or a fine-tooth comb about halfway between your hair's roots and your hand, and apply firm brush strokes downward toward the scalp. [5] X Research source Start with the backside of each section and work towards the side of it that is closest to your face. Repeat this motion until there is a cushion of hair at the base of the hair section. At this point your hair will look wild. That's totally normal! If you backcombed it correctly, your hair should look like you haven't combed it in days. You can smooth out the top layer to hide the tangles later."

      "content": "Use a brush to smooth out the top layer. Use light pressure and fluid movements to brush out the very top layer of your hair so that it hides the backcombed sections. You need enough pressure to blend the hair together to cover or hide the back combed areas but not enough to flatten out the areas where you just added volume. Your hair should appear smooth and full, and the back combing should not be visible. [6] X Research source"
