      "content": "Know your office's dress code. Most offices will spell out their dress code for you. However, if they don't, take a look around when you interview. You should be able to gauge what's appropriate to wear to the office by what other people are wearing. [1] X Expert Source Lynda Jean Certified Image Consultant Expert Interview. 17 November 2020. For instance, if everyone is wearing a suit and jacket, don't show up for work in jeans. [2] X Research source If you interview for a job, make sure to ask about the dress code if your interviewer does not mention it. This will show that you are committed to sticking with the office's dress code policies."

      "title": "Find your brands.",
      "content": "Find your brands. It will make it easier for you to keep your wardrobe up if you find particular brands that work for you in your price range. Not every brand fits the same, nor does every style fit every person. Invest some time visiting different stores to find what you like up front, and then you won't have to spend as much time when you need to update your clothes later. [3] X Research source If the brands you like best are out of your price range, try shopping for them at second hand stores and discount outlets."

      "content": "Understand modesty is your friend. The office is not the place for short skirts, low-cut blouses, tight pants, or halfway unbuttoned shirts, for men or women. [4] X Expert Source Lynda Jean Certified Image Consultant Expert Interview. 17 November 2020. Keep your clothes more modest, and it is more likely that you will be seen as a professional. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that you only get 1 chance to make a first impression. Also, remember that while modesty is important, your work performance and personality is what will set you apart."

      "title": "Dress up more than you think you need to.",
      "content": "Dress up more than you think you need to. This rule is true especially when you are meeting someone for the first time, being interviewed, or attending a big meeting, such as a press release or a meeting with an important client. If you overdress, you'll still be seen as professional, while if you under dress, you'll be seen as unprofessional. That doesn't mean you need to wear tails or a formal dress to a stockholder's meeting; however, you should try to wear your top professional clothing. [6] X Research source Opt for muted colors when choosing an outfit for work. Black, dark grey, and navy are always good choices. [7] X Expert Source Lynda Jean Certified Image Consultant Expert Interview. 17 November 2020. Keep your makeup simple and subdued as well, such as by wearing minimal makeup and selecting neutral tones, such as nude and light pink lipsticks.

      "title": "Focus on the details.",
      "content": "Focus on the details. It's the details that put you over the top professionally. For instance, you may have a well-made suit, but if it's covered in dog hair, you're not going to look professional. In addition, you may have nice shoes, but if they're heavily scuffed up, it takes away from your appearance. [9] X Research source Take a moment before you leave your house to scan yourself from head to toe for things like pet hair, tears in your clothing or stockings, and scuffed shoes."

      "title": "Don't be afraid to add a little flair.",
      "content": "Don't be afraid to add a little flair. You can add personal touches to your outfit and still be considered professional. Maybe you like a funny tie, or maybe you enjoy a pretty hair clip. As long as it's not too flashy, it's fine. [10] X Research source Steer clear of large earrings, visible tattoos, pungent colognes, and anything else that might offend your interviewers, coworkers, or clients."

      "title": "Show up on time.",
      "content": "Show up on time. Being on time actually means making sure you're there a few minutes early in the morning, ready to work. Also, when you are supposed to attend meetings, always be on time. If you do end up being late at some point, having a reputation for being on time will be helpful. It will be more likely that you will be forgiven for being late."

    {
      "title": "Take appropriate breaks.",
      "content": "Take appropriate breaks. If you're supposed to take an hour lunch break, make sure you're back within the hour. Also, follow your break rules. If you're allowed 4 breaks a day at 10 minutes each, make sure to stick to that."

      "title": "Know your job.",
      "content": "Know your job. You should be trained to do your job when you first arrive. However, if you find yourself a year or two in, and you still don't have all the knowledge you need, ask someone for help. If you want to be discreet, ask someone who works at the same level as you to give you a few pointers. Similarly, if you don't understand a new assignment, ask for clarification from your boss. Your boss usually won't mind because you're just trying to get the job done right."

      "title": "Stay on task.",
      "content": "Stay on task. While you're at work, be at work. Don't be on the phone with non-business calls except for the rare emergency. Avoid social media and other distractions. Focus on the tasks at hand."

      "title": "Keep your personal and professional life separate.",
      "content": "Keep your personal and professional life separate. While it's fine to mention your family once and while, it is best to avoid going into too much detail about your personal life. Avoid discussing family issues with your coworkers. If you have a medical issue that could affect your job performance, talk to someone from your human resources department. Similarly, watch how you present yourself on social media. [11] X Research source If you're friending people from work, you might want to hide certain posts from them, or better yet, don't post them at all. For instance, if you're going out on a drinking binge, don't post about it on social media. [12] X Research source If your coworkers mention wanting to connect with you on social media, direct them to your LinkedIn page. However, remember, that once it's out there, it can be copied and shared by other people, so if you really don't want people to see it, don't post it. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Buy into the culture.",
      "content": "Buy into the culture. Every office has a different culture, including unspoken rules. Some are more relaxed, while others may be more rigid.

      "title": "Keep your office clean.",
      "content": "Keep your office clean. If you have piles of papers and coffee cups everywhere, you'll be viewed as unprofessional. However, you can add a few bits of personal charm; just keep it office appropriate. Pictures of your family are fine; pictures of half-naked men or women should stay at home. [15] X Research source Pictures that are lewd or offensive are inappropriate for your work space. Keep them at home or only in your private, non-work spaces."

      "title": "Speak distinctly and thoughtfully.",
      "content": "Speak distinctly and thoughtfully. The best way to sound professional is to keep the verbal tics out of your speech. One way to do that is to speak more slowly, taking time to think about what you're saying as you say it. [16] X Research source If you aren't sure what verbal tics you use, try taking a recording of yourself when you're talking on the phone. You'll be able to notice it better when you play back than you normally do when you're speaking. [17] X Research source Try to eliminate the \"ums\" and \"likes.\" [18] X Research source"

      "title": "Give other people your respect.",
      "content": "Give other people your respect. Being respectful, instead of catty or sarcastic, is a way of showing other people that you are a true professional. Encourage others to speak up in meetings, and don't belittle what they have to say. Don't respond rudely to people, even if you think the idea sounds silly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Listen well",
      "content": "Listen well . Part of treating others well is listening well. It shows other people that you actually care what he or she has to say, and it fosters true conversation, as you're not just waiting until they finish talking so you can say what you want. Remember that listening is different than hearing. It is important to make sure that you fully understand what the other person says and consider their point of view."

      "title": "Skip the gossip.",
      "content": "Skip the gossip. If you talk about people behind their back, eventually it will get back around to them, which won't make anyone happy. If you stay out of the drama, you'll definitely appear more professional."

      "title": "Acknowledge your mistakes.",
      "content": "Acknowledge your mistakes. If something you worked on goes awry, don't push it off on someone else. Own up to it, and figure out how to do better in the future.

      "title": "Be confident, not combative.",
      "content": "Be confident, not combative. Though you should be confident in your work, you shouldn't try to take others down to make your work look better. For instance, if you finish your work quicker than others, your boss will notice without you crowing about it. [20] X Research source"

      "title": "Use people's names.",
      "content": "Use people's names. People love to hear the sound of their name. If you use peoples' names often, they will feel more respected by you. For example, when you pass a coworker in the hall, don't just say “hello.” Say, “Hello, Craig!” or “Hi, Annie!”"

      "content": "Take on extra assignments. While this step doesn't sound like much fun, it can help you build skills and experience. In addition, your boss will notice that you're willing to take jobs that no one else wants, which can help you when promotion time comes around. For example, if your boss mentions that there is a new project that requires a team leader, volunteer to head it up."
