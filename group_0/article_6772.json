      "content": "Turn off and disconnect your Dremel from the power source. Unplug your Dremel tool from the outlet if you have a model with a cord. Take out the battery if you have a cordless model. [1] X Research source You should always do this first before working on any kind of power tool to make sure that you don’t accidentally turn it on. This will help prevent accidental injuries or damage to the tool."

      "content": "Press down and hold the button on the side of the Dremel near the chuck nut. The chuck nut is the outer metal part at the tip of the Dremel that holds the bit. Look for a small button on the side of the Dremel near the chuck nut and hold it down. [2] X Research source This button is a security lock that will allow you to loosen the chuck nut so you can replace the bit. It keeps the bit from just twisting freely.

      "content": "Use a wrench to turn the chuck nut counterclockwise to loosen it. Dremel tools come with a small wrench that fits the chuck nut perfectly, so it's best to use this. [4] X Expert Source Jacob Pischer Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 4 September 2020. However, you can use any other wrench that fits if you have lost the wrench that came with your Dremel. [5] X Research source You can just loosen the chuck nut with the wrench and use your fingers to unscrew it until you can pull the bit out."

      "title": "Remove the bit or head from the collet.",
      "content": "Remove the bit or head from the collet. The collet is the small metal part inside the chuck nut that actually holds the bit. Slide out whatever bit or head is attached to the Dremel currently and set it aside somewhere where you won’t lose it. [6] X Research source You can use all kinds of different bits with a Dremel tool for cutting, grinding, sanding, polishing, and other functions."

      "title": "Place the new bit you want to use in the collet.",
      "content": "Place the new bit you want to use in the collet. Loosen or tighten the chuck nut with your fingers to adjust the collet to the size of the new bit you want to put in. Slide in the new bit or head. [7] X Research source Collets come in different sizes; not all collets can hold all sizes of bits. If the bit you want to use is too big or small for the collet in your Dremel tool, then you will need to replace the collet."

Your Dremel tool is now ready to use with the new bit. [8] X Research source Changing a Dremel bit is similar to changing any other drill bit . The way you release the chuck nut and loosen the collet may vary from tool to tool, but the general concept is the same."

Simply grab it between your fingers and slide it out, then set it aside.
