      "title": "Curling up is the natural way for cats to preserve their body heat.",
      "content": "Curling up is the natural way for cats to preserve their body heat. The curled-up sleep position is the cat equivalent of people sleeping on their backs—it’s sort of the default based on how your body is designed. Cats have extremely flexible spines, so they wrap themselves up in their own fur to help stay insulated and warm while they nap. [1] X Research source Cats also curl up in a ball because it helps protect all of the sensitive skin and internal organs in their tummy. Fun fact! Cats learn to curl up in a ball as kittens before their full coats come in because they don’t have enough fur to stay as warm as they’d like to. This is also why kittens tend to love lying on laptops, batteries, vents, and sunlit windows—it’s all about staying warm! [2] X Research source"

      "title": "If they’re exposing your tummy, your cat feels extremely safe around you.",
      "content": "If they’re exposing your tummy, your cat feels extremely safe around you. Your cat’s stomach is the most sensitive and vulnerable area, so if your kitty is sleeping in front of you with their delicate parts exposed, it’s a huge sign that they feel safe with you—according to feline behavior specialist Molly DeVoss, “a cat’s body language tells us a lot about what they are feeling.” Cats will usually only do this if they feel 100% safe and secure. [3] X Research source As tempting as it may be to give that exposed belly a quick rub, you’re likely to spook your cat if you wake them up by touching their tummy. Just beware if you’ve got a cat who likes to scratch!"

      "title": "Cats typically deep-sleep on their side.",
      "content": "Cats typically deep-sleep on their side. Side sleeping is a sort of “in-between” position for cats. It’s not curled up in a ball to protect their tummies, but it’s also not fully stretched out on their backs to leave their tummies exposed. So, a cat on their side feels safe around you, but they’re also sleeping in a position where they can hop up and run at a moment’s notice if something scary happens. This is why cats will usually end up unraveling or rolling up into a side sleeping position when they’re in a deep sleep—it’s a natural “medium” position for them. [4] X Research source You can tell if your cat is in their deep sleep cycle if their eyes flutter when they’re closed or if they twitch periodically while they sleep. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Your kitty is trying to keep their paws and legs warm by “loafing.”",
      "content": "Your kitty is trying to keep their paws and legs warm by “loafing.” A cat’s limbs don’t have the fur or fat that the rest of their body does, so tucking their legs and paws under their body helps keep them toasty. At the same time, the loaf position allows your cat to protect their tummy. They may still be feeling safe and secure, but it’s a more defensive position. [6] X Research source The loaf position also allows your cat to spring into action at any moment if they need to run or fight, especially if they’re in a half-loaf, half-crouch position. As DeVoss explains, “a crouched position can indicate that a cat is unsure of its surroundings.” While they are protecting their stomachs, the loaf position is not a sign your cat is upset or nervous. This is more of a “better safe than sorry” situation, not an “oh boy, I better be ready to fight” thing. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Cats in the Superman pose are either cooling off or relaxing. The Superman pose—where your cat sticks their limbs out away from them—is usually just a sign of extreme relaxation. Like…Matthew McConaughey drinking Pinot Noir with Tom Hanks in front of a fireplace levels of chill. However, if it’s especially hot wherever you are, this could just be your kitty’s way of trying to cool off. [8] X Research source Are they in a sunny window or on a warm surface? Some cats like to do the Superman when they’re trying to stay warm if the environment is hotter than their tummy."

      "title": "Sleeping while sitting up can mean a number of things for kitties.",
      "content": "Sleeping while sitting up can mean a number of things for kitties. There are four distinct reasons your cat might sleep while sitting up—in fact, it’s probably a combination of all four reasons. Here are the potential motivations: [9] X Research source Your cat fell asleep while grooming itself. Cats often sit upright when they’re licking their stomachs or legs to groom themselves. [10] X Research source But grooming can be really hard work! Sometimes you’ve got to nap mid-grooming session to recharge. Your cat is showing you that they trust you. Your cat’s tummy is their most vulnerable area, so showing you their stomach and falling asleep is a huge sign they’re comfortable with you. Your cat is copying you. Cats often copy the behavior of the people they bond with, so if you’re being a bit of a couch potato your cat may simply be trying to fit in. Adorable, right? [11] X Research source Your cat is trying to cool off. Cats will sometimes prop themselves up when they’re hot to try and cool off."

      "content": "Essentially, your cat is using its paws to block out light and sleep better. If you’ve ever laid down for a nap and forgot to close the blinds, you may have decided to just cover your eyes with your forearm. This is what your cat is doing when they fall asleep with their paws over their eyes. Sleeping is hard work for a cat so don’t break their concentration! [12] X Research source A lot of cats also do this as a way of saying, “Don’t mess with me while I’m sleeping—this is an essential nap.”"

      "content": "A cat lying out on a furniture arm is a totally relaxing vibe. A lot of cats like to be up high to observe their surroundings. If your cat has fallen asleep on their favorite perching spot, it just means that they’re so comfortable they don’t feel the need to be alert. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "A tucked-in cat is just staying warm!",
      "content": "A tucked-in cat is just staying warm! This is one of the more straightforward sleeping positions—your cat likes to snuggle under the covers for the same reason people do. It’s warm and cozy! There’s also a small possibility that your cat is copying you when they do this, but it’s more likely that it’s just a good sleeping environment for them. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Cats sometimes sleep in weird positions when they’re in deep sleep.",
      "content": "Cats sometimes sleep in weird positions when they’re in deep sleep. If your cat looks like an acrobatic contortionist when they sleep sometimes, it doesn’t usually mean anything unique. Cats are just super flexible and they move around a bit when they’re deep in sleep. [15] X Research source What if my cat looks uncomfy? Your cat would not be sleeping in a position where they’re intentionally uncomfortable, so if your kitty is splayed out in a weird posture that looks painful to you, it’s not. Just let them be."

      "title": "A cat who sleeps at your feet is trying to keep you warm and protect you.",
      "content": "A cat who sleeps at your feet is trying to keep you warm and protect you. A person’s feet often get a little cold at night, so if you sleep barefoot your cat may be trying to help you out by donating some of their body heat. On top of that, the foot of the bed is a perfect vantage point if you want to keep an eye out for danger at night. Basically, what we’re trying to say is that your cat thinks they’re a rottweiler on guard duty while you snooze. [16] X Research source Other potential meanings: It’s also possible that your feet smell good to your cat for some reason. People get stinky feet, but cats like stinky sometimes.

      "content": "Sleeping between your legs is your cat choosing to cuddle with you. Your legs are basically just heat-generating cushions for a cat, and when you’re lying down your legs naturally create a canyon that’s perfectly cat-shaped for maximum snoozing. As a result, your legs are a natural place for a cat trying to cuddle with their best friend and catch some Zs. [18] X Research source"

If a cat were to sleep with you the same way that they slept with their littermates when they were a kitten, they’d probably choose the top of your head. Your hair is the closest thing to the texture of cat fur if you think about it. In other words, your cat is treating you like their best friend. [19] X Research source Does your cat ever chew on your hair or mess with it when they’re sleeping on your head? This is a soothing behavior for a lot of cats. They may also just want to play!

      "content": "Sleeping in a cat bed? You’ve raised a cat with some healthy boundaries! If your cat likes their cat bed and they spend a ton of time sleeping in it, it’s a healthy sign that your cat understands “their space” vs. “your space.” Your cat would likely prefer sleeping with you or snoozing on top of your laptop keyboard, so the fact that they stick with their bed is a good sign of restraint. You’ve raised a very respectful kitty! [21] X Research source Should I get my cat a cat bed? If you feel like your cat struggles with boundaries or can’t handle your routine in a healthy way, a cat bed is a great idea. It’s 100% not mandatory though, your cat won’t be worse off without a bed."

They sit in it and the sides of the box protect their flanks while the base protects their stomach. They also get to keep an eye out from the top of the box! [22] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source This is also why cats tend to force themselves into containers that barely fit their bodies.

It’s entertaining, it maintains their senses, it’s stimulating, and it scratches their itch to look for prey. So, why would a cat sleep in the windowsill when they can’t look out? They’re looking out for you! Your kitty wants to be the first one to know if anything dangerous or worrying happens outside so they can protect you. [23] X Research source"

Anyone who has ever had a cat snuggle up to them and lie on their chest knows how special the moment can be. We have good news—your cat is just as much in love with you as you are in love with them. The chest nap is about as close as a cat can get to saying, “You’re the most important person in my life and I love you so much.” [24] X Research source"

This is the cat equivalent of a person sleeping in a bunk bed with pajamas on and a nightlight—it’s a nostalgic thing from your cat’s past. Kittens pile up and sleep together when they’re young to stay warm and feel secure. This kind of behavior carries over into adulthood for a lot of cats. They feel safe among their friends and they’re trying to stay warm and cozy. [25] X Research source"

In reality, cats and dogs can get along just fine. If your cat likes to snooze next to your dog, it’s just a sign that they’re good friends who get along swimmingly. [26] X Research source Sleeping is basically a dog’s favorite thing to do. Coincidentally, it’s also a cat’s favorite thing to do. The fact that they’re choosing to do their favorite things together is basically the biggest sign you could ask for that your pets are best buds."

If your cat sleeps with their eyes open (even partially open), they’re resting while keeping an eye out for any intruders or predators. Cats don’t need to go into a deep sleep to rest, and the eye-open cat nap is a kind of middle-ground between sleeping and staying alert. [27] X Research source"

      "content": "A cat that hides to sleep is adjusting to a new space or needs medical help. Cats hide for two reasons—they’re scared, or they’re in pain. If you’ve just moved, you got a new pet, friends are visiting, or something else has changed in your cat’s environment, they’re probably just anxious. [28] X Research source If nothing is new in your cat’s routine though, it indicates something may be wrong medically. See a vet to get your cat checked out. [29] X Research source Is my cat hiding if they sleep with their head against a wall? No, but this is still cause for concern. If your cat sticks their head against the wall, a pillow, or some other surface, it indicates they may have a serious neurological or viral condition. See a vet ASAP. [30] X Research source"

Cats don’t naturally want to spend time where they go to the bathroom, so it’s a big red flag if your cat is sleeping in or next to their litter box. It’s likely that your cat has a UTI, constipation, trouble holding urine, or a bladder blockage. These are medical emergencies, so see your veterinarian as soon as possible. [31] X Research source"
