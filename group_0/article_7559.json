      "title": "List the full name of the CDC and the publication date first.",
      "content": "List the full name of the CDC and the publication date first. The very first item in your reference list citation should be the full name of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, followed by a period. Then, include the year of publication in parentheses, also followed by a period. For example: [1] X Research source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2017). If you're citing more than one document from the CDC published in the same year, distinguish them by putting a letter after the year. For instance, you might write \"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2017a).\" and \"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2017b).\" Use \"a\" for whichever source comes first alphabetically by title. For each citation, make the first line left-justified and indent each subsequent line 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) afterward. This is called a hanging indentation ."

Finally, include the URL of the page with no period after it. [2] X Research source For example: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2017). Family health and diabetes .

For the first in-text citation, reference the CDC by its full name (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), followed by its abbreviation. Include \"CDC\" in parentheses if you're introducing it as a source before the quotation or in brackets if you're referencing it after the quotation. We explain the 2 different ways to write it below. [5] X Research source With introductory text : According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)... Without introductory text : Certain studies have shown that \"Over 30 million people have diabetes\" (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC])."

      "title": "Write the year of publication for the quoted material in parentheses.",
      "content": "Write the year of publication for the quoted material in parentheses. Always include the year of publication for the source you're citing in-text. APA format is often used by scientists and other researchers who value using the most recent, up-to-date research, so including the publication date is vital. For example: [6] X Research source According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \"Over 30 million people have diabetes\" (2017). Include the publication year in an in-text citation even after paraphrased material, not just direct quotes. Differentiate CDC articles or documents published in the same year by adding a letter after the year. For example, your in-text citations could read \"(CDC, 2017a)\" and \"(CDC, 2017b).\""

In the absence of a page number (in the case of web articles, for instance), write \"para.\" and list the paragraph number afterward (para. 3). If you didn't introduce the CDC in the introductory text, write the date and page or paragraph number in the same parentheses as the source (separated by commas). For example: [7] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source With introductory text : According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \"Over 30 million people have diabetes\" (2017, para. 3).

Every time after that, use the shortened “CDC” to refer to the organization. In this case, you only need to include the date of publication in the parenthetical citation and the page or paragraph number where you found the quote.
