      "title": "Choose the best location.",
      "content": "Choose the best location. A good fort will be built in a place where it fits perfectly. Look for trees with branches that are low to the ground, bushes that are hollowed out in the middle or that form a ring, or logs that can make the base for your fort . Try not to put your fort in the middle of a field or a grassy area, because this will make it difficult to build and won’t give much cover. Lean your fort up against a tree, if you can. Forts built in the woods are the easiest to make. Big rocks can be great places to put a fort, if you can find them."

      "content": "Find some supplies from outside. The best outdoor forts are built using things from the outdoors! Spend a bit of time searching your yard or the woods for supplies to use in building your fort. You might use things like: Old branches Large sticks Tree boughs (with leaves) Dead bushes"

      "title": "Choose some supplies from your house.",
      "content": "Choose some supplies from your house. If you can’t find many good fort-building supplies outdoors, you might want to add some things from your house to make it better. Remember to only use things from your house with permission from your parents. Gather up all the supplies you could use to build your fort. [1] X Research source These might include: Blankets Thick string (for holding up the blankets) and clothespins. Umbrellas Cardboard boxes Chairs [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Make the walls of your fort.",
      "content": "Make the walls of your fort. Use some big sticks (or chairs, if you don’t have sticks) and put them in the ground to set up a wall around your fort. You can use 4 sticks for the corners, or you can use lots of sticks put close together to make a wall. If you don’t have many stick, you can put blankets or big leaves between your corners to make your walls. If you have thick string, you can wrap it between the corners and put blankets or towels over the top to make walls. Try to make your walls between a few big trees or bushes to make it easier to build."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give your fort a roof.",
      "content": "Give your fort a roof. You don’t have to, but it may be good to add a roof to your fort. To do this, drape big branches with leaves over the top, and balance them on your walls. You could also throw a big blanket or tarp over the top of your roof. [3] X Research source If you have lots, a fun idea is to use many umbrellas as a roof over the top of your fort. Old dry branches that have fallen off trees that still have leaves are perfect for making a roof. If you build your fort under a tree with low branches, you might not need to add a roof."

      "content": "Decorate your fort. The next best thing to building your fort is making it feel like your own. Bring in decorations to make the inside feel more comfortable, or add some to the outside. Old logs can act as chairs or tables, and fresh flowers always work well for decoration. Use big leaves as bowls and cups, and look for other parts of nature to add to your fort. [4] X Research source If you want, you can bring things from your house to decorate the inside of your fort. Always be sure to ask permission for this, though. You might want to make a sign for your fort, with a name."

Although your fort probably won't end up like the one in 'Out of the Box!', you can make it feel like a real house with enough work. Combine several big boxes and cut out holes between them to make 'rooms'. You can even add windows and furniture inside your box fort if you want."

      "content": "Build an underground fort . This type of fort might be the hardest to make, but it will last a long time, and is really cool when finished. Building an underground fort involves digging a series of 'rooms' in the ground, and possibly even connecting them with tunnels. If you have lots of land and time to work, you should definitely try making an underground fort. But be careful!! Underground forts can collapse, so make sure you have a parent supervisor, and always make sure the soil is stable. Always build at least two exits in case of a collapse. Never build underground forts in sand. (DISCLAIMER: underground forts are crazy dangerous. More than a few people have died trying to make these. There's a lot more to building underground than digging sideways. Do a lot of research, be prepared to drop some cash, and make peace with your maker. You are seriously risking your life by building one of these.)"
