Assuming a fixed interest rate and evenly spaced payments, the annual payment amount for an annuity (anything that must be paid in yearly increments) can be determined using the following formula: A n n u a l P a y m e n t = ( r ( P ) ) ( 1 − ( 1 + r ) − n ) {\\displaystyle AnnualPayment={\\frac {(r(P))}{(1-(1+r)^{-n})}}} [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Understand the variables in the equation. The first step of finding annual payments on a loan is to understand what each of the letters means. Fortunately, each letter simply represents one of the elements of a loan. This information can be easily found on your loan agreement.If you don't have a copy of your loan agreement, contact your lender. r represents the interest rate per period. Because this represents an annual interest rate in this case, this number may be referred to as an APR (annual percentage rate). P represents the principal, or the amount borrowed. This can also be referred to as the present value. N represents the number of periods in the loan. In this case, periods equals years, and would just be the number of years on your loan agreement."

An amortization table allows you to see each payment you will make for the remainder of your loan, broken down into how much is principal, how much is interest, and what the remaining balance on the loan is. This allows you to see exactly what your monthly (or annual) payment is, and less and less of the payment goes to interest over time as the amount owed decreases. [2] X Research source Simply input the amount, interest rate, and term into the calculator, and the amortization table will show every monthly payment from the current point to the end of the loan."

      "content": "Understand the reason to calculate periodic payments on a loan. Often, lenders require that you make monthly or quarterly payments. Therefore, it is more useful to know what the monthly or quarterly payment is, rather than simply the annual payment. Fortunately, the same formula is used, with some minor revisions. For the sake of this example, assume the new loan is the same as previously-discussed one, with the only change being you are now required to make monthly payments for the two year period."

      "content": "Learn the formula for calculating periodic payments on a loan. Although the formula is largely the same as that for annual payments, a few minor changes occur to reflect the fact that there are now more payments. Again, the standard formula is: P a y m e n t = ( r ( P ) ) ( 1 − ( 1 + r ) − n ) {\\displaystyle Payment={\\frac {(r(P))}{(1-(1+r)^{-n})}}} First, the amount of periods in the loan, or \"n\", would change. Instead of being 2 (representing two years before, or two annual payments), it is now 24 for monthly payments (representing 1 payment a month for 2 years) and 8 for quarterly payments (representing one payment each quarter for the two years). Second, the annual interest rate would need to change to reflect the fact there are more payments. To determine an interest rate for periodic payments, divide the annual interest rate by the number of payments required within a year. For example, a 9% annual interest rate is equivalent to a .0075 or .75% monthly interest rate (.09/12). [3] X Research source"
