      "title": "Get an Ethernet cable.",
      "content": "Get an Ethernet cable. You will need to have an Ethernet cable to connect your Xbox One to your Internet source. Consider the length of your cable and the distance of your console from your Internet source: you don't want to get one that is too short! Your Xbox may come with a cable included, but otherwise, you will need to purchase one. Currently, Xbox Ones do not ship with a cable."

      "content": "Connect the Ethernet cable to your LAN port. At the back of the Xbox One, at the lower right corner beside the infrared output, you will find your console’s LAN port. This is where you’re going to connect your Ethernet cable."

      "content": "Connect the Ethernet cable to your Internet source. The other end of the Ethernet cable goes directly to your internet source. Remember, your Internet source could be your router or your modem itself. It may also be an Ethernet wall jack."

      "title": "Turn your console on.",
      "content": "Turn your console on. After setting up your wired connection, you can now turn on your Xbox One. The initial boot should already give you access to the Internet. You can turn on your console by pressing the Home button on your Xbox One controller. Xbox One added a voice recognition feature that wakes your console by just saying “Xbox On”. The Xbox One Kinect can also identify you through biometric scanning by which it automatically logs in a user via face recognition."

      "title": "Access Wi-Fi.",
      "content": "Access Wi-Fi. Just like the Xbox 360 Slim, Xbox One can easily access the Internet wirelessly in an instant! It has a built in Wi-Fi 802.11n Wi-Fi Direct that allows it to connect to your router automatically."

    {
      "title": "Turn your console on.",
      "content": "Turn your console on. The first time you turn on your console, it will not yet automatically connect to the Internet since it hasn’t memorized your router’s access name and codes yet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose your signal.",
      "content": "Choose your signal. In the Network menu, Xbox One will display all the Wi-Fi hotspots within its signal’s reach. Once the Xbox One detects your router in the Network, select it and you will be able to access the Internet. You may have to enter your router’s password first, depending on your router’s security settings. Xbox One will now remember this wireless setup and use it automatically on your following sessions. If you have an Ethernet cable connected to your console, it will automatically go into “wired” Internet connection mode. If you want to stay connected wirelessly just disconnect the Ethernet cable from your unit. You may need to adjust your console’s wireless configuration setting if your console fails to connect to the Internet. When in doubt, set everything to automatic or simply reset to default."
