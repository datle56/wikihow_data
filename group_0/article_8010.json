      "title": "Use a potato and dish soap on light rust.",
      "content": "Use a potato and dish soap on light rust. Cut a potato in half with a knife. Drizzle dish soap onto the cut end of the potato. Rub away rust by firmly scouring rusted areas with the soapy potato. This method can be messy; work over a sink or outside for easier cleanup. The potato-soap approach to rust removal is most effective on small, light rust stains that are easily accessible. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Use lemon and salt to remove light rust.",
      "content": "Use lemon and salt to remove light rust. Scrub away loose rust flakes with a wire bristle brush. Cut a lemon or lime in half with a knife. Sprinkle a generous amount of salt onto rusty areas. Squeeze the juice from your cut lemon or lime over the salt. Wait 30 minutes to an hour, then scrub at the rust with the rind of the lemon or lime. Rinse the metal with water and then dry it with a towel. It may take several applications of salt and lemon/lime juice before the rust is removed. Repeat this process as necessary. This method is suitable for light rust stains, especially those on kitchen knives. Use caution when cleaning knives to prevent accidental cuts. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Get rid of mild rust with baking soda.",
      "content": "Get rid of mild rust with baking soda. Rinse the rusted metal with water and shake it dry over your sink or outside. Sprinkle baking soda onto areas with rust. The soda will stick to the still damp metal. Leave the soda for about an hour, then scour rust away with steel wool, a scouring pad, or a metal bristle brush. Rinse the item with water and dry it with a towel. This technique is most useful for light rust, rust rings, rusty baking pans, and other kinds of thin metal that have developed rust. While scrubbing, use firm, steady pressure. It may take some time before the rust comes free. If rust remains after rinsing, repeat this process until the rust is completely removed.

      "title": "Erase heavy rust with a white vinegar bath.",
      "content": "Erase heavy rust with a white vinegar bath. Fill a bucket with enough vinegar to completely submerge the rusty metal. Remove loose flakes of rust by brushing afflicted areas with a wire bristle brush or steel wool. Soak the item in vinegar overnight, then rinse the item in water and dry it with a towel. Larger rusty items may not fit in a bucket. In these situations, saturate rags in white vinegar and wrap these around rusty areas. Leave the rags on overnight, then brush, rinse, and dry the item as per usual. This rust removal technique works well for severe rust, especially on steel tools. Vinegar will not harm the surface or integrity of steel. The longer you leave items in vinegar, the more effective it will be. Soak heavily rusted items for longer periods of time. Repeat this process as necessary to remove stubborn rust. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove rust with an application of citric acid.",
      "content": "Remove rust with an application of citric acid. Follow the directions on the citric acid to mix it with hot water to form a cleaning solution. Immerse your rusted steel item in the solution for 8 to 10 hours or overnight. Avoid soaking items for more than 24 hours. After soaking, use a stiff or wire bristle brush to remove any leftover flakes. Rinse the item in water and dry it with a towel. Citric acid can be purchased at most grocery and health stores. You can usually find it in the canning section. In some cases, citric acid may go by the name “sour salt.” Most citric acid products are prepared by adding 2 or 3 tbsp (30 to 44 ml) of acid to a moderate amount of hot water in a bucket. Citric acid will remove paint from items. It is safe for use on steel, and works well for removing heavy rust."

Wear protective goggles and rubber gloves when using converter. Only apply converter in areas with good airflow to prevent the buildup of harmful fumes.

Dip a paintbrush in the converter and paint rusty surfaces. Larger surfaces can be covered more quickly by applying converter with a roller. Some converters may have a spray applicator. If your steel is galvanized, most rust converters will only be suitable for severely rusted areas. Converter will not adhere to galvanized surfaces."

      "content": "Wait until the converter dries and add a second coat, if necessary. Most kinds of rust converters will dry in about 20 minutes. For the converter to fully cure, it generally takes about 24 hours. Apply a second coat of converter after it has fully dried, especially for heavy rusting. A second coat will convert any missed rust. [6] X Research source After the converter has dried, you don't need to rinse or do anything more to the rust. The converter will stick to it, neutralizing it and preventing it from spreading."

[9] X Research source When the rust is removed, finish sanding with an extra fine grit paper, like a 400-grit wet/dry polishing sandpaper. [10] X Research source Steel wool can also be used similarly to sandpaper to remove rust. Start with a coarse wool, like one with a rating of 3. Finish with an extra fine wool, like one rated 000 or 0000. [11] X Research source Steel that has a finish may be damaged by sanding. After removing the rust, you may need to re-seal or paint the metal to prevent future corrosion."

When sanding in this fashion, keep your sander in motion to prevent gouging or uneven sanding in the metal. Narrow or difficult to reach areas can be targeted with a mouse sander or oscillating tool.
