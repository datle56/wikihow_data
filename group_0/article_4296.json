      "title": "Rinse the tails in cool water.",
      "content": "Rinse the tails in cool water. Hold them under the tap with your hands or tongs, trying to rinse every surface of the tail. When you have cleaned the tail, you can dry it with a paper towel or let it air dry before you trim it. [1] X Research source This prevents any unclean substances that may have been on the lobster tails from contaminating your food. Lobsters live at the bottom of the sea, and can have quite a bit of debris on them. If you didn't have time to thaw the tails in the fridge overnight before cooking them, thaw them in cold water for at least 30 minutes before you start the cooking process. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use shears or a knife to cut the lobster tail lengthwise along the middle.",
      "content": "Use shears or a knife to cut the lobster tail lengthwise along the middle. [3] X Research source You should cut the lobster all the way back to the very tip of the fin. Try to avoid cutting into the meat, so that it does not break apart during the boiling. Instead, keep the shears well above the meat by pulling up on the shell as you cut. Kitchen shears are a safer choice than a knife, since the knife has to face upwards to cut the shell."

      "title": "Use your thumps to pull apart the tail along the incision.",
      "content": "Use your thumps to pull apart the tail along the incision. The incision you made allows you to easily break apart the shell all the way along the middle. Keep the meat inside the shell for boiling and serving."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place a large pot filled with water on the stove.",
      "content": "Place a large pot filled with water on the stove. Fill the pot 2/3 full with water to help prevent boiling over. The size of the pot you need depends upon the number of tails you plan to boil. For 8 ounces (230 g) tails, a good rule of thumb is to use 1.5 cups (350 mL) of water per tail. You can also boil lobster tails in batches, instead of all at once. You may salt the water with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) to 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of salt to raise the boiling point of the water and help it reach a gentler boil."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring the water to a rolling boil.",
      "content": "Bring the water to a rolling boil. Set the heat to high in order to reach a fast-paced boil. While you will later turn down the heat, as you begin to place the lobsters in the pot, the bubbles should be rapidly reaching the surface."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the lobster tails in the water.",
      "content": "Place the lobster tails in the water. Use kitchen tongs to gently submerge the tails, being sure that each of them is fully submerged below the surface. Check that the tails have room between one another. [4] X Research source Be careful not to splash the boiling water on yourself or anyone near you. Adding the tails one at a time can help keep the water in the pot."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn the burner down to medium or medium high.",
      "content": "Turn the burner down to medium or medium high. While the tails are cooking, maintain a boil just above simmer, rather than a rolling boil. This helps the tails cook all the way through before separating from the shell."

    {
      "title": "Boil the lobster for 1 minute per 1 ounce (28 g).",
      "content": "Boil the lobster for 1 minute per 1 ounce (28 g). Most lobster tails require between 5 and 12 minutes to cook all the way through. Depending on the heat level and how full the pot is, it may begin to boil over. Turn down the heat if this happens."

    {
      "title": "Poke the lobster meat with a fork.",
      "content": "Poke the lobster meat with a fork. The lobster tails are ready when the meat is white and has a tender texture. The shells should have a bright red hue to them, and appear nearly separate from the meat. If the lobster is not ready, do not remove from the water. It is important to cook the lobster all the way through."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set the lobster tails in a colander or strainer.",
      "content": "Set the lobster tails in a colander or strainer. You can use a number of kitchen tools to pull the tails out of the water, including a slotted spoon or tongs. Anything that can gently remove the tails without separating the meat from the shell works. You can drain the tails in a colander if you wish."

    {
      "title": "Slice the meat lengthwise all the way through for ease, if desired.",
      "content": "Slice the meat lengthwise all the way through for ease, if desired. Lobster meat is easier to eat if it has been pre-sliced down the middle. If you made an incision earlier, it will most likely be enough for the average diner, but cutting all the way through makes using a fork much easier. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Butter the lobster tails.",
      "content": "Butter the lobster tails. One classic choice for enhancing the flavor of lobster is to serve it with melted butter, either on the side or already melted on the tail. Use a basting brush or a fork to spread around enough butter to lightly coat the top of each tail. One option is to make clarified butter, which is melted butter strained through cheesecloth or scraped for excess fats. It is a very common dipping sauce for seafood like lobster."

      "title": "Squeeze lemon over the tail.",
      "content": "Squeeze lemon over the tail. Lemon juice adds a pleasant acidic taste to the creamy lobster meat. If you plant to serve your tails with lemon, you can choose to squeeze the juice over them yourself, or cut up lemon slices for your guests to use themselves."

      "title": "Choose herbs for the dish.",
      "content": "Choose herbs for the dish. Parsley and basil are classic choices for serving with lobster. Garnish the meat and the plate with herbs if you plan to use them. Combining butter, lemon, and herbs creates a tried-and-true, delicious flavor combination"

      "title": "Cut up the meat for use in another recipe.",
      "content": "Cut up the meat for use in another recipe. Now that the lobster has been cooked in a simple fashion, the meat can be used in nearly any recipe calling for lobster meat. If you plan to use the meat in another recipe, do so immediately, as the cooked lobster tails won't keep as well as frozen ones. [6] X Research source"
