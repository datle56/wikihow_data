      "content": "Pick the tools that you want to color with. While coloring is traditionally done with crayon, use any tools that you feel comfortable with. You can try using fine-tip permanent markers, gel pencils, crayons, and different types of pencils such as watercolor. Regardless of the type of tool that you choose, look for a set that has a wide variety of different colors so that you can experiment with different techniques such as shading. [1] X Research source If you are using colored pencils, sharpen them well before you begin. If you are using permanent markers, consider testing if they will bleed through the page first. Pick an inconspicuous area to test in and place an extra piece of paper underneath to protect the other pages if necessary. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Use light layers and gradually build up the layers to darken the color. Especially when using colored pencils, it’s very important to gradually darken the color using multiple layers. Begin with gentle pressure to create light layers and with each additional layer press down slightly more until the color reaches the desired tone. [3] X Research source Making sure that you don’t press too hard with the colored pencils will also prevent them from breaking. If you want to make sure that you get the colors right, get a scrap piece of paper and try drawing swatches with the same colored pencil using different amounts of pressure. You can use the swatches as a reference point to decide how much pressure you want to use while coloring."

      "content": "Experiment with different techniques to become more creative as you color. Try shading by using a combination of light and dark tones to show where the aspects of your drawings that are highlighted. You can also try cross hatching by adding intersecting lines to create dimension. Alternatively, an easy technique to try is crayon rubbings. Simply remove the paper from the crayon, lay it on its side, and rub it gently over the paper. This creates a gentle shade over the paper. You can also try putting paper or cardboard shapes beneath the coloring page and using the crayon rubbings method to create new shapes on your picture. [4] X Research source"
