      "content": "Measure the length of your flat louvers. The length of the louvers should be 1/16th inch narrower than the opening between the two vertical stiles. The nylon louver pins that support the louvers inside the frame have a washer that is molded into the pin and is 1/32 inch in thickness. These washers prevent the lovers from contacting the inside edges of the stile resulting in smooth action. How many louvers you use depends on the size of the louvers and panel height."
