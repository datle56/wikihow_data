      "content": "“Sorry for the inconvenience” can feel insincere and impersonal. People say \"I apologize for the inconvenience\" as a way to address workplace mistakes or problems, both with fellow coworkers and customers. But this phrase is the go-to apology for most professionals, so it can sometimes come across as generic and ingenuine. Your recipient might feel like you’re shrugging off the blame and dismissing their issue instead of hearing them out.

While someone else’s actions might’ve also led to the issue, just focus on what you did—or didn’t—do. [10] X Research source For example, you might email your coworker, “I want to apologize for missing the conference submission deadline yesterday. I take full responsibility for forgetting to upload our documents on time and have let our supervisors know that this was on me, not you.”"

Describe how you’ll learn from the mistake and ensure you won’t make it in the future."
