      "content": "Collect firewood in the days before Lohri. As Lohri approaches, it’s customary to search for dry twigs, branches, and logs, which will provide fuel for the fire. If you’re far from a forest, you could always purchase firewood. [4] X Research source The bonfire is the main aspect of a Lohri celebration, so make sure you have plenty of firewood on hand. The bigger the bonfire, the better the celebration!"

      "title": "Dig out a wide, circular area of dirt or sand.",
      "content": "Dig out a wide, circular area of dirt or sand. Choose a site that’s far away from homes and other structures, trees, shrubs, and any flammable objects. Remove grass and other combustible materials from a circular patch at least 10 feet (3.0 m) in diameter. If necessary, spread dirt or sand over the circle, then place bricks or stones around its perimeter. [5] X Research source To remove grass, water the area 1 to 2 days in advance. You don't want to work in mud, but it'll be easier to dig out moist grass and soil. Use a spade or shovel to dig away vegetation and, if necessary, loosen stubborn clumps with a spading fork, hoe, or steel rake. Make sure there are no telephone wires or tree limbs above the bonfire site. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a tent with dry, thin twigs around your tinder. Your tinder pile could be dried bark, pieces of paper, or a commercial fire starter. Stand 3 to 4 small, thin twigs around the tinder pile in a triangular tent shape. Make another tent around the first with 3 to 4 slightly larger sticks, then add 1 to 2 more layers until the structure is around 1 foot (30 cm) tall. [7] X Research source Use small twigs or pieces of wood to anchor the standing sticks. Stack your sticks loosely so air can fuel the fire. Feel the direction that the wind is blowing, and mark an arrow in the sand or dirt that points in the direction the wind blows. Leave an open space in your tent to allow air to blow into the fire."

      "title": "Stack your logs into a pyramid shape.",
      "content": "Stack your logs into a pyramid shape. After making the tent around the tinder pile, place 2 logs on either side parallel to the wind’s direction. Then stack another set of logs on the first pair perpendicular to the wind’s direction. Continue stacking layers of logs until you’ve build a pile that looks like a stepped-up pyramid. [8] X Research source The pyramid’s height will depend on your amount of wood. As a rule of thumb, the distance between the bonfire and homes or structures should be at least 5 times the pile’s height. [9] X Research source"

At dusk, use a long match or lighter to ignite the tinder at the center of the log pile. Eat dinner, have snacks, sing, and dance with your loved ones as the spark grows into a roaring bonfire. [10] X Research source Be sure to keep an eye on your kids and pets around the fire. Have buckets of water or a fire extinguisher handy just in case. [11] X Research source"

[12] X Research source Add the onions, chilies, and 10 garlic cloves to the melted ghee. When the onions are golden, add the veggie mixture, turmeric, and salt to taste.

When the ingredients are combined, add 1 to 2 tablespoons (14.8 to 29.6 ml) of hot water, and knead the mixture to create a soft dough. Divide the dough into equally sized balls a little larger than a golf ball. [13] X Research source Dust the balls lightly with flour, then roll them out to flatten them. Put a wide pan on the stove over medium heat, then cook the flattened dough in batches. It should take only take about 3 to 5 minutes per side for the roti to become golden. The ghee in the dough will grease the pan, so there’s no need to cook the roti with additional oil or ghee. When they’re done, brush the roti with ghee, and serve them hot with sarson da saag."
