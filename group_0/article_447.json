      "content": "Evaluate the amount of Skype credit you think you may need for your monthly plan, and decide if you'll purchase credits à la carte or as a subscription. This will largely depend on your personal calling needs. For example, if you are located in the United States, calls to Mexico and Canada are included in a basic subscription package, while overseas calls must be purchased as an add on. When you're deciding how to activate SkypeOut in a manner that works for you, these financial calculations are important. Skype provides users with a list of international calling rates, which will help you decide if you need a subscription plan or à la carte credits."

      "content": "Purchase Skype credit through the Skype website's secure interface. You can pay with a credit or debit card or your PayPal account. The Skype software will let you know when your credit balance is running low, so that you can add more money to your account as necessary to continue making calls. If you prefer, you can also set the software up so that it adds money to your account automatically when your balance drops below a certain amount."
