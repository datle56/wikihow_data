      "content": "Choose a topic you’re passionate about. When you’re making content all day, you want to make sure you’re producing something you care about. Ask yourself, “What do I like to do? What hobbies do I have? What’s my personality type?” Answering these questions can help you find your community and niche. For example, if you love reading, consider branding yourself as a “booktoker” who makes TikToks on the latest book and publishing trends. If you’re a foodie, think about starting a blog reviewing the restaurants in your neighborhood. If you have an interest in true crime, try starting a true crime podcast on unsolved mysteries or cases in your area."

Before you start producing content, ask yourself, “Who am I speaking to?” Your audience directly impacts your success as a content creator, so get to know them well! Research the topic you want to cover and notice any similarities between the top search results. Are the articles, videos, and/or photos intended for a younger audience? What vibes do the top results give visually? The answers to these questions will help you tailor your content to appeal to your audience. For example, say your target audience is Gen Z. Your content might include trending, upbeat audio, vibrant colors, emojis, and/or slang to appeal to a younger audience. If your target audience are baby boomers, your content may be cleaner, more serious, and respectable."

Similarly, you wouldn’t want to start a YouTube channel to make short form video content, but you would want to post Instagram Reels . Scroll through the platforms you like to see what’s trending and if your target audience matches. Stick to one platform at first to keep your focus and strategy as narrow as possible. As you grow and learn, you’ll be able to expand across other platforms. If you’re unfamiliar with a specific platform that interests you, download it and start fiddling around, search how to make content for the platform online, and get yourself as familiar with it as possible."
