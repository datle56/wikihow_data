      "content": "Consider purchasing a cored incense stick. These incense sticks consist of a thin, wooden stick (usually bamboo) that is covered with incense material; only the bottom inch or so is left uncovered. The incense material can be smooth and fine, or it can be grainy and coarse. The aroma, which is usually strong, includes both the scent of the incense and the scent of the burning wooden core. As a general rule of thumb, opt for incense that is pure and scented naturally, rather than ones that use bonding agents and chemical fragrances. [1] X Expert Source Karina Menali, L.Ac., DACM, Dipl.

      "content": "Consider purchasing a solid incense stick. These incense sticks are made from pure incense material and have no core inside. They have a lighter aroma, making them perfect for small spaces, such as bedrooms and offices. Because they have no core, their smell is simpler with no underlying notes of burning wood. You can also make your own incense !"

      "title": "Find a suitable incense holder.",
      "content": "Find a suitable incense holder. Incense holders, also known as censers, come in many different shapes and sizes. What you use to hold your incense depends on the type of incense you are using: cored or solid. You can purchase a special holder designed to hold incense sticks, our you can make your own using the supplies you have on hand. If you have a cored incense stick, consider using an incense \"boat,\" which is a long, thin piece of wood, metal, or ceramic that has a tiny hole at one end. The incense boat usually has a groove down the center, which is used to catch any falling pieces of ash. If you have a solid incense stick, do not use a wooden holder. Solid incense sticks burn all the way down, so using anything made from a flammable material as a censer is dangerous. Instead, consider filling a bowl or cup with grain, rice, salt, or sand, and sticking the incense stick inside. [2] X Research source If you wish to use a censer, then look for one that is made of ceramic or stone. Consider purchasing a shaped censer. These incense holders often come in many different shapes, such as elephants, lotus flowers, leaves, or bowls. They are usually made out of ceramic (which makes them suitable for both cored and solid incense sticks) and have a tiny hole at the top."

      "content": "Consider making your own censer. You can make a simple incense holder using a bowl and something grainy, or you can make your own out of clay. Here are some ideas: Make a shaped censer using clay. Take a piece of natural, air dry stone clay and roll it out flat. Cut it into a shape you like using a craft knife or a cookie cutter. You can either leave it flat, or turn the edges up towards you to give it more of a bowl shape. Take your incense stick and poke a hole into the clay. Take the stick out and let the clay dry before using it as a censer. Make an incense holder using a bowl or bucket. Choose a container that is wide enough so that it can catch any falling ash from your incense stick. Fill the container with grain, rice, salt, or sand."

      "content": "Find a suitable place to burn your incense. Because incense sticks release a lot of smoke, you will need to burn your stick in a well-ventilated room. At the same time, however, keep your burning incense away from open windows or doors, where there is a lot of draft. Make sure that there is nothing flammable near your incense, such as curtains or drapes. [3] X Research source"

If you can see a glowing ember, then the incense stick is burning properly. If you do not see anything, and the tip looks ashy, then you will need to relight the stick."

After about 30 seconds, you should be able to smell the incense. [5] X Research source This means that your incense is burning properly. If you do not see anything and the tip looks ashy, then you have completely extinguished the incense. Re-light the stick. This time, cup your hand and hold it behind the flame as you blow it out."

      "title": "Stick your incense into the holder.",
      "content": "Stick your incense into the holder. If you are using a cored incense stick, then place the wooden end unto the holder. If you are using a solid incense stick, then it does not matter which end you place into the holder. Most censers will hold the stick up vertically or at a slight angle. If your censer holds your stick at a slight angle, make sure that the tip of your incense stick is still over the censer. If the tip extends beyond the censer, trim the incense stick down or place the censer down on a heat-resistant try. If you are using a bowl or bucket filled with grain, rice, salt, or sand, then gently push the bottom of the stick into the grain, rice, salt, or sand until the stick is able to stand up on its own. You can stand the stick straight up or angle it slightly. If you choose to angle the stick, make sure that the tip is still within the perimeter of the container. This way, once you light the stick, any ash will fall directly into the container, and not onto your table or floor."

If you need to leave the room, extinguish the incense by dipping the tip in water or pressing it against a heat-resistant surface. Make sure that the incense holder is on a heat-resistant surface, and out of reach of any curtains, drapes, children, and pets."
