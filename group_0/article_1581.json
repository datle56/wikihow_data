      "content": "Set a base layer of face primer and foundation for a less spooky look. For a sexier, less-green witch, grab primer and foundation in your natural skin color, or go a couple shades lighter to maintain a ghoulish feel. [2] X Research source Rub on your primer, then dab foundation on your face and blend it out with a brush, extending down and blending with the skin on your upper neck. Using your fingers, rub concealer under your eyes or on any spots, then brush on some powder to help the makeup set."

      "title": "Contour your face",
      "content": "Contour your face subtly for a hollowed look. Brush a brown or tan color along the tops of your cheek bones and the edges of your jaw with a makeup brush and blend it carefully. Use a thinner brush along the ridges of your noise. Highlight the tops of your cheekbones and the tip of your nose with a light brown or white eyeshadow to get a 3-D effect. [3] X Research source Your eyes will be pretty dramatic, so you can either keep the contouring subtle or use it to enhance the witchy look even more."

      "title": "Paint your face and neck with green face paint for a spooky look.",
      "content": "Paint your face and neck with green face paint for a spooky look. Buy face paint at your local costume store or makeup boutique. Mix a darker shade with some white for a less intense color, or ramp up the impact with a neon or lime green. If you have very sensitive skin, consider applying a thin base layer of natural makeup under your green face paint so your skin doesn’t become irritated. [4] X Research source Squeeze some paint onto a palette or paper plate and use a soft makeup sponge to dab it onto your face, blending as you go. Apply it as close as you can to your hairline, onto your ears if they’ll be exposed, and down your neck and chest to meet the neckline of your dress or shirt. Leave your eyelids bare, since you’ll be doing a smoky eye look later. Dab away the excess paint afterwards with a fresh sponge."

You can also dab a bit of the same liquid liner onto your chin with a makeup sponge to achieve a pointed effect. [7] X Research source Can’t figure out where to contour your cheeks?

To make for an authentic green witch costume, try to cover up exposed skin that you don’t want to paint green, like your hands and ankles. Use long black gloves and a long skirt for a look that’s both elegant and efficient. Buy a large witch hat or move your hair forward if you’d rather not paint your ears. [8] X Research source"

Then, use a green eyeshadow to blend it out into your green face paint, towards your nose and underneath the lash line. Choose a bright green shadow for the main part of the lids and apply with a small brush. Use a black liquid liner to create a thick line just below your lower lashes and above your upper ones.

To achieve the neatest cat-eye, place a piece of tape just under your eye so that the straight edge curves out a bit towards your temples. This will ensure that you get a neat, elegant extension as you apply your eyeshadow. If you use tape, make sure to do your eyes before you prime and contour the rest of your face. [11] X Research source Use your fingers to spread primer on your eyelids up to your eyebrows. Then, rub on a brightly-colored eyeshadow with your fingers, using multiple layers to make the color pop. Try green or purple for a classic witchy look, or experiment with other neon colors. Blend a matte brown eyeshadow into the crease of your eye with a large blending brush, just above the colored eyeshadow. With a smaller, tapered brush, blend a black eyeshadow into the outer corner of your eye and into the crease. To make your colored eyeshadow pop, use a small brush to swipe on white eyeshadow below your brow and along the inner corner of your eye. Apply a black liquid liner along your upper lid, following the crease outwards towards your temple."
