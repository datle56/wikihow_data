Reflect on why you're glad about them, and write them down if you wish. Keep a list of things you're grateful for. Add to it every day. [9] X Research source Write a list of the good things in life (hot chocolate, rainbows, good friends, fuzzy animals, etc.). Add illustrations or photos if you feel like it.

Sometimes, people try to take advantage of your kindness, bully others, or spread hurtful information, and it is absolutely okay to be firm with them. You can even be rude if you have to. You have the right to assert your boundaries and protect others, and doing so does not make you less warm or less likable. It is an act of kindness and self care. [14] X Research source \"Turn the other cheek\" is only good advice if the person's conscience will kick in and they will immediately realize that they were in the wrong. Sometimes people will slap the other cheek. In this case, passivity is not the answer, and you will get help or fight back. Sometimes, being firm is an act of kindness. For example, if your son is crying because he doesn't want to go to the doctor, capitulating will only hurt him: he won't get medical attention, and he'll learn that crying will get him out of anything he doesn't want to do. Tough love is okay in these circumstances."
