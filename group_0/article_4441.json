      "content": "Use a brush to apply the flux appropriate to the temperatures and the metal. An all-purpose flux covers a wide range of temperatures and is beneficial to have on hand for general purpose brazing. Add flux by dipping the filler rod into the flux. You may also use flux-coated rods to eliminate this step. The flux-coated rods apply the flux during the aluminum brazing process."
