The first step is to find the circuit's current and total voltage: [3] X Research source The current of a series circuit is the same at all points on the circuit. If you know the current at any point, you can use that value in this equation. The total voltage is equal to the voltage of the supply (the battery).

[7] X Research source For example, a parallel circuit has three branches, with resistances of 10 Ω, 2 Ω, and 1 Ω. Use the formula 1 R T = 1 10 + 1 2 + 1 1 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{R_{T}}}={\\frac {1}{10}}+{\\frac {1}{2}}+{\\frac {1}{1}}} and solve for R T : Convert fractions to a common denominator : 1 R T = 1 10 + 5 10 + 10 10 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{R_{T}}}={\\frac {1}{10}}+{\\frac {5}{10}}+{\\frac {10}{10}}} 1 R T = 1 + 5 + 10 10 = 16 10 = 1.6 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{R_{T}}}={\\frac {1+5+10}{10}}={\\frac {16}{10}}=1.6} Multiply both sides by R T : 1 = 1.6R T R T = 1 / 1.6 = 0.625 Ω."

Circle each one to help you keep track of them. For example, a circuit has a 1 Ω resistor and a 1.5 Ω resistor connected in series.
