      "content": "Understand the relation between price and demand. Economics study shows that, for most traditional businesses, as the demand for any item increases, the price for that item should decrease. Conversely, as the price decreases, demand should increase. Using data from actual sales, a company can determine a supply and demand graph. That data can be used to calculate a price function. [1] X Research source For more information on graphing supply and demand data, see Find and Analyze Demand Function Curve. Make sure you understand how to construct a Price-Demand function from your real scenario. It's important to consider the following: Historical data: Analyze past sales data to determine how price changes have impacted demand. Competitive Analysis: Look at how competitors price similar products and how it affects their sales. Consumer Surveys: Directly ask how consumers might respond to different pricing scenarios. Economic Conditions: Current economic conditions can influence consumer purchasing power and spending willingness. Substitutes and Complements: The availability and pricing of substitute or complementary products can affect demand."

      "title": "Create a price function.",
      "content": "Create a price function. The price function consists of two primary pieces of information. The first is the intercept. This is the theoretical price if no items are sold. The second detail is a decreasing slope. The slope of the graph represents the drop in price for each item. A sample price function might look like: p = 500 − 1 50 q {\\displaystyle p=500-{\\frac {1}{50}}q} p = price q = demand, in number of units This function sets the “zero price” at $500. For each unit sold, the price decreases by 1/50th of a dollar (two cents)."
