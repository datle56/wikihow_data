      "content": "A tree pod burial buries human remains in pods for a tree to grow out of. Rather than a casket, the human body goes into a biodegradable pod that will break down over time. The pod is buried in the ground, and a tree is planted on top of it. As the tree grows, the person’s remains will provide nutrients for the tree. [1] X Research source In a tree pod burial, the human remains can be whole, or they can be cremated."

Keep in mind that this cost doesn’t include any additional funeral services or the burial process itself. [2] X Research source In general, a full funeral with a tree burial pod costs around $1,000 to $2,000. Biodegradable urns are usually cheaper; those typically range from $65 to $300."
