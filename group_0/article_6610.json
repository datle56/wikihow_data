      "title": "Use phone-compatible gloves.",
      "content": "Use phone-compatible gloves. Not all gloves work with touch-screen phones, but the ones that do are usually marked. Most gloves are made of non-conductive fibers and threads, so you need to make sure that the gloves you're using are conductive or have been dipped in a conductive coating. Most conductive gloves that work with touchscreens are identified by the differently colored fingertips."

      "title": "Make sure your fingers are clean and dry.",
      "content": "Make sure your fingers are clean and dry. If there's dust or moisture on your fingers, your touch screen may respond differently than you expect. Dust and most moisture are conductive, meaning that you might tap in the lower left corner of your phone, but it will select something somewhere else since the conductive materials are changing the location of your tap."

      "title": "Don't use fingernails or a ballpoint pen to tap.",
      "content": "Don't use fingernails or a ballpoint pen to tap. Neither of those conducts energy from your body to the screen, so using something other than your fingers will result in a touch screen that won't work. A ballpoint pen is not a stylus, which is designed to take the place of your finger."

    {
      "title": "Make sure there aren't more conductive items nearby.",
      "content": "Make sure there aren't more conductive items nearby. Conductive items like coins or keys can add to the signal you're sending your phone by tapping the screen. This can result in the phone selecting something that you didn't mean to select."
