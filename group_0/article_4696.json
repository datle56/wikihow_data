      "content": "Learn how to budget. One of the most fundamental skills of life is budget management. If you manage your budget poorly, you will struggle to make ends meet and may even have to borrow money from others. However, if you manage it well, you will be aware of your spending, reach your financial goals and be financially independent. Take some time to make a budget of all of your necessary expenses each month and try to honor that budget by not spending more than those amounts. Also, allocate a certain percentage of any money you earn or receive each month to put in your savings. You can do this manually or by using an app. It is important to develop a spreadsheet for your expenses and income. You can do this manually with a program like Excel, or you can use a special software. You can also use websites like LearnVest to set goals and track your spending. Make sure you are spending less than you make."

This is also a good way to improve your chance of being on time for appointments. Be flexible. Keep in mind that despite your best efforts, things may still not go as planned. Remember that everything will be okay if you are late now and then or if a task takes you longer than you thought it would."

If in developing a plan that will affect other people and you do not consider those people, then you are not thinking critically about the issue.

The more you know about different perspectives, the better able you will be to make decisions and develop your own opinions and understanding of other people's opinions.

For instance, if you want to know more about a certain war or country, google it and read a few articles about it. Read the news in as unbiased a way as possible. Rather than relying on one news source, consider reading several different ones on the same topic so you don't gather a biased perspective."

      "content": "Try to solve a problem without asking for help. Another way to develop your critical thinking skills is by problem solving. If you are accustomed to asking your parents or friends for help with certain things, try to instead solve the problem yourself sans advice. Take some time to first identify the issue, consider several possible solutions, and then select and execute the solution that you think is best. For instance, as a very basic example, if you typically ask your dad for help getting something off of a top shelf that you can't reach, consider ways that you could get the item yourself, like using a chair to elevate yourself."
