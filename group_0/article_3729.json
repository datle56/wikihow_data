      "title": "Understand downsides.",
      "content": "Understand downsides. As nice as the upsides are, there are a number of downsides of which you should be aware. Silver harms anyone, but as a werewolf--especially in wolf form--silver hurts you even more than before. You will not receive any resting bonuses. Racial abilities will not carry over. You cannot use equipment, magic, or other powers. If NPC'S witness your transformation, they will run, or attack you. In the least case they will treat you like an outsider, saying \"I find your wolfish grin... unsettling.\" \"You smell like a wet dog.\" \"Is that... Hair growing out of your ears?\" and even \"Ah, you've been playing with your hounds again?\" But Eorlund Gray-Mane will defend you if you transform in the middle of Whiterun."

      "content": "Cure yourself of lycanthropy. You may wish to cure yourself of lycanthropy. Unless you have activated the Dawnguard Expansion Pack* (*Aela can give you blood once more) or downloaded a mod, it will be impossible to become a werewolf again."
