If your score falls below 4.2, DoorDash will no longer allow you to be a driver."

If you accept more than 70% of your orders, you can qualify for the program. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that this even means accepting orders that are small or that may not tip well."

[6] X Research source To re-qualify for the program, simply meet the requirements again next month."

      "content": "Use “Dash Now” anytime you want. Regular DoorDashers will continue to have to schedule their time on the road. As a Top Dasher, you can “Dash Now” at any time, even when it’s not busy. This means that anytime you’re ready to hit the road, you can simply use the “Dash Now” button to get started. Usually, the “Dash Now” button is only available when DoorDash is very busy. [7] X Research source DoorDash still recommends scheduling your time to avoid too many Dashers on the road at once, but that’s up to you. Becoming a Top Dasher may also give you slight priority over other Dashers when it comes to assigning orders. However, that’s not a noted perk on the DoorDash website."

Since the “Dash Now” perk is the only real benefit of becoming a Top Dasher, if you like “Dash Now,” then it’s a worthy goal. However, if you prefer to schedule your drive time anyway, it might not be for you. Some people find that the requirements for Top Dasher are too strict and hard to attain. For instance, declining a $3 order with no tip will count against your acceptance rate, potentially lowering your score."
