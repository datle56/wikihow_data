      "title": "3 represents creativity, open-mindedness, and self-expression.",
      "content": "3 represents creativity, open-mindedness, and self-expression. The number 3 is a symbol of your many skills and talents that will help you create positive outcomes in your life. Whatever challenges you may be facing, the power of number 3 will help you find creative solutions to these issues and maintain high levels of energy and focus. On top of all of that, since 3 appears twice in 303, its powers are even stronger than usual. [5] X Research source The number 3 also symbolizes the power and energies of the Ascended Masters—or your guardian angels. This means that you are truly blessed with the protection of your angels and will receive their guidance in everything you do. Three is the number of inspiration, imagination, and optimism. The 3 holds an almost childlike innocence that anything is possible. This is why the quality of imagination within the 3 is so powerful—it is doubtless belief and optimism. The 3 is the Gateway Number to the Mind Plane and is the pivotal piece of the puzzle or tool we use as humans to manifest all that we desire (imagination, thought, memory). Three is also the number of unity. When we see a 3, or, better yet, multiple 3s (with an emphasizing zero), it can indicate things are coming together in important and significant ways in our life."
