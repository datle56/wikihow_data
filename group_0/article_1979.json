      "content": "Insert your hook onto the edge of your project and make chain stitches. The great thing about this ribbing is that you work it directly onto the edge of your swatch or project. You can totally customize the number of chains you make based on how long you want your ribbing to be. Keep in mind that the longer your chain, the wider the ribbing will be. [1] X Research source If you're following a pattern, it should tell you how many chains to make or it will tell you to chain a certain length. Working on a hat or sleeve cuff? If you want the garment to hug your body, use a hook in a smaller size so the stitches are smaller than the rest of the item. Want to make ribbing in a different color? Switch yarn colors once you've finished the last stitch of your project and before you start the ribbing."

Then, work a single crochet stitch. Need a refresher? Don't worryâ€”to single crochet, wrap the yarn once around your hook and pull up a loop. Yarn over again and pull through both of the loops to finish the stitch. [2] X Research source"

Just work 1 single crochet into each chain stitch. [3] X Research source This makes a strip of fabric that's dangling from your project. When you join the foundation chain to your project, you'll anchor it in place."

When you look at the crochet work you'll see that each stitch makes a V. The back loops are the back side of that V which are farther away from you. Does your pattern say BLSC? This is exactly what you're doing when you single crochet into the back loops."

If you added ribbing to a cuff or hat, for instance, you'll end up with 2 edges that need to be joined. If you like to sew, cut the yarn tail and thread it onto a tapestry needle. Then, line up the edges and whipstitch them together. Prefer crocheting? No problem! Stack the fabric so the edges line up and slip stitch along the edge to join the pieces. [14] X Research source If you attached ribbing to a flat project like a blanket, just tie off the yarn when you reach the end and weave in the tails."
