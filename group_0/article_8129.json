      "content": "Hose it down. Set your mat on the ground. If your hose has a spray nozzle, use its jet setting to blast away any dirt that just needs a little nudge to loosen. Otherwise, just give it a good soaking to get it wet. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Scrub with mild detergent and water.",
      "content": "Scrub with mild detergent and water. Add a few drops of mild laundry or dish soap to a bucket and fill it with water. Soak a sponge, cloth, or cleaning brush in the solution. Then scrub both sides of the mat down until it's clean. Some people use degreasers and foam cleaners to clean their mats, but Weather technology advises against anything harsher or more abrasive than mild detergent. These may cause damage to the mats. Additionally, WeatherTech strongly advises against using any silicone-based agent. These may cause the mats to be slippery, even after drying, which is especially dangerous for the driver’s side mat."

      "title": "Rinse clean, dry, and reinstall.",
      "content": "Rinse clean, dry, and reinstall. Hose the mat off again until all traces of soap have been removed. Either allow it to air-dry or thoroughly towel-dry before reinstalling. When you put the mat back in, make sure it’s on the appropriate side of the car (driver’s side versus passenger side). Reattach all retention hooks to ensure the mat doesn’t slip out of place. When you reinstall the driver’s mat, double-check that it doesn’t interfere with the pedals before you drive your vehicle again."

[2] X Research source Only use mild detergent. Harsher chemicals and abrasive agents may cause damage. Do not use silicone-based products. These can make your mats unsafe and slippery."
