      "content": "Find something unique about yourself and develop your own style. The goal here is to discover what makes you stand out from everyone else. You may have to experiment to find your own voice and what sets you apart from everyone else. If you have the ability to alternate between alto and soprano, use that skill to show off how your talent spans a wide vocal range. Maybe you have a raspy voice and a gritty vocal style that works great for soul music. [2] X Research source Playing an instrument like the guitar or piano can also set you apart and help you stand out."

      "content": "Sing on a stage to get familiar with performing in front of people. Once you feel confident in the strength of your voice, take the next step to showing it off to strangers. It’s typically much easier to sing to yourself or in front of friends and family who care about you. Singing in front of a group of strangers takes a lot more courage! [3] X Research source Sing karaoke at a local spot or join a school or church choir. While these types of performances are “safe” because they are done for fun or with a group for a good cause, they are still a good starting point for putting yourself out there."

      "content": "Perform in places that take you out of your comfort zone. After you’ve nailed stage performances, branch out and try something new. Try being a guest singer with a local band or singing on the patio at a restaurant. Singing at any sort of venue that is new or different for you will help. You may not get paid when you are first starting out, but you will probably be able to set out a tip jar. If you do get paid for performing, consider it a bonus! No 2 venues, performances, or even songs will be exactly alike. Give yourself opportunities to experience as many different factors as you can. All of these experiences will work to prepare you to be able to give a successful performance no matter what the circumstances. You can’t be shy. Put yourself out there and introduce yourself to the people you want to work with. If there’s a particular band you want to play with, ask if you can come to one of the practices. Using mutual acquaintances can also be helpful in finding venues to perform at and/or people to sing with. These experiences can also help give you a sense of what kind of performances you want to do. You may discover that you would rather sing with a group or a band instead of solo."

If you’re asked to get up and sing unexpectedly, or the instrumentals or background music don’t work during an audition, you need to have something to fall back on. Choose a song that you can sing perfectly, every time. Your go-to song should be familiar to most audiences, well-liked, and within your natural vocal range. As you become more experienced, this list will become longer and you will have multiple songs that you can sing perfectly no matter what."

      "content": "Practice singing a variety of cover songs. A lot of singers don't write their own songs, and that's OK. Particularly when you're first starting out, you want people to pay more attention to the quality of your voice than the quality of your songwriting. Build up a \"set list\" of 10 to 15 cover songs you know you can really knock out of the park, and practice getting better at them. Choose a good mix of current and classic songs. A good way to get a cover noticed is to drastically alter the tone, tempo, or instrumentation of a popular song. Compare the several different versions of \"Hallelujah,\" or listen to the Civil Wars' cover of Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\" for ideas. Don’t worry about royalties for performing cover songs live. Copyright and licensing issues only come into play if you are recording and distributing those songs."

But don’t feel bad if writing isn’t your thing—a lot of singers rely on others to write their songs for them. The goal here is to put out some fresh new music instead of relying solely on cover songs. [5] X Research source If you opt to have someone write your songs for you, you then have to decide whether to give them credit or contract them as a ghost writer. In general, fans appreciate the honesty."
