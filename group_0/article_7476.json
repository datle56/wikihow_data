If something or someone looks ugly, undesirable, or abnormal in some way, someone on TikTok might describe it as looking or being \"chopped.\" For example, an unattractive person or an ugly outfit could be called \"chopped.\" Less commonly, chopped can refer to a conversation or chat. For example, if you have long conversation with a friend you haven’t seen in a long time, you could say something like \"we chopped it up for hours.”"

You might hear the term in conversation, see it in a social media comment or meme, or even see it used as a hash tag on TikTok. Sometimes, it's used lightheartedly to poke fun at something, but it can also be used seriously to describe someone’s unattractive physical appearance. Generally, unless you're just kidding around with a friend or using it in a self-deprecating way, calling something \"chopped\" is pretty harsh.
