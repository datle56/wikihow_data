      "content": "Study every day. Set aside 20-30 minutes every day for test-specific studying. This could be taking a practice test, working on your basic math skills, or playing a brain game. The goal is to be consistent over time. You want your mind to anticipate being challenged in unpredictable ways. [2] X Research source By practicing every day you will keep your brain engaged and avoid ‘losing’ knowledge due to extended breaks. For example, students enrolled in summer learning programs generally maintain or increase their IQ levels. In contrast, students who do not study over the summer holiday often experience an IQ drop by the time that they return in the fall. It is important to stop studying for the day when you begin to feel fatigued or mentally foggy. So, the time limit is a bit flexible (especially if you are taking an extended practice test), but 20-30 minutes of concentrated studying often yields the best results as it forces you to focus for a limited amount of time. It also helps you to resist the urge to ‘cram’ in the final days before your test."

      "content": "Take practice tests. It is best if you can use old versions or current practice tests of the exam that you would like to take. Find these by approaching the company that runs the exam or by searching the exam name online. You can also look for a generic free IQ test online. Take as many different tests as you can. The more puzzles you solve, the sharper your problem-solving skills will be. [3] X Expert Source Katherine Demby Test Prep Specialist Expert Interview. 17 December 2020. Some IQ test booklets also contain whole or partial exams. Go to your local bookstore and flip through a couple of books before making a purchase to ensure the content is worth the cost. If buying online, use the preview function to look inside the text. Be aware that some groups, such as American Mensa, refuse to release their past tests, citing copyright restrictions. As a result, practice tests that fall into these categories may be more difficult to locate. [4] X Research source"

This is a game that pushes a player to recall a geometric sequence. It is available online for free practice by searching “Dual-N-Back.” [5] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source Playing these games can count as your mind practice.

If you play them frequently enough you will improve your gameplay but not your overall cognitive abilities. Your best bet is to move on once any game gets easy. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Read. Sitting down with a book as often as you can is a cheap, quick way to stimulate your brain. Recalling the sequence of events helps with memory retention. The act of reading itself is relaxing and can improve focus. For maximum benefit, jump between different genres and authors to keep your brain challenged. [8] X Research source Most IQ tests are written and contain a significant verbal component so reading is a natural form of preparation. As you read make sure to look up any terms that are unfamiliar to you. Also, work on comprehension by re-reading any passage that is unclear to you."

      "title": "Learn something new.",
      "content": "Learn something new. Actively seek out “novelty” or challenging mental tasks, such as mastering a new language. Performing these “new” tasks often prompts your body to increase dopamine levels which in turn leads to the production of new neurons, a necessary step in long-term learning and retention. [9] X Research source Music lessons are one way to reap an IQ benefit over time. The mental challenges and novelty of even consistent lessons push the brain to adapt and result in climbing IQ numbers.

      "content": "Put aside your technology. On occasion, lock up your cell phones and other devices and go through the world relying on your wits and skills alone. This may mean writing out a math problem instead of looking up the answer. All of these added tasks stimulate your brain in a positive way. [11] X Research source One example of this is trying to navigate your route to somewhere by using a paper map instead of a GPS. If you can do this without compromising your safety, try it."

      "content": "Stay away from the TV. We’ve known for quite some time that watching television holds little to no cognitive benefits. So, it should come as no surprise to you that TV time does nothing for your IQ. Limit yourself to 30 minutes a day and use the remaining “TV time” to do something new, challenging, and active instead. [12] X Research source When you do watch TV, try to steer yourself towards educational programming. It is not active learning, but it is still something. [13] X Research source"

Your brain gets to rest after a hard day of work. Keep this pattern up heading into a test and make sure to sleep in the days immediately before."

Keeping a close eye on your diet gives your brain the fuel that it needs to perform at a top level. Pay attention to those foods that make you feel mentally sharper, such as walnuts. Diets that are high in fats and sugars can lower mental reaction times, reduce memory retention, and prompt feelings of depression. All of these outcomes are problematic in many ways, including damaging your IQ potential.

This will help to increase the blood supply headed to your brain which in turn elevates the oxygen level as well. Exercise creates a better physical environment for your brain to do difficult work.

Mentally repeat the mantra “calm down” if you get stressed by a particularly difficult question. Put your arms over your head and do a slow stretch. Practice in the days and weeks before to figure out exactly which methods calm you down the best. [16] X Research source"

Wear simple, basic clothing without any embellishments that you can play with. Choose something that you will comfortable sitting in for a long time. Don’t worry about what anyone thinks, you are there for the test. If you can find out the general temperature of the room beforehand that may be helpful. Some test centers keep rooms extra-cold to prevent drowsiness meaning sweats may be a good idea for you."

Some tests also factor in your age as well. Your raw score is then converted into your IQ by comparing it to the scores of other test-takers. You will also see a percentile ranking showing how your IQ stacks up against others. [19] X Research source"
