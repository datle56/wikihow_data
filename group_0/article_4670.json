      "content": "Choose wall plugs for smaller shelves that won't hold much weight. The wall plug method uses pins or plugs that attach to the wall and support the shelves. You can move these plugs around to adjust the shelves. This method only works if the shelves will reach completely from one end of the pantry to the other, since the plugs rest on each side of the pantry. This makes it a perfect option for cabinets or smaller closets. The plugs are also pretty sturdy, but they might not be able to support very heavy items. For lighter storage in smaller spaces, this is the best option. [1] X Research source The exact weight the shelf can support depends on the plugs you use. Check the packaging for a listed weight limit, and buy a set that lines up with what you'll be storing on the shelves. If this isn't the case for your pantry, then the standards and bracket method is better for you."

      "content": "Measure the length and depth of your pantry. Use a tape measure and stretch it across the pantry. Make sure the tape measure is straight, or you’ll get an inaccurate measurement. Then measure the pantry from front to back as well to get its depth measurement. Write both measurements down so you don’t forget. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut plywood shelves to fit into that space.",
      "content": "Cut plywood shelves to fit into that space. Measure the correct length and width on plywood boards to match the measurements of your pantry. Use a straightedge and mark the cutting lines with a pencil. Then use a table saw or circular saw to cut straight along those lines. Repeat this for as many shelves as you need for your pantry. [3] X Research source If your pantry is 24 in (61 cm) across and 8 in (20 cm) deep, then those are the dimensions you’ll have to cut the plywood to. Always wear gloves and goggles while you’re using a saw. Keep your hands far away from the blade while it’s spinning. If you want to paint or stain the wood , do it now. It’s a lot easier to do before you install the shelves."

      "title": "Measure and mark 1 in (2.5 cm) in from the pantry edges.",
      "content": "Measure and mark 1 in (2.5 cm) in from the pantry edges. Since the shelves are usually flush with the front and back of the pantry edges, this is easy. Just measure in 1 in (2.5 cm) from the front and back of the pantry on each side, at any height. Make a mark there to note where the plugs will go. [4] X Research source If your shelves are 8 in (20 cm) wide and flush with the edges of the pantry, then simply make a mark 1 in (2.5 cm) in from each side of the pantry."

      "title": "Make a mark every 1 in (2.5 cm) up each side of the pantry.",
      "content": "Make a mark every 1 in (2.5 cm) up each side of the pantry. Hold a straightedge or yardstick straight up the side of the pantry along the mark that you made. Place a dot with a pencil every 1 in (2.5 cm) to mark the locations for the holes. Repeat this for the back side of the pantry, then on the other side. [5] X Research source There are also attachments you can use that have pre-drilled holes in them at equal distances. You’d just have to hold the attachment against the pantry and poke through the holes without measuring the distance by hand. Be careful and make certain that the holes on all sides are even with each other. If not, your shelves will be crooked."

You can also use a Dremel tool to drill the holes. [6] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 13 January 2021. Only go about halfway into the wood so the drill bit doesn’t come out the other side. Work your way up each side of the pantry to hit all the marks. [7] X Research source Check the wall plugs that you’re using to see if the set recommends a drill bit size. If the holes are too big or too small, the plugs won’t fit correctly."

When you pick a spot, place 4 wall plugs into the holes at the same height on each side of the pantry. Repeat this for each shelf you’re installing. [8] X Research source Press the plugs into the holes so you know they’re secure. It might help to tap them with a hammer a few times. Double check and make sure the plugs are all at the same height. If not, your shelf will be crooked and could fall."

That’s the beauty of adjustable shelves! Just slide the shelf out, remove the plugs, and stick them in holes at a different height. Then just put the shelf back in. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the standard and bracket method for larger pantries and shelves. If you have a walk-in pantry or need to support a lot of weight on the shelves, then this is a better choice than wall plugs. It's especially useful if the space is too big for the shelves to reach completely from one side to the other. [11] X Research source Wall standards and matching brackets are easy to find at any hardware store. You'll need 2 brackets for each shelf, and you can put multiple brackets and shelves on each pair of standards. Most brackets will fit in a wall standard. It's more important to make sure the brackets are long enough for the shelves you're using to rest on."

If your shelves are longer than that, then you may need to find and make the third stud instead of the second. [13] X Research source"

Once you find the right height for the second standard, hold it in place. [17] X Research source Making sure the standards are level is very important.
