It's safe for use on stones and various types of metals. It can be tricky to rinse off completely, however, so avoid using it on items like watches that you cannot get really wet to rinse thoroughly.

If you skip this step, the jewelry might roll around in the bottom of the pan and get scratched. Any clean towel is fine as long as it covers the bottom of the bowl and still leaves enough room for you to add enough soapy water to cover the jewelry."

Using clean hands, move the water and the jewelry around in the bowl to get all the soap or cleaning solution off of it. Keep doing that until it no longer feels slimy or filmy. Swishing the water is especially necessary if you are cleaning jewelry with small crevices, filigrees, or stone settings. Rushing the clean water over the jewelry will help to get into those small areas."
