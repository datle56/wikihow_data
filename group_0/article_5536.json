[14] X Research source You can make an international call by clicking \"call\" on your Google Voice account. You would then enter the number as you would normally enter an international number, including things like the calling code. Keep time in mind, as Google Voice calls are not free.

If your calling plan assures you can make calls only to Australia, it may not cost as much as a general international calling plan. If you only make calls to Australia, you will not need to pay for other services. As with a calling card, be wary of hidden fees.
