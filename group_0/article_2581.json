      "content": "Identify the cause of your baldness. The first step to making peace with your baldness is to understand the reasons behind your hair loss. Everyone sheds hair each day (some of us more than others), but it is not significant enough to actually be classified as hair loss. The exact cause of hair loss usually relates to one of four factors: genetics (family history), hormonal changes, a medical condition, medication side effect. If you are suffering from significant hair loss, but you don't know the cause, you will definitely want to find out. Ask your doctor to help you figure out the reason, and you'll be better equipped to embrace your baldness.

Poor nutritional habits can be one reason that you are thinning on top. Also, pay attention to your emotional health. Stress can be another factor."

      "content": "Deflect negative comments. [2] X Research source Sometimes strangers can ask you seemingly random personal questions. If your confidence is taking a beating because people have questioned your hairstyle \"choice\", try learning an effective way to respond to nosy people. One method is to ignore them completely. Pretend you didn't hear the comment and then you don't have to acknowledge it, even to yourself. You can also confront the person by explaining that you prefer not to explain anything about your personal appearance. Either option will leave you feeling more confident than if you choose to brood on the insult."

      "content": "Acknowledge the benefits of baldness. Not only is being bald beautiful, but their are some really positive results!

Being bald can drastically reduce the amount of time you spend grooming in the morning. Instead of blow-drying, brushing, and styling, simply moisturize and add sunscreen and you're out the door! The extra sleep you'll gain each morning will surely boost your mood and your confidence. Save money. Although you do still need to care for your bald head, it is going to cost significantly less money than caring for a full head of hair. Just ask anyone who has forked over a healthy amount for highlights that will fade after only two months."

The most common candidates for replacement therapy are people of any sex who are genetically disposed to pattern-baldness, and people who have lost some or all of their hair as the result of an injury (such as burns). If you think this might be for you, you will want to consult a doctor to get more information and to better understand the procedure. [12] X Research source Do your research.
