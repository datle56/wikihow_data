      "content": "Make your bearded dragon as comfortable as possible. If your bearded dragon is sick, you should make sure that the conditions in its cage are ideal. Above all, make sure that its home is warm enough and that it has access to food that it likes to eat, even if its illness doesn't allow it to move very far. Your bearded dragon should have an area of its home that is warmer and an area that is cooler. The warmer side should be 95°F to 110°F (35°C to 43°C) and the cooler side should be around 85°F (29°C). This allows the animal to decide what temperature it wants to be in at any given time. [1] X Research source A UVB light bulb can provide comfortable warmth for your bearded dragon. Install the bulb about 12 inches (30 cm) above the cage. Remember to change the bulb every 6 months."

If it still won't drink, you can offer it a beverage made to minimize dehydration, such as pedialyte. You should also consult with your veterinarian about the possible need for intravenous fluids.
