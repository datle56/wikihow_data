Estimate that party guests will have 1-2 drinks per hour. There are several different sizes of kegs to consider: Mini keg: A mini keg holds about 5 liters, which is a good amount for bringing to a tailgate party or camping trip. [1] X Research source Cornelius keg: A Cornelius keg is a tall, round keg that is commonly used for soft drinks, but they have also been adapted by home brewers to use for beer as well. [2] X Research source Log keg (sixth barrel): A log keg holds about 5 gallons, which equals about 55 12-ounce servings, or 41 pints. Pony keg (quarter barrel): A pony keg holds about 7.5 gallons, which equals about 82 12-ounce servings, or 62 US pints (29,000 ml). [3] X Research source Full keg (half barrel): A full keg holds about 15 gallons, which equals about 165 12-ounce servings, or 124 US pints (59,000 ml). The full keg is the most common size of keg.

      "content": "Find a store near your party. There are many places that sell kegs, such as liquor stores, breweries, wineries, and even some restaurants. Choose a place that is close to your party and that sells the type of beer you'd like to buy."

      "title": "Place your order in advance.",
      "content": "Place your order in advance. Planning in advance will ensure that your order will be fulfilled to your specifications. Planning at least 10 days in advance is a good idea. Some places do have kegs available for last-minute orders, but these may be limited in selection and size."

      "title": "Get the proper permit for serving at special events.",
      "content": "Get the proper permit for serving at special events. If you are planning to serve beer from a keg at a wedding, fundraiser or other special event, you need to get the correct type of permit. These permits are typically issued by your state’s liquor control board. For private parties such as weddings or holiday parties, apply for a banquet permit. Typically, you will fill out a form, giving information about the event, and pay a fee (around $50). Nonprofit organizations need a special occasion permit in order to serve beer from a keg at a special event. These are also issued by your state’s liquor control board. They also need a licensed bartender to serve the beer. Be sure to have proof of the bartender’s license with you at the function."

      "content": "Sign paperwork accepting responsibility for the keg. If you are the person renting the keg and signing the form, you are the one who is responsible for what happens with the beer inside the keg. You are therefore responsible for making sure no minors drink the beer, and those who do drink the beer are also responsible in their behavior. [6] X Research source You are also responsible for ensuring that the keg and other items are returned in the same condition as when you rented them. Some places might require that you provide the address where the keg is going to, the approximate date and time of the beer’s consumption, and your vehicle’s license plate."

      "title": "Pay the deposits and pay for the beer.",
      "content": "Pay the deposits and pay for the beer. You will be charged a refundable deposit fee for the keg itself in addition to the charge for the actual beer. The beer cost will vary depending on the type of beer, how much you are ordering, and where you’re located. Bring a credit card with you. Even if you pay the fees in cash, you’ll need a credit card for the deposit, which will be charged additional fees if you do not return the keg. Keg deposits can range from approximately $30 to $75 or more. You may also be charged a nonrefundable keg cleaning fee. Beers like Budweiser, Miller and Coors are usually cheaper than microbrews, with Budweiser costing $100 for a full keg and other beers like Dogfish Head running about $225 for a full keg."

      "content": "Be prepared for heavy lifting. Kegs that are full of beer are heavy. A full keg weighs roughly 162 pounds.

Many places will rent kegerators by the day, week, month or even on a rent-to-own plan.

[10] X Research source Use a chilling bucket filled with ice or a kegerator (a refrigerator specially designed for kegs). Alternately, you can place the keg inside a large garbage bag and fill the bag with ice. Do not allow the beer to go above 55 °F (12.8 °C) or below 28 degrees F. Beer that is too warm will produce bacterial growth. Beer that has frozen will have reduced quality of flavor and aroma."

A manual pump (the kind most often used at a party, for example) will reduce the quality of the beer’s taste rather quickly. In this case, drink the beer within 8 hours. You may be able to stretch this out to one day. [12] X Research source Using a kegerator and CO2 to dispense your beer will prolong the quality and freshness of the beer. In this case, pasteurized beer can last up to 3 months. Unpasteurized beer might last about 2 months. [13] X Research source"

You are paying for the beer, so you might as well drink it or store it in growlers (large bottles for beer). You will not get any refund on the keg once it leaves the store where you bought it.

Consider who you are selling your beer to, and how frequently, when deciding on keg size and number. Will the brewery or distributor ask for smaller sized kegs to start? Or, on the other hand, should you start with larger kegs so that your customers don’t have to change their kegs so often?

Pressure regulator: This instrument will regulate how much CO2 is going into your keg, and consequently, how carbonated your beer will be. Connection lines: You will need connectors to hook up the CO2 tank to the keg. Get two quick disconnects, a gas line and a picnic faucet."
