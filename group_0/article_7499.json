      "title": "Keep your parenthetical citation at the end of the sentence.",
      "content": "Keep your parenthetical citation at the end of the sentence. MLA citations favor the readability of your text. Because multiple citations in the same sentence break up your text and make it more difficult to read, you'll usually use a single parenthetical citation at the end of the sentence, even if the text in the sentence draws from multiple sources. Use the last name of the author and the page number for each source, separating them with semi-colons.

    {
      "title": "List sources that all support the same fact in order of relevance.",
      "content": "List sources that all support the same fact in order of relevance. If you write a sentence in your paper and have multiple sources that support the same information, you may want to include them all. The most relevant source is typically the one that discusses the information presented the most thoroughly, although it may also be the source that established the fact first. [2] X Research source For example, if you had 3 sources that all supported the same information and 2 of them referenced the other one, you would put that one first, followed by the others. You might also decide that a source is more relevant if it's more authoritative. For example, if you had 2 sources and one was from a scholarly journal while the other was from a mainstream magazine, you would list the one in the scholarly journal first."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a citation method for multiple pages that enhances readability.",
      "content": "Choose a citation method for multiple pages that enhances readability. If you're discussing a particular issue at length, you might find that you have a source that mentions different aspects of the same issue on different pages. When this happens, you have 3 options for your in-text citations: [3] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source You can include all of the page numbers or page ranges in the parenthetical citation at the end of the sentence, separated by commas, like this: (Potter 12, 24, 48-52). You can provide a citation with the author's last name and the page number after the first bit of information, like this: (Potter 12). For the rest of the sentence, simply include a page number in parentheses (24) at the end of each part supported by that page or page range (48-52). You can mention the author's name in the text of your paper, then provide the page numbers in parentheses after the part they support."

      "title": "Split one sentence into two if necessary for readability.",
      "content": "Split one sentence into two if necessary for readability. If you need more than one citation in one sentence, there's a possibility that the multiple citations will look clunky and make the text hard to read. With only 2 citations, the problem typically won't be as bad. However, if you have 3 or more sources for a single sentence, it's usually better to break it up into 2 or more sentences. [4] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source Keep in mind that if you have a source that only supports half of your sentence, typically that sentence is presenting 2 separate ideas. In that situation, it's usually better to have 2 sentences anyway."

    {
      "title": "Place a citation mid-sentence if it supports only part of the sentence.",
      "content": "Place a citation mid-sentence if it supports only part of the sentence. An APA citation includes the author's name and the year of publication. If you reference more than one source in a sentence, and one source only represents part of that sentence, place your in-text citation at the end of the material that citation supports. This may mean that you end up using more than one in-text citation in the sentence. [5] X Research source For example, you might write: While Lockhart's books frequently mention encounters with dangerous creatures (Snape, 2018), the professor's former students note that he was actually terrified of them (Potter, 2020). Including the author's name in the text of your paper can increase readability, especially for sentences with multiple in-text citations. For example, you might write: Although Snape (2018) noted that Lockhart's books discussed encounters with dangerous creatures, his former students consider those books to be works of fiction (Potter, 2020)."

      "title": "Order sources in the same parenthetical citation alphabetically.",
      "content": "Order sources in the same parenthetical citation alphabetically. If you have more than one source that supports the information you've included in a sentence, list them all in a single parenthetical, separated by semi-colons. Place them alphabetically in the order they appear on your Reference List so your readers can easily find the full citation. [6] X Research source For example, you might write: By the end of his tenure at Hogwarts, the wizarding community at large was well aware the Lockhart was a fraud (McGonagall, 2016; Potter, 2020; Snape, 2018)."

    {
      "title": "Separate minor citations with the words \"see also.\"",
      "content": "Separate minor citations with the words \"see also.\" In some circumstances, you might want to mention other sources that agree with the main source you cite, such as if you are trying to demonstrate broad appeal for a particular theory. Separate these minor sources by placing a semi-colon after the primary source, then adding the words \"see also.\" List each of your minor sources in alphabetical order, separated by semi-colons. [7] X Research source For example, you might write: After events at Hogwarts exposed Lockhart as a fraud, many other wizards spoke out against him as a charlatan (Potter, 2001; see also Grainger, 2010; Snape, 2018; Weasley, 2014)."

      "title": "Use multiple footnotes if each source supports a different part of the sentence.",
      "content": "Use multiple footnotes if each source supports a different part of the sentence. Since superscripted numbers aren't much of a distraction, Chicago style isn't as concerned about multiple citations frustrating readability as some of the other styles are. If you have a source that only supports part of a sentence, simply place a footnote at the end of the portion of the sentence that source supports. [8] X Research source If the same source supports the whole sentence, but different page numbers or ranges support each half of the sentence, it's appropriate to include 2 footnotes with the different page numbers or ranges. Use a shortened footnote format for the second footnote."

    {
      "title": "Include multiple sources for a single idea only if it is complex or controversial.",
      "content": "Include multiple sources for a single idea only if it is complex or controversial. While Chicago style supports including multiple citations in a single footnote, it's generally considered unnecessary. If you're including a fact or idea that's relatively new or not well-established, however, multiple citations might be warranted. Separate the citations with semi-colons. [9] X Research source When you're talking about a relatively new discovery, multiple sources make it more authoritative — especially if your research is building on that discovery. For studies that are more controversial, positive discussion of the findings in other sources helps your reader understand why you're relying on the information despite the controversy surrounding it."

      "title": "List multiple sources in one note in order of importance.",
      "content": "List multiple sources in one note in order of importance. If you do include multiple sources in one footnote, start with the most important one, then list minor ones. While it isn't necessary to exhaustively rank every source in order of importance, at least make sure the most important source is listed first. [10] X Trustworthy Source Library of Congress Official library of the U.S. and main research institution for Congress and the American public Go to source If you're unsure which source would be considered the most important, look at the dates when the sources were published. You might also look at the publisher — scholarly publications are generally considered more authoritative than mass media publications."
