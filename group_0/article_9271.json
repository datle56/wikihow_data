[1] X Research source If the monitor also has a USB-C port, you can connect it to your MacBook Air using a USB-C cable without a special adapter. If you have a 2020 or later MacBook Air with an Apple chip (M1-M3), your USB-C port also supports Thunderbolt/USB 4. The 13\" MacBook Air models from 2018, 2019, and 2020 USB-C ports also support Thunderbolt 3. If you have a MacBook Air from 2017 or earlier, you don't have a USB-C port. However, you can still connect your MacBook Air to a USB-C monitor using a Thunderbolt 2 to USB-C adapter."

If both the monitor and MacBook Air have USB-C ports, a standard USB-C cable that supports video output is all you'll need to make the connection. If there's a port mismatch, you can get an adapter. [2] X Research source You can find all types of USB-C adapters at stores, including USB-C to HDMI, USB-C to DisplayPort, USB-C to DVI, and USB-C to VGA. Apple's USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter is one example that allows you to connect to an HDMI port, which you'll find on HDTVs and most monitors. Not all USB-C cables are the same—some only support charging and not data transfer. If possible, use the USB-C cable that came with your monitor, or make sure to buy one that can supports video output. [3] X Research source The USB-C cable that comes with your Mac is for charging only. It won’t work for connecting your MacBook to an external display."
