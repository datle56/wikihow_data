There are 5 number in our sample so n = 5. The sum of tree heights in our sample was 39.5. You would then divide this figure by 5 to figure out the mean. 39.5/5 = 7.9.

[6] X Research source This calculation will give you an idea about how far your data is spread out. Samples with low variance have data that is clustered closely about the mean. Samples with high variance have data that is spread far from the mean. Variance is often used to compare the distributions between two data sets or samples."

You will often get a very large decimal figure when you calculate this step. It is ok to round to the second or third decimal place for your standard deviation figure.

For example, if you wanted to find out how many standard deviations 7.5 was from the mean in our example of tree heights, you would plug in 7.5 for X in the equation.

[16] X Research source In our sample of tree heights, we want the z-score for the data point 7.5. We already subtracted the mean from 7.5, and came up with a figure of -0.4. Remember, the standard deviation from our sample of tree heights was 0.74. - 0.4 / 0.74 = - 0.54 Therefore the z-score in this case is -0.54. This z-score means that 7.5 is -0.54 standard deviations away from the mean in our sample of tree heights. Z-scores can be both positive and negative numbers. A negative z-score indicates that the data point is less than the mean, and a positive z-score indicates the data point in question is larger than the mean."
