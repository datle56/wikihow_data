      "content": "Secure the wooden trim with extra nails. You can use a hammer and nails to secure the top of the trim if it’s sagging. If the sides are lifting, you can also secure them with additional nails after you have addressed the top of the trim. Place nails 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) apart and hammer into the trim gently.

It’s best to use stainless steel screws, which you can find at any home improvement store, because they will hold up best in the weather. Drill the screws into the holes, remove the shim and test the stability of the door again. [6] X Research source If it still isn’t steady, add additional screws to the sides of the frame, working from top to bottom and testing the door as you work."
