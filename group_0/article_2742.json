      "title": "Fight for justice.",
      "content": "Fight for justice. Batman is a super-hero, which means he fights against injustice in all its forms. He fights against evil. Batman has been known to take on gangsters, super-villains, human penguins, genetically-engineered monster alligators, evil clowns, and frozen men. Pretty much the basics. If you want to be like Batman, you've got to be good and fight for the side of justice. You probably don't have any Two-Faces or Penguins in your neighborhood, but that doesn't mean there's no injustice in your own world. Keep a close eye out for other kids being picked on, or anything unfair. Stand up for fairness and equality."

      "title": "Defend the innocent.",
      "content": "Defend the innocent. Bruce Wayne became Batman because his parents were killed in a robbery attempt. His parents were good, honest, hard-working people (Unless you're talking about in the Telltale series) who cared about him very much. As Batman, his job is to defend those kinds of people. If you want to be like Batman, defend the innocent. To be like Batman, you need to have a good sense of right and wrong. Look out for examples in your own life."

      "title": "Use gadgets.",
      "content": "Use gadgets. More than any other super-hero, Batman has the most cool gadgets. If you want to be like Batman, stay up to date on new technology. Learn to use the computer and mobile phones very well. Try to understand how the Internet works and how to use new software. Get your parents permission to do these things and stay up to date. Batman is rich, which helps in the gadget department. But you don't have to be. If you want some pretend gadgets, use an old broken calculator, old clocks, and other broken electronics that have been thrown out in place of gadgets. Take them apart and use the components for fun. Ask permission first."

      "title": "Make your own Bat-Cave.",
      "content": "Make your own Bat-Cave. Every Batman needs a space to call their own. Batman's cave is where he hides his Bat-gear, changes into his costume, and does his Bat-research. You don't necessarily need a secret passageway to get to your Bat-cave (or a mansion to hide it under), but it's still good to have a space that's yours. Turn your room into your Bat-cave. Keep it private. Put a sign on the door that says, \"Bat-Cave: No Penguins or Evil-Doers.\" If you don't have your own room, find a closet to play in that you can call one. Keep your costumes and your gadgets there, and disappear in when you change into your super-self."

      "title": "Face your fears",
      "content": "Face your fears . Batman picked the bat as his symbol because he was afraid of bats.

Even if you're not scared of bats, you need to find and face your own fears, like Batman did. What are you afraid of? Snakes? Spiders ? Heights ? Think about what scares you, then find a way to face that fear, safely. Talk to your parents about it and come up with a plan."

      "title": "Talk like Batman, as well.",
      "content": "Talk like Batman, as well. Batman's voice is always very rough , as if he just drank a quart of sandpaper.

      "content": "Cover your face with a mask. All Batmen need to have their face covered with a mask, that covers the eyes at least.

A good dark cape is important for a Batman costume. Other types of costumes will often come with capes. You could borrow the cape from a vampire costume, or some other super-hero's costume.

If you want to look like this kind of Batman, wear a set of old gray sweats, and add a Batman emblem to the front with marker."
