This is the \"perfect\" cold. While absolute zero is not possible to create, scientists have come close.

This makes it much, much easier to work with mathematically. You can better compare temperatures, find differences or averages, and note relationships when you don't have to work with positive and negative temperatures. [5] X Research source Kelvin is also used to measure color temperature -- thus the 3000K, 6000K, etc. settings on cameras and professional lighting kits and bulbs. [6] X Research source"
