      "content": "Stop using cocaine immediately. If you need to get your system, stop using the drug right away. One-time users will have cocaine in their urine for at least one day afterwards, but cocaine can still be detected for up to four days even after a single use. Habitual users can however have a positive result on a drug test for up to a month. The sooner you stop using, the sooner you’ll be clean. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Anticipate the comedown and wait for the symptoms to pass. Anyone who uses cocaine is likely to “crash” after the initial effects of the drug wear off. This is your body’s way of rebalancing itself in terms of energy and mood. Expect to be tired and potentially depressed for a short time, even up to 2-3 days. [2] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source The cocaine crash is not the same thing as withdrawal, though there are some overlapping symptoms. This is the primary difference between detoxing from cocaine and crack cocaine. Expect the comedown from crack to be a bit tougher and more intense.

      "content": "Go into a detox program for the safest option. If you’ve been using cocaine for a long time or using it often, go through medically-supervised detoxification if you can. There’s no drug that can remove cocaine from your system, but a medical professional will help you through withdrawal by giving you medications to counteract the withdrawal symptoms and monitor your condition. If you need help, look online for a detox center near you. [5] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Depending on your symptoms and how heavily you used cocaine, a detox program can last from three days to over a week. An inpatient rehabilitation program can last around 30 days. Outpatient detox can cost you between $1,000-1,500, whereas a full rehab program can cost up to $20,000."

      "content": "Wait for the cocaine to fully leave your system. There’s no great way to flush your system of cocaine and its metabolites (what your body turns it into), so you just have to wait it out. If so, know that how long cocaine takes to leave your system depends upon a number of different factors: [6] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source How much you used: More cocaine takes longer to leave. How often you use it: The more often you use, the longer it lasts in your body. What was mixed with the cocaine: Purer cocaine leaves more drug in your body. If you were also drinking alcohol: Alcohol slows down elimination of the drug at first, keeping it in your body longer. How well your liver and kidneys function. If you have kidney problems or liver disease, your body won’t clear cocaine as fast. Your weight: Cocaine sticks around longer the more you weigh."

Zinc is sometimes considered a mineral that will help your body cleanse itself, though whether it works to clear cocaine from your system is not scientifically proven. However, it will render urine tests negative for cocaine. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Check with your doctor about whether it’s safe for you to take a zinc supplement. If so, take one daily at the recommended daily dose (8mg for adult women and 11mg for adult men). [12] X Research source Don’t overdo it in an attempt to clear cocaine from your system—toxicity from too much zinc can cause diarrhea , nausea, vomiting, and headaches. Zinc doesn’t appear to impact hair or blood tests."

The internet is teeming with pills, powders, and beverages claiming to rid your body of cocaine—whether permanently or just for a few hours so you can pass a drug test. Many of these products claim to be natural, but because they are not supervised by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) this may or may not be true. In reality, these kits and products have not been proven to remove cocaine from your system, and they can be quite expensive. If you choose to use one, it’s at your own risk.

It’s best not to take untested products from the internet."
