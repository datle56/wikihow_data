Measure the space between existing pipes where the salt cell used to be. Also note the diameter of the existing pipes by measuring across their openings.

      "content": "Drain half of the water from the pool. Change the pump’s settings to reverse so the water pumps out. If you don’t have a pre-installed pump, rent or purchase a vacuum pump from a pool supply store. Put the inlet hose in the water, then put the outlet hose near a container or drain. This takes out a lot of salt and makes the chemical levels a little easier to balance later. You can also try opening the pool’s drain if it has one or taking apart the pool until you can turn over the liner."

      "content": "Use a kit to test the water’s chemical levels. Testing strips are the most common option sold by pool supply stores. Scoop some water out of the pool with a cup, then hold the strip in the sample for about 15 seconds. The strip will change colors to indicate the levels of several chemicals within the water. Compare the strip’s colors to the chart included with the test kit. Liquid test kits are also available. You squeeze a droplet of dye into the sample, which changes color depending on the chemical it detects. Digital water testers are also available. For these, you dip the end of the device into the sample. Activate the device to get the test results."

      "content": "Avoid adding chlorine if the cyanuric acid level is above 70 ppm. A normal cyanuric acid reading is between 20 and 30 ppm. If yours is around 70 ppm or higher, wait 2 or 3 days before testing the pool again. Most chlorine tablets include cyanuric acid, so adding them now could end up damaging the pool by making the water too acidic. Acid eats away at the pipes and pool liner. The pH and other chemicals should still be at safe levels. If you are concerned about them, keep everyone out of the pool until you finish converting it."

      "title": "Fill a floating container with chlorine tablets and place it in the water.",
      "content": "Fill a floating container with chlorine tablets and place it in the water. Purchase chlorine tablets from a pool supply store along with a plastic floating container. Once the pool’s acid level is around 30 ppm or lower, add the tablets to the container according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Push the container below the water’s surface, then let it float so the tablets dissolve. The number of chlorine tablets you need depends on the size of your pool. Add 1 tablet for every 5,000 US gal (19,000 L) of water your pool holds. You may also purchase a chlorinator. It attaches to the pool’s pipes and automatically disperses any chlorine you place inside it. Avoid adding the tablets directly to the pool. They can damage the pool’s pipes and liner."

[6] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source When converting your pool, it can be helpful to test the water every couple of days until the chemical levels stabilize. The ideal pool pH level is between 7.2 and 7.8. Keep the chlorine level between 1 and 3 ppm. Make sure the cyanuric acid level is between 20 and 30 ppm."

Check the container daily to see how many tablets are left. Add more as needed to keep your water sterilized. The chlorine level should stay between 1 and 3 ppm. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Avoid using more than the recommended number of tablets."

      "content": "Add shock to the pool once a week to sterilize the water. Purchase a bag of non-chlorinated shock from a pool supply store. In a well-ventilated area, mix the shock into a bucket of pool water. Add about 1 lb (0.45 kg) of shock for every 10,000 US gal (38,000 L) your pool holds. Non-chlorinated shock is the best choice since it won’t raise your pool’s cyanuric acid level, which may be high after switching from salt water."

      "content": "Adjust the pH level with muriatic acid. Salt water pools tend to have a high pH level. To bring your pool’s pH down after converting it to chlorine, get muriatic acid from a pool supply store. You will need to add 1 ⁄ 4 US gal (0.95 L), possibly more for pools that hold more than 10,000 US gal (38,000 L) of water. Pour it into the water according to the instructions on the label. The pH level should read between 7.2 and 7.8 on your testing kit. Avoid using soda ash or baking soda. These products raise the pH. They are only useful later on if you lower the pH too much."
