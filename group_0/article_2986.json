      "content": "Identify your natural talents. Champions identify the gifts that they've been given and seek to develop them into expertise. Competitive skill, natural athletic ability, and other talents are the seed from which championships grow, but they need to be watered with intelligent focus and hard training. You can't hop straight into the NBA or get hired on as a CEO for a tech company without identifying your talents and training to improve them."

      "content": "Identify your limitations. An athlete who is not gifted with blazing speed can make up for it by increasing their agility, strength, jumping ability, or strategy, but it's important to be honest. If you're an intelligent soccer player, you won't develop an attachment for playing striker if your shot is inaccurate, but your defending skills are top-notch."

      "title": "Explore different fields of play.",
      "content": "Explore different fields of play. Explore lots of competitive and non-competitive fields to see where you might be great. Diversify your talents and find your expertise. Maybe you've idolized LeBron James since childhood and can't get it out of your head to be a professional basketball champion, just like him. If you can't shoot your way out of a cardboard box and stumble on your own feet when you try to shoot a lay-up, that might be hard. But maybe you're built like Dick Butkus, or you can do the quadratic formula in your head–maybe you were destined for greatness in some other field. Play lots of different sports, even if you're worried you won't be good. If you love football, try out volleyball to develop hand-eye-coordination and see if your skills translate. If you love playing tennis, try out a team sport like soccer to see if you don't enjoy playing a role in a group of champions."

When you're learning how to cook, when you're learning how to drive a manual transmission vehicle, when you're learning to speak German, treat it like you're walking onto the field of competition and that you'll come out champion."

      "content": "Identify the gold ring. If you've narrowed in on a set of skills and natural abilities, what is your ultimate goal? What will make you a champion? What will make you satisfied? Set a goal in mind and start yourself in working toward it. Being a champion is partly a list of achievements, but even more so a state of mind. Being a champion has to do with knowing–really knowing–that you're the best at what you do. Winning the National Book Award might be a great achievement, but does that really mean that writer is the best? Being a champion student might mean getting your grades up to at least Bs–something that might've seemed impossible at one point. Maybe being a champion worker means that you show up early and stay late and can walk with the confidence that you're great at what you do. Find your championship and define the terms."

A champion chemist forgets to eat dinner because the new issue of Science is too compelling. A champion lives and breathes the field for which they have talent. Study the competition and study your competitors. Professional athletes devote countless hours each week to studying film of their next week's opponents, dissecting the strategies the other team will employ, the techniques they'll use, and the abilities of the athletes. Businessmen at all levels make a point of studying the sales strategies and the product quality of their competitors as a way of improving their own."

Champions need great coaches, teachers, and motivators to keep them succeeding at a high level. If you're going to be a champion, you'll need help along the way. Athletes should consult good exercise trainers and coaches, as well as good weightlifting trainers, fitness and rehab doctors, and often diet coaches to stay fit and healthy. Look for coaches that you can build a relationship with on a personal level to make your training as enjoyable as possible. If you look forward to sessions with your coach, you'll be a better and more receptive student. Learn to take negative feedback and motivate you to improve. If a coach tells you that you're doing drills like a grandmother, you could collapse and complain, or you could kick it into high gear. Even if you were working hard, is it such a bad thing to go faster? If you're a champion, you'll say no."

All champions struggle to find good reasons to get up every day, sore the day before, and hit the weight room, or head back to the office. It's hard to be great day after day. That's what real champions–the best of the best–find ways to stay motivated and keep themselves one step ahead. It's an essential part of training to be a champion. [1] X Research source Lots of champions are big fans of using motivational music to psych themselves up before big games, or even practice. Heavy music with a big beat tends to be popular among athletes, making metal, hip-hop, and dance music iPod staples. Get \"Seven Nation Army\" by the White Stripes going in your headphones and try not to hit the gym with energy and enthusiasm. It's impossible. Michael Jordan, one of the greatest basketball players to ever play the game, used to tape newspaper articles and quotes from opposing players that said negative things about him in his locker. Every time he got ready for practice and games, he would look over the negativity to psych himself up and light his competitive fires. If opposing players hadn't said anything negative, he would make stuff up. That's how much of a champion he was."

Champions make self-improvement a priority, and while they might work alongside coaches, trainers, and other teachers alone the way, are driven from within to succeed, not by the opinions of others. It's important to put a system of punishment and reward in place to get yourself to champion-status. Pact and FitLife are recent innovations in exercise motivation. By entering your fitness regimen into the system, these exercise trackers will punish you by taking money out of your account if you fail to exercise according to your initial plan.

Every time you step onto the field, whether it be the office or the playing field, you need to go in expecting that you're going to walk out having done your best and proven your worth as a champion. Visualize yourself winning and doing what will be necessary to be the best and believe that it will happen. Eliminate mental distractions when you're competing. When you're on the field, it's not the time to worry about your partner at home, whether or not you're going to be able to score concert tickets this weekend, or where you're going to party after the game. Focus on what needs to happen to win. To help with your confidence, you have to train effectively. When you're about to compete, it isn't the time to be wondering if you could have worked your reps in the gym better, or if you could have watched more tape of the opposing team. Train hard and you'll know that you're at your best."

      "content": "Leave it all on the field. When you compete, you need to compete like a champion, which means saving absolutely nothing of yourself in the tank. All your energy, all your heart, all your soul, all your competitive fire needs to explode from you during the course of the contest. You can't be left wondering if you could have chased down that shot along the baseline a little faster, or if you could have been a little more energetic in your presentation. A champion shouldn't have to wonder. All athletes and champions of the mind have to confront exhaustion at some point. Losers pack it in, close up the shop, and cash out. Champions dig deep and find a little bit more where it seems like there shouldn't be any. Work hard in your training regimen and you'll have enough endurance and stamina to see the competition through."

When the whistle blows and the game is over, an athlete can reveal the grace and humility of a champion, or the childish behavior of a loser, regardless of the outcome. If you win, treat it like business as usual. It's ok to celebrate, but you should act as if you've been there before. It shouldn't be a big surprise if you expected to win in the first place. Compliment the opposition and give credit where credit is due. If you lose, it's likely that you'll be feeling frustrated and annoyed. If you're dealing with a sore winner, too, it can make it a lot worse. Don't sling mud, make excuses, or throw a tantrum, though. Shake your head, take your licks, and look to the next contest.

We've all seen the gloating self-absorbed athlete bragging after making a game-winning play, forgetting the fact that teammates were there contributing the entire game. Winning champions share the credit and praise their fellow competitors, coaches, and teammates. Even if you're feeling particularly proud of what you accomplished on the field, find something to praise about others who competed. Staying humble and showing perspective is an absolutely essential part of being a great champion. We all like to think of ourselves and self-starters who are responsible for our own success, but try to widen perspective to see the bigger picture. Your success as a champion is dependent upon your teachers, your parents, even the people working the concessions stand, or driving the bus you use to commute are contributing to your success. Don't forget that, big shot."

Take on the burden of success and decide that it will be your fault if you don't come through as the champion. Put yourself in a position to win. If you don't come through, put your name on it and stand up to the blow-back like a champion. Only you can decide whether or not you're a success. It might be good enough for you to have made a personal best on the golf course, regardless of what Tiger Woods has to say about it. Never throw any of your teammates, coworkers, or fellow competitors \"under the bus.\" Don't call someone out for blameworthy activity, even if it's deserved. Doing so is classless, a sign of pettiness. Share in the blame, if something went wrong, and act like a champion."
