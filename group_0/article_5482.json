[2] X Research source Its opposite sides are equal in length, so the sides along its length are equal, and the sides along its width are equal as well. If one side of the rectangle is 10, for example, then the opposite side's length will also be 10. Also, every square is a rectangle, but not all rectangles are squares. So treat squares like rectangles in terms of finding its area."

You can use it to find the hypotenuse of a triangle, which is its longest side, or its length or width, which meet at a right angle. [9] X Research source Since a rectangle is comprised of four right angles, the diagonal that cuts through the shape will create a right triangle, so you can apply the Pythagorean theorem. The theorem is: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a and b are sides of the triangle and c is the hypotenuse, or longest side. [10] X Research source"

Use 6 cm for one side, use b for the other side, and take 10 cm as your hypotenuse. Now just substitute your known quantities into the Pythagorean theorem and solve. Here's how to do it: [11] X Research source Ex: 6^2 + b^2 = 10^2 36 + b^2 = 100 b^2 = 100 - 36 b^2 = 64 square root (b) = square root (64) b = 8 The length of the other side of the triangle, which is also the other side of the rectangle, is 8 cm."
