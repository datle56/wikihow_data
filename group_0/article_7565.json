The citation should also note the article number. [1] X Research source The citation would look like: Book title , article number. For example: The Federalist Papers , No. 51.

[4] X Research source For example: James Madison, Federalist No.10, in The Federalist Papers , ed. Clinton Rossiter (New York: New American Library, 1961), pg 77-84. In your full citation in footnotes, you need to note the editor of the article. The Federalist Papers were not published as a unified work. They were gathered together over time by various editors. Your footnotes should begin with “1” and follow numerically. They should be superscript at the end of the quoted sentence or phrase. Using a word processing program, the footnote should automatically also appear at the bottom left of the page. [5] X Research source"

You do not need to cite the paraphrased sentence or summary in the text. For example, if you are paraphrasing the first line from Federalist No. 1 by Alexander Hamilton, you may write: “In Federalist No. 10, James Madison talks about deliberating the new Constitution and how important the subject is to the state of the Union.” Though you have simply restated the first two lines of the article, you must still cite these lines as a footnote in your text. The footnote should have a full citation: James Madison, Federalist No.10, in The Federalist Papers , ed. Clinton Rossiter (New York: New American Library, 1961), pg 77-84."

But if you feel you need to use notes in your text to prevent plagiarism, APA style has two types of footnotes: [8] X Research source Content footnotes: these notes provide supplemental, or extra, information to your readers. Be brief and try to limit the footnote to one small paragraph. You should also point readers to information that is available in more detail elsewhere. For example: 1 See DeWeese (2000), especially Chapters 1 and 2, for an insightful analysis of Hamilton’s article. Copyright permission notes: If you quote more than 500 words of published material, or think you may be in violation of “Fair Use” copyright laws, you must get formal permission from the author(s). The other sources can appear in the reference list at the end of your paper or document. Follow the same formatting rules as the content footnote. Then, attach a copy of the permission letter to the document. Begin the copyright permission footnote with “Note”. The format is: Note: From Article Title by Author, Journal Title, Journal Number, page number. Copyright Date by Copyright Holder. Reprinted with permission. For example: Note: From The Federalist Papers: A Study by D. DeWeese, 2000, American Letters, 20, p. 122. Copyright 2000 by Flag Publishing. Reprinted with permission. For both types of footnotes, always insert the number in superscript at the end of the sentence, after the punctuation mark.

These are other publications your readers can consult for extra information on a particular topic. For example: 1 See DeWeese (2000), especially Chapter 1 and 2, for an insightful analysis of Hamilton’s article. Explanatory notes, or content notes.

While The Federalist Papers were published anonymously, three of the founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton, who became Secretary of the Treasury, John Jay, who became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and James Madison, who served in congress before becoming the fourth president were later revealed to be the authors of the articles. The Federalist Papers are legally established as important references to the creation of the Constitution. [11] X Research source"

Failure to cite the original source of a quote or a paraphrase of the original source is considered plagiarism. [12] X Research source Paraphrasing and summaries are restatements in your own words of written or spoken text. A paraphrase usually restates a portion of the text in a few sentences. A summary condenses larger chunks of text. When paraphrasing and summarizing, you must reword the information completely and not just substitute a few words from the original text. You must also be careful not to change the original meaning in the original text with your rewording. All three citation styles require you to cite all quotes and paraphrasing in text. However, each style cites paraphrasing in different ways."

      "content": "Don’t overuse citations of The Federalist Papers . This may draw criticism from legal experts who think that the influence of The Federalist Papers on the Constitution are not well founded, or a professor who wants to see you use more than one source for your paper. Some legal experts believe The Federalist Papers are self-contradictory or that they may not have persuaded the ratifiers of the Constitution at all. They also argue that The Federalist Papers were written to support the ratification of the Constitution, rather than to explain it and that they are an unreliable source for determining the original intent of the founding fathers because of the secrecy of the Constitutional Convention. All of these critiques of The Federalist Papers are valid. But none of them work against the articles in a significant way. So if you are going to make a claim about the original meaning of The Federalist Papers , take the counterarguments noted above into account."
