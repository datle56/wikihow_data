      "content": "Curl the front of the tongue down slightly to slide it under the sheet and then simultaneously curve the very tip of the tongue up to capture it and slide it back onto the tongue. Do this while the lower lip area acts to keep the sheet from moving forward. If it doesn't pop, it will form a half bubble sitting on your tongue. This will require some monkeying around to get right, but, like most directions, it sounds much harder or more complex than it actually is."

      "content": "Blow the bubble off the tongue very gently. Now, this is the most difficult part of this trick. you want to very gently push it onto your lower lip and then slowly out. It will take lots of practice. But, don't get tensed, you will slowly master it. You will likely have more that will pop than float out."
