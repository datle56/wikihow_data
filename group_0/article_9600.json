[2] X Research source It’s normal to show some narcissistic tendencies occasionally, and this doesn't necessarily indicate NPD. [3] X Research source For example, someone could struggle with conversational narcissism without meeting the full criteria for NPD. Conversational Narcissism on its own would not be enough to indicate that someone has NPD. A formal diagnosis of NPD requires multiple severe, frequent, and long-lasting symptoms.

      "content": "Conversational narcissism could be a sign of NPD, however. At least 5 NPD symptoms need to be present in order to meet the criteria for a formal diagnosis. These include an inflated sense of self-importance, a need for excessive admiration, and a lack of understanding for other people’s needs and feelings.

If you’re having a hard time with someone who's been diagnosed with NPD, check out this guide on how to deal with a narcissist.

[6] X Research source They’ll likely hog the floor, leaving little room for your input or contributions. If you’re only able to squeeze in an “Uh huh” here and there, rather than real, thoughtful responses, you’re likely dealing with a conversational narcissist. Pay attention to how much they're talking, and think about whether or not they're giving you time to respond. If it feels like they're monologuing and you’re just a supporting character, they might be a conversational narcissist."

      "content": "They aren’t encouraging your responses. Conversational narcissists underuse a tactic called the support-response, which encourages the other person in the conversation to talk. [7] X Research source Inviting you to give your opinion or asking about your own experiences are examples of support responses. If the person you’re talking to doesn’t encourage you to participate in the conversation, it could be a sign of conversational narcissism. Look out for the presence or absence of support responses. Here are some examples of what they might look like: “Have you ever experienced something similar?” “I’m not sure what to do about it. Do you have any advice?” “So that’s my opinion—what do you think?”"

The shift-response involves constantly steering the focus of a conversation back to oneself. [8] X Research source If you tell a story about your life, they’ll somehow find a way to relate it to their own experience. They might even interrupt you while you’re speaking, so they can get a hold of the reins and keep talking. Do they always find a way to “relate” to something you’re saying, even if they haven’t experienced it themselves? Do they use this to regain control of the conversation and get themselves talking again? If so, you're probably dealing with a conversational narcissist."

When you share a difficult experience you’ve been through, they say that they’ve survived something a lot tougher. If the person you’re talking to consistently one-ups you or puts you down, they’re showing signs of conversational narcissism. [9] X Research source Assess the ways your conversation partner responds to your statements. Do they ask you for more information and affirm your feelings? Or do they find a way to make it about themselves and belittle you? If the conversation is feeling like a competition, conversational narcissism might be to blame."

      "content": "They seem bored or disinterested when you’re talking. It’s common for conversational narcissists to glaze over when someone else speaks. [10] X Research source This is because they’re just waiting for their chance to start talking again, rather than truly ingesting what you’re saying. If someone consistently looks like they’re bored or zoning out when you’re speaking, this could be a sign of conversational narcissism. Study their body-language. Are they making eye contact, or looking off somewhere into the distance? Are they nodding and reacting to what you say, or are they wearing a blank expression?"

[11] X Research source This may feel a little awkward at first, as there will likely be a few seconds of talking over each other. Remember, conversational narcissists can be oblivious to their frustrating behavior, so it might take a few tries for them to get the hint. Try not to raise your voice or express anger or agitation. Instead, calmly finish speaking as if you haven’t heard the interruption. If you feel uncomfortable continuing without acknowledging the interruptor, say, “One second, I’m still finishing my story.” Then continue on."

You’re completely justified in calling them out. [12] X Research source If you’re talking to someone who consistently shows signs of conversational narcissism, talk to them about it confidently and directly. Use “I” statements to address the situation without making them feel attacked. [13] X Research source “I feel frustrated because I can’t get through the story I’m trying to tell. The interruptions make me feel like you don’t care about what I’m saying.” “I’m trying to contribute to the conversation, but I don’t feel like you’re interested when I’m talking.” “I’ve enjoyed hearing your perspective, but the conversation feels a little one-sided, and I’d like to share my perspective too.”"

Sometimes, in the middle of their monologue, a conversational narcissist might ask, “Am I talking too much?” If this happens, be honest and gently tell them that they are. [14] X Research source You might be tempted to excuse them to avoid any awkwardness, but at the end of the day, this doesn’t help either of you. They won’t know that they need to change their habits, and you’ll be stuck in a one-sided conversation. Remember, a healthy conversation is a two-way street, and you deserve to say your piece, too! [15] X Research source Here are some ways you can respond when they ask if they’re talking too much: “Thank you for asking!

Tell them you’ll end conversations in the future if they engage in frustrating behavior, like one-upping, belittling, or interrupting you. If you run into them in public, set a time-limit on your conversation. Tell them you only have 10 minutes to talk, and when the time is up, kindly (but firmly) tell them you have to go."

Remember, a conversational narcissist wants to keep talking, and they likely can’t regulate their own behavior. You might be tempted to show interest and give animated responses to be polite, but they’ll see this as a green flag to keep talking.

Remember, it’s okay to take care of your needs! If you're at a social gathering, excuse yourself and say that you’re going to say hello to someone else.

Remember, healthy conversation involves taking turns.
