      "content": "Capricorn is a Cardinal sign, and Taurus is a fixed sign. That’s a fancy way of saying that Capricorn is the first zodiac sign in a particular season (winter), while Taurus is the second/middle sign of a season (spring). Cardinal signs like to take the lead, while fixed signs tend to dig their heels in and stand their ground. [2] X Research source Many astrologers agree that cardinal signs are most compatible with other non-cardinal signs, while fixed signs are most compatible with other non-fixed signs—that’s good news for Caps and Tauruses!

      "title": "Capricorn and Taurus approach sex at the same speed.",
      "content": "Capricorn and Taurus approach sex at the same speed. As earth signs, Capricorn and Taurus lack the wild sexual passion and experimental energy you might see in a fiery sign, like Leo, Aries, or Sagittarius. Still, Capricorns and Tauruses are both very focused on satisfying their needs. [4] X Research source Capricorn isn’t usually a “mushy” sign. Don’t be expecting a lot of affectionate pillow talk when all is said and done! Keep in mind that Taurus is more of a sensual , touchy-feely sign rather than a sexual one. They love the simple pleasure that comes from making love, but they definitely aren’t as sexual as other signs on the zodiac."

      "content": "Capricorn and Taurus are tuned into the same emotional wavelength. Ruled by the element of earth, both of these signs are as steady and grounded as they come, and have a lot of support to offer one another. The unwavering sense of trust that both signs have for each other makes for a truly unbreakable relationship. Taurus will be happy to lend a listening ear after Capricorn has a tough day at work. If Taurus gets stuck on the side of the road with a flat, Cap will be there in a jiffy to help out."

      "title": "Capricorn and Taurus inspire each other to learn and grow more.",
      "content": "Capricorn and Taurus inspire each other to learn and grow more. Capricorn approaches life in an extremely practical, clear-cut way, and may not have as much emotional intelligence as the bull. Thankfully, Taurus is more than willing to teach them! Capricorns are still teachers in their own right, though, and often inspire Tauruses to learn more about the world around them. [5] X Research source Taurus also approaches life in a very practical way. This definitely helps with compatibility!"

      "title": "Capricorn and Taurus often have different priorities.",
      "content": "Capricorn and Taurus often have different priorities. Practical, focused Capricorn is about as driven as they come and likes planning ahead for all types of situations. Taurus, on the other hand, is a fixed, stubborn sign—you can’t get them to move unless they really want to. This could lead to some frustrating situations and difficult conversations if both signs aren’t willing to meet in the middle. Compatibility Tip: Look for opportunities to compromise whenever you can. Let’s say that Capricorn is hoping to clean out the garage on Saturday morning, while Taurus is hoping to get a few extra hours of shut-eye. Taurus could agree to help Capricorn after they wake up and have something to eat. Reader Poll: We asked 824 wikiHow readers what the most negative traits in Taureans are, and 56% of them said stubbornness and resistance to change. [Take Poll] So, Taurus needs to learn to be a tiny bit flexible."

Capricorn is constantly scanning the horizon and preparing for every possible circumstance, while Taurus unabashedly lives in the moment.

Taurus might pick out their outfit the night before, while Capricorn might make impulsive plans over the weekend."
