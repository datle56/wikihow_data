      "content": "A glitching remote can cause the blinking white light on your Apple TV. To find out if this is the case for you, take your Apple TV remote into a different room, far away from the Apple TV. The goal is to make sure your remote cannot make contact with the Apple TV. You'll also want to be far away from all Apple TVs in your house, because if the remote is the culprit, it will cause the same symptoms in a different Apple TV. Leave the remote in the other room and check on your Apple TV. If the light on your Apple TV stops flashing: The problem is the remote, and you will need to replace it. For now, use your iPhone or iPad's built-in Apple TV remote to control your Apple TV, and don't bring the remote close to the Apple TV again. If the Apple TV is still under warranty, you should be able to get a free replacement from Apple . Some people have had success resetting the remote, but it's tricky—you'll need to be somewhat near the Apple TV to reset the remote, but block enough of the signal to prevent the Apple TV from freaking out again. To try it, take the remote back into the room with the Apple TV, but don't aim it at the TV. Instead, press the front of the remote against your body to block the signal, and press and hold the TV and Volume Down buttons at the same time for about 10 seconds. If you see \"Remote Disconnected\" on the TV, try pairing the remote again to see if you’ve fixed the problem. Otherwise, put the remote into a drawer in another room and get a replacement. If the light is still blinking: The remote is not the problem. Continue to cold-restarting your Apple TV ."

Connect a USB-C cable (Apple TV HD models) or Micro-USB cable (3rd Generation) to the port on the back of your Apple TV. Connect the other end of the cable to your PC or Mac's USB port.
