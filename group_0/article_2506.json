      "content": "Melt your batik wax. Batik wax comes in a brick that needs to be melted in either an electric wax pot or a double boiler. Use caution with hot wax. Do not heat it above 240° as it could begin to emit fumes or even catch fire. It is not recommended that you heat the wax on the stovetop. Wax pots and double boilers heat the wax slowly and at a lower heat."

      "content": "Stretch your fabric on an embroidery hoop. [2] X Research source The hoop will keep the fabric taught and stable, allowing you to apply wax with greater precision. If you are applying designs to large swaths of fabric, you can lay newsprint or cardboard on your work surface without stretching it on a hoop. The wax will penetrate through the fabric, so a protective surface underneath is highly recommended."

      "content": "Begin to apply the wax with your tools. [3] X Research source Various tools will yield different line qualities, so some experimentation beforehand is recommended. [4] X Research source Use a single-spouted tjanting tool to draw thin lines and designs. It is a standard tool that is very versatile and comes in a variety of spout sizes. A double-spouted tjanting tool creates parallel lines and can also be used in filling larger areas. Brushes can also be used to cover large areas. They can be used traditionally, in broad strokes, or as a stippling tool for a dot pattern. Use stamps for the application of uniform shapes. Stamps can be made of anything that can take the heat of the wax. Try carving a potato into a shape, or using the end of a celery stalk to stamp out half circles."

      "title": "Get ready to tub-dye your fabric.",
      "content": "Get ready to tub-dye your fabric. When considering which dye colors to use, it is recommended that you begin with the lightest colors first (like yellow) and then move toward darker colors. [5] X Research source Wash your fabric in Synthrapol. Dissolve your dye by following the instructions on the package. Some dyes (like reds) are harder to dissolve than others. Add in the appropriate amount of non-iodized salt. For a 1/2 pound of dry fabric, add 1 1/2 cups of salt. For a pound of fabric, use 3 cups of salt. Add in your damp fabric. Stir gently, but frequently for 20 minutes. Mix up your soda ash. Soda ash, or sodium carbonate, is used to bond the dye to the cellulose in fiber. Dissolve the ash in warm water and add it into the tub slowly (over the course of 15 minutes), being careful not to dump it directly onto the fabric (which could cause discoloration). For each 1/2 pound of dry fabric, add in 1/6 cups of salt. For a pound of fabric, use 1/3 cup of salt. Stir gently, but frequently for another 30 minutes. Rinse your fabric and wash out excess dye. Run cool water over your fabric until it runs clear. Then wash it in hot water using Synthrapol. With some darker colors, like red or brown, a second washing may be necessary to remove all excess dye. Allow the fabric to dry."

      "content": "Remove the wax. When you are done with all the color dyeing, you may remove the wax in one of two ways: [6] X Research source Boil the wax out. Fill a pot large enough to hold your fabric with water and a few drops of Synthrapol. Once the water begins to boil, add in your fabric and weigh it down with a rock to keep the wax (which will be floating at the top) from re-bonding with the fabric. After a few minutes, the wax will pull out of the fabric. After all the wax appears to be out of the fabric, allow the pot to cool completely, and peel the wax layer from the top of the pot. Iron the wax out. Place the fabric between two sheets of absorbent paper and run the iron over the sandwiched fabric. The wax can leave behind a residue, so use care to ensure the wax is removed. Periodically changing out the papers can aid in wax removal."

Use paint brushes to cover larger areas with the medium. Allow the medium to dry for approximately 30 minutes, though the exact dry time depends on how thickly the medium was applied. Consider using stamps dipped in the medium to create a repeat pattern. You can use a stencil by placing it down on the fabric and dabbing the medium around it with a foam brush."

The rubber bands should be small enough to maintain good tension, but long enough to as to avoid tearing the fabric. You can link two rubber bands together to create longer ones if your frame is much larger than the piece of silk. The goal is to create a taut surface on which to paint. The surface should be taut, but should not be too tight that it begins to tear."

Allow the resist to dry completely before moving on to color. Depending on preference, two types of resists work well for silk painting: Rubber-based resists, or guttae, are similar in consistency to rubber cement and can be diluted to a thin consistency useful for drawing finer lines. After the color has been set, they are removed by dry-cleaning the finished fabric. The downside of this resist is the fumes it produces. It is recommended that you use a respirator in a well-ventilated area when applying rubber-based gutta. Water soluble resists are non-toxic, odorless, and wash away in warm water. These resists work well in conjunction with silk paints (as opposed to dyes), which are heat set with heat. The downside to this resist is that it's not as free-flowing as other guttae, and fine details are harder to achieve."

There are two options when it comes to color: Silk paints are pigment-based products that color the surface of the fabric, but do not penetrate the fabric's fiber. These colors can be used on a wide variety of fabrics (including synthetics) and are set with a dry iron Silk dyes color fabric by forming a bond with the fibers in the fabric. These are a wonderful choice if you do not want to diminish the natural luster of silk. Colors are light-fast and washable."

[13] X Research source If you used silk dyes, after allowing the color to dry for 24 hours, rinse the fabric until the water runs clear. Add a couple of drops of light detergent or dish soap to a bucket or tub and wash the silk. Rinse again with cool water, and hang to dry. When the silk is almost dry, apply a dry iron heated to the \"silk\" setting."
