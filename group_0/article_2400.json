Look for a younger cheese, or for something that says \"double cream\" on the label; avoid anything that says \"triple cream,\" as it may end up too runny when baked. [2] X Research source If your cheese came wrapped in paper or plastic, you will need to remove the wrapper and discard it. Leave the white rind on the cheese. Baked brie is usually eaten by cutting a bit off with a knife and spreading the softened cheese over a cracker. You can make a dip-able baked brie by cutting the top part of the rind off. Leave the sides and bottom of the rind intact; they will hold the cheese together while you bake it."

You can also cut the cheese in half, so that you end up with two thin circles. Spread your honey (and other ingredients if you wish) on top of the bottom circle. Then, place the top circle back down on it—just like making a sandwich. Instead of using honey, you can also use maple syrup, agave nectar, fruit jam, or fig spread."

If you cut your brie in half, you can place these toppings in between the two slices with the honey. Place the toppings over the honey. Here are some suggestions and combinations: A few sprigs of fresh thyme and a handful of chopped walnuts. A few sprigs of fresh rosemary and a handful of chopped walnuts. Before you place the brie into the oven, add a few sprigs of thyme. After you take the brie out of the oven, top it with some quartered figs. [3] X Research source Substitute the honey for maple syrup instead, then add brown sugar, a handful of chopped pecans, and a handful of dried cranberries. [4] X Research source"

[7] X Research source Here are some suggestions for the filling. To make a simple, sweet filling, you will need, raspberry jam or other fruit jam, brown sugar and ¼ cup (56.25 milliliters) maple syrup. [8] X Research source To make a sweet and savory brie, you will need 2 tablespoons chopped pecans, ¼ cup dried cranberries (30 grams), and 2 tablespoons honey. [9] X Research source You can also stuff your brie instead. Slice the brie in half, creating two disks. Press some red, sliced, seedless grapes down onto the cheesy side of the bottom disk. Add 1 teaspoon of fresh, minced thyme, and ½ teaspoon of fresh, minced rosemary on top of the grapes. Put the top disk down onto the grapes and press down lightly, creating a sandwich. Place the brie down onto the pastry sheet. [10] X Research source Slice the brie in half and spread a fruit jam over one of the halves. Put the two halves back together and place them back onto the pastry sheet."

If you accidentally cut too much of the pastry off and don't have enough pastry left to cover the brie, do not stretch it. Instead, use the scraps left over from cutting the pastry to patch up the hole. To help the steam escape during baking, consider poking holes into the top of the pastry using a fork.
