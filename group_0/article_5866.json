In order to keep you from running into the dogs when you are too weak to fight them, the Legendary Dogs will not enter the game until you have progressed to the end of the game. You will only be able to capture one dog per game, and that depends on the Pokémon you started with: Squirtle starters can capture lightning dog Raikou. Bulbasaur starters can capture fire dog Entei. Charmander starters can capture water dog Suicune. [1] X Research source"

You can only fight the Elite Four after collecting every gym badge. You will need several Pokémon around Level 50 to beat the Elite Four, and these Pokémon should be strong enough to capture the dogs too. The Elite 4 covers a wide variety of Pokémon, and each of the 4 trainers has a specialty you need to counter: Lorelei uses Ice and Water Pokémon. Counter with Fire, Fighting, Grass, and Electric Pokémon. Bruno uses Fighting and Rock Pokémon. Counter with Flying, Psychic, Fighting, Steel, Grass, and Water Pokémon. Agatha uses Poison Pokémon. Counter with Psychic and Ground Pokémon. Lance uses Dragon Pokémon. Counter with Electric, Dragon, and Ice Pokémon."

This makes it much easier to find it again if you cannot capture it the first time. Open your Pokédex, scroll down to the dog, and check the \"Area\" section to find it. [7] X Research source If you accidentally KO the dog it will not appear again later in the game. Remember, however, that as soon as you try to go to the dog's current location it will move.

The dogs, however, do not want to be caught, and will try to run from your the moment you encounter them. This makes them slippery and difficult to get a hold of permanently. Any damage you do to a dog will last. If you run into them once and bring them to half health before they run, they will still be at half health the next time you see them. [8] X Research source"

The go first, your speed rating needs to be higher than the dog's: Suicune has a speed rating of 85. Entei has a speed rating of 100. Raikou has a speed rating of 115. [9] X Research source"

You can put the animal back to sleep or paralyze it to make capturing even easier. You will likely need 50 or more Ultra Balls to succeed. You would rather have them, after all, than run out of them when you need them. Timer Balls, which gain power the longer the battle goes on, reach their peak performance after 25 turns. Use your Ultra Balls to weaken the Pokémon, then launch your Timer Balls later in the battle to use them effectively."

Once you've met the dog, forget about trapping it or lowering its health -- immediately throw the Master Ball. This is a guaranteed method of catching your legendary dog. Remember, however, that you only get one Master Ball in the game. That said, this is one of the perfect places to use it."
