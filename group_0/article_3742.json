      "title": "Go to auditions.",
      "content": "Go to auditions. What new actors need more than anything is experience. You'll probably have to start off by doing free work, but you'll gain experience and be able to add each role to your resume. For example, if a local car dealership needs a commercial, volunteer to be in it. Go to local colleges and audition for their plays or student films. Doing these free projects will build your resume and get you into the habit of auditioning and performing. There is no better way to learn how to act than to actually act. Actors typically go on hundreds of auditions and only get called back for a few. When you're new to acting, the auditions can be bigger learning experiences than actually getting cast for the role. Embrace the learning experience of each audition and ask for feedback from the casting directors. [1] X Research source For auditions, you should have two rock-solid, contrasting monologues that aren't frequently performed. This means steering clear of monologues that pop up when you Google \"best monologues.\" [2] X Expert Source Jim Jarrett Acting Teacher Expert Interview. 28 April 2020. Look online for casting calls. There are a few reputable casting websites for TV, film, commercials, etc – backstage.com and projectcasting.com to name a few. There are also theater auditions on backstage.com. Look on your local theater websites for casting calls as well as Craigslist."

      "content": "Say yes to almost every role. As a new actor, it's important that you get experience, take on diverse roles, and build your resume. Even if a certain character is different from the roles you typically play, accepting the role will add range to your resume. This will show casting directors that you are versatile, easy to work with, and excited about being involved in different types of projects. If you are cast for a role that completely goes against your morals or values, then you don't have to take it. It is perfectly okay to turn down roles that make you feel uncomfortable. As your career progresses and your resume begins to come together, you can start to be more picky with the roles you play and the jobs you accept. Until then, get as much work as possible!

      "content": "Learn some special skills. If you're an actor with no experience, auditioning against seasoned professionals can be challenging and intimidating. This is where special skills can come in handy. Developing skills such as horseback riding, speaking multiple languages, playing tennis, or singing could end up winning you a role over another actor. You never know when a character will come along that requires one of your special skills, so work hard on developing new skills all of the time."

      "content": "Take acting classes. If you want to start acting, start by asking yourself a simple question. Is acting a hobby or a career? It is easier to start when you know where you want to go. (You don't need an entire plan, just an overall idea). Decide what type of acting you'd like to study first – theater, musicals, improv, television, film, etc. – and research teachers and classes in your area. Commit yourself to that class for at least six months, give yourself a chance to warm up to it. If you love it, then continue. After you've completed your first class, it's recommended to take classes in other areas to see if you are interested in another type of acting. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Go to plays and watch films. Although you should take classes and get real-life experience, you can also learn a great deal about acting by simply curling up on the couch for movie night! Study your favorite films to learn about important acting techniques – such as character development, physicality, diction, and reacting – from your favorite on-screen actors and actresses. Going to plays is another great way to study stage actors and actresses. Absorb everything you see! [7] X Research source If you want to be in film or commercials, these are the acting methods you should study. Pick your favorite commercials or movie scenes and try to reenact them. If you want to get involved with theater or musicals, then study plays and musicals. Observe what the actors do right and what they can improve upon.

They may even be able to give you a few pointers or point you to some auditions. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Don't move to a major market right away. Being an actor in a major city like LA or New York City is hard enough for performers with decades of training and experience. If you're an actor with no experience, it's best to start off in your hometown. Nearly every town has a local theater company, and local theater companies are the perfect place to start. You can also try working with student or local filmmakers if you're more interested in movies and television. If your hometown happens to be a major city, that's fine! Focus your auditions in the community theater scene or the independent film scene. There are still small community theaters in big cities that will allow you to get some great experience. If you've decided you want to become a serious actor, moving to a major city would be the smart move for you to get the best training. Wait to make this move until you've decided you want to take acting to the next step. Make sure you ask yourself why you are willing to commit fully to being actor, and what you are willing to sacrifice over how long a period of time to get there.

Local community theatres are always looking for volunteers to help with props, sets, costumes, etc. Being a volunteer will allow you to study actors in rehearsal, will help get you familiar with the acting world, and will introduce you to people in the industry. Next time the company holds auditions, do a monologue! You already know everyone in the room, so it's the perfect place to start auditioning. They'll most likely give you some good feedback as well.

Get a few headshots taken so that you have a variety to use for different auditions. Keep them professional, but don't be afraid to show a little personality. [11] X Research source Headshots are needed for any type of acting; film, commercials, plays, musicals, etc. While it may be tempting to just have a friend take your headshot, anything more competitive than small commercial work will require something professional.

Although it's admirable to have range as an actor, it's still important to identify your \"type.\" We are all born with a certain look, and there's no denying what you actually look like. It’s up to actors to identify that look, harness it, and use it to your advantage. For example, are you the smart, clean-cut young lawyer, or the early thirties slacker guy? Are you the popular girl or the art nerd? Knowing your type can help guide you to certain auditions and can help you to develop your character strengths.

Find a few who you think would be a good fit for you, and submit your headshots and resume with a cover letter explaining that you're looking for a new agent. It can be hard to secure an agent, but if you work on networking and building your resume, it will be a bit easier. [18] X Expert Source Melessa Sargent Film Producer Expert Interview. 14 August 2019. Ask your actor friends, teachers, or anyone else you know in the industry for some recommendations of good agents. If they have any personal connections with good agents, ask them if they'd be able to refer you to them. Agents get tons of headshots and resumes sent to them daily, so don't be upset if you don't hear back. You should submit yourself to many different agents or agencies, as this will increase your chances of getting a response. If no agents get back to you, consider revamping your resume and getting new headshots taken. [19] X Research source"
