      "title": "Begin with internet auctions.",
      "content": "Begin with internet auctions. Internet auctions are a great way to start coin dealing because they don’t require a huge inventory. Choose a few coins from your inventory that you want to sell and set up an internet auction on a website like eBay. Internet auctions can also help you build a reputation for having good inventory without the financial investment that an actual shop will take. You'll need to set up a seller's account on whatever website you use, and you might also want to set up a PayPal account to make getting paid for the coins easier. Don't leave your coins up for too long - get a good price but don't leave your inventory out there for too long."

The requirements for renting a table at a weekend show will vary from show to show. Search for shows happening near you, and then contact the show organizers to find out the details of renting a table. Renting a table will cost some money, but it's cheaper than setting up a whole store. Don't forget display cases for your coins!"
