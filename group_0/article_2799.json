It’s no wonder why you might feel a little stressed when someone is being mean to you. However, if your goal is to be nice to them, try not to yell, and don’t snap at them when you’re talking.

Slowly let it out through your mouth and try to calm your body and your mind.

      "content": "Listening is a good way to calm someone down and make them feel heard. Try not to brush them off right away, even if they’re being rude. Even mean people have points to make sometimes, they just might not know how to say it nicely. Try to interpret their words as best you can instead of ignoring them outright. [3] X Research source You can try saying something like, “So what you’re saying is…” to make sure you understand what they mean."

If you can put yourself in their shoes, you might be able to have a little more compassion and understanding for them, which can lead to being nicer. [5] X Research source You might never fully understand mean people, and that’s okay. Give them the benefit of the doubt to maintain your sanity and make the world seem a little more kind."

      "content": "Sometimes, we take things the wrong way. If you’re chatting with a friend or coworker and they say something mean, pause and ask yourself if you’re misinterpreting them. Their tone of voice or their words might have sounded mean in the moment, but it could be that they didn’t intend to sound that way. [6] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For instance, maybe a friend says, “You’re so weird.” Are they actually being mean, or are they calling you weird as a term of endearment? Or, maybe a colleague tells you, “You need to have those reports done by the end of the day.” They might have sounded mean to you, but actually, they were just telling you the facts so that you don’t get in trouble."

If you know you’re going to be interacting with someone who’s rude, ask a few friends or coworkers to stay beside you while you do it. Hopefully, they can help you ward off mean comments and exit the situation as fast as possible. You won’t always have the chance to bring a buddy along when you encounter a rude person, but when you can, it really helps!"

But, I’m going to be the bigger person and just laugh that one off.” If a stranger was rude to you, just remember that's all they are—a stranger. Their words and actions have no bearing on your life.

Or, think about how much effort it must take them to find the negative in every situation. If you can laugh it off a little, you can let their comments roll off your back. [9] X Research source You can even respond to their mean comments with something funny! For instance, if they say something like, “I hate that shirt you’re wearing,” you might say, “Wow, I didn’t know you were so involved in the fashion world. Got any more tips for me?”"

      "content": "Being nice to a mean person can be draining. If you’re finding it too hard to kill them with kindness, you can always try to distance yourself from them as much as possible. Keep your interactions short and walk away as soon as you can so that you don’t have to talk to them often. Just try not to stoop down to their level and start making mean comments back. This probably won’t make you feel any better, and it can make your relationship with this person much worse."
