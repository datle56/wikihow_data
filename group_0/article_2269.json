      "content": "Buy a basal thermometer so you can get a precise temperature reading. Your basal body temperature is your lowest temperature over a period of 24 hours. Your body experiences a slight rise in temperature just after ovulation, and monitoring your basal body temperature over time can help indicate when your peak fertility window is about to begin. Basal body thermometers look basically the same as regular thermometers, but they give more precise readings. They’re available in drugstores and should come with a chart to help you track your temperature every day. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source A regular thermometer that you might use to check a fever won’t give you exact enough measurements to be helpful. A basal body thermometer measures your temperature’s changes in small increments."

      "content": "Take your basal body temperature at the same time every morning. The most accurate way to track your temperature is to take it right when you wake up before you get out of bed and start moving around. Keep the thermometer by your bed and make it a habit to take your temperature first thing in the morning. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Most basal body thermometers give you the option of taking your temperature in your mouth or your vagina. Usually, taking your vaginal temperature will give you the most accurate reading from day to day. Whichever way you choose, do it the same way every day to ensure your readings are as consistent as possible. Follow the instructions that came with your thermometer. Generally, you’ll turn on the thermometer and insert it in your vagina or mouth. When you hear it beep, after about 30-60 seconds, remove the thermometer and check the temperature reading. Make sure to sanitize your thermometer after each use. Either wash it with soap and water or wipe it down with a disinfectant."

Make sure to record the date as well as the exact temperature so you have the best data to help you understand your fertility window better. Period Tracker, Flo, Eve, Cycles, Ovia, and other apps help you track your period and give you space to write down other daily details, like your temperature, mood, and other symptoms."

      "content": "Look for a small spike in temperature that lasts 3 days. After you ovulate, your temperature will increase a little bit for about 3-4 days. This is a small change, which is why it’s so important to have the most precise temperature readings. Look for an increase of about 0.4-1 degree Fahrenheit (0.7-1.8 degrees Celsius). Chances are, your fertility window has ended.

Especially when used along with other tracking methods, it can be a very accurate indicator of fertility so you know when to abstain from sex."

      "content": "Keep track for a minimum of 3 months to understand your body’s pattern. Until you’ve taken your temperature consistently for a few months, you shouldn’t rely on this method for pregnancy prevention. If your cycle is regular, 3 months’ worth of data should be enough to help you predict your fertility window in the following months. If your cycle tends to be irregular, you may need to take your temperature for 6 months or more before you can rely on the patterns that emerge. Illness, stress, alcohol, lack of sleep, and other factors can also affect your body temperature. That’s why it’s a good idea to use this method with other tracking methods to back yourself up in case your temperature pattern is thrown off for some reason. Accurate data is super important to this method. Be consistent with taking your temperature every single day and keeping track of your findings. If you miss a few days each month, it could really throw off your understanding of your body and make it less likely to effectively prevent pregnancy."

After 3 or more months of tracking your temperature every day, you can use your findings to try to anticipate when you’ll ovulate next. For the most effective results, use your basal temperature along with tracking your cycle and observing your cervical mucus. Interpret the data in this way: [6] X Research source Look at your chart and find the day when your regular spike in temperature happens each month. On a calendar, mark the 2 or 3 days before this temperature spike as the days when you’re likely to ovulate. Remember, your temperature doesn’t increase until 2-3 days after ovulation. Avoid having unprotected sex for at least 5 days before ovulation is supposed to begin, up through ovulation day."

By checking it every day, you can use the patterns you find to predict when your body is fertile.

      "content": "Observe your mucus until it begins to get thin and stretchy. Every day as you check your mucus, look at it and press it to your thumb to check its texture. As your hormones fluctuate, the characteristics of the mucus will change, too. During the days following your period, you may have no discharge, then slightly cloudy or creamy discharge. Once it takes on the consistency of egg whites, you’ll be at peak-fertility level and have a high chance on getting pregnant. When you’re most fertile, the discharge may even stretch between your fingers without breaking. Ovulation occurs on or after the last day this mucus is produced. Keep in mind that you can still get pregnant during the 5 or so days before you ovulate, so even if your discharge doesn’t quite have an egg-white texture yet, you are still somewhat fertile."

Here are some examples of detailed entries you might write: [9] X Research source 4/22: Mucus is tacky and white. 4/26: Mucus is whitish and runny, like egg whites. 4/31: Period started; heavy flow."

You’re most fertile when your mucus has the consistency of stretchy egg whites, but err on the safe side by avoiding sex for a few days before and after your mucus takes on these qualities. After tracking your patterns for a few months, you’ll start to better predict when you’ll be fertile each month. If you’re tracking your basal body temperature, compare the data. Your mucus will probably turn stretchy and wet several days before your body temperature spikes. Ovulation typically happens between the change in mucus and your temperature spike."

Your fertility window is between those 2 numbers of each cycle. For example: [12] X Research source If your shortest cycle was 26 days, 26-18=8. If your longest cycle was 30 days, 30-11=19. This means your fertility window is between the 8th and 19th of each monthly cycle. The 5 days preceding ovulation and the 24 hours of ovulation are your most fertile."
