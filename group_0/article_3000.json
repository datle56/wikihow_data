TPIR tickets are open to nearly everyone, but there are a few restrictions listed at the beginning of the online ticket application. To qualify for tickets, you can’t : Be under 18 years old (barring special episodes with younger contestants). Have been a contestant (not just an audience member) on TPIR in the past 10 years. Have been a contestant on more than 4 other TV game shows in the past 10 years. Be a contestant on any other TV game show that will air in the next year. Be a candidate for public office for at least 1 year after the application date. Be (or be an immediate relative of) an employee of CBS, TPIR’s production companies, or TPIR’s product sponsors. Be unvaccinated against COVID-19 (as of the 2022-23 season)."

      "content": "Provide personal and personality info on the application. As expected, you’ll have to provide some basic info, like your name, age, address, email, phone number, and dates when you’ll be in the Los Angeles area. Additionally, you’ll need to upload a photo and answer some personality questions like “What is something about yourself that no one would ever know by looking at you?” Think of this as the beginning of your interview to get called on down as a contestant! When answering the question “Describe your personality,” for example, come up with a response that will appeal to the producers who choose contestants. Words like “bubbly,” “fun-loving,” “enthusiastic,” and “positive” are better choices than “shy” or “quiet.” Think of the personality traits that come to mind when you see contestants on the show. While you should be 100% honest with your personal info, feel free to embellish your personality answers a bit—be truthful, but with the most fun version of the truth!"

Eventually, after several screens of forms, check boxes, and questions, you’ll be able to submit your request for a ticket on the date you choose. When approved, print out the ticket to bring with you on the day of the show taping you’ve selected. Note: If you’re given a “Priority Ticket,” you’re guaranteed entry on the chosen date. If you get a “Line Voucher,” you can wait in the first-come, first-served line on the day of taping (and aren’t guaranteed entry)."

Clothes with bright, bold colors or highly-patterned designs tend not to look as good on camera, so stick with muted colors to improve your chances of being selected as a contestant. Also, avoid wearing clothes with snarky or profane slogans—stick with fun, family-friendly options. [1] X Research source You’re also prohibited from wearing clothes with visible corporate logos, and may not be allowed in the studio with a company-branded shirt on. Lots of audience members wear slogan shirts, so feel free to come up with something fun and positive yourself. If you love Drew Carey, let him know!"

      "content": "Arrive at the studio 2+ hours before the doors open. Head to the Bob Barker Studio at Television City, 7800 Beverly Boulevard, Los Angeles, located at the intersection of Beverly Blvd. and Fairfax Ave. To ensure the venue is filled, TPIR (like all game shows) overbooks its audience, meaning not everyone with a “Line Voucher” ticket gets in. Getting there early greatly improves your chances of success! You’re supposed to be guaranteed entry if you have a “Priority Ticket,” but don’t risk it by showing up at the last minute. Play it safe and come at least 1-2 hours early. There’s paid parking available on the street or in a nearby garage. Make sure to plan for the possibility of congested traffic so that you can get to the studio as early as possible."

      "content": "Smile and make friendly conversation while you wait in line. As you stand in the queue to get into the studio, production assistants will circulate through the line, asking questions, possibly handing out forms or surveys, and generally just observing people. From this point onward, assume that someone with the power to choose you as a contestant is always watching. Be positive , show off your funnyside , and aim to be super enthusiastic —in other words, the kind of person they want to “come on down!” Get to know the people around you in line and have fun, positive interactions with them. Treat them like fellow TPIR super-fans, not competitors. Remember that, even when they’re not interacting with you directly, the producers are watching for signs of your true personality traits."

      "content": "Answer questions clearly when a producer interviews you. The producers interview everyone in line once the studio lot doors open. You'll be asked your name, where you're from, and your occupation. Think of it as a super-fun “job interview” and answer the questions sincerely and eagerly, with a touch of humor. Your answers play a big role in the producers’ initial determination of who will appear on the show. [3] X Research source Enunciate your words and speak up . Those in line around you will likely be talking or even cheering. Make sure the producer can hear every word you say. Don’t ramble. If you ramble on when asked a simple question, the producers are likely to think you’d do that on-air when Drew Carey asked you a question."

      "content": "Match the energy of the producer with your answer. Unless you’re first in line, watch the producer’s body language and listen for their tone as they interview other contestants. Try to match their excitement and enthusiasm without exceeding it. The producers are looking for just the right amount of energy, so mimic them. [4] X Research source For example, if the producer speaks at a certain volume, match it. If they move their hands while talking, don’t be afraid to move yours. If, for whatever reason, the producer isn’t showing any energy, don’t try to match them. Instead, answer as if you did receive a contestant slot, and Drew Carey was asking you a question on set. Keep past contestants in mind."

Being authentic is key. Also, sharing a sob story with the producers is highly unlikely to move them. If they think you may break down in tears on stage, you’ll probably lose your shot. [5] X Research source The producers are prohibited from accepting even a business card, so don’t give them anything that could be perceived as a bribe."

[7] X Research source While you can request tickets as often as you like, showing up to repeated tapings, or radically changing your appearance or personality for each attempt, will hurt your chances of ever being selected."
