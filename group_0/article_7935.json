      "content": "Mix 1 drop of dish detergent with 1 c (240 mL) of water to clean dust off leaves. Squeeze 1 drop of a mild liquid dish detergent into 1 c (240 mL) of water. Stir or shake the mixture to mix the soap and water. [1] X Research source This solution works well when your main goal is to clean dust, dirt, or grime off your orchid’s leaves. If you have a hard water supply, using a water-based cleaning solution can leave mineral deposits behind on the leaves. If this is the case, try a different method to clean the leaves or make this solution using distilled water instead of tap water. Examine your orchid’s leaves at least once a week for dust, mineral deposits, and signs of pests. Removing dust, mineral deposits, and other grime from the leaves lets them breathe and absorb moisture better, so your orchid will be healthier and happier with regular leaf cleanings."

      "content": "Use a solution of 1 part lemon juice to 1 part water to remove mineral deposits. Combine tap water and lemon juice in a 50/50 ratio. Mix the juice and water up well to combine the liquids. You can use lime juice instead of lemon juice to make this solution. The acidity in a citrus-based cleaning solution works to clean off mineral deposits left behind by hard water from cleaning or watering with tap water. Citrus also acts as a natural insect repellent."
