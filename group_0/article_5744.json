Knights can jump over other pieces blocking their way, but a queen cannot. [1] X Research source Queens and knights are both able to “fork” 2 or more pieces, which means they have the potential to attack your opponent on 2 or more squares at the same time."

If the queen lands on a square with an enemy piece, that piece is captured. [2] X Research source Your queen is the most powerful piece in the game, so you should protect it from getting captured as much as you can. If there’s one of your opponent’s pieces on the square where you end your movement, capture it and remove it from the board."

      "content": "Knights move through 3 squares on the board. Knights (or horses) have a unique L-shaped movement. First, move the knight 2 squares in one direction, and then make a right-angle turn to move 1 more space. Knights are able to jump over friendly and enemy pieces that are blocking the way between their start and end squares. A knight always lands on a square that’s the opposite color of the one it started on. If an enemy piece is on the square where a knight ends its movement, that piece is captured and removed from the board. The knight is the only piece that can jump in chess, so try to keep them on the board as long as you can when you’re playing a game."
