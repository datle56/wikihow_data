      "title": "Listen to your parents.",
      "content": "Listen to your parents. The best thing you can do to be a good boy at home is to listen to what your parents tell you to do. If they ask you to help out, to turn down your music, or to join them for dinner with your aunt and uncle, then you should do as they say as much as possible. Of course, if their demands are completely unreasonable, then you should have a nice, open conversation with them, but as a rule of thumb, you can be a good boy and make your parents happy by listening to what they tell you to do. [1] X Research source If your grandparents or other adults live in your home, then you should listen to them, too. When your parents are talking to you, make sure you look them in the eye and that you put away your phone. Make them see that you really care. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Help out around the house.",
      "content": "Help out around the house. If you want to be a good boy, then you should help clean up messes instead of creating them. Work to clean up after yourself, do your own laundry, and help your parents with daily tasks like throwing out the trash, taking the dog for a walk, wiping down the kitchen table, or anything else that you can do to lighten the load. If you have required chores, then you should do them without grumbling and even go above and beyond when it comes to housework. You shouldn’t have to ask if you need to help or what you can do. Instead, be observant and look around to see what really needs to be cleaned up or fixed, from a sink of overflowing dishes to a hamper of clean laundry that needs to be folded."

    {
      "title": "Respect your siblings.",
      "content": "Respect your siblings. Another way to be a good boy is to be nice to your siblings, whether they are older or younger. If you’re the older sibling, you should serve a role model for your siblings and should help them grow more mature and reasonable as they get older. If you’re a younger sibling, then you should be nice and avoid taunting or teasing your older siblings too much and let them have their own space. [3] X Research source Being a good sibling is an important part of being a good boy, and you should try to get along with your siblings as much as you can. [4] X Research source You should also help your parents out by spending time with your siblings so they don’t always have to watch over them. If your siblings are upset, help them sort their problems out when you can so your parents can have some time to themselves. Avoiding fights with your siblings will help you be a good boy because you’ll be helping make things easier around the house."

    {
      "title": "Obey the rules.",
      "content": "Obey the rules. Another thing you can do to be a good boy is to obey the rules your parents have set forward. This can mean sticking to your curfew, waking up at a certain time, doing the chores you were meant to do, cleaning up after yourself, only spending a certain amount of time on your phone or computer, and so on. If you want to be a good boy, then you should obey the rules you are given and only question them if you really think you need to talk to your parents about it. Disregarding your parents’ rules shows them that you don’t respect or care for them as much as you could. You have to show them how much you appreciate their parenting by listening to them. If you have siblings, it's important to follow your parents’ rules so that you set a good example for your brother or sister."

      "title": "Apologize when you have made a mistake.",
      "content": "Apologize when you have made a mistake. Being a good boy doesn’t mean being perfect all the time. It does, however, mean that you should apologize when you feel like you’ve made a mistake. If you want to be a good boy, then you have to learn when you have done something wrong and be ready to admit it. [5] X Research source To truly apologize, look your parents and siblings in the eyes and give them a sincere and honest apology to show that you’ve put a lot of thought into what you’ve done and that you won’t do it again. Don’t just say you’re sorry while you’re doing something else or heading out the door. Take the time to sit down with your parents and take the time to let them know you really messed up."

      "title": "Make your parents’ lives easier.",
      "content": "Make your parents’ lives easier. The best thing you can do as a good boy is to make your parents’ lives easier. This can mean doing extra chores when you’re not asked, being extra obedient on days when you can see that your parents are extra tired, spending time with your siblings to give your parents more time off, or even giving your parents space when they’re tired and want to lie down. Most parents are overwhelmed by their parenting duties, and if you try to make their lives easier instead of creating problems, then they will be grateful to you for it. As you get older, you can help them run more errands, like picking up a few groceries, washing the car at home, shoveling snow, mowing the lawn, or helping get your younger siblings ready for school. If you are good at snow shoveling, you can even make legitimate money by doing it for your neighbors. If you see that your parents come home upset, try helping cook dinner or ask if you can pick up some pizza to make things easier."

      "content": "Learn more skills to help out around the house. You may think that there’s only so much you can do because you’re too young to really help out, but you can always learn more ways to help. If your parents do your laundry or wash your dishes for you, learn to do it yourself. If your parents always take care of the dog or cat, you should learn when they need to be fed and when to take out the dog. You can even learn to cook simple things, or to make yourself sandwiches for lunch so your parents don’t have to do it. [6] X Research source Don’t think that you can’t really help because you’re too young; instead, be a good boy and always look out for new ways to help out."

      "content": "Find hobbies that help you improve yourself. Another way to be a good boy is to work on becoming a smarter, more interesting person. This can mean spending more time reading and writing, teaching yourself a foreign language, learning a skill such as soccer or playing guitar, and generally caring about self-improvement. [7] X Research source Though watching TV or playing games online can make for a fun break, you should attempt to grow as a person as much as you can if you want to be a good boy. Part of being a good boy means becoming more mature and growing as a person. Learning new skills and educating yourself can help you become a more thoughtful, well-rounded individual."

      "content": "Don’t disobey your parents in public. Another way to be a good boy is to make sure to listen to your parents in public. Avoid contradicting them, ignoring them, openly disregarding their rules, throwing tantrums, or doing anything that would make them feel embarrassed and disappointed in you. If you disagree with them about something, bring it up later, when you’re alone at home, so you can have a productive conversation with them instead of throwing a fit. Even if you really, really want something your parents won’t give you right then, you should avoid embarrassing or making them feel bad. This will make them upset and can hurt your relationship with them. Instead, do the mature thing and avoid throwing a tantrum and ask if you can talk about it later."

      "content": "Listen to your teachers. One of the best ways to be a good boy is to listen to your teachers. You should respect them and recognize that they’re just people, too, and that it’s rude and unkind to ignore them, be mean to them, or question their authority. Pay attention, stay calm, and show that you are engaged in whet they are saying. Make an effort to do as your teachers say and not to cause problems in the classroom. Not only will listening to your teachers make them happier, but it will make your parents happier, too. If you really struggle with listening to your teachers or think they are being completely unreasonable, then you should be as nice as you can to them and talk to your parents to discuss next steps.

However, you should make an effort to do as well as you can, to study for your exams, to do your homework, and to generally be a dedicated student. When you need help, come to your teachers or your parents for help, and make an effort to always improve. Good boys tend to do well in school, because they know that success in the classroom is important. Make an effort to study for your exams well in advance so you get the best results. [9] X Research source What’s most important is that you respect the idea of education and come in to school on time and are happy to be there."

      "content": "Be kind to your classmates. If you want to be a good boy, then you have to be nice to your classmates, whether you’re with your lab partner or talking to some kids on the bus to school. Treating other people with kindness and respect is one major way to be a good boy. Don’t put down students who don’t do as well in school as you or make fun of people for their clothes or their general appearance. Work to truly treat others as you’d like to be treated and you’ll be on your way to being a good boy. [10] X Research source You may think that putting down other people will make you look better, but really, the best thing you can do is be friendly to everybody and most especially those who are being bullied by other students. In addition to feeling great about yourself, people like you and feel comfortable around you. If someone in class doesn’t know something, don’t make fun of that person and help him or her understand the material instead. You can also be friendly and provide a positive voice in non-academic situations such as when eating lunch in the cafeteria or peeing in the boys' bathroom."

      "content": "Participate in class. Another way to be a good boy is to participate in class. This shows your teachers that you’re listening and that you care. When your teacher asks questions, you should make an effort to answer them while giving other people a chance to answer, too. If you’re interested in or confused by something, then you should ask your teacher questions when it’s appropriate. If you’re engaged in class and participate often, then you’ll be making learning more fun for yourself while being a good boy in the process. [11] X Research source If your teacher asks for a volunteer, help her out by participating in whatever activity she has planned. Make sure to participate in group work, too. You should always be active and engaged with the material."

      "title": "Follow the rules.",
      "content": "Follow the rules. In order to be a good boy in school, you should avoid having conflicts with your teachers and your administrators. Follow all of the rules at your school, from any dress code rules you have to follow to coming to school on time and acting respectful in the school cafeteria. If you have broken a rule, be honest about it and apologize and show that you won’t do it again. If you want to be a good boy, then listening to the rules is important. If you want to be a good student, then it’s important to follow the rules in your school. You don’t want to develop a bad reputation with your teachers; if you do that, then it’ll be hard for them to take you seriously."

      "title": "Don’t be arrogant.",
      "content": "Don’t be arrogant. Good boys don’t try to act like the smartest person in the room or question their teachers' authority for the sake of causing problems. Whether you’re hanging out with your friends during recess or listening to your teacher talk about George Washington, you should avoid acting like a know-it-all, or you’re likely to annoy the people around you. Though it’s important to be curious and to question things in order to reach your own conclusions, you shouldn’t show off or brag or act like you know more than other people if you want to be a good boy. Trying to outsmart your teachers is one of the worst things you can do if you want them to like you. If you try these antics, they’ll be making a fast phone call to your parents. Of course, if you have a legitimate concern, you can still bring it up to your teacher. Just make sure you do so in a respectful manner. Showing off in front of your friends isn’t a good idea, either. They’ll quickly get tired of your act."

      "title": "Be honest.",
      "content": "Be honest. [12] X Research source It’s important to be honest if you want to be truly good in school and outside of it. If you’re in trouble for breaking the rules, then be honest about what you did instead of lying and trying to cover it up. When it comes to tests, you should avoid cheating or engaging in other dishonest behavior and work on getting good grades honestly, through studying and hard work. If you’re dishonest in school, then that will make you dishonest in other parts of your life and will lead you to not be a good boy. Though it’s okay to tell an occasional white lie to save a person’s feelings (such as telling your friend you like his bad haircut), it’s important to have integrity when it comes to the important stuff. Make sure to tell your teachers and parents the truth, or you’ll make a lifelong bad habit. It’s not always easy to be honest. If you’re honest about something that is difficult to share, then you should be proud of yourself for opening up."

      "content": "Be organized. Good boys tend to be organized in school, so that they can focus on their studies without making a mess. Have an organized backpack, school and home desk, notebook, and anything else you use for school. Work on separating your school subjects by folder and always knowing where everything is. If you want to succeed in school and be a good boy, then it’s important to be on top of your organizational skills. [13] X Research source Being organized goes hand in hand with being. Make sure that your desk at home, your desk at school, and your locker or backpack are neat and organized. Taking just 10-15 minutes a day to clean your things can help you stay on top of your studies. It is very helpful to keep a planner with all things you have to do and due dates."

Whether they are your parents’ friends or your dentist, it’s important to be nice and respectful to the people around you and to treat them with basic kindness. Respect their space, ask them how they’re doing, and avoid asking overly personal questions. Being respectful is an important quality of a good boy as well as a good man. [14] X Research source Good boys are respectful, especially of their elders. Make sure to treat people who are older than you with the utmost respect, even if you may disagree with them sometimes. When you’re in public, make sure you’re not too loud and avoid not cleaning up your mess. A restaurant or movie theatre isn’t your bedroom, and you need to be aware of the people around you."

Avoid making too much noise, accidentally getting on their property, ignoring them, or generally not treating them kindly. Your parents will want you to be nice to them to help make a good impression for your family, and being nice to them will make your living situation much easier. Even if you feel like you don’t have a lot in common with them, it’s always important to be nice. [15] X Research source Just making polite small talk can make a big difference. When you see your neighbors, just say, “Hi, how are you?” You don’t have to get wrapped up in a long conversation with them, but take the time to acknowledge them."

      "content": "Be kind to girls. One of the most important parts of being a good boy is treating girls with the kindness and respect they deserve. Be nice to them, make an effort to get to know them, and only tease them if you’re both being playful. Don’t ever make demeaning or nasty comments to a girl or make her feel bad about her looks or who she is. Even if the other boys around you aren’t mature enough to be nice to girls yet, it’s important that you break this mold and make an effort to treat them with care and kindness. When you see a girl, be friendly and ask how she’s doing. You can even compliment her new haircut or a piece of jewelry she’s wearing. If you’re shy about talking to girls, you don’t have to force it. The more you talk to girls little by little, the more comfortable you’ll feel about opening up to them."

Being polite means treating others with kindness and respect, avoiding being vulgar, and showing a kind interest in people. It also means avoiding any offensive topics or being rude to the people you don’t like. While you don’t have to be best friends with everyone, it doesn’t take any effort to be polite, and it can help make your social situations easier. [16] X Research source Being polite also means having good manners. Avoid burping in public and excuse yourself if you do. Don’t chew with your mouth full. Ask people how they’re doing when you see them. If you’re introduced to a new person, stand up to say hello. Let people pass in front of you instead of butting in in front of them."

You can volunteer with your parents, or jump on your bicycle to go by yourself or with some friends if you’re old enough to do that. You can help clean up a local park, help people learn to read at the library, or volunteer in a soup kitchen to help people have access to food. To be a good boy, you have to know that it’s about more than just being good at school or at home, but in the world at large. Make an effort to give at least a few hours of your time to others a month, whether you’re volunteering through your school, church, or another community organization. If you help out with your parents, then this will also be a great bonding activity."

To be a good boy out in the world, it’s important to spread your positive energy and to make the people around you feel happier and better about the world. You should avoid complaining or being overly negative and should work on talking about all of the good things in your life, smiling, and complimenting people instead of being negative or only focusing on the bad things in life. If you want to be a good boy, then you want to work on spreading good in the world. [17] X Research source Work on complimenting people instead of criticising them. It’s a better people to make people feel good about themselves than to put them down. [18] X Research source Work on smiling more often too. It’ll make you and the people around you feel happier."
