      "content": "If you text a Pisces man first, you’ll make him feel special. You know those guys who need to chase their crushes to stay interested? That's not Pisces. In fact, these guys can be a little shy, so send him a warm, friendly opener to kick things off between you two. Introduce yourself, use a subtle excuse to start a conversation, or invite him to hang out. If he doesn’t have your number, introduce yourself: “Hey! Hank, right? I got your # from Nikita. You seemed really sweet. I thought I’d reach out :)” If you have each other’s numbers but don’t text much, use a subtle conversation starter: “Leo, I just spotted your literal doppelganger on 5th! 😱” If the two of you have been texting, ask him to spend time with you: \"Heading to Lori's Cafe rn. Want to split the world's best brownie with me? 😍\""

Plus, you're proving that you're generous, loving, and emotionally intuitive—AKA, all things he admires in a crush. If you pick up on a shift in his mood, ask him about it: “I don’t mean to press, but you didn't quite seem like yourself today. Everything okay?” If you know he’s been feeling down, check in and offer to help: “Hey, Ali. I know it’s been a tough week. How was today? Can I bring you some ice cream?” When he mentions something that's been bothering him, follow up with him later on: “Hey, by the way, how did that chat with your sister go? Is she alright?\""

Hoping a warm tea turns things around. 🫖\" If he asks a specific question, offer an emotionally insightful response: \"Yes, my dog is feeling better! I tried to play it cool but I was really nervous for a while.\" Work some emotional vulnerability into a good morning text: \"Good morning! I woke up feeling totally at peace today. How about you? 😺\""
