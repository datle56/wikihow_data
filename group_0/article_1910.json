Keep in mind that if a meeting is scheduled in advance, it's usually considered a date and not a casual hang out.

[6] X Research source Ask something like “Do you want to grab something to eat for dinner this Friday?” or “There’s a concert next Monday at 7. Do you want to come with me?” Lead the conversation with your plans. Asking a guy if he’s free on a specific day without mentioning what you plan on doing makes it hard for him to determine if he’s interested.
