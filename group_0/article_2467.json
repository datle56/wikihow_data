      "content": "Using a pickup line can be tricky—you have to carefully walk the line between cheesy and cute, as well as direct and aggressive. So, we asked Jacoby what her thoughts were on using pickup lines, and she emphasized the importance of “just being authentically yourself. That could mean walking over and saying, ‘I noticed you and I just wanted to come over and say hi.’” Jacoby also confesses that she’s not a big fan of the pickup line, sharing that “sometimes they can be cute, but I really prefer an authentic hello to a pickup line any day of the week…I just think a big smile, warm personality, and being friendly is all it takes.” If you do choose to use a fun pickup line, however, Jacoby explains that you don’t “have to be super smooth or rehearse all the time. Just being oneself—warm, smiling, making direct eye contact—and just chatting and introducing yourself is all you really need to do.” But what about responding to a pick up line ? The honest answer is that you should respond to a pickup line in an authentic way based on how you feel about the line (and the person using it). If you think the line is funny or cheesy, you can laugh or make another joke in response. If you think the line is creepy or aren’t interested in making conversation, you can let them know you’re not into it or simply shrug it off and walk away."
