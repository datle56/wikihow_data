      "content": "Place the bass face-up on a flat, sturdy surface. Find a large, open space in your home or practice area where you can lay your double bass flat on the ground. Always keep the bridge and strings face-up so the instrument isn’t damaged. [2] X Research source If you don’t have a lot of room in your home, place your bass on your bed."

      "title": "Check that your bridge lines up with the notches in the F holes.",
      "content": "Check that your bridge lines up with the notches in the F holes. Take a close look at large, symmetrical F holes on both sides of your base. On the inner edge of each opening, look for a carefully etched notch—these notches form an invisible, horizontal line across your instrument, and represent where your bridge should be placed. Look at your bridge to see if it’s centered over this line, or if it needs to be adjusted. [3] X Research source The F holes are the large, curvy openings on the front of your bass that resemble a cursive F. It’s okay if your bridge isn’t exactly straight—it’s easy to adjust!"

      "content": "Measure the vibrating string length with a ruler. Check online or contact your luthier, or bass maker, and see what the vibrating length of your bass string is. Use this number as a guide when measuring the string from the tuning pegs down to the bridge. [4] X Research source The vibrating length of the string is the ideal length of the string between the top of the instrument and the bridge. If this section of string is too short, then your bridge has shifted forward and needs to be readjusted. Some basses have a vibrating string length of about 41 1 ⁄ 2 in (105 cm)."

      "content": "Pinch the outside of the bridge with your thumb and middle finger. Grip the outside edges of your bridge firmly to hold it in place. Keep your arm and hand tucked beneath the strings so you don’t hurt your bass in the process. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Push the bridge with the thumb of your opposite hand.",
      "content": "Push the bridge with the thumb of your opposite hand. Place your fingers on top of the strings, centering your thumb next to the top of the bridge. Force the bridge backwards until it’s completely perpendicular to the base of the instrument. [6] X Research source Don’t use your fingers to pinch and adjust the bridge. Using your thumb is an accurate way to adjust your instrument without possibly harming the bridge piece. Measure with a small ruler or other straight object to see if your bridge forms a 90-degree angle with the rest of the instrument. [7] X Research source"

If your bridge is completely sturdy and well-adjusted, you won’t be able to slide the paper beneath the bridge whatsoever. [8] X Research source If you can slide the paper beneath your bridge, you’ll need to make a few more adjustments."

      "content": "Check that the height of your “G” and “D” strings is 5 to 6 mm (0.20 to 0.24 in). Measure the gap between each bass string and the fingerboard. Keep in mind that the leftmost 2 strings (D and G), or the “G side” need to be 5 to 6 mm (0.20 to 0.24 in) above the fingerboard. [11] X Research source This is a good measurement for solo bass music. If you’re using orchestral strings, you can raise your strings to 8 or 9 mm (0.31 or 0.35 in) above the fingerboard, depending on how the strings feel."

      "content": "Measure your “E” and “A” strings to see if they’re 7 to 8 mm (0.28 to 0.31 in) high. Use a ruler to see how high your bass strings sit above the fingerboard. Check that your strings are around 7 to 8 mm (0.28 to 0.31 in) away from the fingerboard, or jot down what the current measurement is. [12] X Research source Use your own discretion when adjusting your strings. If a certain measurement feels more comfortable, go with that. When your strings have more tension, they tend to sound brighter."

      "content": "Loosen the tuning pegs before making any adjustments. Rotate your tuning pegs to the right to loosen the strings a little bit. You don’t need to loosen or unwind the strings all the way—just enough so your strings aren’t super tight and tense along the bridge. [13] X Research source Unlike other string instruments, double basses use special pegs for tuning and string adjustments. Turn these pegs to the left to loosen the strings, and twist them to the right to tighten the strings."
