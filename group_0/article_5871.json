The cause here could range from something minor, like a loose gas cap that’s letting air into the cylinders and throwing off the air-fuel ratio, or something serious, like a bad catalytic converter or a dying oxygen sensor. If the check engine light is flashing, it’s a sign there’s a potentially catastrophic problem, so pull over and turn the vehicle off."

      "title": "How to fix the issue:",
      "content": "How to fix the issue: Pop the hood and inspect the battery. If you see a chalky substance around the terminals, that’s corrosion. Try cleaning your battery with baking soda, water, and a wire brush to see if that resolves the problem. If it doesn’t, test the battery with a voltmeter by holding the probes against the terminals. If it reads a stable number (usually 12-12.7 volts or so), the battery is fine. If the number fluctuates or it gives no reading, the battery is dying and you need to replace it . If none of this resolves the issue, the issue is probably your alternator, and you need a mechanic to help you out. [2] X Research source"

If the indicator is red, check your coolant levels. [4] X Research source Pop the hood and look to see if the coolant reaches the hash mark on the reservoir. If it does, it may simply be time for a coolant flush or a top off . If it doesn’t, it’s likely damage to your coolant system causing a leak.
