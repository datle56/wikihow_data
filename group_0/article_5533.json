      "content": "Add the relevant Australian area/city code minus the leading zero, or use “4” if you are calling a mobile. This code is 1-2 digits long and will direct your call geographically in Australia. If you conduct an online search for the city you are calling, followed by “Australia area code”, you will find it easily. Australia area code examples include: Sydney and Gold Coast = 02, Melbourne and Tasmania = 03, Brisbane = 07. Do not type in the leading \"0\" when calling from overseas! The leading \"0\" is only used when calling within Australia from an Australian Mobile or Landline to call someone in a different geographic area within Australia. If the phone number has 1-2 digits in brackets/parentheses at the beginning of the number, this is most likely the area code. For example: (02) 555-55555."
