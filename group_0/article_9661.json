      "content": "Learn the conversion factor. You can learn from many tables or textbooks that one Newton is equal to 0.10197 kilograms of force. [1] X Research source A useful way to write this figure is as a conversion ratio, 0.10197 k g 1 N {\\displaystyle {\\frac {0.10197kg}{1N}}} . By writing the conversion in a fraction that way, it should remind you that the two are equal, and the value of the fraction is 1. Recall that any fraction in which the numerator and denominator are equal has a value of 1. This is important in conversions because you can multiply any number by 1 without changing its value, but you can convert the units."

      "title": "Set up your conversion equation.",
      "content": "Set up your conversion equation. If you have a number of Newtons that you wish to convert to units of kg-force, you can use the conversion factor to set up a simple equation. As long as the conversion term is equal to 1, the value of the measurement will be the same. For example, suppose you have a measurement of 5 N that you wish to convert to kg-force. Set it up as a multiplication problem, as follows: 5 N = 5 N ∗ 0.10197 k g 1 N {\\displaystyle 5N=5N*{\\frac {0.10197kg}{1N}}} In setting up the conversion factor, you need to make sure that you write the conversion fraction so the unit you wish to end up with is in the numerator. If you wrote the conversion fraction as 1 N 0.10197 k g {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1N}{0.10197kg}}} , your result would be incorrect. This would be the conversion to use for the inverse conversion, from kilograms to Newtons."

      "title": "Perform the conversion.",
      "content": "Perform the conversion. If you set up your conversion factor correctly, the final step should be a simple multiplication. You should see that you begin with the unit of Newtons, and your conversion ratio has Newtons in the denominator. As with any fraction multiplication, something that appears both in the numerator and the denominator can cancel out of the equation. This will leave just the desired unit of kg-force. [2] X Research source In this example, the problem is set up and can be completed as follows: 5 N = 5 N ∗ 0.10197 k g 1 N = 0.50985 k g . {\\displaystyle 5N=5N*{\\frac {0.10197kg}{1N}}=0.50985kg.}"

Review them briefly to find one that has a style and a presentation that you like and find easy to use. The results should be the same, no matter which you choose. [3] X Research source For example, the site KylesConverter.com has a very simple read out. There is one large box to enter the number of Newtons, and as soon as you enter the number, the result appears in a second box. You can select the “precision” of your conversion to show the number of decimal places that you want. The precision begins at 1, so only 1 digit will appear unless you change it."
