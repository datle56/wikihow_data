      "title": "Avoid feeding the dog for at least 12 hours.",
      "content": "Avoid feeding the dog for at least 12 hours. Vomiting can irritate a dog’s stomach lining, which can lead to more vomiting if they eat anything soon after vomiting. Resist the urge to feed the dog even if they act hungry. The fasting helps the dog’s body heal and gives you time to determine the cause. [10] X Research source Be sure the dog still has access to fresh, clean water and is drinking it regularly. A puppy or young dog should not fast for more than 12 hours. Contact a vet for a more personalized fasting plan. If your dog has an underlying medical condition (especially diabetes), speak with your veterinarian before withholding any meals."

If there are no vomiting or signs of illness, start integrating their normal food back into their diet. [13] X Research source Put a little bit of kibble into their bland meal. This helps the stomach slowly start to get used to processing regular food again. Continue adding more regular food to the bland food with each meal until the ratio is completely regular food. [14] X Research source For example, start with a 50/50 mix for one meal, then 3/4 dog food and 1/4 of the bland diet for one meal.

While vomiting and regurgitation both involve expelling items from the stomach, they’re different medical terms. Vomiting is when a dog shows signs of illness and retches or brings up digested food.
