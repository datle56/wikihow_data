Self-service codes are not available for all phone providers. These steps will work for T-Mobile, and may also work for third-party services that use T-Mobiles network. [1] X Research source If this method doesn't work for you, call your provider's customer service (you can usually just dial *611 from your Android to do this) and tell them how much time (between 5 and 30 seconds) you want calls to ring before transferring to voicemail."
