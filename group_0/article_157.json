      "content": "Ancient Mesopotamia The 8-Pointed Star is associated with the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar. Ishtar is the Babylonian (a region within ancient Mesopotamia) goddess of love and war. She is therefore capable of both creation and destruction as one of the Near East’s most powerful and revered deities. Ishtar is referred to as Inanna in Sumeria. [1] X Research source Like Ishtar, the 8-pointed star (also called the Star of Ishtar) represents a place between heaven and earth where believers can reach higher consciousness. Ishtar also corresponds to the planet Venus (called the “morning star”), which is why her Roman deity equivalent is Venus, the goddess of love."

For the Mi’kmaq tribes in Canada’s maritime provinces, the star represents sol (the sun). It was originally a 7-point star for the 7 districts of Lnuk, the name the Mi’kmaq people call themselves, which became an 8-pointed star after the addition of the Ktaqmkuk district in Newfoundland. [8] X Research source The Mi’kmaq 8-pointed star has four colors: white for the north, red for the south, yellow for the east, and black for the west. It’s a colorful symbol of their nation which often appears on art, jewelry, and quilts. In Lakota mythology and art, the 8-pointed star tells the story of the morning star. In the story, an old medicine man becomes the morning star after he dies. The Morning Star is more powerful than the sun and the moon and is a symbol of wisdom and understanding. [9] X Research source The 8 points of the morning star represent the 4 stages of life: infancy, youth, maturity, and old age.

      "title": "The 8-pointed star is tied to several spiritual meanings.",
      "content": "The 8-pointed star is tied to several spiritual meanings. From good luck and protection to new beginnings and happiness, there are many ways to use this ancient symbol on your path to spiritual enlightenment. [16] X Research source Illumination : The 8-pointed star is linked to the planet Venus, also called the morning star, as well as the sun. It becomes a potent symbol of light triumphing over darkness, which is a metaphor for spiritual enlightenment. Creation : Many cultures connect the 8-pointed star with the birth of the entire universe. It’s a representation of creation in its most grandiose and divine form, so it’s easy to see why we associate the star with growth and expansion. Solar Events : In many belief systems, the 8-pointed star stands for the 8 phases of the moon, 8 solar events, and the 4 seasons combined with the annual 2 solstices and 2 equinoxes. It’s a reminder that we are all part of the natural cycles of life as they come and go. Guidance : The 8-pointed star is thought to represent the North Star, also called the Polaris star. It’s no accident that a compass looks very much like an 8-pointed star since it can guide you wherever you need to go and direct you along the way. Protection : The 8 points of the star are meant to ward off evil coming from the 8 cardinal directions. Multiple cultures have used the 8-pointed star as a talisman of protection, which is why it was usually depicted on the front of a door. Renewal and New Beginnings : The number 8 stands for resurrection, salvation, and new beginnings. The number 7 equals a calendar week, so 8 becomes a symbol of new beginnings, and also the cycle of death and rebirth. Prosperity and Good Luck : The number 8 is associated with both material success and achievement in numerology and with the 8 auspicious objects relating to the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, who rules over wealth and good fortune. Balance and Harmony : The evenly symmetrical design of the 8-pointed star includes 8 points to represent a color, a direction, and an element. The number 8 also stands for the balance between opposites. Infinity : Because the number 8 turned to its side becomes the infinity symbol, it too stands as a symbol of the infinite, beyond the cycles of life, death, and rebirth. Happiness : The 8-pointed star symbol relates to both light and the sun, which makes it a clear representation of happiness and joy."

      "content": "In astrology, the number 8 is linked to balance and equilibrium. It is a symbol of the natural order of everything, so it makes sense that its equivalent among the actual stars is said to connect all the aspects of cosmic energy. The number 8 is also associated with Saturn, a planet that rules over both discipline and karma. [17] X Research source The 8 points of the star are symbols of the sun and the moon, along with the infinite nature of space. In spiritual geometry, the number 8 represents balance and the cyclical nature of existence. It also stands for infinity, via the cycles of birth, death, and rebirth.
