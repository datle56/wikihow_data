      "content": "If you like makeup, now’s your time to experiment. Emphasize your eyes with false lashes, black eyeliner, and smokey eyeshadow. Draw attention to your lips with a bold lipstick and shiny gloss. Highlight your cheekbones with a bit of bronzer and blush to really round out your look.

      "content": "You may get comments or questions about your bald head. If friends or family members ask, feel free to explain why you went bald or chose to shave your head.
