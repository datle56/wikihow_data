Before you can calculate CBM, convert each measurement into its equivalent value in meters. To convert centimeters to meters, divide by 100. For example, if the length is 15 centimeters, divide 15 by 100, which is equal to 0.15 meters. [2] X Research source To convert inches to meters, divide by 39.37. For instance, if the width is 10 inches, divide 10 by 39.37, which is equal to 0.254 meters. [3] X Research source To convert feet to meters, multiply by 0.305. For example, if the height is 5 feet, multiply 5 by 0.305, which is equal to 1.525 meters. [4] X Research source"

[5] X Research source For example, say the length is 5.5 meters, the width is 2.5 meters, and the height is 7.0 meters: 5.5 x 2.5 x 7.0 = 96.25, so the CBM is 96.25 cubic meters."

      "content": "Convert the measurements into meters, if necessary. If you took your measurements in centimeters, inches, or feet, it will be easiest to convert these units to meters before you calculate CBM. To convert centimeters to meters, divide by 100. For instance, if the height is 90 centimeters, divide 90 by 100, which is equal to 0.90 meters. [7] X Research source To convert inches to meters, divide by 39.37. For example, if the radius is 75 inches, divide 75 by 39.37, which is equal to 1.905 meters. [8] X Research source To convert feet to meters, multiply by 0.305. For instance, if the height is 20 feet, multiply 20 by 0.305, which is equal to 6.1 meters. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the formula V = πr 2 h to find the CBM. In this equation, V = volume, π = 3.14, r = radius, and h = height. Simply plug the measurements you found for the radius and height of the cylinder into the equation and solve it. [10] X Research source For instance, say the radius of your package is 3 meters and the height is 12 meters. Start by squaring the radius: 3 2 = 9. Multiply 3.14 by 9 by 12, which is equal to 339.12, so the volume of the cylinder is 339.12 cubic meters."

Treat an irregularly shaped package like a rectangular package when calculating CBM, but since there is no consistent length, width, and height, you must identify the longest, widest, and tallest portions of the package and measure those maximum distances with a measuring tape. Write down each measurement. [11] X Research source Even though CBM is a measurement of volume, there is no standard formula to use when calculating the volume of an irregularly shaped three-dimensional object. Instead of finding an exact volume, you can only calculate an estimated one."
