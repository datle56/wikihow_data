      "content": "Make sure you know what it means to be a Muslim and how to act like one. The first and foremost rule of being a Muslim is believing in the one and only Allah (accent on the second syllable). Allah is the only God, the only Creator and the Almighty. He is the only one you should be doing your good deeds for and the only one who shall be worshipped. There should be nothing standing in His place. Allah's messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the messenger and the last Prophet who came down to Earth, and there will never be any prophets after him. Islam considers itself to be the natural way of all creation. That is, Islam is the original, perfect state of being. So, when a person \"converts\" to Islam, he/she is actually reverting to their own original nature. Islam considers anyone who follows its teachings to be a Muslim, regardless of when or where she or he lived. For instance, Islam believes that Jesus was a Muslim, though he lived hundreds of years before modern Islam's historical founding. Allah, the Arabic word for God, refers to the same God worshiped by Christians and Jews (aka the \"Abrahamic\" God). Thus, Muslims revere the prophets of Christianity and Judaism (including Jesus, Moses, David, Elijah, etc.) and consider the Bible and Torah to be divinely inspired, but modified over time, and therefore, unreliable. The Qur'an is God's final scripture that affirms the truth in the previous scriptures and rectifies any falsehoods or corruptions. Avoid associating yourself with any sect in Islam. Allah and His Prophet command us to be united. Therefore, Muslims should only obey Allah and His Prophet and avoid bid'ah (innovation in religious matters). If the Allah or the Prophet didn't command or do an action, don't do it. \"Indeed, those who have divided their religion and become sects—you, [O Muhammad], are not [associated] with them in anything. Their affair is only [left] to Allah ; then He will inform them about what they used to do.\" [6:159] [1] X Research source The Prophet (ﷺ) said: \"Beware! The people of the Book before were split up into seventy two sects, and this community will be split into seventy three: seventy two of them will go to Hell and one of them will go to Paradise, and it is the majority group.\" [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Read Islamic scripture. The Quran is the central religious book of Islam, believed to be the unadulterated word of God and the culmination of all previous Christian and Jewish scripture. [3] X Research source Another very important religious scripture is the Hadith, the sayings and accounts of Muhammad. Hadith collections form the basis for much of Islamic law. Reading these writings will give you an understanding of the stories, laws, and teachings that make up Islamic belief."

      "content": "Talk with an Imam. Imams are Islamic religious scholars who conduct religious services inside and outside the mosque (Masjid). Imams are chosen for their knowledge of Islamic scripture and their good character. A good Imam will be able to provide you with advice when deciding whether you're ready to devote yourself to Islam."

      "title": "Say the Shahada.",
      "content": "Say the Shahada. If you're absolutely sure that you accept the basic beliefs of Islam and want to fully submit to the will of Allah, all you need to do is recite the Shahada, a short oral declaration of faith in order to become a Muslim. Be aware that once you have said the Shahada, you are committed to following Islam for life. The words of the Shahada are \" Ash-hadu anla elaha illa-Allah wa ash-hadu anna Mhammadur rasul-Allah \", which translates to \"I testify that there is no other god but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is Allah's messenger.\" [4] X Research source [5] X Research source By saying the Shahada, you become a Muslim. The first part of the Shahada (\" Ash-hadu anla elaha illa-Allah \") refers not only to deities from other religions, but also to worldly things which can take the place of Allah in your heart—wealth and power, for example. [6] X Research source The second part of the Shahada (\" wa ash-hadu anna Mhammadur rasul-Allah \") is a recognition that Muhammad is Allah's final messenger. Muslims are required to live by the principles of Muhammad, revealed in the Quran and follow his example. The Shahada must be said with sincerity and understanding to be binding. You can't become a Muslim just by pronouncing the words—the oral recitation is a reflection of belief that's held in the heart. You should never kill, lie, steal, or anything of the sort. Always follow Allah's commands detailing how He wishes to be worshiped. You are committing to follow all the rules of Islam, known as the Shari'ah."

      "content": "To become a legal member of the Muslim community, have witnesses present at your recitation. Witnesses are not strictly required to become a Muslim—God knows all things, so a Shahada said alone, with conviction, will make you a Muslim in God's eyes. However, to become legally recognized by the Muslim mosque, you generally must make your Shahada in front of witnesses—two Muslims or an Imam (Islamic religious leader) who is authorized to certify your new faith."

      "title": "Wash yourself.",
      "content": "Wash yourself. Immediately upon becoming a Muslim, you should take a shower or bath as a form of purification. This is a symbolic act that signifies the washing away of the past and of emerging from darkness to light. No one's sins are too grave to prohibit newfound purity. Upon making your Shahada, your past sins are forgiven and you are pure. You symbolically begin a new life centered around striving to improve your spiritual state through good deeds. Males are recommended to submit to circumcision . Although this may seem daunting, it is considered important for cleanliness and represents an act of love for Allah, seeking His reward. The local mosque should be able to direct you to a nearby clinic where this procedure can be performed in a sterile environment by qualified experts. To be clear, this is not a requirement, only a recommendation. Circumcision is a highly personal decision for a person to make, so consider the all pros and cons of getting circumcised."

      "title": "Offer prayer to God.",
      "content": "Offer prayer to God. If you're not sure how to pray as a Muslim, the easiest way to learn is to attend a Mosque for the five daily prayers. Prayer should be a relaxing, enjoyable activity, but be aware that the five daily prayers are obligatory for all mature Muslims. Take your time when praying. Rushing the prayer should be avoided in order to gain maximum benefit. Remember, prayer is a direct spiritual connection between you and the being who keeps your heart beating and who created the universe. It should bring serenity, happiness, and peace. This will come with and improve over time. Avoid being excessive or ostentatious with your prayer—pray simply and humbly. Your initial goal is to establish a habit and make it an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. With time, your focus should improve to a level where nothing can ever distract you. Structure your day around the five daily prayers. Make sure that you leave plenty of time for supplication (dua) after performing the obligatory prayers, as this is the way Muslims seek help from Allah. Try to adopt the habit of praying all the optional prayers as well, as these bring great rewards. Pray to Allah for good judgement and success in life. However, keep two points in mind. First, you must perform the duties that Allah has required of you. It is not enough to merely pray for success—you must do what is necessary to achieve it. Second, have faith in Allah in all matters. Your material success is fleeting, but Allah is eternal—keep your devotion in Allah whether you are successful or not. Pray for forgiveness every day, after every salat and whenever you have a quiet moment. Acknowledge your sins in your own words to Allah, say why they are wrong, promise not to repeat them and ask Allah for mercy. Every sin should be acknowledged no matter how small it may seem to us, for example mispronouncing a word in recitation, or looking lustfully at the opposite gender. If we ask with sincerity we can be hopeful of forgiveness, otherwise each sin will count against us on the Day of Judgement and may even lead to punishment in this world. Remember that Allah is self-sufficient and does not actually need our worship, rather He commands us to pray for our own benefit, so we should embrace the gift of salah with great joy."

      "title": "Perform Islamic obligations (Fard).",
      "content": "Perform Islamic obligations (Fard). Islam requires Muslims to fulfill certain obligations. These obligations are called \"Fard.\" There are two kinds of Fard: Fard al-Ayn and Fard al-Kifaya. Fard al-Ayn are individual obligations—things every single Muslim must do if he or she is able, like praying daily and fasting during Ramadan . [7] X Research source Fard al-Kifaya are community obligations—things that the community as a whole must do, even if every member doesn't do them. For instance, if a Muslim dies, some of the Muslims in the community must get together to say funeral prayers. It's not required for every individual Muslims to say the prayers. However, if no one says the funeral prayers, the whole community is at fault. Islamic belief also mandates the observance of Sunnah , lifestyle guidelines based on the life of Muhammad. Some acts are recommended, and some are mandated. The narration (hadith) will inform you if the described action is required. Try to adopt new Sunnan in your life as you develop as a Muslim, for example adding more voluntary prayers to your daily routine and reciting some of the recommended daily duas in the morning and evening."

As a Muslim, you will keep the following habits (and others): Observe halal dietary practices. Muslims abstain from consuming pork, carrion, and alcohol. Additionally, meat must be properly slaughtered by an authorized Muslim. Say \"Bismillah\" (\"In the Name of God\") before meals. Eat and drink with your right hand, and never with the left, even if you are left-handed. However, if your right hand is unusable (such as by being amputated), you are allowed to use your left hand. Practice proper hygiene. Refrain from non-essential interaction with the opposite gender. Remember that all forms of sexual gratification outside the bounds of marriage are strictly forbidden. Married women must abstain from sex during the menstrual cycle. Study and follow the Islamic dress code, which places great emphasis on modesty ."

The Five Pillars are: Testimony of Faith (Shahada). You make this when you become a Muslim by declaring that there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is His messenger. Performance of the five daily prayers (Salah). Prayers are made throughout the day, five times, in the direction of the holy city of Mecca. Fasting during the month of Ramadan (Sawm), if able. Ramadan is a holy month marked by fasting and additional good deeds such as prayer and charity. Giving 2.5% of your savings to the poor ( Zakat ).

The six articles of faith mandate that Muslims must believe in: Allah (God). God is the creator of the universe and the only being worthy of worship. His angels. Angels are the unquestioning servants of God's divine will. His revealed scripture. The Quran is the perfect will of God as revealed to Muhammad by through the angel Gabriel (Christian and Jewish scripture is also considered holy, they were given from Allah but some or more of the content has already been changed). His Messengers. God sent Prophets (including Jesus, Abraham, and others) to preach His word on earth. The Day of Judgement. God will eventually raise all life for judgement at a time known only to Him. Fate. God has ordained all things—nothing occurs without His will or pre-knowledge."

      "content": "Continue to read the Qur'an and always keep it at the center of your life. You can learn much from translations of the Qur'an. Some of these translations may be harder to understand than others. Abdullah Yusuf Ali and Pickthall are the two most common Qur'an translations, but give Sahih International a try if you're experiencing difficulties in understanding the old English of the other translations. However, it's even better to seek guidance from people who are trained in the study of the Qur'an rather than simply relying on your own ability to interpret the Qur'an. Your local mosque will likely have people who will be more than willing to guide and assist you in learning more about Islam and many have \"New Muslim\" brothers' and sisters' study circles, which are often a good place to start. Be careful, but relaxed, about finding someone who you feel comfortable with and who you are convinced has enough knowledge in order to teach well. Many Muslims devote much time to memorizing the Qu'ran as it brings great reward. When your Arabic improves, start learning by heart some of your favourite surahs. These can then be recited during prayer or whenever you feel you need a lift. Research and study authentic collections of hadith (sayings or acts of the Prophet Muhammad [pbuh]), for example Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, and Al-Kutub Al-Arb'ah. Memorize some of your favourite ahadith. See Sunnah.com to browse the collections."

      "title": "Study Islamic Law and choose a school (optional).",
      "content": "Study Islamic Law and choose a school (optional). In Sunni Islam, religious law is divided into four schools of thought. The major Shīʿa school of jurisprudence is the Jaʿfari or Imāmī school. Look into the different schools and choose the one that appeals most to you. Subscribing to a school will inform your interpretation of Islamic law as revealed in the primal sources of Islam (Quran and Sunnah). Note that all schools are equally valid. Although some aspects of the Shariah may seem very strict at first, the legal system is a gift from Allah to ensure a safe and fair society. It is your duty to embrace it and use it to motivate yourself to live a good life. The officially recognized schools are: Hanafi. The Hanafi School was founded by Imam Al A'dham Nu'man Abu Hanifa and is the most widely practiced school and has the most information available in English. It ranges from the widely secular Turks to the Ultra-Orthodox Deobandis and Barelvis. Most Hanafis live in the Indian subcontinent, Turkey, Eastern Iran, parts of Egypt and many non-Muslim-majority countries Shafi'i. The Shafi'i school was founded by Imam Abu 'Abdillah Muhammad Al-Shafi'i and is the second most populous school and is the majority in Egypt and East Africa as well as Yemen, Malaysia and Indonesia, The Shafi'i school is known for their complex legal system. Maliki. The Maliki school was founded by Imam Abu Anas Malik, who was a student of Imam Abu Hanifa; it is the majority school in North and North West Africa, as well as a reasonable following in Saudi Arabia. Imam Malik took his practices from the people of Madinah; one famous Maliki scholar is Hamza Yusuf. Hanbali. The Hanbali school was founded by Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal and is practiced almost exclusively in Saudi Arabia, with some followers in the West. The Hanbalis place great emphasis on creed and ritual practice and it is considered the most conservative and strict. It is not obligatory to follow one of the aforementioned schools of thought. These did not exist during the time of the Prophet, and are simply different minor interpretations of how to perform certain actions, such as prayer. Do not worry if someone else follows a different school; Islam warns against dividing the religion into sects. Follow the Qur'an and Sunnah, and you won't go astray."

      "content": "Above all, strive to improve yourself in the service of Allah throughout your life. No matter what may anger, sadden or upset you, your duty on earth is to be the best person you can be by serving Allah and seeking His reward. Muslims believe that Allah created us to have a good life, and to be happy through our service to Him. Use your talents to help others and better your community. Be open-minded. Never do harm to anyone. Make it your mission to tell people about Islam, emphasizing that Islam is a religion of peace. Muslims are required to remain mindful of Allah throughout the day. Beautiful phrases - such as Subhana l-lahi wa bi-hamdihi (how perfect Allah is and I praise Him), La ilaha illallah (there is none worthy of worship except Allah), Alhamdulillah (All praise is due to Allah) and Allahu Akhbar (Allah is greater) - can be repeated throughout the day and are a great way of showing gratitude to Allah. The outlook of every Muslim is balanced between the hope of Allah's mercy for our sins and fear of incurring His punishment. Like many religions, Islam advocates that its believers follow the \"Golden Rule\". Always follow the advice of Prophet Muhammad and you will not go far wrong."
