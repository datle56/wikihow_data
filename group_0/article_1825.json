      "title": "Make the texts personal.",
      "content": "Make the texts personal. Avoid generic texts like “Hey,” “What’s up?” or “What are you doing?” since they’re not ideal for starting conversations.

[7] X Research source Try referring to the last conversation you had with them. For example, if they mentioned a big test or work project, ask them how it went. Talk about their interests.
