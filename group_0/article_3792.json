      "content": "Research an OB/GYN’s roles and responsibilities. Some OB/GYNs will eventually specialize in either obstetrics or gynecology, but the majority treat both. Becoming an OB/GYN requires extensive knowledge of women’s reproductive organs and all stages of pregnancy. Before deciding to become an OB/GYN, ask yourself if you are interested in spending years learning about and eventually providing procedures such as: Cervical exams Pap smears Fertility testing Uterine surgery Child delivery Abortion STI/STD screening Hysterectomy Ovarian surgery Bladder surgery for prolapse Surgery for incontinence Surgery for rectal prolapse"

      "content": "Plan for university or college. If you decide on becoming an OB/GYN while still in high school, take upper-level science and math courses, as this will help you later on. Work hard to obtain the high grades necessary to attend the university or college of your choice. Research the reputations of pre-med programs and available scholarship opportunities. Start preparing your university or college applications early so they are polished and stand out. If you pursue college or university in the United States, start studying for the SAT test right away. An excellent SAT score is necessary for admission to prestigious universities and colleges. Your school may also require ACT scores, so find out if you need to take both tests. Consider getting involved in extracurricular activities at your high school, and volunteering in your community, preferably at a hospital or clinic. The best universities and colleges prefer well-rounded applicants who give back to their communities."

      "content": "Enroll in a pre-med program. A pre-med program is not a degree; it is an educational trajectory that will help you get into medical school. Pre-med entails coursework in fields such as biology, organic chemistry, and statistics. These courses will satisfy medical school prerequisites, and help you prepare for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). [1] X Trustworthy Source Association of American Medical Colleges Nonprofit organization repsonsible for the administration of the MCAT and for facilitating the medical school applications process Go to source Although pre-med is not a requirement for entry into medical school, it will give you a big advantage over the competition. Many pre-med programs offer work or volunteer opportunities at hospitals and clinics. Consider pursuing such opportunities because they can enhance your application to medical school, and affirm that an OB/GYN career is truly what you want. Keep your GPA at 3.5 or above as an undergraduate, as this will significantly improve your chances of getting into medical school. [2] X Research source You should complete a four year undergraduate degree program, and preferably an honors degree."

      "title": "Take the MCAT",
      "content": "Take the MCAT . This test is a mandatory requirement for most medical schools in North America and many schools internationally. It will require months of studying and preparation; don’t try to “cram” close to the deadline. The test is comprised of multiple choice questions pertaining to the physical sciences, biological sciences, and verbal reasoning. The MCAT is held in designated testing locations with varied schedules and seating capacity, so be sure to register in advance. [3] X Trustworthy Source Association of American Medical Colleges Nonprofit organization repsonsible for the administration of the MCAT and for facilitating the medical school applications process Go to source If unsatisfied with your grade, you can retake the MCAT. But medical schools can see how many attempts you have made, and multiple failed attempts will weaken your application. Each time you take the MCAT costs money, generally around 300 dollars. If you want to become an OB/GYN outside North America, research the medical school examination requirements in your home country."

In the final two years of the degree, you will complete a series of medical rotations, working with patients under the direction of licensed physicians in many fields, such as OB/GYN. It is particularly important to obtain strong grades in the OB/GYN rotation if you plan to pursue this specialization. Be sure to complete at least one sub-internship in the field prior to graduation."

      "content": "Complete a residency in OB/GYN. In general, a residency program is four years in length, and entails hands-on experience in gynecology, obstetrics, and benign gynecological surgery. During a residency, you will care for patients under the supervision of more senior physicians, and will earn a relatively low salary (often in the $45,000 dollar range); [4] X Research source however, at this phase of OB/GYN training, you will have the rewarding experience of doing everything from helping women through difficult pregnancies, to performing surgeries that will greatly improve lives. Consider your residency options carefully, as programs vary greatly. Conduct research into the reputation and stability of residency programs, the support available from peers and superiors, whether schedules are flexible or on-call hours, and opportunities for advancement.

Although the licensing process varies between states and countries, all jurisdictions require a medical licensing examination. In the U.S., there are two licensing examinations: the United States Medical Licensing Examination (required for licensure of medical students from Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) programs and optional for medical students attending from Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) programs) and the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination (COMLEX), which is required for licensure of D.O. medical students ."

Following licensing and certification, some OB/GYNs pursue three-year fellowships at teaching hospitals that allow them to specialize and conduct research in areas such as maternal-fetal medicine, pediatric and adolescent gynecology, and gynecologic oncology, reproductive endocrinology. Pursuing such specializations can double your annual salary. For example, gynecologic oncologists generally make well over $400,000 a year, while general OB/GYNs typically earn over $200,000 a year."

      "content": "Consider where you want to work. OB/GYNs can work in a variety of settings. Some join or establish private practices or women’s clinics. Others work primarily out of hospitals. Some OB/GYNs focus on obstetrics and childbirth, others emphasize gynecology. A smaller number of OB/GYNs join academic medical schools as full-time faculty members with administrative, teaching and research responsibilities. The options for OB/GYNs are numerous; choose an employment direction that is in keeping with your personality, goals, and interests. While obstetrics can be stressful because it entails late-night phone calls and sudden deliveries, many OB/GYNs love being part of the emotionally charged process of childbirth. A rewarding aspect of gynecology is greater opportunities for surgical research. While the process of becoming an OB/GYN is long and difficult, once trained and licensed, the job prospects are excellent; there is extremely high demand for OB/GYNs now, and this demand is only projected to grow in the future.
