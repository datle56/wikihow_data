      "title": "Retrieve a USB-C cable.",
      "content": "Retrieve a USB-C cable. The PS5 retails with a USB-C cable included. This Sony-manufactured cable tends to work best with the controller, but you can use any USB-C charger. USB-C charges most Android devices, as well as many wireless headphones, smart watches, etc. Feel free to charge your DualSense controller with the same USB-C cables you use for your other USB-C devices. Keep in mind that the PS4 controller did not use a USB-C cable to charge, but a standard microUSB."

      "title": "Plug the USB end of the cable into a front-facing port on your console.",
      "content": "Plug the USB end of the cable into a front-facing port on your console. If you want to charge your controller while you play, you can plug the USB-C cable into your console. If you do not plan on playing while it charges, you can plug the cable into a USB port on any wall plug or computer. If charging through your PS5, ensure the console is powered on. At 3ft, Sony's packaged USB-C cable may be long enough for you to play while charging. But retailers do sell cables up to 15ft long, in case your console is far from your sofa/chair. Keep in mind longer cables won't charge your controllers as quickly."

      "title": "Plug the USB-C end into the port atop your controller.",
      "content": "Plug the USB-C end into the port atop your controller. With both ends plugged in, the LED light atop your controller should turn on, indicating that the controller is now charging. Sony claims that a single hour of charging equates to 6 hours of gameplay. Your PS5 can charge your controller while in Rest Mode, but only if you visit your \"Power Saving\" settings and, under \"Features Available in Rest Mode,\" change \"Supply Power to USB Ports\" to \"Always.\""

      "title": "Purchase a DualSense docking station.",
      "content": "Purchase a DualSense docking station. Sony sells an official docking station for its DualSense controllers. There are also several third-party docking stations, each with their own set of design features and technical attributes. While costly, a docking station should charge your controller even faster than a USB-C cable, and may be more convenient as well."

    {
      "title": "Place your docking station on a flat surface.",
      "content": "Place your docking station on a flat surface. Try to place it on a table or shelf. A hardwood floor should be fine as well, but you may want to keep it away from any pets or children that could knock the station (and your controllers) over while charging."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place your controller into the charging dock.",
      "content": "Place your controller into the charging dock. Most docks offer at least two stations, so you can charge multiple controllers simultaneously. Sony claims their official charging dock can offer your DualSense controllers a full charge in just 2-3 hours."
