      "content": "Apply hydroquinone for all-over lightening, but be aware of the risks. If you want to lighten your skin quickly, you might get good results by applying a skin lightening cream that contains hydroquinone once a day for several weeks. However, some people experience negative reactions to hydroquinone, including skin irritation, sensitivity to the sun, or, in some cases, skin darkening. [1] X Research source In addition, hydroquinone may also cause your sweat to have an unpleasant fishy smell. [2] X Research source Because of its side effects and potential risk as a carcinogen, hydroquinone and products containing hydroquinone are banned in the UK. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If you live somewhere you can purchase hydroquinone, do not plan to use it for more than 4-8 weeks at a time. You can buy creams containing up to 2% hydroquinone over-the-counter, but you'll need a prescription for creams up to 6%. If you use hydroquinone, protect yourself from the sun. Wear SPF 30 sunscreen every day and avoid being outdoors between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., when the sun's rays are the strongest."

Typically, you'll apply the product to clean, dry skin once a day.

You may also need to wear SPF 30 sunscreen each day, and avoid going outside at mid-day. Do not use tretinoin if you are pregnant. You may see improvement in hyperpigmentation after 4-6 weeks with a daily application of tretinoin. Those effects will continue to improve up to at least a year.
