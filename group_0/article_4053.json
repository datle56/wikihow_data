Bleach powder comes in either packets or tubs; it can be more economical to buy a tub if you're planning on bleaching your hair more than once. You'll also need a tint brush (for applying products), a bowl, and plastic wrap. Developer. Developers come in strengths ranging from 10 to 40. If your hair is blonde or light brown, use a 20 or 30 volume developer. If your hair is black or very dark, you may need 40 volume developer; this is very damaging so try to avoid if possible. The lower the volume, the less damaging it is to hair. If you aren’t sure what strength to use for your hair, go with a 20-volume developer."

Normally the instructions will tell you to add bleach powder and developer at a 1:1 ratio, but you can double check your product for specifics. [1] X Research source Put the powder in a mixing bowl and mix in the correct ratio of developer using a spatula or spoon. Bleach powder and developer is usually measured in scoops, meaning you use the plastic scooper that comes with a tub of bleach powder. For a 1:1 ratio, you’d mix 1 scoop of bleach powder and 1 scoop of developer. The mixture will not look blonde; it should be blueish-white or blue. It also shouldn’t be too soupy or too thick. It should have a consistency like gravy. If you're using it, now is the time to mix in the red gold color corrector. Follow the instructions on the bottle."

      "content": "Apply the bleach to completely dry hair. Use the tinting brush to paint on the mixture, one section at a time. Really saturate your hair with the mixture. Work from the ends of your hair up to within a few inches of the roots – these come last because they tend to process the bleach more quickly. To avoid hot roots, do not put bleach near your scalp while working with the ends of your hair. If you have dark hair, wait 20 minutes after applying the bleach to your ends before putting it on the roots. Keep a towel nearby to wipe bleach off your face or arms."

If your hair still looks dark, reapply a little bleach to the section you wiped off, and let the bleach sit in your hair for another 10 minutes. The bleach will cause your head to feel warm; it may sting. If it gets painful, wash it out immediately."
