      "title": "Don’t try to break in your skates all at once.",
      "content": "Don’t try to break in your skates all at once. You should not try to break in your new figure skates during a multi-hour practice session. This can cause discomfort and possible injury to your feet and ankles. Instead of trying to break the skates in all at once, break them in over the course of a few weeks during several 30 minute sessions."

      "title": "Don’t lace up the top hooks.",
      "content": "Don’t lace up the top hooks. When breaking in a new pair of figure skates, abstain from lacing up the top pair of hooks while you are breaking in the skates. Instead, tie the laces just below the top hooks. This can help make the figure skates more comfortable while you are breaking them in."

      "title": "Practice movements that require you to bend your knees and ankles.",
      "content": "Practice movements that require you to bend your knees and ankles. Deep bending motions will help you break in a new pair of figure skates. For example, movements that require you to bend your knees and ankles will help soften the leather and break in the skates. Try doing back crossovers in both directions."

      "title": "Allow at least six hours to break in new skates.",
      "content": "Allow at least six hours to break in new skates. It takes time to break in a new pair of figure skates. It is best to break the skates in over several skating sessions. You will need to skate in the new boots for a total of at least six, but up to eight, hours."

    {
      "title": "Wear your new skates around the house.",
      "content": "Wear your new skates around the house. Another way to speed up the breaking in process is to wear your new figure skates around the house. Lace them up as you normally would and then walk around the house. You can also leave them on while watching television or reading, which can help the leather shape to your foot. [1] X Research source While wearing the skates around the house, loosen and then re-lace the skates at least twice. This will help break in the boots of the new skates."

    {
      "title": "Ask the skate shop to punch out your skates.",
      "content": "Ask the skate shop to punch out your skates. New figure skates can cause blistering and discomfort in the areas where they are tight, particularly around the ankles. Ask the shop where you purchased your skates to punch out these areas using a machine. This can help break in the skates more quickly. [2] X Research source Some shops will punch out skates for free if you purchased them directly from the shop, while others will charge a fee. Call your local skate shop and ask how much they charge to punch out a pair of new figure skates."

      "title": "Break in new skates before competition season.",
      "content": "Break in new skates before competition season. If you compete as a figure skater, make sure your figure skates are broken in well before competition season begins. For example, you can purchase new skates in the summer to make sure they are broken in before the fall competition season begins."
