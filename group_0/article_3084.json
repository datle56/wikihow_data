      "title": "Be there when it matters.",
      "content": "Be there when it matters. Some moments may really stand out in your family, such as when your spouse gets passed up for a big promotion or the moment your young child learns to bike without training wheels. As a spouse and a parent, you won’t be able to be there for every single moment in their lives, but try to be there when it matters most. Avoid missing out on important sporting events, recitals, anniversaries or birthdays whenever possible. If you know it’s important to your spouse or kids, try your best to make it. If you can’t, let them know how upset you are to miss it and be sure you’re there next time."

      "title": "Show interest in your spouse and kids.",
      "content": "Show interest in your spouse and kids. It’s common for many families to fall into a ho-hum pattern of only discussing things like the kids’ grades, bills, household repairs, and who’s picking up whom from sports practice. Strike a new chord when communicating with your spouse and kids by adding some new topics to the conversation. If you never ask your spouse about their day job, ask “So, how’s that big project coming along at work?” If you never inquire about your children's friends, you might say “How’s Rebecca adjusting to the new school?” Changing up the way you talk helps show your family that you’re interested in them and what’s important to them."

      "title": "Be a role model and practice what you preach.",
      "content": "Be a role model and practice what you preach. Don’t expect your children to follow your advice if your own behavior goes against it. Hold yourself accountable for meeting the same standards that you set for your kids. [1] X Research source For instance, don’t lie in front of your kids--even little fibs--if you are emphasizing the importance of honesty. If helping out is a big deal in your family, be the first to pitch in with chores or household responsibilities."

      "title": "Date your spouse.",
      "content": "Date your spouse. When’s the last time you took your spouse out on a date? When were you last romantic and spontaneous? If it’s been a while, commit to dating your spouse more often. Compare schedules and agree on dates and times when the two of you will go out together sans kids. [2] X Research source Dating your spouse also refers to behaviors you did when you were dating. For example, maybe you made them breakfast in bed or regularly purchased a bouquet of flowers to surprise them. Pick those romantic habits back up and watch how your marriage transforms."

      "content": "Encourage open and honest communication. The best husbands and fathers regularly talk to and listen to their spouse and children. When your family feels like you actively make time to hear them out, they will be more forthcoming with communication. Good communication starts early on, so try to implement positive practices as soon as possible. [3] X Research source Power off your phone or mute the TV and turn to face your loved one when they are talking. Let your loved ones know that you are interested in talking to them by making yourself available and paying attention when they’re around. Ask open-ended questions to show your interest, like “So what do you like most about this TV show?”"

So, you could probably benefit from freshening up your listening skills. Practice devoting your full attention to your loved ones when they're talking—this one tip could benefit your entire family. [4] X Research source Turn to face the person who's talking and make regular eye contact. Nod or encourage them to share. Before you rush to the next subject or end the discussion, sum up what was said to show you were actually listening. Say something like “It seems like work has you stressed out. Am I right?”"

      "content": "Avoid judging or criticizing. A common barrier for effective communication is jumping in with judgments or criticisms. When you do this, your spouse and kids put up walls and are hesitant to talk to you. Instead of judging or criticizing, ask more questions that help you better understand their perspectives. [5] X Research source For instance, don’t ask “Why would you do that?,” ask “What happened?” Or, say something like, \"Hmm...Tell me more about that.\""

      "content": "Use meal times for conversation. Meals are a special way for families to come together. Eating meals together promotes bonding and fosters communication. Dedicate this time for catching up on one another's days or discussing important issues. Take turns going around the table having everyone share the \"peaks and pits\" (highs and lows) of their day. Take advantage of everyone's presence to share family values or broach difficult subjects with your children, such as bullying."

      "content": "Be a team player. Your behavior should reflect the notion that you and your spouse are on the same team. This covers basically everything from splitting household and parenting duties to backing up your spouse when they discipline the children. [6] X Research source If you aren’t currently being a team player, you might ask your spouse, “What can I do to be a team player?” Being a team player helps you to support your spouse, but it will also reduce conflict between you and minimize the kids’ chances of undermining either of you. When you and your spouse do inevitably have conflict, try communicating openly and honestly and listening to their perspective. If you can’t resolve things, attempt couples counseling. However, try to resolve the issue directly first.

This might include celebrating Hanukkah, attending church services, praying, or exchanging gifts on Christmas. Show respect to existing family beliefs and traditions and create new ones that are distinct to your family unit. If you and your spouse have the same views, share those beliefs with your children. If your views differ, find a happy medium so that your children have an understanding of both your backgrounds and beliefs. You can also try blending or alternating celebrations from both traditions."

If you’re the type to immediately turn on the TV or laptop after a long day at work, try powering off the electronics for a while.
