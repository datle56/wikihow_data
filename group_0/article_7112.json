    {
      "title": "Shift your gaze around.",
      "content": "Shift your gaze around. Staring makes it obvious that you're checking a girl out. Instead of keeping your eyes on her, pretend like you're looking around the room naturally. As you're moving your head and eyes around, sneak looks at the girl that you want to check out. For instance if you notice her at a sporting event, you can pretend to watch the game but steal looks at her instead. If you share the same lunch period you can act like you're looking around the cafeteria or looking at your friends, when you're really checking her out."

    {
      "title": "Wear sunglasses to obscure your eyes.",
      "content": "Wear sunglasses to obscure your eyes. Sunglasses will hide where you're looking and enable you to check out a girl without her thinking that you're looking directly at her. If you want to use sunglasses, make sure that you get ones with dark or reflective lenses so that she can't see your eyes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch her from afar.",
      "content": "Watch her from afar. If you're far enough away from the girl, she won't be able to see your eyes or where you're looking. If you don't want her to notice you, wait for her to walk at least five feet (1.5 m) away before turning to look at her. Don't follow the girl around, just check her out when she's around you. Avoid doing this repeatedly or she and her friends may think you're creepy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your peripheral vision.",
      "content": "Use your peripheral vision. Instead of looking directly in the girl's direction, you can use your side vision, or your peripheral vision, to check them out. You can practice this in your room by keeping your head straight and trying to look at things on the side of you. Instead of turning your head or facing the girl, look at her from the side."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check her out quickly.",
      "content": "Check her out quickly. There's no reason why you need to stare at someone. Instead, just take a quick glance, check her out, and then look at something else. If you check her out for too long, it could come off as creepy and isn't a habit you want to get into. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Pretend that you're reading.",
      "content": "Pretend that you're reading. Put a book or a newspaper in front of you and pretend that you're reading it. When the girl comes near you or walks past you, you can lift your gaze and check her out without her noticing. If you pull it off correctly, she'll just think that you were reading."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look at her while she's preoccupied.",
      "content": "Look at her while she's preoccupied. If the girl's concentration is on something else, she won't be looking at you and you can check her out without her noticing. She could be talking to someone else, eating, exercising, or her head could be turned. Just make sure that her attention is on something else so that she doesn't catch you checking her out.

    },
    {
      "title": "Create a distraction.",
      "content": "Create a distraction. If the girl's attention isn't on anything, you can create a distraction to misdirect her. Drop something on the ground or ask her to help you with homework and then check her out while she's concentrating on it. You can also ask her opinion of a piece of art, show, or event, and then sneak a look at her."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pretend that there's a reason to be around her.",
      "content": "Pretend that there's a reason to be around her. Try to come up with valid excuses of why you might need to be around her. Group up with her for group projects or try to sit next to her if you share classes together. If she regularly shops at a certain place, you can start shopping there so that you have more opportunities and excuses to be around her."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't make the girl feel uncomfortable.",
      "content": "Don't make the girl feel uncomfortable. If you keep checking the girl out and staring at her, it could make her feel uncomfortable and threatened. If the girl looks or tells you that she feels uncomfortable, stop looking at her and walk away."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apologize and stop checking her out if she catches you.",
      "content": "Apologize and stop checking her out if she catches you. If the girl catches you, don't try to avoid the situation. Instead, admit that you were checking her out, apologize, and stop doing it. She will appreciate your honesty and your apology. You can say something like, \"I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to stare; I just think you’re really pretty. I won't anymore.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Introduce yourself to the girl instead of checking her out.",
      "content": "Introduce yourself to the girl instead of checking her out. If you think a girl is pretty and want to look at her, you can introduce yourself to her. Go up to her and introduce yourself by telling her your name and then asking for hers. Take a look at her body language. If she seems interested in talking to you more, make small talk with her. You can say something like \"Hey, my name is Dan. What's your name?\""

      "title": "Look at girls in the eye.",
      "content": "Look at girls in the eye. Instead of checking out a girl, you should really try looking them in the face or the eyes. This shows respect and is a gesture that girls can reciprocate. If you have a bad habit of looking at women in an inappropriate way, try looking at them in the face more often."

      "title": "Don't check out girls around your significant other.",
      "content": "Don't check out girls around your significant other. If you're checking out girls around your significant other, it can do more than just make the girl that you're checking out feel uncomfortable. It can also cause your significant other to get jealous and mad at you. Avoid checking out girls around your significant other or keep it as stealthy and unnoticeable as you can.
