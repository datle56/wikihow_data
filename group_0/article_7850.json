Set aside any pieces with stickers or printed patterns, as well as any multi-part units that are not meant to be separated, such as turntables. Scrub these with a dry towel, or remove serious grime using a new toothbrush. Delicate electrical parts can be cleaned using alcohol wipes instead."

[7] X Research source If no bubbles form on the pieces after an hour, the hydrogen peroxide has broken down into mostly water. Dispose of the liquid down the drain and try again with a new bottle."
