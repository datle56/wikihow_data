Remove the capsule container and dump all the used capsules into your trash. Then, pour out any liquid left in the drip tray. Replace the components and turn your machine on. [1] X Research source The capsule container and drip tray are usually located on the side or back of your Nespresso machine, but check your model’s instruction manual for its exact location."

      "content": "Fill the reservoir with either descaling solution or white vinegar. Nespresso officially recommends their descaling solution, but many people have had success using distilled white vinegar in a pinch. For the homemade solution, fill the reservoir with equal parts water and vinegar. [2] X Research source Otherwise, Raymond Chiu, a professional house cleaner, recommends you \"Fill the water tank with the suggested ratio of water and descaling product on the packaging, which is about 3 parts water, 1 part descaler. Nespresso officially recommends pouring in a pack of descaling solution and adding about 17 fluid ounces (500 mL) of water. [3] X Research source Alternatively, you may make a citric acid solution. Mix 2 tablespoons (22.8 g) of citric acid with about 34 fluid ounces (1,000 mL) of water. Then, add it to your tank. [4] X Research source If you have hard water at home, then use distilled water in the reservoir for a more effective cleaning."

      "content": "Switch your Nespresso machine to descaling mode. Each Nespresso machine has a unique way to enter descaling mode. Typically, you’ll press and hold down specific buttons to start the cycle. [5] X Research source Chiu states that the buttons will start blinking after about 3 seconds when you enter the descaling cycle. To clean a Nespresso Vertuo machine, hold the top button down for around 7 seconds. For the Pixie, Inissia, and CitiZ models, press down the 2 flashing buttons and hold them for approximately 3 seconds. For the Prodigio model, press the 3 coffee buttons at the same time and hold them for 6 seconds to enter descaling mode."

As the cycle runs, the solution will move through your Nespresso machine to remove any limescale or calcium buildup inside and empty into the mug. [6] X Research source When the solution finishes running through your machine, you may hear it beeping or the buttons will start blinking again. Descaling usually takes around 10–20 minutes. Chiu says that on some models you may need to \"press and hold the button to pour out the water tank.\""

[10] X Research source If you live in an area with hard water, then you may need to clean your Nespresso every 1 or 2 months. If you’re able to connect your machine to the Nespresso app, it will notify you when it’s time to descale."
