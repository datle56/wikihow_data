      "content": "Freeze the grinder for 30 minutes, then pick out the stuck bits. Pop your grinder in the freezer for little while to make any especially stuck bits of bud brittle and easier to remove. [1] X Research source Then remove the grinder from the freezer and use a toothpick to chip out the buds stuck in the teeth. Also, use a toothbrush to scrub any kief out of the grinder screen, if your grinder has one. For a more effective freeze, place a dime in the herb catcher beforehand. Then, once you take the grinder out of the freezer, shake it vigorously. The dime will rattle and loosen any stuck kief. If you’re strapped for time, go ahead and skip this step for now. But next time your grinder needs a refresh, pop it in the freezer for a deeper clean."

      "title": "Disassemble the grinder and tap out any remaining herb.",
      "content": "Disassemble the grinder and tap out any remaining herb. Separate all the individual pieces of your grinder. These pieces will vary by grinder type, but most grinders have 2-4 parts: a cap and a bottom (both with teeth), plus an herb catcher or a kief screen to filter out smaller particles. As you separate these, tap out any loose particles onto a dish to save and smoke later. [2] X Research source Alternatively, use a scraper tool to scrape any kief off the screen to save for later."

      "title": "Soak the grinder in alcohol for 20-30 minutes.",
      "content": "Soak the grinder in alcohol for 20-30 minutes. Pour enough isopropyl alcohol to submerge the grinder parts into a glass dish, like a jar. Then, place each piece of the grinder into the dish for about half an hour. Give the container a jostle to shake free any air bubbles trapped in the pieces. As they soak, the alcohol will lift the more stubborn grime. If the alcohol bath becomes overly grimy or opaque, place the grinder pieces in a new bath to let them soak for another 20 minutes in a clean solution. Alternatively, soak grinders that have designs or decals in white vinegar to preserve the design. Or, use white vinegar if you don’t have any rubbing alcohol on hand."

      "title": "Rinse the grinder under warm water, then let it dry.",
      "content": "Rinse the grinder under warm water, then let it dry. Remove the grinder from the alcohol bath and rinse each piece under running water for 30-60 seconds to wash off the alcohol. Then lay them on a paper towel to dry for about an hour before you reassemble them and get to grinding again. Wipe the grinder down with a cotton swab to speed up the drying process and get back to grinding more quickly. If you spot any remaining, stuck bits of weed, work them out with a toothpick and rinse the grinder under water once more."

      "title": "Take apart your grinder and pick out the weed with a toothpick.",
      "content": "Take apart your grinder and pick out the weed with a toothpick. Disassemble your grinder so that all your parts are separated. Then, go in with a toothpick or a cotton swab and dislodge any bits of herb stuck between the teeth. Use a spare toothbrush to scrub the kief screen, if your grinder has one. [3] X Research source Work over a dish to catch any debris to grind and use later. Acrylic or plastic grinders may deteriorate in alcohol or vinegar solutions, so use this method to give them a more gentle wash. Optionally, freeze your grinder for 30 minutes, then set to work with a toothpick again to more thoroughly and easily dislodge the stuck weed."

      "title": "Soak the grinder in soapy water overnight, then scrub it clean.",
      "content": "Soak the grinder in soapy water overnight, then scrub it clean. Fill a container, like a tupperware, with warm water and mix in about 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of dish soap. Place the grinder pieces in the container and let them sit for 6-7 hours. After, use a toothbrush to scrub the grime and loose bits of weed out of the grinder, wetting the brush with the soap solution. If you're short on time, skip the soak and go straight to scrubbing. You may need to work a little harder to thoroughly clean out any debris, but you’ll be able to use your grinder sooner. Grind weed without a grinder using scissors or even by breaking it up with your fingers while you wait for your grinder to soak."

      "content": "Rinse the parts under warm water and let them dry for about an hour. Rinse away any soap or loose kief under a warm tap for about 20-30 seconds. Then place the grinder parts on a paper towel to dry for an hour before reassembling your grinder."

      "content": "Bring a double-boiler of milk to 150 °F (66 °C). Place a glass dish inside a large pot filled with water. Fill the dish with 2–3 cups (470–710 mL) of whole milk, then heat the pot and dish on the stovetop over medium heat. Use a food thermometer to check that your milk reaches 150 °F (66 °C) and reduce the heat if it goes over. [4] X Research source Only use this method for metal grinders, since plastic or acrylic grinders may impart harmful chemicals into the milk. Using a double boiler ensures that milk doesn’t burn or curdle as you heat it."

      "content": "Steep the grinder pieces in the warm milk for 2 hours. Place the grinder parts in the milk bath and keep the bath at 150 °F (66 °C) for about 2 hours. The fats in the milk will bind to the cannabinoids, at once cleaning the grinder and infusing the milk with THC for consumption later. [5] X Research source Keep an eye on the pot to make sure the milk doesn’t burn or curdle. If you don’t care for infused milk or just want a quick clean, simply place your metal grinder in the boiling water for 5-10 minutes to dislodge the weed particles."

      "title": "Rinse the grinder parts under warm water and strain out the milk.",
      "content": "Rinse the grinder parts under warm water and strain out the milk. Rinse each part for 1-2 minutes to remove the milk, and use a spare toothbrush to scrub away any remaining debris. Set the parts on a paper towel to dry for about an hour. While they dry, strain the milk into a glass container to cool for 1-2 hours in the fridge before consumption. [6] X Research source Drink your THC-infused milk straight, or use it to make weed cookies or even make weed brownies to add a special boost to your homemade edibles. Just substitute it in equal amounts for regular milk. Dispose of any strained weed particles in the trash."
