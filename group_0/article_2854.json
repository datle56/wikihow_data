      "content": "Running water can mask your love-making. Invite your partner to join you in the bathroom. If you’re living with children or houseguests, pick a time when not as many people are angling to use the shower. [4] X Research source Be really careful whenever you have shower sex. For your safety, place a non-slip mat on the floor ahead of time. Since condoms don’t hold up well in the shower, double-check that you have another pregnancy/STI prevention measure at the ready.

      "content": "The floor eliminates the squeaky mattress factor. Drape a big quilt or other comfy bedding on the floor before things get hot and heavy. On the floor, you don’t have to worry about noisy mattress springs or creaking bed frames as you get intimate. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Breathing through your mouth is a lot louder than nose-breathing.",
      "content": "Breathing through your mouth is a lot louder than nose-breathing. As things get hot and heavy, try to focus on breathing through your nose instead of panting and gasping from your mouth. Plus, experts agree that nose-breathing can actually make the sex even better. When you breathe through your nose, your diaphragm and pelvic floor work a little differently, so your orgasm might feel even better."

      "content": "Slow sex can cut down on the screams and yells. Take it slow with your partner, working your way up to an orgasm. It’ll still feel great, but the slower pace will transform your screams into moans."

      "title": "Music and white noise are great ways to hide what you’re really up to.",
      "content": "Music and white noise are great ways to hide what you’re really up to. Pick out some background music before you head to bed, so nearby neighbors, houseguests, and/or children won’t be the wiser. [7] X Research source A white noise machine can also do the trick. In a pinch, turn on the TV for some extra noise. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Spice things up with a gag.",
      "content": "Spice things up with a gag. Gags may be on the kinky side, but they’re great at lowering the volume while you’re in bed. If you don’t have an actual gag on hand, a tie or sock will do the trick as you and your partner get intimate. [9] X Research source To use a ball gag, place the center of the gag in your mouth. Then, secure both straps along the back of your head. [10] X Research source It’s okay if you don’t have a gag! Biting your hand or covering your mouth are other simple, effective ways to cut down on the noise."

      "content": "Kissing is a great way to mask an orgasm. Making noise is a natural, expected part of sex, but it isn’t ideal when there are other people around. Right when you climax, kiss your partner instead of yelling out. This also adds a sexy, passionate touch to the end of your love-making. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Positions like spooning are a lot less noisy. Experts also agree that 69-ing is a great, quiet way to have sex.
