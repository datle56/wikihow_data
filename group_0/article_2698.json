Glasses that are too big for your face will throw off your facial symmetry and make onlookers wonder why you didn’t choose a more flattering shape for your frames. You should use your frames to help balance out the less distinct features of your face or to detract attention away from your more prominent features. Some suggestions for the four most common face shapes include: Round shaped faces can benefit from frames that have strong, noticeable details. The lens shape should be wider than tall. Nose pads are also a must, as these will keep your frames from accentuating your already round cheeks too much. Square shaped faces should consider frames that soften your natural sharp angles in the jaw and elongate your relatively short facial height. Frames that are wider than they are deep are an excellent choice, as well as lenses that are wide and thin. Oval faces are usually considered to be naturally balanced. To preserve this balance, you should find glasses with frames that match the wideness of the broadest part of your face. You might also find that frames with a walnut shape keep your facial features nice and balanced. Heart shaped faces will benefit from frames that are wider at the bottom than the top. Add to this style of frame a rimless border and you should notice a lighter look in your glasses that lessens the natural wideness at the top of your face. [16] X Research source"
