Pour out any remaining water from a previous brew. [1] X Research source If you’d rather not throw out your coffee grounds after every pot, compost them and use them in your garden later—coffee grounds are a great source of supplemental nutrients for plants."

Then, make sure there aren’t any coffee grounds stuck inside of the basket filter. If there are grounds, wash the basket with soap and then rinse it with water. Place the basket back in the coffee maker when all of the grounds have been removed. [2] X Research source Wash your coffee maker after each use with soap and warm water to keep it clean and ready for the next pot of coffee."

Don’t use more vinegar than water; too much vinegar can damage the internals of your coffee maker. [3] X Research source If your machine’s manual has a cautionary note about using vinegar, or you’re hesitant to use that much vinegar, dilute the mixture to 1 part vinegar to 3 parts water to weaken the mixture. Alternatively, use a mixture of 1 part water and 1 part lemon juice. [4] X Research source"

Turn off the coffee maker halfway through the brew cycle, when the carafe is halfway full. [5] X Research source If your coffee machine has it, use the built-in clean cycle instead (which typically has a dedicated button). An automated clean cycle usually starts and stops intermittently, allowing different parts of the machine to soak in the solution."

[7] X Research source You may see brown or white bits in the water. This is normal and means the vinegar solution is doing its job, removing residue from within the machine. Use this same method to clean a Keurig coffee maker —just brew the vinegar solution directly into a mug 3-5 times, discarding the brewed liquid after each cup."

[11] X Research source Alternatively, use a spray bottle to spritz the outside of the machine with pure white vinegar, then wipe it down with a microfiber cloth and rinse it with a damp paper towel, for a more thorough clean. Also wipe down the hot plate—just give it 30 minutes to 1 hour to cool down, first! Use a Q-tip to clean heard-to-reach places, like corners or metal detailing."
