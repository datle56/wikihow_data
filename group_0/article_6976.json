      "content": "Cut the smaller end off of a USB phone cord. Grab an old iPhone or Android cord, or use any other micro-USB charging cable with a USB plug. Then, take a pair of scissors and cut off the end of the cord that plugs into your phone, leaving the USB end intact. [1] X Research source If you’re using a damaged USB phone cord, cut off the damaged portion. Throw the cut end of the cord away. Warning : Ensure the phone cord is unplugged before cutting it. Cutting the cord while it’s plugged in can give you an electrical shock."

      "content": "Cut off 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) of the cord’s insulation. Phone charging cords are covered in insulation that protects the wires inside; you need to expose the wires to charge your JUUL. Use your scissors to cut a circle around the cord’s casing, being careful not to cut through the wires. Then, pull the insulation off the cord. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Strip ¼ to ½ inch (0.6-1.3 cm) of insulation off the red and black wires.",
      "content": "Strip ¼ to ½ inch (0.6-1.3 cm) of insulation off the red and black wires. Separate the red and black wires from any other wires inside the phone cord. Then, place the tip of your scissors around the red and black wires’ insulation and carefully scrape off the plastic covering. This fully exposes the copper wires. [3] X Research source Your phone charging cable might contain green and white wires, which you don’t need. Either snip them off or fold them back against the cord. Note : The black wire might be in a silver casing in some phone charging cords."

      "title": "Set the red and black wires against the opposite ends of the JUUL’s bottom.",
      "content": "Set the red and black wires against the opposite ends of the JUUL’s bottom. Separate the red and black wires so they form a “V” shape. Then, lay your JUUL device on a flat surface so the charging light faces up. Position the red wire against the left-most contact on the bottom of the JUUL and the black wire against the right-most contact. [4] X Research source It’s okay to place the red wire against the right contact and the black wire against the left contact. Just make sure the wires are separated and touching the contacts at the edge. You may need to position your JUUL device differently so the wires don’t fall out. Warning : Do not let the red and black wires touch when the cord is plugged in, as this can create an electrical spark."

      "title": "Plug the cord into a USB wall charger or power bank.",
      "content": "Plug the cord into a USB wall charger or power bank. Insert the USB end of the phone cord into a wall charger or a portable battery. Do not use a laptop or other electronic device; this can cause a short circuit and damage your device. [5] X Research source Make sure your power source is nearby so you can adjust the wires if needed. Warning : Do not leave your new JUUL charger plugged in when you're not using it. The live, exposed wires can start a fire."

      "title": "Secure the wires in place with tape or a heavy object.",
      "content": "Secure the wires in place with tape or a heavy object. To hold the wires against the bottom of the JUUL, place your scissors, a utensil, or another heavy object over the wires. Or, secure them in place with electrical tape. When your JUUL is charging, the light on the front of the device illuminates. [6] X Research source If the JUUL’s light doesn’t start blinking, plug the cord into another USB charging device. Leave your JUUL device to charge for about 1 hour, or until the light turns green. Warning : Never leave your JUUL device unattended while it’s charging, as the exposed wires can potentially start a fire."

      "title": "Plug the USB charger into a port.",
      "content": "Plug the USB charger into a port. The charger that comes with your JUUL device has a USB plug, allowing it to be charged in any device that has a USB port. For instance, plug the cable into a USB wall charger, laptop, or portable battery. [7] X Research source Make sure the charger is on a flat surface so your JUUL device doesn’t fall off of it while it’s charging."

      "title": "Set the bottom of the JUUL device on the USB charger.",
      "content": "Set the bottom of the JUUL device on the USB charger. The bottom of the JUUL is the end that has 4 electrical contacts or slots. Make sure the bottom faces down and set the JUUL on top of the charger so it locks on magnetically. Let go of the JUUL once the light on the front of it starts flashing, which indicates it’s charging. [8] X Research source Charge your JUUL in a spot where it won’t get easily knocked over. If the light doesn’t start flashing, make sure the cable is fully connected. Or, try a different USB port"

      "content": "Check the charging status of your JUUL device by double-tapping it. If you want to see how close your JUUL device is to full charge, tap the light on the front twice with your finger: [9] X Research source If the light is red , the device has a low charge (0-25%). If the light is yellow , the device has a medium charge (25-50%). If the light is green , the device is fully charged. It typically takes 1 hour to charge a JUUL from an empty battery to a full battery."
