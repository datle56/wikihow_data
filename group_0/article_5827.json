      "content": "Virgo and Cancer complement one another emotionally. Both signs are natural caretakers, so they’ll instantly feel comfortable with one another.

      "title": "Virgo may need some time to process emotions alone.",
      "content": "Virgo may need some time to process emotions alone. As super emotional signs, Cancer men tend to speak from the heart at all times—but Virgo women prefer to rely on logic. Therefore, it can be tough for Virgo to come right out and say what they feel; rather, independent Virgo might need some space to process and carefully reflect on their emotions before they’re ready to talk. Compatibility Tip: Cancer, remember there’s no need to get worried when Virgo goes off on their own to think. Have faith that they’ll come back to you, and give them space if they ask for it. Cancer, your warm and compassionate nature may also help Virgo open up more over time and be more expressive —just be patient and let it happen naturally rather than pushing them to open up before they’re ready."

      "title": "Cancer and Virgo will share a sensual bond in the bedroom.",
      "content": "Cancer and Virgo will share a sensual bond in the bedroom. This couple’s intimacy can teach Virgo a lot about emotion and romance. Virgo women are normally unemotional and analytical signs, so in the bedroom, they may not understand how to let their guard down right away. A Cancer man, however, is the perfect partner to help Virgo relax by giving them all the comfort and tenderness they need. Virgo can be enthusiastic and passionate in the bedroom, but only with a partner who makes them feel secure first. A nurturing Cancer is sure to bring out Virgo’s fiery side! Cancer craves plenty of romance and emotional connection during intimacy—which Virgo can provide by giving touchy-feely Cancer all the physical affection (hugs, kisses, and cuddles) they need."

      "title": "Cancer men and Virgo women may struggle with miscommunication.",
      "content": "Cancer men and Virgo women may struggle with miscommunication. Cancer men tend to internalize their thoughts, while an articulate Virgo woman likes to talk everything out in extreme detail. This can lead to miscommunications between them; if Cancer starts internalizing their feelings and shuts down, Virgo may assume there’s nothing else to discuss—which may, in turn, make Cancer feel neglected. Compatibility Tip: Cancer, try to be a little more open with Virgo about your feelings rather than shutting down. In turn, Virgo, make a point to check in with your Cancer partner, especially when they seem a little quiet. Each sign’s ruling planet influences their communication style. Mercury, the planet of communication, makes Virgo very logical and talkative—while the Moon, which rules inner emotions, makes Cancer more introspective. Cancer is also a cardinal sign, which means they’re an “initiator,” able to introduce new ideas and perspectives to their conversations with Virgo. Meanwhile, Virgo is a mutable sign, meaning they’re adaptable and capable of understanding Cancer’s perspective, even if it’s different from theirs."

      "title": "Cancer’s stable, nurturing nature helps Virgo build trust.",
      "content": "Cancer’s stable, nurturing nature helps Virgo build trust. Cancer men are extremely nurturing signs; they love making others feel safe and comfortable. Virgo women may find it easier to settle into the relationship with Cancer's support. When it comes to making emotionally-driven decisions (like the decision to commit to a relationship, for example), Cancer men are also very firm and steadfast, which can help Virgo feel more secure in turn. Unemotional Virgo tends to be a little cautious and slow to settle into relationships normally, which is why Cancer’s decisive devotion can really help Virgo relax and follow suit."

      "title": "This pair has very different values, yet they're still compatible overall.",
      "content": "This pair has very different values, yet they're still compatible overall. Because they’re ruled by the Moon, Cancer men are arguably the most emotional zodiac signs; they value empathy, romance, relationships, and family. [2] X Research source Meanwhile, logical and practical Virgo women value things like intelligence, a healthy lifestyle, humanism, and hard work. Their values aren’t in opposition to one another, but they’re still significantly different. Both partners are usually willing to compromise to keep the relationship steady. If they can accept one another’s different values, their bond will keep growing stronger. The one thing both signs will always value is the connection they share with one another. So long as they value that love and respect first and foremost, they can overcome nearly any obstacle!"

      "title": "Virgo’s critical nature may hurt a sensitive Cancer’s feelings.",
      "content": "Virgo’s critical nature may hurt a sensitive Cancer’s feelings. Virgo women tend to be perfectionists; they have high standards—and hold themselves to those standards alongside the rest of the world. As a result, Virgo can be a bit critical sometimes. Usually, Virgo is just trying to be helpful—but a sensitive Cancer man may still read Virgo’s criticism as harsh and hurtful. [3] X Research source Compatibility Tip: Virgo, try to be conscious of Cancer’s feelings. Avoid criticizing them; when you have feedback, rephrase it as constructively as possible. Rather than correcting Cancer, offer gentle and nonjudgmental advice . For example, rather than saying, “You’re doing that wrong!” try something like, “Can I show you a trick that really helped me? It might help you get that done even faster.”"

      "title": "Cancer’s tendency to be moody may confuse rational Virgo.",
      "content": "Cancer’s tendency to be moody may confuse rational Virgo. As water signs, Cancer men have a lot of emotions—and because they feel things so deeply, they may get moody or grumpy when they have too many negative emotions swimming around. However, practical and logical Virgo women may not understand Cancer’s moodiness, which can lead to tension between the two signs. Compatibility Tip: Cancer, remember that it’s important to take care of your own emotional well-being ! If you feel irritable or moody, try to self-soothe so your emotions don’t impact the relationship. Be sure to let Virgo know what you need rather than waiting for them to figure it out on their own. The sooner Virgo understands what’s going on (and what you need), the sooner you can work through the problem together."
