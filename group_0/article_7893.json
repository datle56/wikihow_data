Depending on which method you choose, you can use a bucket or spray bottle to hold the solution. [11] X Research source For hard surfaces, combine a gallon of water with a cup of bleach, or one part bleach to sixteen parts water. For porous surfaces, try one part non-ammonia, liquid dish detergent, ten parts bleach and twenty parts water. To use baking soda, combine 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon (1 to 2 mL) baking soda with a full spray bottle of water. Alternately, combine 1/2 cup (118 mL) baking soda with one cup (250 mL) of water and one tablespoon (15 mL) of mild liquid detergent. Borax is safe for porous and nonporous materials. Combine a cup (225 mL) of Borax with a gallon (4 L) of water.
