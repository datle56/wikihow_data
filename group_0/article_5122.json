      "title": "Consider the size you’ll need.",
      "content": "Consider the size you’ll need. A good fit is essential to making sure your adult diaper prevents leaks and accidents. Wrap a measuring tape around your hips, and take the measurement. Then measure the distance around your waist. The sizing for incontinence products is based on the largest figure of the measurements around the waist or around the hips. There aren’t standardized sizes for adult diapers. Each manufacturer uses his own sizing method, and it can even vary across product lines from the same manufacturer. Check your measurements every time you place an order, particularly if you are trying a new product."

      "title": "Think about your need for absorbency.",
      "content": "Think about your need for absorbency. You’ll want to buy the diaper with the highest level of absorbency, without compromising the diaper’s fit. Take into consideration whether you’ll need diapers for both urinary and fecal incontinence or urinary incontinence only. You may decide to use different diapers for daytime and nighttime use. [1] X Research source Absorbency levels vary widely from brand to brand. Incontinence pads can be added to adult diapers to increase the absorbency rate if necessary. However, this is an expensive option and should be used as a fallback method. If your absorbency needs are light, using a pad by itself might be sufficient Comparison of absorbency in different adult diapers can be done through online websites such as XP Medical or Consumer Search."

      "title": "Make sure you buy sex-specific diaper.",
      "content": "Make sure you buy sex-specific diaper. Diapers meant for people with penises or vaginas are different. The urine tends to concentrate in different areas of the diaper depending on your anatomy, and diapers built for different sexes have more padding in the appropriate area. [2] X Research source Unisex adult diapers may be fine for your needs, and are usually less expensive. Try a sample before you invest in a full case or box."

      "title": "Decide whether you prefer washable or disposable diapers.",
      "content": "Decide whether you prefer washable or disposable diapers. Reusable diapers cost less over time, and are often more absorbent than disposable diapers. They’ll need to be washed often, though, and this might not be practical for you. Washable diapers will also age quickly, so you’ll need to make sure you have replacement products handy. [3] X Research source Athletes often prefer reusable diapers because they fit better and hold more urine than disposable diapers. Disposable diapers are best for travel or other situations when you may not be able to easily wash your diapers."

      "title": "Know the difference between diapers and pull-ups.",
      "content": "Know the difference between diapers and pull-ups. Adult diapers, or briefs, are best for people who are limited in mobility, or who have caregivers who can help them change. Because they come with refastenable side tabs, these diapers can be changed while you are sitting or lying down. You won’t have to completely remove your clothing. [4] X Research source Adult diapers tend to be more absorbent. They’re best for overnight protection and those with heavy to severe incontinence. Many adult diapers have a wetness indicator strip to show caregivers when a changing is needed. Pullups, or “protective underwear”, is best for those who don’t have mobility problems. They look and feel more like regular underwear, and are often more comfortable than diapers."

      "title": "Consider bariatric briefs.",
      "content": "Consider bariatric briefs. Bariatric briefs are designed for very large adults. They usually come with stretchy side panels to keep their wearer more comfortable, and to provide a better fit. While they’re usually labeled in sizes like XL, XXL, XXXL, etc., the exact sizes vary by company so you’ll want to carefully measure your waist and hip circumference before ordering. [5] X Research source Many bariatric briefs also include anti-leak leg cuffs to prevent leakage. Bariatric briefs are available waist sizes up to 106 inches."

      "title": "Think about using different nighttime diapers.",
      "content": "Think about using different nighttime diapers. Nighttime incontinence affects at least 2% of adults who may not otherwise have the needs for adult diapers. Consider using a diaper that protects against leaks for overnight protection. [6] X Research source You may need to use a diaper that has additional absorbency to keep you dry and clean during the overnight hours. Make sure your overnight diapers have breathable outer layer for better skin health."

      "title": "Keep your receipts.",
      "content": "Keep your receipts. While Medicare does not pay for adult diapers, their cost is tax-deductible. If you keep your receipts proving purchase of your adult diapers, you can deduct them on your federal income tax. [7] X Research source Keep these receipts in an folder or file together with all your tax-deductible receipts. Make sure each receipt has the specific cost, the date, and the place of purchase of your adult diapers."

      "title": "Be aware of your insurance coverage.",
      "content": "Be aware of your insurance coverage. If you’re a veteran, you’ll be eligible for VA services which include access to adult diapers. The type of diapers covered by this insurance may be limited; however, if your health care provider is willing to write a prescription for specific brands, you may be able to use your insurance coverage to cover the purchase price. [8] X Research source Medicaid covers the cost of adult diapers for people living in nursing homes. If you receive services under a Medicaid “waiver” program, you may be eligible for adult diapers while you live at home or in a community setting. Services covered by Medicaid vary from state to state, so you’ll need to check with the Social Security (SSA) offices in your home state for more information."

      "title": "Look for discounts and coupons.",
      "content": "Look for discounts and coupons. Manufacturers’ coupons can help defray the cost of adult diapers. You may be able to receive help paying for diapers through local nonprofits or community health resources. Nonprofit diaper banks are established in many communities to help support people who need adult diapers. [9] X Research source You can find online options for medical discount coupons. [10] X Research source Discount prescription cards can help you with adult diapers if they are prescribed by a medical provider."

      "title": "Shop online.",
      "content": "Shop online. If you’ve found a product that fits well, provides the absorbency you require, then it will save you money to purchase in bulk. Online sellers often offer lower prices than the traditional brick-and-mortar stores in your home community. [11] X Research source Make sure you’re calculating the cost of shipping when you’re comparing prices. Look for online retailers who offer free or discounted shipping. Online prices may be 50%-80% less expensive than the prices found in supermarkets. Online retailers who mail products to your home use discreet packaging to preserve your privacy. Try to use each product fully given that briefs are wasteful and expensive. Get plastic pants to cover your brief to conceal odor, noise, and to make one feel more confident."
