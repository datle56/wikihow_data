Start your cut with a pair of scissors or utility knife just above the bottle’s label, or about 4 inches (10 cm) down from the top. Cut around the entire bottle until the top is completely removed. [1] X Research source Using a soda bottle will hold 1 plant. If you want to house 10 or fewer plants in a hydroponic garden, consider using a 20 US gal (76 L) plastic tote instead."

      "content": "Poke a hole through the bottle cap using a screwdriver. Set the bottle cap on a hard surface such as a cutting board. Hold the cap by its sides with your non-dominant hand while you punch a hole in the center with a screwdriver. Make the hole about 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) wide. [2] X Research source Heat the end of the screwdriver over a candle flame to melt the plastic cap if you have trouble punching through it. If you’re using a plastic tote, use a hole saw attachment for a drill to make 3-4 holes along the middle of the lid."

      "content": "Feed a piece of twine through the hole in the cap. Cut a piece of twine with a pair of scissors so it’s about 12 in (30 cm) long. Feed the end of the twine through the top of the bottle cap until you have about 6 in (15 cm) on each side. Once the twine is through the cap, screw it back onto the bottle. [3] X Research source If you’re using a larger reservoir, you may use a thicker piece of rope as the wick to transport more water."

      "title": "Fill the bottom of the bottle with a nutrient solution.",
      "content": "Fill the bottom of the bottle with a nutrient solution. Visit your local gardening store to find a nutrient mix meant for hydroponic gardening. You can use the same solution regardless of what you plant in your system. Fill the bottom of your bottle with about 4 c (950 ml) of tap water. Follow the directions on your nutrient solution to find the amount you need to stir into your water. Once you add the right amount, mix the water with a stir stick. [4] X Research source Use store-bought purified water in your container if you have hard tap water. If you can’t find any nutrient mixes in store, order a bottle online."

      "content": "Place the top of the bottle upside-down so the twine is mostly submerged. Once you have the nutrient solution mixed together, set the top of the bottle upside-down so the cap faces down. Make sure there’s about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of twine between the bottle cap and the top of the solution. [5] X Research source If you’re using a plastic tote, use a plastic container that’s 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) deep on top of the tote lid. Make sure to drill holes in the new plastic container so they line up with the holes in your tote."

      "content": "Put growing medium and your seeds into the top of the bottle. Look for a medium that allows water and nutrients to easily travel through it, such as perlite, coconut coir, or vermiculite. Spread 2 handfuls of the medium in the top portion of the bottle and tamp it lightly with your fingers. After the growing medium is added, you can plant your seeds at the depth specified on their packaging. [6] X Research source Each growing medium can be purchased from your local gardening or yardcare store. Any of these growing mediums will work no matter which plants you’re using. The nutrient solution travels up the wick into the growing medium to provide food and water to your plants. Wick systems work great for new hydroponic gardeners and are hands-off, but they cannot support larger plants. Wick systems work best for herbs or lettuce ."

      "content": "Cut a hole in the lid of a plastic coffee container the same size as a net pot. Net pots have slots so water can easily flow through them. Trace the bottom of your net pot onto the coffee container lid with a pencil or marker. Use a craft knife or a utility knife to cut the hole to size so the pot fits tightly inside the cutout section. Continue to shave the sides away until the rim of the net pot is level with the top of the lid. [7] X Research source A coffee container can hold 1 plant. If you want to make a larger hydroponic garden, use a large plastic tote instead with multiple net pots."

[12] X Research source The nutrient solution soaks into the growing medium in your pot, providing your plants with constant water and food so they can grow . Deep water nutrient systems are low-maintenance and easy to make at home, but they don’t work well for plants that have a long growing period. Bubblers can be purchased from your local pet or aquarium store. Bubblers need to run continuously or else your plants could die."

Space each of your plants about 1 ft (30 cm) apart so they have room for the roots to grow. Place 1 net pot in each hole once they’re cut. [17] X Research source Your channel should fit about 4-6 plants depending on how long it is. Hole saw attachments can be purchased at your local hardware store.

Make another 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) hole in the lid of the tote directly underneath the channel drain so the water keeps recycling.

      "content": "Plug in the water pump so it constantly runs. Make sure the water pump transfers the nutrient solution through the bottom of the channel without leaking. The solution will flow through the channel and the roots of your plants to provide them with constant nutrients before falling back into your reservoir. [21] X Research source The nutrient film technique constantly pumps a thin layer of water through the channel so your plants grow without drowning the roots. Nutrient film systems allow for multiple plants to grow and recirculate water to reduce waste, but the pumps need to constantly run or else your plants may die. Plug the pump into an automatic timer that runs every 2-3 hours if you don’t want the pump constantly running."
