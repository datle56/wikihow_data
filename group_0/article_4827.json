      "content": "Consider what you'll be using the base for. Different dogs have different needs, but almost every dog will need the following: an insulated, dry space that he can call home whether it's hot or cold. [1] X Research source Pay attention to these factors when building a dog house: Think about insulation. Remember that the base builds the foundation for the whole house and creates a space of air between the ground and the floor that acts as insulation for the house. A house without a base is cooler during the cold months and warmer during the hot months. Consider the specific elements that might affect the base in your outdoor environment. If it rains often in your area, make sure to use a non-toxic, water-resistant material and build the base high enough off of the ground to prevent flooding."
