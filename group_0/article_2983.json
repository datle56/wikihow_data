      "content": "Do the beachy long haired look . Many California girls have a seemingly effortless beachy hair look from swimming in the ocean all day long. You can create this look at home with a few styling tools, no ocean water necessary. Start with damp hair, straight out of the shower. Create a rectangle with your hair at the front of your head. Make sure the rectangle extends from the end of one eyebrow to the end of your other eyebrow and four inches back from your hairline. Use volumizer spray on the roots of your hair and blow dry your hair using a round brush. Move the brush straight and upward to create a tousled look. Once you finish drying your hair, use three fingers to twist the rectangle section so it forms a pin curl and pin it with a bobby pin. Let the section cool as you spray sea salt on your hair. Tousle your hair with your fingers. Remove the pin and let the curl fall over your face. Use dry shampoo on the roots of the rectangle section and flip most of the section to one side. This should form a side part that goes from the arch of your eyebrow and angles toward the crown of your head."

It can also be done at home with the aid of damp hair from a shower and styling mousse. Apply two dollops of styling mousse to dry hair or start with damp hair. Use your fingers to apply the mousse from the roots of your hair to the ends. Flip your hair over and dry your hair with a blow dryer, using your fingers to roughly blow it out. Dry it until there are no stiff pieces and the mousse is completely dry. If you are using damp hair for this style, you can skip this step. While your hair is still upside down, pull your hair together into a ponytail at the very top of your head. Use a hair tie to secure the ponytail and flip your head back up. Divide the ponytail into two sections and twist each section until they come together. Secure the sections at the base of the ponytail with bobby pins. Finish with a few spritzes of salt spray."

      "content": "Use bronzer for a sunkissed look. Get the ultimate California look by “tanning” your skin tone with bronzer. Use a big make up brush to apply bronzer on your hairline, temples, chin, and jawline. Do one to two swoops of bronzer and do not over do the bronzer, as you do not want your skin tone to look too dark and unnatural. Finish by applying bronzer to your neck and chest, including your collarbones, as well as your shoulders and your shins. This will give you a full body sun kissed look. Another option is to try self tanner so you have a nice, even tan. However, self tanner can look fake and unnatural if it is applied poorly."
