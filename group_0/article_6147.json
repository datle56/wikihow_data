      "title": "Cut a hole in the back of the pumpkin large to fit your hand through.",
      "content": "Cut a hole in the back of the pumpkin large to fit your hand through. Use the largest, flattest side of the pumpkin for your name and the smaller side as the back. Carefully push a serrated knife into the back of the pumpkin so it’s in the center vertically. Slowly saw through the pumpkin skin in a circular or hexagonal shape that’s large enough for you to reach your hand inside. Set the cut-out piece aside while you’re working. [1] X Research source Avoid cutting a hole around the stem at the top of your pumpkin because it will become structurally weak. It may take a bit of force to first cut into the pumpkin. Work slowly to ensure that the knife doesn’t slip so you don’t cut yourself."

      "title": "Remove the seeds inside the pumpkin with a plastic scraper.",
      "content": "Remove the seeds inside the pumpkin with a plastic scraper. Reach inside the pumpkin with the scraper and press it firmly against the side of the pumpkin. Drag the scraper toward the opening in the back of the pumpkin to remove the stringy pulp and seeds. Set the pulp and seeds in a bowl as you remove them. Try to get the inside of the pumpkin as clean as possible to reduce the chances of rot. [2] X Research source You can get a plastic scraper from a pumpkin carving kit from most supermarkets around the Halloween season. If you don’t have a plastic scraper, then try using an ice cream scoop or a sturdy metal spoon that won’t bend while you’re working."

      "title": "Print out the name you want to carve in block letters.",
      "content": "Print out the name you want to carve in block letters. Type your name in a word document or in photo editing software so it’s the same size as what you want to carve out. Try to use a font that has thicker letters since they’ll be easier to carve and you’ll be able to read your name easier. Print your name on a standard sheet of paper when you’re happy with your design. [3] X Research source You can also draw the outlines for the letters on your pumpkin freehand or trace around store-bought stencils. If you do, use a dry-erase or washable marker so you can wipe your pumpkin clean when you’re finished. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Tape the edges of the paper onto the front of the pumpkin so it’s wrinkle-free.",
      "content": "Tape the edges of the paper onto the front of the pumpkin so it’s wrinkle-free. Position the paper onto the front side of the pumpkin so your name is near the center vertically. Put a piece of painter’s tape across the top of the sheet to secure it to the pumpkin. Then pull the paper down as tightly as you can and tape the bottom edge. Wrap the sides of the paper around the pumpkin and tape them down as well. Make sure your name is still legible, and reposition the paper if it’s not. [5] X Research source If the paper gets too wrinkled or you have trouble reading your name, try cutting out the individual letters with scissors and taping them to the pumpkin instead."

      "title": "Poke holes every 1⁄8–1⁄4 in (0.32–0.64 cm) around the letters’ outlines.",
      "content": "Poke holes every 1 ⁄ 8 – 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.32–0.64 cm) around the letters’ outlines. Use a nail or a push pin, and start in the corner of one of the letters in your name. Poke the end through the paper so it goes into the pumpkin skin. Go around the outlines of each letter, making a hole in the skin every 1 ⁄ 8 – 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.32–0.64 cm) so you can clearly see the shapes of the letters. Only poke about 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.32 cm) into the pumpkin skin. Remove the piece of paper when you’re finished. [6] X Research source If you still have trouble seeing the dotted outline, trace around it with a dry-erase marker. You may also sprinkle baby powder on the pumpkin skin, and it will fill in the holes so they’re easier to see. Avoid poking completely through the pumpkin skin since you could weaken the pumpkin."

      "title": "Cut around the outlines with a serrated carving tool.",
      "content": "Cut around the outlines with a serrated carving tool. Use a small serrated tool from a pumpkin carving kit so it’s easier to stab into the skin. If the letter has a gap or space in the middle, such as the letters A, B, D, O, P, Q, or R, remove that section first. Then go around your outline of each letter, making long straight cuts as often as possible since they’re easier to cut. Work slowly so you don’t accidentally break off pieces of the pumpkin skin that you want to keep on. [7] X Research source It’s okay to cut out sections of letters at a time. For example, if you’re cutting out the letter T, try cutting the top horizontal line first before cutting out the vertical part. Always cut away from your body so you don’t hurt yourself in case the knife slips."

      "title": "Secure the center cutouts from any letters into the gaps with toothpicks.",
      "content": "Secure the center cutouts from any letters into the gaps with toothpicks. Only use the small middle cutouts from the letters A, B, D, O, P, Q, or R, so you don’t block all of the light coming through the cutout. Slide a toothpick into the middle of the cut out on the thickest side. Place the cutout section in the gap where you carved the letter and stab the toothpick into the pumpkin skin to secure it in place. Try to position the cutout section so it looks like the letter on the printed design of your name. [8] X Research source For example, if you have the letter O in your name, put the circular cutout from the middle of the letter so it’s in the center of the carved letter. For another example, the letter A will have a triangular cutout that you can stick near the top of the carved hole in the pumpkin. You don’t have to place the cutout section back in the carved out letters, but it may be more difficult to read at a glance. Light will still shine around the small cutout section."

      "title": "Rub petroleum jelly around the exposed skin to prevent rot.",
      "content": "Rub petroleum jelly around the exposed skin to prevent rot. Coat the tip of your finger with a bead of petroleum jelly and apply it on any of the cut edges on the pumpkin skin. Make sure it has a thin, even coat so the pumpkin retains moisture and preserves the carving longer. Then rub petroleum jelly on the inside walls of the pumpkin for an additional layer of protection. [9] X Research source If you don’t use petroleum jelly, the pumpkin may turn brown and shrivel, making it harder to read your name."

      "title": "Put a tealight inside of the pumpkin to light it up.",
      "content": "Put a tealight inside of the pumpkin to light it up. Set the tealight candle on the bottom of the pumpkin and use a utility lighter to light the wick. Place the back piece you cut off from the beginning back over the hole to keep the light contained so it makes your name look brighter. Don’t forget to blow out the tealight after each time you light it so you don’t create a fire hazard. [10] X Research source Display your pumpkin indoors or outdoors to give your home a festive look."

      "title": "Scrape 1⁄4 in (0.64 cm) of the skin off with a linoleum block cutter.",
      "content": "Scrape 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) of the skin off with a linoleum block cutter. Set the blade of the block cutter on the edge of the letter’s outline and push it away from your body so it digs into the pumpkin skin. Push the cutter in a straight line following the outlines for your name. Throw away the scrap pieces of skin as you remove them from the pumpkin. Avoid punching completely through the pumpkin while you’re etching the skin. Continue carving all of the outer skin until you’re able to read your name. [11] X Research source Linoleum block cutters have U-shaped blades that make it easy to carve material, and you can buy them from your local craft or hardware store. The inner skin of the pumpkin will look lighter than the outer skin, so it will be easy to see where you have and haven’t already carved. Keep your hands behind the cutter blade at all times so you don’t injure yourself if the tool slips."

      "title": "Cut 1⁄4 in (0.64 cm) deeper into the skin if you want more light to shine through.",
      "content": "Cut 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) deeper into the skin if you want more light to shine through. While light will shine through the lighter interior skin, go over areas where you want highlights in your name with the cutter again. Keep the skin in some areas of your design thicker so you have spots that are darker than others. Be careful not to break through to the inside of the pumpkin, or else a bright spot will appear in your name when you light it up. [12] X Research source You don’t need to add highlights or carve any more skin from the pumpkin if you don’t want to. Put a light inside your pumpkin while you’re working to see which areas of your name look brighter than others."

      "title": "Try using a Dremel rotary tool to remove the skin quickly.",
      "content": "Try using a Dremel rotary tool to remove the skin quickly. Use the rounded ball tip for the rotary tool and turn it on to the slowest speed. Lightly press the rotating tip against the pumpkin skin and guide it around the outlines of your letters. Press deeper into the skin if you want to add highlights to your name, but be careful not to break through to the inside of the pumpkin. When you’re finished, turn off the tool and wipe the tip clean with a rag. [13] X Research source Dremel rotary tools have a small rotating head that’s usually used to carve wood, but it will easier slice through pumpkin skin. Look for Dremel tools at your local hardware or craft store. Dremel tools work great for cutting around curves that may be difficult to maneuver around with the linoleum cutter."

      "title": "Spray a lemon juice solution on the exposed skin to help preserve it.",
      "content": "Spray a lemon juice solution on the exposed skin to help preserve it. Combine equal parts of lemon juice and cold water in a spray bottle and thoroughly mix them. Apply the spray to the etched letters wherever you cut through the outer skin. Then spray the inside of the pumpkin as well to prevent it from rotting as quickly. [14] X Research source You can also apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly if you don’t have any lemon juice."

      "title": "Set a tealight in the pumpkin if you want the design illuminated.",
      "content": "Set a tealight in the pumpkin if you want the design illuminated. Set the tealight on the bottom of the pumpkin and light the flame. Position the back piece you cut off earlier over the hole to help make your name look brighter on the front. Display the pumpkin inside or outside of your home. [15] X Research source If the light doesn’t shine through the etched letters, use your cutter to remove more of the skin. Use a battery-powered light if you don’t want to have an open flame. You don’t need to use a light with an etched name since it will still be easy to read without one."
