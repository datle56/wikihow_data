    {
      "title": "Say it to her in person, if you can.",
      "content": "Say it to her in person, if you can. Tell your girlfriend that you want to meet up with her so you can deliver the news face-to-face. If you live too far away to meet up easily, try to set up a video chat with her so she can see your face and hear your voice. [1] X Research source Breaking up through text or over social media isn’t super kind or respectful. Put yourself in her shoes and think about how it might make you feel. Be mindful of her feelings, too."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be honest, tell her what’s not working, and say you want to break up.",
      "content": "Be honest, tell her what’s not working, and say you want to break up. Start the conversation by telling her something that you like about her, then talk about what’s not working out in your relationship. Tell her clearly and directly that you want to break up with her. Afterward, tell her that you’re sorry if it hurts, but that it’s for the best. [2] X Research source For instance, you could start with something like, “I really like talking to you,” then you could mention a problem like, “But I’m not ready to commit to a serious relationship right now,” and then deliver the news with something like, “So I think it’s for the best if we break up.” It may feel uncomfortable, but she deserves to know the truth."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take responsibility for your role in the relationship.",
      "content": "Take responsibility for your role in the relationship. Take the two-way street and own up to any of your actions or behaviors that may have contributed to your relationship falling apart. Be honest about what’s not working, but also acknowledge your role in those problems to convey respect and gratitude and so she doesn’t feel like it’s all her fault. [3] X Research source For instance, you could say something like, “I know I haven’t been spending much time with you, and that’s my fault.” Sometimes a relationship’s failure can be more her fault than yours. If she cheated on you, you can still show her respect when you break things off."
    },
    {
      "title": "Focus on the reasons why you want to break up with her.",
      "content": "Focus on the reasons why you want to break up with her. If you’re feeling like you want to break up with your girlfriend, there’s obviously something that’s making you unhappy. Think about what advice you’d give to a friend in your situation to help you come up with reasons why your needs aren’t being met and why you should break up with your girlfriend. [4] X Research source For instance, if you’d tell your friend something like, “She never makes any time for you and you feel like she’s holding you back from being happy.” Sometimes it can be hard to step outside of ourselves and identify a problem. This exercise can help you think about your situation from a different perspective."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tell her you want to take some time apart.",
      "content": "Tell her you want to take some time apart. Ask her to meet up so you can talk about something important. Be honest about your feelings and say that you think a break can give you a better perspective on your relationship. Because she loves you, taking a break may hurt less than just being dumped. [5] X Research source For example, you could try saying something like, “I just don’t feel like we’re connecting anymore and I’d like to take a break to see how I really feel about us.” If you still really feel like you don’t want to be with her after you’ve had some time apart, you can simply stay broken up."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be patient and allow her to feel upset.",
      "content": "Be patient and allow her to feel upset. While it may feel hard for you to break up with her, keep in mind that it’s also hard for her. Allow her to get emotional and feel hurt. Don’t get angry or attack her on social media. In time, she’ll move on and it’s important that you give her space to do it. [6] X Research source Even if things ended on a bad note and you have some anger or resentment toward her, just let it go. The sooner you can move past it, the better."

    {
      "title": "Yes, if you can’t meet up with her, a phone call is okay.",
      "content": "Yes, if you can’t meet up with her, a phone call is okay. While the best way to break up with someone is face-to-face, sometimes that isn’t an option, such as if you live too far away. You can try to set up a video call so she can see your face, but if that isn’t possible either, at least call her so she can hear your voice when you tell her how you feel. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Choose a text breakup for new or toxic relationships.",
      "content": "Choose a text breakup for new or toxic relationships. Text messaging should be used as a last resort. If you can, try to break up with her in person. However, while the vast majority of girls won’t act irrationally or aggressively, if you’re worried that your girlfriend might, breaking up over text is a safe way to avoid a scene or potential violence. Additionally, if you’ve only been on a few dates, breaking up over text isn’t a bad option. [8] X Research source A text message also removes some of the more intense emotions from a breakup. Seeing your face can make it harder for her to handle the news."

    {
      "title": "Start with something positive then tell her it’s not working out.",
      "content": "Start with something positive then tell her it’s not working out. Lead with something that you genuinely like about her. Then, tell her what’s not working in the relationship. Be honest and direct and tell her that you want to break up so there isn’t any confusion. She may not like it, but it’s better than leading her on or staying in a relationship that doesn’t make you happy. [9] X Research source You could try saying something like, “I like hanging out with you, but I don’t think we’re meant to be a couple. Can we still be friends?”"

    {
      "title": "Break up with her if you’ve grown apart or your feelings change.",
      "content": "Break up with her if you’ve grown apart or your feelings change. At the beginning of a relationship, you may feel overjoyed to see and talk to her. But if you feel like you no longer share interests, ideas, values, or feelings it may be time to break up. Additionally, if you just no longer feel romantic feelings for her, it could be a sign that you aren’t meant to be together. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Find a good time to talk so you can tell her how you feel.",
      "content": "Find a good time to talk so you can tell her how you feel. Ask her when she has some free time so you can meet up. When you’re talking to her, tell her something you appreciated about your relationship, and then tell her that you want to break up. If she’s really upset, you can tell her that you’re sorry if you hurt her, but you think it’s the right thing to do. [11] X Research source Nobody likes getting broken up with, but it’s important that you’re honest with her about how you feel. Try saying something like, “I really like hanging out with you, but I don’t think we have the same connection. I think we should break up so we can both be happy.”"

      "title": "Choose a private location so your partner won’t feel vulnerable.",
      "content": "Choose a private location so your partner won’t feel vulnerable. Breakups can be an emotional experience, and it’s not uncommon for people to cry. A private location, such as her home or an empty park (the more private the better), will allow her to feel comfortable as you deliver the news. [12] X Research source Your home may seem like a good idea, but she may feel angry, trapped, or uncomfortable there once you tell her that you want to break up."
