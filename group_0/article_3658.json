[1] X Research source You can even enter go-kart competitions, which are essentially scaled-down versions of race car competitions. In fact, many professional race car drivers begin with go-karting at a young age. If you can win races at a young age, sponsors will start taking notice, and you may be able to jump into professional race car driving."

[2] X Research source That's often the first step to being qualified as a race car driver, amateur or professional, as you get your licensing through the chapter. To join, you'll need a sports physical from a doctor. You'll need a form from the SCCA's website. You'll also need to fill out the novice permit form, another form on the SCCA's website. You'll also need to passport-size photos. You can buy these at a local pharmacy, usually. You'll also need a copy of your license (both sides), and you'll need to pay a fee. As of 2015, the fee is $125. You can also become a track-side person with your local club, giving you the inside scoop. From there, you can possibly move up to car racing. [3] X Research source"

Some of these schools offer 3-day courses for teenagers as young as 13 and 14, but they of course take adults, too. They teach you the basics of how to drive a race car. [5] X Research source In driving school, you'll learn about things such as how to take a corner, how to approach your visual field, how to accelerate and brake properly on a race track, and the basics of passing. Your instructor should be able to give you some idea about when you're ready for the track. If you're not getting the basic skills, you may need to spend more time in school."

      "content": "Learn the basic seating position. While most new drivers don't think about seating position, how you position yourself is important. In a crash, you want to be braced against the seat, and while driving, the seat helps you withstand the forces of the car. Square up your body with the seat. That is, don't lean or twist one way or another. Make sure all of your body that should be touching the seat is, including your shoulders, head, and legs. Ensure your arms are at the proper distance from the steering wheel. With your shoulders back against the seat, your wrists should be resting on top of the wheel. This extra space helps you to make turns without moving your back from the seat. Ensure your legs are the proper distance from the pedals. Like the arms, you should be able to press the pedals without overextending your legs. Press the pedals down with the ball of your foot. Your knee should still be slightly bent."

      "title": "Learn how to steer.",
      "content": "Learn how to steer. Place your hands at 9 and 3. That is, pretending the steering wheel is a clock, place your hands at 9:00 o'clock and 3:00 o'clock, which gives you the most control over the wheel. Push into the turns. Instead of pulling with one hand, use the hand away from the turn to push the wheel. Use your other hand to add control. Pushing, rather than pulling, provides smoother steering, giving you more control of the car and increasing your speed."

      "title": "Understand the basics of shifting.",
      "content": "Understand the basics of shifting. Only place your hand on the gearshift when shifting. Otherwise, you lose half of your ability to steer the car. Also, make sure to only shift with as much force as necessary. If you're shoving the gearshift too hard, you will slow yourself down."

    {
      "title": "Know how to use the pedals.",
      "content": "Know how to use the pedals. Race cars generally have four pedals: the accelerator, brake, clutch, and rest. Use the ball of your foot when pressing the pedal, and press it in one smooth motion. Like in a regular car, the rest pedal is to the left. It's a place to rest your leg away from the clutch. The clutch is to the right of the rest pedal. To take corners on a race track, you need to perform the heel-toe downshift. As you brake into the corner, you press the clutch with your left foot and downshift with your right hand. However, you also need to rev the engine, as the car has been losing speed. With the ball of your right foot still on the brake, you give a small push to the accelerator with the heel of your right foot. After you return your foot completely to the brake and release the clutch, you move your right foot to the accelerator, and you speed up as you come out of the corner. The brake is to the right of the clutch. To apply the brakes, first apply a smooth, constant pressure. Next, hold the brakes until you feel them start to vibrate towards locking up. As you slow down, gradually release the pressure from the brakes so you can turn into your pit stop. The accelerator is on the far right. When coming out of a turn, make sure to gradually increase speed. If you jump in too quickly with the accelerator, you can lose control of the car."

      "title": "Learn to take corners.",
      "content": "Learn to take corners. The best way to take corners is to create the simplest line from the entry point to the exit point. The apex is the farthest point you reach inside the turn. [6] X Research source To take the corner as quickly as possible, come into the turn on the outside of the track. Cut across the inside of the corner, then proceed to the outside of the track. [7] X Research source Essentially, it is like cutting off the corner of a piece of paper in an arching motion. [8] X Research source Use a reference point when taking a corner. When doing practice runs, choose a reference point for when you turn, as well as one for the apex and exit. Doing so will keep you consistent throughout the race."

      "content": "Find money for the race. Races take a lot of money to enter, so to race, you'll need money. You may be able to find sponsors if you're good enough. You might also be able to enter with a team if they recognize your talent and pay your entrance fee. However, both of those options require that you already be established as a race car driver with talent. [9] X Research source Nonetheless, local races cost a great deal less. For instance, you may get away with a couple hundred dollars per day at a local race."
