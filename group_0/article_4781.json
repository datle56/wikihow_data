      "title": "Use untreated wood.",
      "content": "Use untreated wood. To create the butterfly house, you will need pine wood which can be purchased at your local hardware store. Your materials do not need to be perfectly sanded down or anything of that nature. Using raw wood will work just fine. You will be able to create an entire butterfly house with two boards. One measuring 1\" x 8\" x 8' and the second measuring 1\" x 10\" x 4'. Consider recycling scrap wood you have around the house if available. If purchasing materials from a store, ask to have everything cut to size for easier assembling and time savings once at home."

      "title": "Grab the 1”x 8” x 8’ board.",
      "content": "Grab the 1”x 8” x 8’ board. With a measuring tape, mark three equal parts, each measuring 30” in length. These three pieces will serve as the back and two sides. The remaining piece of this particular board will be used as the bottom of the house. [1] X Research source You can customize your butterfly house as you see fit and adjust the measurements to create a larger or smaller version. Using the jigsaw, cut out each piece. Take every precaution when using power tools like this one. Read all instructions, wear gloves and goggles. If you are not trained in using this machine, a handsaw will work as well."

      "content": "Grab the 1”x 10” x 4’ board. Out of this piece, you will create the front of the house, the roof and roof block (the roof block with sit inside the house when closed to seal the unit shut). Measure and cut 30” x 5 5/8” to make the front. Measure and cut 5 ¾” x 5 ½” to make the roof block."

      "title": "Create the slots.",
      "content": "Create the slots. Butterflies will use the slots to enter and exit the house. Grab the front piece you’ve just made (the 30” x 5 5/8” piece). Measure and mark six vertical rectangles. Each should measure 4” long x ½” wide. These can be spaced as you see fit. Using the ½ inch drill bit, drill a hole through the top and the bottom of the rectangles to create 6 pairs of holes. [2] X Research source Using the jigsaw, cut the space in between each of the paired holes to create the openings/slots. You can add more or less slots if you prefer. Keep in mind that making the slots any larger will encourage other, perhaps unwanted, animals to make this house their home."

      "title": "Grab the back and two side pieces (these each measure 30\" in length).",
      "content": "Grab the back and two side pieces (these each measure 30\" in length). Lay the back piece flat on your work surface with a side piece up against it to create a 90 degree angle. Attach the first side piece to the back edge using a screw gun. You will only need three screws to attach the side. They should be placed 10” apart. One at the bottom, one in the middle and one at the top. Use 1 1/2\" deck or galvanized wood screws to prevent rusting. Repeat this for the other side of the house. If a screw gun isn't available, you can use a screw driver."

      "content": "Place the floor. Put the piece measuring 5 ¾” x 5 5/8”, in the interior of the back and the sides. The floor should be flush with the bottom of the back board and side boards. Using the screw gun or screw driver, drill a screw through the side into the edge of the bottom piece and repeat on opposite side. Drill another screw through the back wall, into the side of the bottom piece."

Attach with screw gun or screw driver by drilling through the side, into the edge of the front piece. This is exactly how you attached the back piece, every 10”. Place one screw through the front piece, into the bottom block."

      "title": "Attach the roof block to roof.",
      "content": "Attach the roof block to roof. Remember, the roof block with sit inside the house when closed to seal the unit shut. The roof block will need to be centered on the underside of the roof. Put the roof piece flat on a table lengthwise vertically. Measure 1” off the back edge and draw a horizontal line. Mark the center of this line which is 4 5/16”. Draw a vertical line from this point to the front edge of the roof piece. Also mark a center line on the shorter edge (5 ½”) of the roof block, which is 2 ¾”. Place the roof block along the horizontal line. Be sure to line up the center marks on both the roof piece and roof block. This will center the roof block on the roof and allow for equal overhang."

      "content": "Use sugar. Mix one part sugar with four parts water and bring to a boil. This will help dissolve the sugar completely. Get a brand new sponge and a small dish. Pour the water into the dish on top of the sponge so it is about halfway full. Place the dish with sponge in the butterfly house. [3] X Research source Check the solution daily to ensure it isn’t growing mold or other bacteria. Rather than throwing out the remaining sugar water, store it in the fridge for later use."

      "content": "Paint the outside. Butterflies are attracted to bright colors so decorate the house. Pick a color that will really pop amongst the other foliage like yellow, pink or red. Draw flowers and trees on the house for even more appeal. Be sure to use non-toxic paint. Consider placing a piece of tree bark inside the house to create a more real environment."

      "content": "Plant flowers. You probably are well aware that butterflies are drawn to certain plants and flowers. [4] X Research source Plant a few around your home like strawberry, dandelion or blueberry. These flowers provide nectar for feeding. You can place a few inside the butterfly house too. Aster, clover, honeydew and thistle are great choices. Skip anything that has been treated with pesticides as this could harm them."

      "title": "Keep the house in the sun.",
      "content": "Keep the house in the sun. Shaded areas will not attract the butterflies. They love to swirl around in the bright sun during feeding and mating. Because of this, having water around will ensure they stick around for longer periods of time. Place a shallow water source outside the house. Pour water on rocks or stone paths in your garden."

      "content": "Leave rotting fruit. This may not sound too appealing to you but butterflies love it! Throw out some fruit cores and peels whenever you have them. Overly ripe bananas are an especially good trick. Simply place pieces around the garden and watch the butterflies swarm."
