Besties for life, even if we barely survived senior year 😵‍💫 We’re not just besties…we’re co-founders of the struggle. Senior year was a mess, but at least we were messy together 😭 The real degree we earned? A PhD in friendship and bad decisions. We really went from “can’t wait to leave” to “wait…it’s actually over?” 4 years, 500 inside jokes, and 1000 bad decisions later…we made it! If “bad decisions but core memories” was a friend group, it’d be us 💀 We made memories, we made mistakes, and we made it out together."

      "title": "Write a concise, memorable, and personal caption for your bestie.",
      "content": "Write a concise, memorable, and personal caption for your bestie. According to social media expert Kasey Dunn, your caption should be concise to “captivate the audience in the first eight seconds” of seeing your post. Instagram hides the rest of your caption after a few lines of text, so include the most eye-catching details at the beginning. Other tips to create a good best friend caption: Use quotes and song lyrics: If you’re struggling to come up with a caption, think of quotes and lyrics from your favorite authors, poets, and artists. Their words can perfectly describe your friendship and the vibe of your photo. Include a question to increase engagement: This encourages people to leave comments and like your post. For example, you could caption your photo with “Should we start a girl group now or later?” or “So, same time next week?” Add personality with emojis, slang, and references: Social media and digital marketing consultant Candace Gasper recommends “seeing what’s trending in pop culture and utilizing it in your post.” If there’s a viral song or meme, for example, you could reference it in your caption. Using emojis and slang terms like “POV,” “slay,” or “it’s giving” can make your caption extra punchy too."
