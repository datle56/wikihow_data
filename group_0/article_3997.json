As Quran 3:139 states, ‘So do not weaken and do not grieve, and you will be superior if you are [true] believers.’ Happy birthday! May your faith remain strong and your spirit uplifted!” “And your Lord is going to give you, and you will be satisfied.” (Quran 93:5) “Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while being a believer – We will surely cause him to live a good life.” (Quran 16:97) “Allah is with those who have patience.” (Quran 2:153) “Indeed, Allah is with the doers of good.” (Quran 29:69) “Reflecting on the Prophet's words: ‘Every new day is a chance to begin again.’ Wishing you a blessed rebirth, dear brother/sister!” “On this beautiful day, let us remember the verse: ‘And your Lord is most generous, the Giver of All.’ May His generosity always embrace you.” “Recalling the hadith: ‘The best of people are those who benefit others.’ May your new year be filled with opportunities to serve and bring light to others.” “On your birthday, may you be reminded of the verse: ‘Whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, and is a believer—verily, we will give them a good life.’”"
