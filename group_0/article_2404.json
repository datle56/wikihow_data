Usually, Cernit , Fimo , Premo , Sculpey , and Souffle clay bakes at 275 °F (135 °C). Bake Kato clay at 300 °F (149 °C) and bake Pardo clay at 325 °F (163 °C). [1] X Research source Before baking your clay, open windows to allow any fumes to escape your kitchen."

      "content": "Place a piece of paper on top of a ceramic tile inside an aluminum pan. [2] X Expert Source Deanna Ranlett Pottery & Ceramics Professional Expert Interview. 12 November 2021. Pick up 2 rectangular aluminum pans from your local grocery store or supermarket that are deep enough to fit your clay inside. Place one of the pans on a flat surface and center a piece of ceramic tile in the bottom of it. Then, lay a piece of copy paper or parchment paper on top of the tile. [3] X Research source The ceramic tile helps to stabilize the temperature inside the pans, and the paper protects the clay from the glaze on the tile. [4] X Research source If you don’t have ceramic tile, that’s okay. Line a flat baking sheet with parchment paper instead. Just be aware that the clay may not harden as evenly. Keeping the project covered protects it from the heat, avoids scorching, and contains fumes. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Set your project on top of the paper and cover it with the other pan. Carefully center your project on top of the paper and tile. Then, flip the other pan over and use it as a lid to cover the project. Place 2 metal binder clips on opposite sides of the pans to secure them together. [6] X Research source If you can’t find an aluminum pan that’s large enough, cover a roasting pan with aluminum foil instead. If you’re baking clay without a ceramic tile, place your project on parchment paper and cover it with an aluminum pan. Make sure to use metal binder clips, not the kind coated in plastic, which would melt in your oven. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Bake the clay for 30 to 45 minutes per 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) of thickness. Place the pans inside the oven, making sure they’re centered and away from the oven's walls and heating elements. The clay type and the sculpture's thickness determine the baking time, so refer to the package instructions. As a general rule, aim for 30-45 minutes per 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) of thickness. [8] X Research source For instance, if the piece is 1.75 inches (4.4 cm) thick, bake it for 3.5 to 5.25 hours. Make a few test projects to find the perfect temperature and time for pieces of varying thicknesses, or bake another project alongside your clay creation to use as a test breaker. Polymer clay won’t burn when baked at a low temperature, so don’t be afraid to leave it in the oven for a little longer."

      "content": "Let the clay cool completely for 30 to 60 minutes. Remove the pans from the oven using oven mitts and carefully transfer the project to a heat-safe surface. Allow the clay to cool completely, which can take between 30 and 60 minutes. Bend a test project in your hands. If the test piece flexes before it breaks, it’s properly cured! If the piece crumbles and breaks easily, it needs more time in the oven. [9] X Research source If you think your creation is under-baked, cure it in the oven again using the same method as before."

      "content": "Preheat the oven to 265 °F (129 °C) or to the temperature in the clay’s instructions. Different brands of clay fuse at different temperatures, so read the instructions to determine the correct heat. For instance, bake Cernit, Fimo, Premo, Sculpey, and Soufflé clays at 275 °F (135 °C), and bake Pardo clays at 325 °F (163 °C). Ensure the area is well-ventilated so the fumes can escape. [10] X Research source If you’re using a mix of different clays or no longer have the instructions, preheat the oven to 265 °F (129 °C). The clay doesn’t need to be specifically formulated for baking in a toaster oven; following the directions for use in a conventional oven gives the same results. Consider using a separate oven thermometer to gauge the temperature as some toaster ovens are prone to spikes and dips in temperature. Because of a toaster oven’s small size, this method works best when making polymer beads , charms, ornaments, or small sculptures."

      "content": "Place a ceramic tile covered with parchment paper on a baking tray. Carefully lay a ceramic plate or tile on top of a toaster oven baking tray . The ceramic tile helps evenly distribute the heat around your clay. If the ceramic is glazed, cover it with a piece of parchment paper or copy paper. [11] X Research source If you don’t have a ceramic tile, no worries! Bake your clay directly on the parchment-lined baking sheet (just know that the clay won’t bake as evenly)."

      "content": "Put your clay on the tile, and cover it with “tented” parchment paper. Carefully arrange your clay pieces on top of the paper and tile. Fold a piece of parchment paper in half to create a crease, then place it on top of the clay so it forms a “tent.” [12] X Research source Double-check that the parchment paper isn’t touching the heating element inside the toaster oven; otherwise, a fire could start. This tent-like structure prevents heat from scorching and burning the clay as it bakes."

The brand and thickness of the clay affect the baking time, so refer to the package instructions. Generally, aim to bake the clay between 30 and 45 minutes per 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) of thickness. [13] X Research source For instance, if the clay piece is 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) thick, bake it for 5 to 7.5 hours. Try baking several test pieces of varying thicknesses before baking your creation to help you find the best baking temperature and time. If the clay is covered, it shouldn’t burn even if you leave it in the oven for hours. Keep in mind that it’s better to bake the clay longer than the instructions say to ensure the piece is fully cured."

Transfer your clay creation to a heat-safe surface, then allow it to cool completely, which may take between 30 and 60 minutes before handling it. [14] X Research source The best way to tell if polymer clay is fully baked is to try to break one of your test pieces. Fully baked polymer clay will bend before it breaks or cracks. [15] X Research source If your clay creation isn’t cured all the way, stick it back in the oven and bake it again like before."
