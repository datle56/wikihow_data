      "title": "Help people out during everyday life when you have the opportunity.",
      "content": "Help people out during everyday life when you have the opportunity. While they may not be glamorous, small gestures of kindness at a one-on-one level are a great way to be useful in your community. When you spot an opportunity to make a direct intervention and help another person in your community, do it with a smile. For example, you could help an older man or woman cross a busy street. Or, give a few dollars to a homeless person. Better yet, buy them a meal and chat with them while they eat. If you see someone struggling to open a heavy door or carry a heavy package, go and help them. Check in on vulnerable neighbors and family members, like senior citizens, people with health issues, or those who live alone. Schedule some time to visit and let them know they’re not alone!

      "content": "Listen to the people in your daily life and show them empathy . Our friends, family, and coworkers are members of society, and we can contribute by showing them emotional support. Or, if you need to talk about a negative experience with somebody else, let them share their own experiences, too. [2] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source For example, if a coworker recently lost a loved one, say something like, “I’m so sorry, that’s hard to go through. If you want to talk about it, I’m happy to sit and listen.” Or if a friend is having a hard time in school, say, “That sucks. Sorry you’re struggling so much this term. Let’s have a coffee. Want to talk about your classes?” Showing others empathy will help them feel supported as individuals, and hearing their struggles can give you ideas for broader changes to make in your community that can help."

      "content": "Mentor a young person in your community to build their character. If you’re an adult, you’ve probably accumulated decades of practical knowledge and worldly experience that many young people could benefit from. Mentorship programs exist for this purpose and allow adults to pass on personal or professional knowledge to young people who are struggling with an aspect of their lives. [3] X Research source For example, you could mentor a young person in your area through the YMCA , Big Brothers Big Sisters of America , Best Buddies , or other large, national programs. Many churches or social groups also encourage mentorship programs."

      "content": "Start volunteering at a community organization. Volunteering is a great way to interact with your local community and help out people who are less fortunate than yourself. Volunteering will only take a small amount of your time each week and can make a huge difference in the lives of people in society around you. [4] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

      "content": "Give blood if you’d like to help injured or unhealthy people. People who are ill or frequently injured need blood transfusions, and you can help them out by donating some of your own blood . Many local hospitals will do semiannual blood drives, and local blood banks are always looking for new people to sign up and donate blood.

      "title": "Teach people in your community useful skills to benefit their lives.",
      "content": "Teach people in your community useful skills to benefit their lives. Giving other people practical knowledge and day-to-day skills is a great way to contribute to your local community and enhance society overall. You can help friends, neighbors, local kids, or complete strangers by showing them practical ways to solve common problems. [6] X Research source For example, if you see someone with a dead car battery, show them how to jump the car. Or, teach kids in your neighborhood useful outdoor skills. Teach them how to pitch a tent, light a fire, or sharpen a knife. If you’re a mechanic—or just good at fixing things—you could show a few neighbors how to change a flat tire, change the tire on a bicycle, or repair simple engines."

      "content": "Vote in local and national elections to influence society for the better. If you live in a democratic society, voting is a crucial part of contributing to both your local and national community. To be a responsible voter, make sure you’re registered to vote , research ballot issues and candidates ahead of time, and vote for the individuals and policies that you think will most directly benefit society. [7] X Research source For example, research and vote on often-overlooked local issues like taxation, city management, and county regulations."

      "title": "Pay your taxes in full and on time if you’re able.",
      "content": "Pay your taxes in full and on time if you’re able. If you’re employed, paying taxes is part of your social responsibility. Local, state, and national governments use tax money to improve infrastructure, strengthen social safety nets, and pay public officials. [8] X Research source You can file your taxes through various online sites or in-person agencies in your area. A number of accounting businesses offer help with tax filing, and some even let you file your taxes for free. If you’re unable to pay your taxes, talk to an accountant and see if they can offer any suggestions about deferring tax payments."

      "title": "Support a charity through financial donations if you have the means.",
      "content": "Support a charity through financial donations if you have the means. When you give to a local or global charity, you’re using your money to help strengthen society and the people who live in it. Charitable giving also sets a good example for others around you, because they’ll see you giving and be more inspired to do likewise. [9] X Research source Give to national charities like the YMCA , Doctors Without Borders , the NAACP , the Native American Rights Fund , or the Jane Goodall Institute to impact the whole country. Or, look for local charities that operate in your area to directly benefit your own community. You don’t have to restrict yourself to financial giving. Many charities, for example, will accept donations of used vehicles or clothing. Not able to donate money? Try organizing your own fundraiser event instead. For example, you could throw a community dance party or a raffle where everyone pays $5 to enter. The money could be used to support a local charity or organization to make improvements to your town or help a family in need."

      "title": "Shop from small or local businesses.",
      "content": "Shop from small or local businesses. Small businesses are the backbone of local economies. Buy and shop at local shops and restaurants, or buy gift cards for small businesses instead of massive corporate chains. When local businesses are supported, they can give back to the community more easily by creating jobs, paying taxes that benefit the community, donating to local charities, and reducing their carbon footprint. [10] X Research source So, try ordering from a family-owned restaurant instead of getting fast food from a chain, or visit a local hardware store instead of ordering project supplies on Amazon. When you go to these places in person, you’ll get to interact with the actual people you’re supporting and see how your business helps them."

      "title": "Be more active in community meetings.",
      "content": "Be more active in community meetings. In most municipalities, there is a City Council or similar group that meets to discuss community projects and issues and vote on policies to affect change. These meetings are opportunities for the public to voice their opinions and raise concerns about problems they’ve noticed in the community. Check your local government’s website for meeting details—often, the agenda will be posted publicly several days before the meeting. [11] X Research source The rules for speaking vary by council. Generally, you’ll arrive at the meeting and register if you want to speak on an agenda item or raise a new concern. Then, the City Clerk or another official will announce you, and you’ll have a set amount of time (typically 3 minutes) to speak."

      "content": "Get a good education you can use to help others after graduation. There’s nothing selfish about working hard to receive a good education, whether at the level of high school, college, trade school, or graduate school. Education helps you contribute to your society both locally and globally in ways you couldn’t have imagined without the high-level training, problem-solving skills, and exposure to different types of people that education offers. [12] X Research source For example, you could study farming or agriculture in college. After graduating, you could return to the community you grew up in and help people there develop better farming practices. Or, you could get a BA and an MA in psychology, then open a private practice to counsel those struggling with negative thoughts or mental illness."

      "content": "Find employment in your community that feels meaningful to you. Working a job is a great way to contribute to society, whether directly or indirectly. If you’d like your work to directly benefit your community, you could look for jobs that involve helping local people or infrastructure. For example, you could work as a firefighter or a construction worker, at an animal control center, as a public servant in a government position, or at a local nonprofit organization like the YMCA . If you already have a job, look for ways that you can help the community through your place of employment, such as volunteer opportunities or public outreach. Some professions that directly help local communities include social workers, teachers, community organizers, lawyers, healthcare workers, emergency responders, and more. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Share your specialized knowledge with your local community. Regardless of how much formal education you’ve had, you probably have some knowledge and skills that would be useful to people in your community. [15] X Research source If you’re a finance whiz, for example, you could give a public lecture at your house about managing money. Or, contact the public library and see if they’d let you put on a talk about paying taxes and saving money. Sharing specialized knowledge is a great way to use your higher education or training to benefit society."

      "content": "Reduce, reuse, and recycle goods whenever possible. We all live in natural ecosystems, and protecting your local environment is an integral part of contributing to society. Recycle plastics and try to use less plastic in general. Always make sure to throw recyclable materials (e.g., drink and food containers, cardboard boxes, aluminum cans, etc.) in recycling bins rather than trash cans. [16] X Research source For example, if your clothes are wearing out, mend them rather than trashing them. Or, donate the worn clothes to a local branch of the Salvation Army or other charity. Also, avoid buying materials that aren’t biodegradable, like Styrofoam. Check out this list of common recyclable materials and how to recycle them from the EPA."

      "content": "Conserve fuel by taking public transportation or bicycling weekly. Driving alone in a vehicle wastes fuel and contributes to polluting the environment (and local traffic!). Try to conserve fuel as much as possible by carpooling or riding a bike instead of driving a car. Or, take public transportation like a bus or train to work to help cut down on the amount of fuel being burned in your city.

Go to source When you reduce your carbon footprint and help preserve the environment, you’ll also help the health of people in your community. A healthy public transportation system is crucial in big cities. When there are more riders, the system gets more revenue to improve and expand service."

      "content": "Try planting a tree in a public area to help clean the air. Not only will planting a tree enhance the beauty and natural shade of your neighborhood, but it will also make the environment a little healthier. You can purchase saplings at a nearby plant nursery or garden center. Plant the tree in spring at the beginning of your local growing season. [18] X Research source If you’d like to plant a tree in a public park (or another city-owned area), you’ll need to contact city hall and fill out the necessary paperwork. If you’re so inclined, do a little research to find out what types of trees are native to your area."

      "content": "Use solar power to supply your own electricity, if possible. Rather than getting your home’s electricity from large electric companies that burn fossil fuels and pollute the atmosphere, supply your own with solar panels . Solar panels can be attached to the roof of your house and can generate enough power to supply 100% of your electricity. [19] X Research source If you’d like to purchase solar panels, check at large home-supply stores. You can also reach out to local contractors to do the actual installation."

      "content": "Organize neighborhood cleanups. Cleaning up litter and debris from your neighborhood is a great way to meet your neighbors and beautify your living space. Post online and put up flyers to alert people to the time and place, then grab some trash bags and gloves (and perhaps a bright safety vest if you’ll be picking up litter near busy roadways) and get to work! Organize a cleanup after big events that leave behind trash, storms that scatter branches and debris, or any time you notice litter. There’s never a bad time!"

      "content": "Start or join a community garden. A community garden is a dedicated green space for a community to grow vegetables, fruits, and/or flowers. Some gardens allow individuals to plant and harvest from their own small plots, while others are managed by one team that oversees the entire garden. These gardens provide nutritional, locally grown food to community members (and are a great way to meet your neighbors!). [20] X Research source These gardens also provide educational opportunities and a stronger sense of community."

      "content": "Contributing to society means participating in a community to better it. Some believe that you can only contribute to society through financial donations or by working a job, but this is a narrow view. Even if you’re low-income or can’t work, sharing your time, energy, knowledge, and other resources with neighbors and the community are all ways to positively contribute to society. [21] X Research source Another way to look at it is simply making a small difference whenever you can, whether that means providing money, labor, a small favor to an elderly neighbor, picking up some litter, or just saying “hello” to the folks you pass every day. Developing your own special skills and upright character is also part of contributing to society. Well-rounded and thoughtful people are likely to “give back” in some way and recognize problem areas where they can be of assistance. Every small action is a contribution (not just massive donations or exhausting public projects). It takes everyone collaborating to contribute to a society!"

It’s easy to see how getting involved can impact your community—supporting charities, caring for the environment, and helping the underserved are all very satisfying and visible ways to see how your effort can transform a neighborhood. But did you know there are more benefits in it for you, too? [22] X Research source When you give back, you’ll: Meet new people and forge stronger bonds with folks in your community. Increase your self-confidence and combat feelings of depression and anxiety. Help maintain your physical health through movement and socialization (especially if you’re an older adult). Learn new skills and find new passions that can guide your career choices. Have more fun and feel more fulfilled in life."
