      "content": "The number 690452 is part of a viral creepy internet challenge. The challenge was first invented in 2021 before getting another surge in popularity in 2024 on TikTok. The spine-chilling idea behind the challenge is that 690452 is supposedly a cursed number—and could cause someone to get stuck in a dangerous, near-lucid dream or parallel universe forever. [1] X Research source In response to the challenge, many TIkTok users have posted videos of themselves attempting the challenge or recounting their experiences during the challenge."

      "title": "The challenge begins with writing 690452 on your wrist.",
      "content": "The challenge begins with writing 690452 on your wrist. To potentially experience the chilling dreams caused by 690452, you must write 690452 on your wrist before you go to sleep. The challenge claims that when sleeping with the number on your wrist, you’ll see scary things in your dreams, like demons, dark tunnels or alleys, monsters, and people with no faces. [2] X Research source The dreams brought on by this challenge are said to be like dangerous lucid dreams, and the number itself is supposedly a gateway of sorts that transports you into the dream state. Other theories include seeing your future (or seeing yourself dying) and getting cuts or injuries in the dream that transfer to real life."

      "content": "TikTok users claim you have a 50/50 chance of escaping your dreams. One of the creepiest details of the 690452 challenge is the supposed “risk” of doing it. Some people who have done the challenge claim there’s a chance you may not escape your frightening dreams and will instead get stuck inside them forever; some even claim it’s possible to die inside the dreams. [3] X Research source Some people who attempt the challenge also recommend having someone nearby to wake you up. However, it should be noted that there are no actual instances of people dying from doing this challenge. Don’t let friends pressure you to try this challenge if you don’t want to. Even though it’s just an internet-created horror story, you shouldn’t be forced to do something that makes you uncomfortable."

      "title": "There isn’t any definitive origin for the number.",
      "content": "There isn’t any definitive origin for the number. It’s unclear where “690452” comes from or why it’s associated with getting trapped inside lucid nightmares and parallel universes. There’s no official record of the challenge being created online, just vague lore from sites like Urban Dictionary , which has entries referring to 690452 as a “cursed number” and a “heaven or hell number.” Despite those claims, the actual meaning of “cursed number” and “heaven or hell number” is again unclear (beyond the idea of 690452 supposedly trapping you inside a dream). Some on the internet claim the challenge is like summoning a demon, and others assert that the number comes from ancient witchcraft or a book of the devil—but none of that is based in fact or verifiable."

      "title": "The challenge is fictional, and there’s no evidence that it works.",
      "content": "The challenge is fictional, and there’s no evidence that it works. There are no true risks associated with this challenge, as its supposed effects are not real or possible. Rather, its scary reputation comes from the many people who have attempted it and continue to dramatize it for effect. At its core, the 690452 challenge is just a spooky trend done for thrills (like ouija boards or Bloody Mary ). Some TikTok users claim the challenge worked and they did indeed experience haunting dreams, while others have debunked it and say they experienced nothing. If you see this trend posted on TikTok or other social media platforms, it might come with a disclaimer or warning not to try it because of the dangers, but that’s just done to make it seem more frightening and realistic."
