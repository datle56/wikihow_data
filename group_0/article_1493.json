      "content": "Choose a flesh-colored powder to correct redness. Loose powder that matches your skin tone can correct any unevenness in skin tone. It can also brighten your face and correct redness. If you’re going to be in photographs or want to look more professionally done up, use a colored powder. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Select a powder a shade lighter if you have oily skin.",
      "content": "Select a powder a shade lighter if you have oily skin. When your loose powder meets the oils in your skin, it can oxidize, turning a slightly darker shade. If your skin is naturally oily, choose a loose powder a shade or half a shade lighter than your natural skin tone. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a powder that matches your skin tone for dry or combination skin. If you have dry skin or combination skin (sometimes oily, sometimes dry), you’re fine using a powder that matches your skin tone. It won’t oxidize and should maintain its color. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Shake some loose powder into the container lid.",
      "content": "Shake some loose powder into the container lid. Dipping your applicator directly into the container of powder risks spilling the powder everywhere. Instead, shake a bit of loose powder into the top and set the container aside. You can add more powder to the lid if you need it. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Dip the brush into the powder.",
      "content": "Dip the brush into the powder. A kabuki brush, which has a large surface area and dense bristles, is best for applying loose powder. The size doesn't matter as much as the type of brush. Don’t smash the brush into the powder. Gently dip the tip of the brush into the powder, only covering the top of the brush.

      "title": "Tap the brush against the lid.",
      "content": "Tap the brush against the lid. This removes the excess powder from the top of the brush and works the powder into the bristles. You can also hold the brush vertically and tap the end of your brush on a hard surface to work the powder further into the bristles. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Buff the powder onto your face in small circular motions.",
      "content": "Buff the powder onto your face in small circular motions. Use small circular motions to apply the powder to your T-zone, moving across your forehead and then down your nose. Continue to buff the powder onto your face, moving toward your hairline. When you’re finished, you shouldn’t see any lines in the powder or your makeup. [8] X Research source You may need to reload the brush with powder a second time. If the bristles of the brush feel scratchy on your face, you need more powder."

It will remove the powder without taking off your foundation. [9] X Research source A blush or powder brush is best for removing excess powder. The size doesn't matter as long as you're using the right type of brush. If you’re not sure if you’ve removed all of the excess powder, take a selfie using the flash on your smartphone. Any loose powder will show up as white splotches on your face."

      "content": "Dampen your sponge. The sponge shouldn’t be dripping wet, but it shouldn’t be totally dry, either. If you have a small water bottle, you can spray the Blender a few times. Or you can run it quickly under water and then squeeze it out. The water should be room temperature."

      "title": "Dip the sponge in the powder.",
      "content": "Dip the sponge in the powder. You should only dip the tip of the sponge, up to about a third of the way down the sponge, into the powder. You can add more later if you need it, but if you start with too much, the powder can look caked on."

      "title": "Press the sponge under your eyes and on your face.",
      "content": "Press the sponge under your eyes and on your face. Pressing the powder under your eyes will help set any concealer you have on. Press the sponge along your T-zone and the rest of your face to set your foundation. Then use small dabbing motions to press the powder onto the rest of your face."

      "title": "Reload your sponge when necessary.",
      "content": "Reload your sponge when necessary. If you notice that while you're pressing the sponge to your face, no powder is transferring to your face, you need to reload the sponge. If you've put on too much powder, wet a clean sponge and press it gently against your face. It should remove some of the loose powder."
