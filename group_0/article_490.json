      "content": "Prepare for important meetings or conversations. Business etiquette consultant Carolyn Powery emphasizes that \"first impressions matter. People form judgments within 7 seconds, even before you speak. Posture, professional attire, and approachability (such as smiling and open body language) play key roles in making a strong first impression.\" Take notes and research the background of anything you're not clear on. If it's something major, you might even get a friend to do a practice run with you. Developmental psychologist Leslie Bosch notes that practicing a conversation in advance can make it easier. \"Practice is important because it helps you figure out exactly what you want to say and why it's important to say it,\" she explains. \"Practice also makes it possible to achieve higher levels of performance.\""

      "content": "Speak clearly and concisely. Tailor your message to the person you're speaking to using what you know about how they like to receive new information. If you don't know, ask around—you might work with someone who does. Consider what they know and don't know so you can avoid rehashing something unnecessarily. Keep the following distinctions in mind as well: [1] X Research source Some people prefer the big picture , while others want to know all of the details . Some people are more direct , while others favor a more indirect style of communication. Some people are more people-focused , while others are more task-focused ."

      "title": "Pay attention to nonverbal cues.",
      "content": "Pay attention to nonverbal cues. People may disagree about how much communication is nonverbal, but one thing's for sure—the majority of communication comes through body language, and a lot of that body language isn't even conscious! You can learn a lot about what someone is thinking and feeling by reading their body language . [2] X Research source For example, if the person you're talking to is standing stiffly with their arms crossed over their chest, you might infer that they're not open to whatever you're saying—even if they say that they are. Pay attention to body language when joining conversation groups as well. \"I once tested a theory at a networking event where I approached a closed group, and they dispersed immediately,\" Powery recalls. \"This reinforced what I teach—understanding body language can help determine whether a group is open to new interactions.\""

When you listen actively , you're paying attention to what the person said so that you can paraphrase it back to them. \"Active listening and great question asking are all part of being a fantastic human,\" certified executive coach Jessica Elliot remarks. \"These skills can be learned and fine-tuned over time, and are vital for workplace synergy.\" \"In conversation, I would recommend trying to listen 70% of the time,\" Elliot advises. \"And you do the talking the other 30%. Test this out and see what type of response you get!\" \"People often talk more than they listen,\" psychotherapist Kelli Miller agrees. \"They don't even realize it so I think the first thing is that if they listened a little bit more, I think there'd be more effective communication.\" \"Ask follow-up questions,\" advises certified life coach Nora Oliver. \"Follow-up questions would lead to more clarity and… you might find out something new about them [that] could open up all these other opportunities.\""

This is especially important in the professional context. \"To command respect, you need to show that you value what others have to say,\" Powery advises. \"If you make people feel that their opinions are just as important as yours, they'll recognize you as a good listener and communicator,\" she continues. \"Respect is earned when people feel heard and valued,\" Powery explains. \"Communication, appropriate body language, and making others feel comfortable around you are essential in establishing that.\" If you're asking for feedback, professional certified coach Alyson Garrido recommends \"the KISS model, [which] is what should you keep , what should you improve , what should you start , and what should you stop .\" Garrido's method ensures \"you actually get feedback instead of \"you're doing great,\" which is not actionable… Feedback should be something that [you] can take action on.\""
