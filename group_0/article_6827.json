      "content": "Release the tension on the belt. There are a few things to remember when releasing tension on a belt. For serpentine belts this is done by compressing the spring loaded tensioner. The tensioner is just another pulley that the belt runs over, but only serves to keep tension on the belt and does not power any accessories. Some tensioners can be compressed by turning them with simple hand tools such as a wrench, and others may require a special tool. Usually twisting the pulley clockwise will compress the spring. V-belts do not have an automatic tensioner. They can be removed by adjusting the position of one of their pulleys to release tension. To loosen a pulley, turn it with a wrench or specialized tool. By convention, counter-clockwise will loosen the pulley."
