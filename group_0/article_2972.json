      "content": "The 4-second window is a trick to maintaining proper spacing. You may have heard to keep 2 car-lengths between you and the vehicle in front of you, but that’s actually misleading. Depending on your speed, 2 car-lengths may be too much or too little room. Instead, ask yourself, “If the vehicle in front of me stops where they are right now and I slammed on the brakes, would I hit them in under 4 seconds?” If the answer is yes, back off a bit."

      "content": "Most people actually don’t have their mirrors in the optimal position. From the driver’s seat, lean your head over the center console so you’re looking directly at the rearview. Adjust your passenger-side mirror from this position so that you barely see the edge of your vehicle. Then, put your cheek against the driver’s side window and do the same thing with that driver’s side mirror. For the rearview, up straight in the driver’s seat and adjust it so that you can see everything behind you. If you adjust your side mirrors so that you see the edge of the vehicle from the driver’s seat, you’re actually wasting part of the mirror, since a portion of each side-mirror’s view will overlap with the rearview. By adjusting the mirrors while you’re leaning to a side, you’ll maximize your field of vision. [1] X Research source This should also keep you from getting blinded by headlights and reflections, since the angle will be wider. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Stay actively focused on the road and track your surroundings. It’s easy to just pull behind another vehicle and mindlessly follow them, but it’s important to scan your surroundings so that you’re actively following what’s going on around you. Every 5-10 seconds, give the landscape a quick scan. Use your mirrors to see what’s happening around you on the right, left, and rear. This will keep you engaged and prevent you from getting fixated on any one thing for too long. If you’re on a long stretch of highway with no turns and you’re just cruising along, just scan the road in front of you as far as you can see instead of focusing on the vehicle in front of you.

      "content": "Many people don’t know this, but your rearview mirror has 2 settings! That little tab under your rearview actually does something—it’s a dimmer switch! If you find yourself squinting because of the headlights in your rearview mirror when it’s dark out, flip this tab to soften those lights up. This one simple feature can make you a much better driver in low-light conditions since you’ll have an easier time seeing what’s going on. Some newer vehicles have a button instead of a tab. Most of the time, you just push or pull that little tab until it slides into the second position to turn the dimmer on/off."

      "content": "Instead of turning all the way around for a few seconds, rely on your mirrors. Once you turn your blinker on, check all 3 of your mirrors. This will help you build a mental image of where the vehicles around you are without totally twisting your neck around. If you scan your mirrors and spot an opening for the lane change, do a super quick turn to check the small blind spot on your side. Checking your mirrors first will keep you from needing to look at every vehicle on your side before switching lanes. [4] X Research source Obviously, if there’s nobody in front of you and you really want to be 100% certain that nobody’s in your blind spot, feel free to do one of those quick head spin moves. It’s not a good idea to take your eyes off of the road in front of you, but if it’s totally clear it’s alright to do this for a second or two."

      "title": "A lot of people make a big mistake on left turns.",
      "content": "A lot of people make a big mistake on left turns. When you’re sitting in the turn lane, keep your wheels pointed straight. Don’t start turning the wheel until the exact moment you want to initiate the turn. A lot of people wait in the turning lane with their steering wheel turned a bit, which causes them to overturn, potentially into oncoming traffic in the perpendicular lane! On top of that, if you get rear ended while your wheels are turned, your vehicle will slide into the oncoming traffic. Also, make sure you don’t turn into the right-hand lane when they’re turning left. Not only is this inefficient from a turning perspective, but it’s usually illegal."

      "content": "If your vehicle skids, slides, or you’re surprised, focus on your exit point. Keep your eyes pinned where you want your vehicle to go instead of focusing on how your steering wheel is oriented, or which direction your vehicle is facing. You’ll intuitively feel whether your vehicle is heading towards the point you’re looking at, and you’ll adjust the steering wheel accordingly based on the feedback you’re experiencing as your vehicle moves. [5] X Research source This is also helpful if you’re on a winding road or handling an odd turn. Look where you want to go, not where you are. You already know how to turn the steering wheel, and the reference point you’re looking at will help you intuit how you need to turn."

      "title": "Use the behavior of drivers around you to intuit what they’re thinking.",
      "content": "Use the behavior of drivers around you to intuit what they’re thinking. If there’s a driver two lanes over who keeps switching lanes and tailgating, they’re probably going to be super aggressive if you get too close. If the person in front of you keeps slowing down and speeding up, it’s safe to say they’re distracted, so stay alert! Drivers signal what they’re thinking through the way they navigate the roads, so if someone seems to be driving strangely or aggressively, it’s best to keep a tab on them and keep your distance. [6] X Research source Remember, you can’t control what other people do. Even if you’re the best driver possible, you still need to pay attention to what everyone else is doing!"

      "content": "Driving should feel as smooth as butter if you’re doing it right! Unless it’s unsafe to do so, accelerate evenly as you get up to speed, brake as reasonably slowly as you can, and don’t make any abrupt turns or movements. This is the safest way to drive—especially if it’s raining or snowing. On top of that, this will protect your vehicle from unnecessary wear and tear while saving you money on gas. [7] X Research source Making slow, measured movements also makes it a lot easier for the drivers around you to respond to your actions on the road."

      "content": "Parallel parking can be tough, so practice in your spare time! Take your vehicle to an empty lot and set up two traffic cones near a curb. Pull up parallel to the front cone as if there’s a vehicle there. Pull back to where that imaginary vehicle’s passenger seat is located, and turn the steering wheel all the way to the curb. Then, straighten out by turning the wheel in the other direction while reversing once your rear curb-side wheel is even with the curb-side wheels of the “vehicle” in front of you. [8] X Research source Practice doing this over and over again to see if you can do it in one attempt!"

Always abide by the posted speed limit, regardless of how open the road may feel. Never try to “beat” a yellow light, and give pedestrians the right of way. Whatever the law is where you live, follow it to be the best driver you can be. [9] X Research source Your turn signal is your best friend. It’s the main way that you can signal your intentions to other drivers. Even if you feel like nobody is around, just use your turn signal before changing lanes or turning. It’s a good habit to get into. [10] X Expert Source Ibrahim Onerli Driving Instructor Expert Interview. 18 November 2019. Always wear your seatbelt. Seriously, it’s one of the simplest and easiest things you can do when you get in the vehicle, and it may save your life. Unless you’re using a hands-free device, never use your phone while you’re driving. Not only is it almost always illegal, but it’s extremely dangerous."

Since mindfulness meditation is all about learning to settle your thoughts and focus, there’s some evidence that it will actually make you a better driver! Start by following a guided meditation tutorial, and try to do at least 15 minutes a day. You’ll feel better, and you’ll end up being a better driver!
