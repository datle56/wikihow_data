      "content": "Research the payout percentages on different slot machines . You can find this information online, as many websites are dedicated to telling you the payout percentages of slot machines at different casinos. While the casinos do not make this information available to the average player, some insiders get access to this information and publish it online or in specialty magazines and newsletters. [1] X Research source Percentages can run anywhere from 80%-98%. A payout percentage refers to how much of the money spent on the machine is returned to customers. If a payout percentage is 90%, that means the machine pays out 90% of what it takes in. If you're gambling online, consult trusted online casino reviews to learn which sites offer the best odds. Check out tips and strategies for winning at slots from wikiHow users on the “What are the best tips or strategies to win at slots?” forum page."

Picking higher payout percentages may help your overall chances; payout percentages are one of the few concrete pieces of data available to aid you when choosing slot machines. However, these statistics are taken over millions of spins. Because you're only on the machine a short period of time in relation to those millions of spins, you could see a lot of variance in your winnings. You aren't guaranteed that percentage.

      "content": "Pick machines with the smallest jackpots. Machines that offer a lot of large prizes tend to pay less often, while machines with smaller prizes tend to pay out more frequently. The bigger the jackpot, the harder it is to hit, so you're better off choosing a machine with a smaller jackpot. [3] X Research source This phenomenon is referred to as \"volatility\" or \"variance.\" Double check the machine's maximum jackpot. Two machines might look exactly the same, but one may pay out a 1,500 credit jackpot and the other 10,000 credits. Be aware of the maximum you can win on your machine."

Even on non-progressive machines, the jackpot payout for the maximum credit bet is typically markedly higher than at any other level. [4] X Research source Since you can't win a progressive jackpot if you don't bet the maximum, it makes sense to spend your money wisely by betting the max."

      "content": "Try machines with fixed jackpots over progressive jackpots. There are two main categories for progressive slots machines: “top payout” and “progressive.\" With top payout machines, you can win a fixed maximum amount for that particular machine. Progressive machines are linked together, and the maximum jackpot is determined by how much they're being used. The more people play them, the higher the jackpot amount. However, because of the number of people vying for that jackpot, your odds of winning at progressive machines are lower than fixed machines. Among flat-top machines, the overall odds are generally similar, no matter how high the jackpot is. Sometimes a bank of progressive machines in a single casino are linked together. In other cases, the machines are linked throughout the entire state, which is why they feature a high jackpot amount."

A reel-spinning slot machine typically features 3 or 5 reels/cylinders with symbols and blanks printed on them. Matching these symbols in certain combinations leads to a winning payout. Video slots play the same, but they may have up to 7 reels, each representing three rows of five symbols. Your chances of winning are pretty much equal for both types of these machines. [6] X Research source Choose the reel-spinning machines for a retro feel. Alternatively, opt for video slots for a flashier, more entertaining slot machine. You can even find video slots that feature your favorite cartoon or television show characters. the same goes for online slots games, which are becoming more popular than land based ones Both types are controlled by a program called a random number generator (RNG) that determines the outcome of each spin and makes it impossible to determine the outcome of future spins."

[7] X Research source On reel-spinning slots, push a button marked \"play one credit\" until you've reached the number of coins you wish to play. Then hit the \"spin reels\" button or pull the handle. If you want to bet big, you can hit a button marked \"play max credits,\" which will play the maximum coins allowed on that machine.

Plus, setting a win limit will help you come out ahead. If you keep betting, you could lose everything you've won. For instance, you may decide that you'll only spend $50 while you're in the casino. That's your \"lose limit.\" So you'd stop when you run out of that cash or when your winnings equal $100."

If you'll be vacationing in a gambling town or spending several days to play, it's best to figure out how you'll budget your funds to cover the length of your visit. Here's what you can do: [10] X Research source Decide how many days you'll make it to the casino and how long you'll gamble during each session. Divide your total bankroll by the number of days and then divide that daily allowance by the number of hours you plan to play each day. This will tell you how much you can afford to lose per hour. For example, you arrive in Atlantic City with a $2000 bankroll and plan to stay for 5 days. That allows you to wager $400 per day. You decide that you want to play a total of four hours per day. This means you can afford to lose $100 per hour."

These offers are based on how many coins you play in the slot machines or your rate of play. Compare the benefits of different casinos or sites and choose the casino that offers the best benefits or freebies for your level of play. Some casinos even give some of these points back as cash, making your gambling dollar stretch even further. Be sure you always have your club card inserted in your slot machine before you spin. You want to get credit for every bit of your play time."
