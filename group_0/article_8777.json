      "content": "Place your cut vine in a jar or container of clean water, only filling the water up to where it covers the bottom one or two nodes. If you want to, you can add a tiny bit of liquid plant fertilizer. Overdoing fertilizer can be bad for your cutting, so if you don't know exactly how much to put, don't risk it."

      "title": "Put in a place where there is indirect sunlight, and wait.",
      "content": "Put in a place where there is indirect sunlight, and wait. Make sure to check and refill the water level so the node(s) will keep growing roots. Once roots (at least half an inch long) show, you can transplant the cutting quickly if you want your new plant to begin growing in soil. [3] X Research source If growing it in water, you can wait to transplant put watch out for stagnating/souring water (pour water out and refill)."

      "content": "Use potting material that is mostly peat and drains well. [4] X Research source Whether your plant is growing outside or indoors in a pot, make sure there is at least six inches of soil-depth in which to grow. If using a pot, there needs to be a drainage hole and a water tray underneath. Using fertilizer is unnecessary, as pothos grows fast and it is optional."

    {
      "title": "Water the plant by sprinkling onto the dirt.",
      "content": "Water the plant by sprinkling onto the dirt. Watering on top of the leaves won't ensure all the water gets down to the dirt. The potting soil should be moderately moist and an inch of topsoil; not ever overly wet. Puddles and mud are not good for the plant."

      "content": "Let the plant grow! With good conditions, with a warm winter climate or re-starting each spring, pothos outside can create a \"carpet\" of leaves. You can use a trellis to encourage the vines to climb; just twine some long vines through/around the structure. Indoors, it can create a curtain of foliage if several vines are placed on a high shelf."

      "content": "Make a \"hole\" through the substrate and place the cutting in it. Gently cover the hole with the rest of the substrate. Choose a fairly long vine to be visually attractive. The roots should be completely covered, and an area up to an inch above the roots can also be covered with substrate (remove leaves that would decay in the water)."

      "content": "Fill the container with water and add liquid fertilizer. Only add enough so that the roots are covered. Some water visible above the substrate level is fine, but avoid putting a lot of the cutting underwater. Liquid fertilizer can be as simple as Miracle-Gro. Always make sure that the fertilizer is for plants in water and that you are dosing correctly."
