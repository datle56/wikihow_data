      "content": "Your friends will feel more at home if they know where everything is. You don't have to show your friends every inch of your home, but giving them a brief tour of the kitchen and showing them where the restrooms are is helpful. That way, they won't have to ask you for anything and can relax and get more comfortable. [4] X Research source If you're hosting small children, warn their parents about anything that's not kid-friendly so they'll know to keep their kids away. Point out any places that are off-limits, such as a baby's room, so they won't mistakenly go there later."

      "content": "Turn off the TV and put away your phone while hosting. Unless a TV show or broadcast event is the point of the gathering, it will just be a distraction. If you're using the TV for music, turn the visuals off. Make your friends the center of your attention at all times so you can ensure that everybody is enjoying themselves. [7] X Research source If you anticipate you might get calls from friends who need directions, set your phone to vibrate and keep it in your pocket.

      "content": "Choose light topics that everyone can converse about. Pay attention to the flow of conversation and make sure no one is feeling left out. If a conversation takes a dark turn or starts getting heated, step in and steer it back into happier, more neutral territory. If you stay light and upbeat, your friends will as well.

      "content": "Provide options to pass the time if something isn't already planned. As the host, it's your responsibility to lead the group of people you've invited over. Have a few board games or other activities on hand that you think your friends would enjoy. Party games are especially fun if you've invited over several friends who don't know each other very well. [9] X Research source At the same time, don't force anyone to participate who isn't interested. If you have a variety of games, you can try to choose one that everyone wants to play. But if someone says they just want to watch, let them know that they're free to do so. If your friends are bringing kids with them, make sure you have some kid-friendly toys or activities to keep them occupied while the grown-ups chat."

A good host will have a fresh drink on hand just as you've finished your last one or be right there with a napkin just as you dripped dip on your leg. To be this good of a host, you have to constantly pay attention to your friends and think about what they might need. [10] X Research source Make it a habit to glance at each person every 5 to 10 minutes and assess their situation. Is their drink low? Do they have an empty plate in front of them? Are they looking around like they're looking for something? This can take some practice, so don't stress out too much if you get caught up in a conversation or an activity and let your hosting duties slip. At the same time, you don't want to be too overbearing. Avoid interrupting conversations to ask after your guests and don't insist that they take more food or drink if they decline.

      "content": "Make sure your friends don't leave anything behind. If you took your friends' coats or jackets as they entered, offer to retrieve them when the party's winding down. This is also a pretty good way to signal that you're ready to start wrapping things up. For example, you might say, \"Can I get your coat for you?\" [12] X Research source If any of your friends brought food, take care to package that up or wash the dishes they brought so they can take those back home. Have a friend who's overstayed their welcome? Etiquette coach Tami Claytor recommends that you start by cleaning up as a nonverbal suggestion that it's time to go. If that doesn't work, she advises saying, \"'Oh, we have an early day tomorrow, so we're going to plan on getting to bed, you know, thank you for coming.'\" [13] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 16 February 2022."
