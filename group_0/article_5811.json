      "content": "Determine why you wish to cancel your transfer. Western Union will want to know the reason for the requested cancellation, so be prepared to provide this information. If you believe that you are a victim of fraud, immediately call your customer service number (number found on your national Western Union website). This will ensure that your money cannot be picked up and will be made available for you to receive as a full refund of principal send amount and charges."

      "content": "Gather your transaction details. For security reasons, Western Union cannot proceed with your request without proper verification of a transaction. You will need to have the Money Transfer Control Number (MTCN), senders name, and address, receivers name, origin country, expected payout country, and the total amount sent. If available, it is helpful to have the original \"to send\" money form, as this already has all of the information included on it. You will also need a copy of the same form of identification that you used to send money."

      "title": "Find information about the place of purchase.",
      "content": "Find information about the place of purchase. The original money transfer transaction could have been purchased at a sending agency or online. If the transaction took place at a sending agency, find the location and hours of operation, so you can visit that location. If the transaction took place online, find your national email or consumer line phone number. The easiest way to find this is to access your national Western Union website and click on \"contact\" in the top right hand corner of the website. The email address for your country is as follows: COUNTRYNAME.customer@westernunion.COUNTRY (e.g, if you're in Germany, the email address would be Germany.customer@westernunion.de)."

You will need to explain that you are requesting a cancellation and provide an explanation for your request. This is to help avoid or report any potential fraud. Provide verifying information. In order to verify your request, you will need to provide the following information: Your name, your address, MTCN number, Sender's name, amount sent and the expected payout country.

If you are visiting a sending agency, simply wait for the agent to call one of the Western Union offices, wait a few minutes and then collect your money in cash. Refund requests made on the same day will always include the charges as well as the principal send amount. However, if your refund request is not made on the same day you will lose the charges (unless there was an error on Western Union's side or you were a victim of fraud, in which case you will receive a full refund ). If you contacted Western Union via email, you will receive a confirmation email once your request has been processed."
