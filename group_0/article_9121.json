Le Shan “I can imagine no heroism greater than motherhood.” —Lance Conrad “Babies are always more trouble than you thought –– and more wonderful.” – Charles Osgood “Motherhood is a choice you make every day, to put someone else’s happiness and well-being ahead of your own, to teach the hard lessons, to do the right thing even when you’re not sure what the right thing is ... and to forgive yourself, over and over again, for doing everything wrong.” —Donna Ball “Motherhood is near to divinity. It is the highest, holiest service to be assumed by mankind.” —Howard W. Hunter “(24/7) once you sign on to be a mother, that’s the only shift they offer.” —Jodi Picoult “Motherhood is the biggest gamble in the world. It is the glorious life force. It’s huge and scary — it’s an act of infinite optimism.” —Gilda Radner “What it’s like to be a parent: It’s one of the hardest things you’ll ever do, but in exchange, it teaches you the meaning of unconditional love.” —Nicholas Sparks"
