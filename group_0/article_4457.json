      "content": "Use safety equipment. Concrete removal creates hazardous dust and sharp fragments, so protect yourself and your coworkers with safety goggles, dust masks or respirators, steel toe or other heavy boots, thick gloves, and thick clothing that covers your arms and legs. [2] X Research source If you're going to be using power tools, especially a jackhammer, use ear protection. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Cover the slab with plastic sheets to protect fragile items. Be careful when using plastic sheets, as they can sometimes create a slipping or tripping hazard. However, sheeting can be worthwhile if you're breaking up concrete near fragile items or structures. If you're breaking up concrete in a wide open area away from structures and other breakables, it's unlikely you'll need sheeting. Fragments of concrete can be launched great distances by the force of your hammer and tools. When in doubt, use a cover to protect the surrounding area. If you don't use plastic sheeting, protect any nearby windows and breakable objects with plywood sheets to protect the glass from concrete fragments. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Obtain a large pry bar.",
      "content": "Obtain a large pry bar. Whether you're using a sledgehammer or jackhammer, you'll likely need to pry apart the pieces of concrete as you break them apart. Concrete removal generally goes quickest if you have one person breaking apart the concrete and another following along and prying the pieces apart. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use a sledgehammer for thin slabs.",
      "content": "Use a sledgehammer for thin slabs. If your concrete is 4 in (10 cm) thick or less, try using a sledgehammer. Start at any existing cracks or at a corner or edge, and keep in mind that thick concrete will be easiest to break closer to its outer edges. Don’t try to swing the sledgehammer or lift it above your head; hold it at shoulder-height and let it fall onto the concrete, instead. Use the pry bar to pull apart the chunks of concrete after you break them apart. Then, move them out of the way to eliminate trip hazards. If after 10 minutes you've failed to make significant cracks or you are exhausted, you may want to try a demolition hammer."

      "title": "Dig underneath slabs that are difficult to break.",
      "content": "Dig underneath slabs that are difficult to break. \"Undermining,\" or removing soil beneath the slab, will make the cement break more easily. Use a shovel to clear out the soil beneath the lip of the concrete, then strike it with your hammer. The more you undermine a slab, the easier it'll be to break. However, even undermining a little can significantly decrease the difficulty of breaking concrete. After you’ve begun to undermine, use a garden hose to loosen the dirt and wash it out from underneath the slab."

      "title": "Use an electric demolition tool.",
      "content": "Use an electric demolition tool. A 60-pound (27.2-kg) breaker should be sufficient for most home jobs. Only rent a heavy duty pneumatic jackhammer for extremely thick or difficult to break concrete. [6] X Research source Only use a chisel point bit to break up concrete. This concentrates force, allowing the tool to break up the concrete more efficiently. Let the weight of the machine do the job; it's not necessary to add force by pushing down. Forcing the bit may damage the tool or possibly wedge the bit. If the concrete doesn't crack immediately, stop hammering and move over a few inches. More hammering could get the drill bit stuck. Break pieces 2-3 inches (5-8 cm) away from each other to minimize chances of a stuck drill bit. Use the pry bar to pull apart chunks of concrete after you crack them apart. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Deal with any mesh or reinforcing bars you encounter. You may encounter supports inside the concrete after you start cutting. Deal with them as you separate the chunks of concrete: If the concrete is held together by wire mesh or heavy, welded wire fabric, you'll need bolt cutters to snip it apart. Number 10 wire can be cut with side cutting pliers. Metal reinforcing bars will take much longer to cut apart. Use a reciprocating saw or an angle grinder with a cutoff blade. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Pull apart jammed together chunks with a mattock. If chunks of concrete remain locked together, making it hard to break the surrounding area, clear the surrounding rubble. After that, you're ready to use a heavy mattock to pry locked chunks apart: [9] X Research source Swing the pointed end into the crack between the two chunks and pry. Once the crack is wide enough, switch to the larger flat end and pry it fully apart. Pry up the opposite side of each chunk if they still won't budge."

      "content": "Determine where you need to break the concrete. If you are looking for a broken water or drain line and you can figure out its general location, you'll save a lot of effort and expense. Here are some things to look for: For plumbing problems, try to determine the location and depth of the underground pipes. Look for an outdoor faucet, sewer cap, or use a line locator. For water problems, look for areas where water is either bubbling up through cracks in the concrete or seeping out around the edges of the slab. For electrical lines, you may find you have to locate the conduit outside the slab area and dig up a length of it to determine where it runs. For other types of repairs, look up the construction blueprints with your municipal government or request them from the contractor who built your home."

These saws are powerful and can cause serious injury, property damage, or death if used incorrectly. Always wear a respirator or face mask to protect your lungs from cement dust and always follow the tool's user instructions carefully. Whenever possible, use a wet saw and a steady flow of water to prevent airborne dust and damage to the saw blade. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Gradually deepen the hole. Using the same tool, work the area around the cut, penetrating deeper each time until you've reached the bottom of the slab. This is the hardest part of the job, since the pieces you break off cannot come free until there is a space for them to drop into. You may need to leave tightly wedged pieces of concrete until the adjacent concrete is broken and removed. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Chip inward to make the gap wider. Once a gap has been created between the concrete you're removing and the concrete that's staying, chip further with the same tool. Widen it to at least 3 inches (8 cm), or enough to fully remove the broken pieces. Keep your chisel point slanted toward the beginning hole while you work around the perimeter of the hole, so it doesn't try to penetrate straight down. If the chisel goes too deep, the bit will become lodged in its hole and will be difficult to remove. If a bit is truly stuck, you may need to use a new drill bit to break the concrete around it and free it. [16] X Research source"

Once there is a wide enough gap to avoid damaging the concrete you wish to keep, you can use the techniques described in the section on removing a whole slab. [17] X Research source Use a pry bar as you go for the quickest and most effective results. Do not use a jackhammer or similar power tool if you are near a water pipe, electrical line, or gas line. Remove the broken chunks of concrete from the hole as it becomes larger so you can work more comfortably and spot pipes or electrical wires more easily. Use bolt cutters to snip reinforcing mesh and an angle grinder to cut through reinforcing bars."

      "content": "Search for the damaged pipe (if applicable). If you're trying to find a damage utility such as a water pipe, look for signs as you go, such as water puddles or stains. Once you find the pipe, you may need to continue breaking concrete along its length until you find the damaged section. As you approach the depth and location of the damaged line or pipe, slow down and swing your hammer more precisely to prevent further damage. To protect pipes and lines, refrain from hitting your hammer on the concrete directly above their suspected location underground. Avoid hitting cast iron or PVC pipes with the breaking hammer, as these are especially brittle and can easily become damaged."

As an alternative, you can use a hand truck. You’ll only need to move the pieces a few inches, rather than lifting them into the wheelbarrow. Do not overload the wheelbarrow, or it could fall over and create additional work. Taking more trips with smaller loads will prevent you from overdoing it. Consider renting a power wheelbarrow.
