      "content": "Aromanticism is a romantic orientation defined by a lack of romantic attraction. Romantic attraction refers to a person’s desire to do romantic things and be in a romantic relationship with other people (e.g., kissing, holding hands, etc.). Aro individuals tend to lack these desires, or may only have them in certain circumstances. Ultimately, aromanticism exists on a spectrum—there isn’t a “right” or “wrong” way to be aro, and people can identify as aro in different ways , like: [3] X Research source Grayromantic: Someone who occasionally experiences romantic attraction, but not frequently. This identity sits on the aromantic spectrum between alloromantic (experiencing romantic attraction) and aromantic (a lack of romantic attraction). Demiromantic : Someone who only experiences romantic attraction for someone once a strong emotional bond exists. Frayromantic: Someone who experiences romantic attraction upon first meeting someone, only for this attraction to dim once a closer friendship develops. Aroflux: Someone who alternates between having and not having romantic attraction."

      "content": "The aroace flag features 5 horizontal stripes in sunset-themed colors. Unlike more well-known sexualities (e.g., bisexuality, pansexuality, etc.), the aroace flag isn’t well-established and there are lots of different variations on the internet. One of the most popular iterations includes 5 sunset-colored horizontal stripes: orange, yellow, white, light blue, and dark blue. The orange stripe is said to stand for community, the yellow represents love and relationships, and the white symbolizes wholeness. The bottom blue stripes don’t have specific meanings assigned to them. Most other variations of the aroace flag feature green and purple themes, since green is associated with the aromantic pride flag and purple is associated with the asexual pride flag."

      "content": "You may be aroace if romantic and sexual experiences don’t appeal to you. Take a look at some of the following statements and see if you vibe with any of them at all. If you do, the aroace label might be a good fit for you: Romantic relationships and hookups aren’t a priority for me. I don’t like hanging around places where people might try and flirt with me (like a party). I don’t care one way or another if I’m single indefinitely. Romantic and sexual relationships carry the same weight to me as platonic relationships. I can’t really relate when my friends talk about sex and romance. If I ever experience romantic or sexual attraction, it’s only for a short period of time. I don’t really love reading or watching content that has a lot of romance or sex."
