    {
      "title": "Wait a minimum of 1 week before following up with recruiters.",
      "content": "Wait a minimum of 1 week before following up with recruiters. The waiting period after submitting a job application can be pretty daunting, but you definitely don’t want to be too pushy at this point in time. If you choose to get in touch, try framing your message as a means of confirmation that your application was received successfully. From there, you can briefly acknowledge your qualifications and interest in the position. [1] X Research source “I sent in my application for Data Engineer last week, and I just wanted to confirm that my application and portfolio were submitted successfully. I’m so grateful for the opportunity to apply, and I look forward to the chance to further discuss my qualifications with you.” Try to contact them using the same medium they touched base with you, whether that’s email, phone, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, or something else entirely."

      "title": "Send a thank-you email right after the initial interview.",
      "content": "Send a thank-you email right after the initial interview. It’s good manners to thank your interviewer the day after your interview. Rather than using the email to pitch yourself again, focus on highlighting how interested you are in the position, and how grateful you are for their time and consideration. [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Dear Mr. DeLuca, Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me today, and for allowing me to share my interest in the Digital Production Editor position. It was great to hear how committed [Company Name] is to their employees and their brand mission. I look forward to speaking with you. Best, Damion Lewis"

    {
      "title": "Reach out a week after you expected to hear back from your interviewer.",
      "content": "Reach out a week after you expected to hear back from your interviewer. It’s always a good rule of thumb to follow the timeline that your interviewer gave you, whether that’s a few days or a few weeks. If anything, tack an extra week onto that deadline before reaching out regarding your application status. [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Dear Ms. Liu, I just wanted to touch base regarding my interview on June 13 for Account Director. I was curious if there were any updates regarding the position. It was my pleasure to learn more about [Company Name] and the vibrant company culture you’re cultivating there. In fact, your focus on employee wellness really drew me in—it sounds like such a vibrant and supportive place to work. Please feel free to reach out if there’s any extra information you need from me. Thank you for your continued consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you."

      "title": "Keep your message short, formal, and polite.",
      "content": "Keep your message short, formal, and polite. You don’t need to send your recruiter or interviewer a 5-paragraph essay checking in on how things are going. Instead, reintroduce yourself while keeping your message succinct and polite—at the end of the day, you’re just looking to touch base on the status of your application or interview . Formal language is all about using more sophisticated vocabulary, fewer slang words, and fewer personal pronouns (like “you”). [4] X Research source For example, “I wanted to follow up regarding the status of my application” is much more formal than “I wanted to see if you had any news about my job application.” Pro tip: Your email shouldn’t be longer than a couple of short paragraphs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a simple and succinct subject line.",
      "content": "Choose a simple and succinct subject line. Whether you’re reaching out over email or LinkedIn, a good subject line clearly outlines the intent of your message, rather than making the recruiter/interviewer guess. Try something like: “Following up after 11/3 Interview” or “Touching Base on [Job position] Application.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask in clear, concise words about the status of your application.",
      "content": "Ask in clear, concise words about the status of your application. Make it known that you’re interested in how the application process is progressing. You could also request a professional timeline to keep in mind following the interview. [5] X Research source “I was curious if there were any updates regarding my job application.” “I wanted to touch base and see what the status of my job application was.” “What would be a good timeline to keep in mind for the coming weeks?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Reiterate your interest and capabilities.",
      "content": "Reiterate your interest and capabilities. Treat your follow-up message as an opportunity to connect with the hiring professional and remind them of what you have to offer (especially if you’ve already interviewed for the position). Try sprinkling strategic phrases in your messages, like “excellent fit” and “deep interest.” Choosing your words and phrases carefully can help you make a good lasting impression in your message. [6] X Research source “I feel as though my goals line up well with the company’s, and I believe I could make a strong connection with the existing company culture.” “As a former product designer of 7 years, I believe I could be an excellent fit for the team.” “I am committed to finding innovative solutions to complex problems, and I am thrilled at the prospect of problem-solving in a team environment.”"

      "content": "Request feedback on how you carried yourself throughout the interview. Showcase your professionalism and humility by focusing on your performance and desire to improve. Center your email on your interview performance and/or application quality. Demonstrating your ability to be a team player may help you positively stand out in an email. “It was great getting to connect last Thursday, and I so appreciate your time in meeting with me. If it isn’t too much to ask, would you mind sharing any feedback you had about how I did?” “I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me last week. If you have a moment to spare, I would be grateful for any feedback you might have regarding my application.”"

      "title": "Offer to answer any questions or concerns your contact has.",
      "content": "Offer to answer any questions or concerns your contact has. Making this offer gives the other person an excuse to reach out to you. Leave the invitation open-ended, indicating that you are available no matter what the other person has to say. Sometimes interviewers will call you back, giving you a chance to gain feedback and erase any doubts they may have about your application. [7] X Research source Indicate your openness by saying something like, “Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns I can answer.” Another way to encourage a response is to ask a question you forgot during the interview, such as, “What would someone need to do by the end of the year to prove they were the right hire?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Sign off with your first and last name.",
      "content": "Sign off with your first and last name. Your name at the bottom of the email serves as a reminder to your interviewer. Sure, you won’t break the law by leaving it off, especially if your name is in your email address. However, it is a good business practice that helps the interviewer identify and remember you. Sign off with a line such as “Thanks, Your Name.” Typically, including your first and last name is the best bet because the interviewer doesn’t know you well and may be dealing with a lot of different candidates."

      "content": "Follow the interviewer’s provided timeline before placing a call. Did you ask the interviewer to give you a specific timeline of when they’d get back to you? If so, let that entire time period pass before attempting to call them. If you don’t have a set timeline to follow, wait at least 1 week before touching base. [9] X Research source Don’t call an interviewer earlier than this. If you call really early on, they might not have any updates—plus, you’ll likely come off as pushy."

Your script might include: [10] X Research source A polite greeting (“Hi John!” or “Good afternoon, Mr. Cage!”) A brief intro (“This is Amir Naifeh.”) Your main inquiry (“I was calling to follow-up on the status of my application for the Managing Editor position.” or “Thanks so much for meeting with me last Monday! I wanted to touch base and see if there were any updates on the Managing Editor position.”) Any questions (“Around when do you expect a final decision to made for this position?”) What if they don’t answer? Leave a voicemail where you mention your name, the position you applied for, and when you interviewed. Rather than requesting them to return your call, simply offer to share any additional information they might need, and thank them for previously meeting with you. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Politely request an update. How you phrase your question can depend on different factors, like how many interviews you’ve had. If you’ve passed the final stage of interviews, a question like “Have you reached a decision on [this position]?” can be a good way to go. If you just interviewed once, a more vague question like “Is my application still being considered for [this position]?” could be a better option. [12] X Research source Try to keep a calm and cool head, no matter what the interviewer says. Responding maturely and respectfully will leave a much better impression than a brash, upset reply."

      "content": "Wait at least a month before following up with recruiters. Sending extra follow-ups isn’t always the way to go. While you may feel like you’re taking extra initiative, a recruiter or interviewer might find your constant communication as pushy, or even annoying. If you’re really curious and just have to touch base, wait a minimum of 4 weeks before sending a second follow-up message. [14] X Research source Recruiters are incredibly busy individuals who are fielding countless applications for lots of job positions. At this point, there unfortunately isn’t a guarantee that you’ll be one of their top picks—and being pushy likely won’t win you any points. Exception: If you get an offer from another company, it’s acceptable to send a follow-up message sooner than this, saying something like: “I just wanted to touch base, as I was recently offered a different job. I am still very interested in your company, and wanted to know where my application stood.”"
