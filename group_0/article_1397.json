      "content": "Read reviews of the BB Cream. No matter how reputable the cosmetic company is or what the BB Cream claims to offer, each type will work differently for different people. Reading reviews will help you understand if the product is both high-quality and right for you. Pay close attention to reviews that mention skin tone, skin type, and skin condition so that you can gauge how applicable the experience is to your set of circumstances."

      "content": "Choose the best BB Cream for your skin type. Different skin types have different needs as far as cosmetics go. For the most effective experience, choose a product that is geared toward oily skin, normal skin, or dry skin, depending on which skin type applies to you. If you have oily skin, consider a BB Cream with a matte finish. Gravitate toward those containing natural plant extracts, as well. This skin type tends to be sensitive, and a BB Cream with natural extracts is less likely to cause a reaction. If you have normal skin, consider a moisturizing BB Cream that can make your skin appear smoother. You could also look for one with a skin whitener in it if you need help balancing your skin tone. If you have dry skin, look for a BB Cream with a watery consistency instead of a thick cream, since thick creams can cause excess dryness. You should also look for moisturizing formulas."

      "content": "Choose the tone that matches your skin tone best. BB Creams tend not to have a wide variety of shades, but most will have some range of shades. The tone that comes closest to your natural skin tone will likely suit you best. When comparing tones, compare the tone of the BB Cream to the skin of your face and neck. Do not compare it to your hands, since the skin on your hands can be a slightly different shade than the skin on your face."

[1] X Research source Lighting can make a big difference in the way a cream looks. The lighting in a cosmetics store may not give you an accurate idea of how the cream looks on your skin once you walk outside. As a result, it is better to wear the cream in a variety of settings for a few hours before making a purchase."

[2] X Expert Source Janet Miranda Professional Hair Stylist & Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 11 February 2021. Balmy BB Creams should be applied with the hands since the heat of your skin melts it, making it easier to apply. Applying BB Cream with your fingers will produce a less smooth result than applying it with a sponge or brush, though."

      "content": "Get a small amount on the back of your hand. Squeeze a puddle of BB Cream roughly 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) in diameter, or the size of a dime, onto the back of your hand. Strictly speaking, this is not essential. It will make it easier to dab the cream on in equal portions, however."

      "content": "Apply five dots to the forehead, nose, two cheeks, and chin. Dip the tip of your middle finger into the puddle of BB Cream on the back of your hand. Dab the cream on your fingertip onto your face. Only apply it in dots: one in the middle of the forehead, one on the tip of the nose, one on your left cheek, one on your right cheek, and one on your chin. The dots of BB Cream should be about equal in amount. Do not apply the cream in streaks or in large splotches. You should use the cream sparsely, apply a thin layer to avoid making your skin look too heavy or weighted down."

      "title": "Pat the cream into your skin.",
      "content": "Pat the cream into your skin. Use your index and middle fingers to gently pat the cream in. Rub the BB Cream into your skin using a circular motion, but instead of keeping your fingers in contact with your skin for the entire motion, tap your fingers up and down as you rub. This gentle, light pressure spreads the cream evenly without irritating your skin. Start with the forehead and work your way down toward each cheek from the middle. Move onto your nose and chin after that, then finish off with your cheeks."

As before, start with the forehead before working your way to the nose and chin. Finish with the cheeks."

      "content": "Gently pat the cream around your eyes. Use even gentler pressure when you reach the eye area, regardless of whether your are patting or blending the cream on in strokes. By using a gentle patting pressure near your eyes, you prevent the fine lines that may show up when the dragging, stroke motion strains the skin around your eye, which is especially sensitive."

      "content": "Dab extra on to cover imperfections. Wait a few minutes for the BB Cream to dry. After it dries, if there are any particular areas in need of extra coverage, you can dab another thin layer of BB Cream over them. Note that you may never achieve a purely flawless look with BB Cream, since it tends to even out the skin tone more than it covers imperfections."

      "title": "Know when and why to use a sponge.",
      "content": "Know when and why to use a sponge. Sponge application is most suitable for people with oily skin. When you have oily skin, applying BB Cream with your fingers can add further oil to the skin on your face. A brush is less forceful, so when you have oily skin, you may have difficulty spreading the BB Cream evenly when you use a brush."

      "title": "Apply a facial mist to the sponge.",
      "content": "Apply a facial mist to the sponge. Lightly spritz the makeup sponge with a moisturizing facial mist before using it to apply your BB Cream. Using a sponge can throw the moisture levels of your skin off, so using a moisturizing facial mist can help prevent this. Spraying the sponge with a mist beforehand will also allow you to spread the cream more smoothly while keeping as much of the cream on your face as possible instead of losing it all in your sponge."

Even though you will be blending the BB Cream in using a makeup sponge, you should still dab the initial amount onto your skin using your fingers in order to control the amount better. The dots of BB Cream should be about equal in amount. Do not apply the cream in streaks or in large splotches.

Apply enough pressure to make your skin “jiggle” or move slightly from the vibration. Start from the forehead and work your way out toward the sides of your forehead from the center. Focus on your nose and chin next. Finish by firmly rubbing the BB Cream on your cheeks into your skin using outward strokes."

Blend the BB Cream on in this area using a patting motion. You can either use your fingers or the sponge for this part. If you feel like you have less control over spread and pressure with the sponge, switch to your fingers. By using a gentle patting pressure near your eyes, you prevent the fine lines that may show up when the dragging, stroke motion strains the skin around your eye, which is especially sensitive."

      "content": "Know when and why to use a makeup brush. This method is best if you have dry skin and works especially well with liquid BB creams. Note that it is not generally recommended for thick, balmy creams. If you have dry skin, using your fingers to apply the product can irritate your already irritated skin, causing it to become drier. Additionally, using a sponge can be too forceful and may rob your skin of what little moisture it has."

      "content": "Get a small amount onto the palm of one hand. Squeeze a puddle of BB Cream roughly 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) in diameter, or the size of a dime, into the palm of your hand. Strictly speaking, this is not essential. It will make it easier to dab the cream on in equal portions, however. Use the palm of your hand with this method rather than the back of your hand. The palm of your hand has more heat, so it can warm up and liquify the BB Cream more effectively than the back of your hand. As such, it makes the cream easier to spread, especially if the cream is somewhat balmy in consistency."

      "content": "Smooth the BB Cream into your skin using the brush. Use even, firm, outward brush strokes to spread the cream over your face and into your skin. A brushstroke will naturally be a little softer and a little gentler than a stroke with your fingers or a sponge. As such, you should not be afraid to use a little pressure. Work from your forehead out. Start at the center of your forehead and brush the cream out toward the top and side. Brush the cream on your nose up and down and the cream on your chin side to side. Blend the cream on your cheeks in all directions until it meets with the ending point of each previous area."
