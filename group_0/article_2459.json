      "title": "Neck tag",
      "content": "Neck tag The neck tag is one of the key identifiers of authenticity for your Bape hoodie as long as you know what you’re looking for. On authentic hoodies, the lettering on the neck tag is evenly spaced, uniform, and spelled correctly. On inauthentic hoodies, the lettering tends to be sloppily placed and, in some cases, misspelled. The ape’s face should also be beige. [1] X Research source Signs It’s Real: Uniform, evenly-spaced lettering. Beige-colored ape. Signs It’s Fake: Misspaced lettering, especially around the “t” and the “h” of “A Bathing Ape” and the trademark symbol (™). Miscolored ape."

      "title": "Wash tag",
      "content": "Wash tag Wash tags on authentic Bape hoodies tend to be securely stitched on the inside fabric, while fake hoodies feature loose, inaccurate stitching. Fake hoodies also tend to feature faded, misspaced lettering on the wash tag, specifically around the “LTD” lettering. Fake wash tags may also feature a placeholder serial number, so look up the serial number on your product and consult images of fake Bape hoodies to see if it’s been used by fake manufacturers in the past. [2] X Research source Signs It’s Real: Strong, uniform stitching, bold lettering that’s uniformly spaced. Signs It’s Fake: Bunched lettering, especially around “LTD,” loose stitching, and faded lettering."

      "title": "Sleeve tag",
      "content": "Sleeve tag The sleeve tag on authentic Bape hoodies is crisp and securely attached. It is also made of a silky material. On fake models, the edges tend to be frayed, feature sloppy stitching, have a rough texture, and have misplaced branding. The ape also tends to be miscolored and placed too low on the tag. Make sure to check the stitching on the inside of the cuff, too, as it tends to be poor. [3] X Research source Signs It’s Real: Silky texture, clean and secure stitching, and properly placed branding. Signs It’s Fake: Rough texture, poor and loose stitching, a trademark symbol (“™”) that folds over the cuff. CEO of WyCo Vintage Patrick Klima says that because counterfeit manufacturers don’t have access to the original company’s art files and are trying to replicate items cheaply, counterfeit graphics are typically less sharp and clear than the original artwork."

      "title": "Gold tag",
      "content": "Gold tag Every Bape product features a gold tag, so manufacturers frequently try to fake it. Authentic gold Bape tags are flat and feature a grainy texture. While the texture on authentic gold Bape tags is flat and grainy, the texture on fake Bape tags tends to be thick and rough. Another sign of fake gold tags is an incorrect color and location of the trademark symbol (™) and logo. Fake gold tags have heads that are too close to the bottom, a shinier color, and a misplaced trademark symbol. [4] X Research source Signs It’s Real: Flat, grainy ape head that’s the proper shade of gold and close to the bottom of the tag. Signs It’s Fake: Thick, miscolored ape head and misplaced trademark symbol (™)."

      "title": "Zipper",
      "content": "Zipper Real and fake Bape hoodies use YKK zippers since they’re one of the most popular zipper brands in the world, but there are a few telltale signs that help discern real Bape zippers from fake ones. For starters, authentic zippers tend to smoothly connect, come in a wide, stocky shape, and feature a small 5 on their backside, while fake zippers tend to jam and come in a slimmer, longer shape. Signs It’s Real: It’s wide and bulky, features “5” and “YKK”, and smoothly slides up and down the zipper tape. Signs It’s Fake: It’s long and slim, lacks the “5,” and has a hard time actually zipping."

    {
      "title": "Shark face",
      "content": "Shark face The eye placement and mouth composition are different on fake models than they are on authentic models. On authentic models, the eyes are about an inch away from the zipper, the teeth should run all the way down the bottom of the mouth, the top of the tongue shouldn’t touch the teeth, and the eyes should be aligned. [5] X Research source Signs It’s Real: Properly placed and aligned eyes that are an inch away from the zipper. Signs It’s Fake: Misaligned eyes that are less or more than an inch away from the zipper and improperly sized."

      "title": "WGM Lettering",
      "content": "WGM Lettering The WGM lettering’s placement is a strong indicator of authenticity. The lettering on fake hoodies is typically misplaced and unevenly spaced. Fake hoodies also tend to use the wrong type of fabric for the WGM lettering, which results in a less cohesive look. The stitching and underfabric are also straight and uniform on authentic models, so look for bumpy fabric and loose stitching if you suspect your product is fake. [6] X Research source Signs It’s Real: Evenly spaced lettering with vibrant, properly-colored fabric. Signs It’s Fake: Cheap-looking felt fabric, uneven and misplaced lettering, and bumpy placement of the fabric underneath the lettering. WGM stands for “world gone mad,” which is a popular Bape slogan."

      "title": "Packaging",
      "content": "Packaging The ziplock bag that holds authentic Bape hoodies is plastic and features Bape branding along with the quote “APE SHALL NEVER KILL APE,” both of which are in a narrow font. Bape hoodies tend to come with extra tags that are a light shade of camo, as well. Fake hoodies try to replicate these features, but they often use darker shades and bolder fonts. Signs It’s Real: Slim, narrow branding, light camo-colored tags. Signs It’s Fake: Thick, bold branding, improperly colored tags."

As the company grew, products were outsourced to Chinese manufacturers, who have since made a majority of their products. As of 2025, though, Bape does have products that are still produced in Japan.

      "content": "The limited quantity and high demand are what make Bape products so expensive. While Bape does use durable materials for their products, they aren’t necessarily expensive. However, Bape produces its products in limited quantities to preserve exclusivity. Together, these factors contribute to their high prices, thanks to the limited supply, durable materials, and strong demand. Bape’s popularity can be attributed to artists like Pharrell Williams and Lil Wayne, who consistently wore Bape in the 2000s."

      "content": "When authenticating your Bape hoodie, study key features like the neck tag and branding. Bape hoodies are commonly faked, but if you observe the neck tag, wash tag, sleeve tag, and other key areas for things like sloppy stitching, improper brand placement, and miscoloring, you can spot a fake before you spend your money on it. When personal authentication doesn’t work, reach out to a professional. If you do end up buying a fake, contact the seller to start the return process.
