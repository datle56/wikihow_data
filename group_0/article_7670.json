      "content": "Locate the source of the odor. It's easiest to clean fresh stains that are still damp, since you can lift much of the urine from the affected spot. However, you may also come across dried stains. In these cases, the same procedures should be followed, even though the urine has had more time to break down and soak into the surface. The smell will usually lead you directly to the area where your cat has urinated, though you might have to feel around with your hands for a wet spot if it is on carpet or cloth-covered furniture, or a sticky spot if it has dried on tile, linoleum or hardwood floors. [2] X Research source You can also try using a black fluorescent light. These lights will show stains on furniture, walls, or carpet as yellow spots. You can purchase a black light rather inexpensively from pet stores or online. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Wipe up and blot.",
      "content": "Wipe up and blot. Using paper towels, blot up as much of the urine as possible if the surface is fabric or carpet. With these surfaces, there is a danger of the urine soaking into the fibers of the material. Use a gentle dabbing motion to blot up the urine. [4] X Research source If you're concerned about using a lot of paper towels for environmental reasons, use a cloth towel or rag or even old clothes that can be thrown away. [5] X Research source You can also use a wet vacuum to \"suck up\" the urine if you have one on hand. This will lift more of the cat urine than blotting. Do not use a steam cleaner as at this point in the cleaning process the heat can cause the odor to last much longer and be more difficult to remove. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid rubbing in the stain. Scrubbing away at the stain at this stage will only cause it to sink in deeper. If the stain is already dry, pour cold water on the stain, and blot. [7] X Research source Be careful when saturating a stain with fluidâ€”it's always important to keep your subfloor in mind."

    {
      "title": "Purchase a commercial product.",
      "content": "Purchase a commercial product. Look in particular for an enzymatic cleaner. Enzymatic cleaners are specifically designed for cleaning urine-soiled areas. These types of cleaners break down the enzymes in the cat urine and neutralize the odor.They can usually be purchased at any pet store. Well-known brands include Knock Out, Urine Off, and Anti-Icky Poo. Enzymatic cleaners break down the uric acid in cat urine into carbon dioxide and ammonia. These are both gasses that will then easily evaporate and thereby neutralize the odor. [9] X Research source An enzymatic cleaner might not work on old urine stains. Avoid using cleaning solutions that contain optical brighteners, as they can cause damage and set the stain."

Then blot up as much of the cleaner as you can using paper towel or a rag. [11] X Research source Don't pour too much cleaner onto the carpet, or you could risk damaging your subfloor. For example, an OSB subfloor can suffer damage as it is not waterproof or water-resistant."

      "title": "Let the affected area air dry.",
      "content": "Let the affected area air dry. This is very important because the cleaner needs this time to effectively break down the uric acid salts and then allow the gasses to evaporate. Close off the affected area. Cats are naturally attracted by the enzymes in urine and will be drawn to urinate in areas that have previously been urinated in. Cover the area loosely with something like aluminum foil or an upside-down laundry basket. This will not only keep the cat from attempting to pee in the same spot while the cleaner does its job but also keep any members of the household from stepping on the area. To help dry an area, use a fan. Position it so the air moves over the entire carpet, not just over the wet spot."

While enzymatic cleaners are ideal, you can substitute a homemade cleaner that uses white vinegar, baking soda, liquid dish detergent, and 3% hydrogen peroxide. Vinegar helps to kill any bacteria and neutralize the odor. [13] X Research source This mixture works well for treating both old and new stains.
