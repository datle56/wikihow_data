This number, however, cannot receive phone calls or regular text messages. Because the Rachel Maddow team receives so many messages, they may not be able to respond to your message. [1] X Research source Signal is a free messaging app. When using the app, you’ll just use your mobile number instead of a username. It’s popular among journalists because it encrypts all the messages that you send and receive. [2] X Research source WhatsApp is one of the most popular messaging apps around. You can download it for free on your mobile device or desktop computer. You just need a phone number to start an account. [3] X Research source Telegram is also a free-to-download messaging app. The app uses end-to-end encryption, which means only you and the recipient of your messages will be able to read what you write. The app also gives you the option to send messages with a self-destruct timer, which gives you an extra level of security when contacting the Rachel Maddow Show. [4] X Research source"

[8] X Research source Use this method if sending the information to Rachel will put your safety at risk. While this is the most secure way to contact Rachel, keep in mind that no method is 100 percent secure."
