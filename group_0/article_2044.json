      "content": "Use a direct or serious pick-up line. Don’t try a flippant conversation-opener on a Capricorn. Stability-oriented Capricorns aren’t interested in casual relationships, and women tend to assume flirts who deliver over-the-top pickup lines are only good for short-term flings. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Capricorns get more spontaneous as they age, but young Capricorns have little time for anything that doesn’t get them closer to their goals. Start a conversation over a shared interest or signal your romantic intentions with a direct compliment. For a perfect stranger, try: “You have a great laugh” or “You have a wonderful smile.” If it’s a work or class peer, try: “I really liked how you handled that situation.” If it’s a friend you’ve been too shy to make a move on: “You’re exactly the kind of woman I’d like to date.” Don’t shower her with compliments about her physical appearance or clothing unless you suspect it’s something particularly meaningful to her. Later, she’ll want to know you find her attractive, but initially, she’ll want to know you’ve noticed her brain or accomplishments. Capricorns have a sharp sense of humor, but it’s usually reserved for their inner circle, so avoid humor until you know each other better."

      "title": "Bring history into the mix.",
      "content": "Bring history into the mix. Capricorns love tradition and ritual, so try engaging your Capricorn crush in conversations about historical places, old movies, and events connected to her heritage or family life. Get first date ideas from any tradition or heritage she brings up. It’ll show you know what’s important to her. Dates at a museum or historical landmark can seem sterile, but many museums and landmarks offer more intimate themed events in the evening or on weekends. Try catching a movie at a vintage drive-through. Not only will it appeal to her love of tradition, it’ll be more personal than a theater date, since you can talk (and maybe more) during the film. If she’s more interested in esoteric topics, consider ordering in a grand take-out spread to eat while watching a streamed documentary or reality show. Make it interactive — the movie or museum is just an excuse for conversation, a jump off point to engage her on an intellectual level. It might feel like you’re just trading facts and trivia, but to a brainy Cap, an intellectual connection is flirting."

      "title": "The expression “dress for the job you want” was made for Capricorns.",
      "content": "The expression “dress for the job you want” was made for Capricorns. Capricorns have an unfair reputation of coming across as snobbish and materialistic, but really they just like trappings that show you have worked for what you have. [7] X Research source They work hard to be sure their outside appearance reflects what they’ve accomplished and what they admire, and they’ll respect if you do the same. Do you want a Capricorn woman on your arm? Dress for it. Combine her love of history and status symbols by wearing your most traditional, dapper looks. You don’t have to purchase clothing to accomplish a more stylish look. Pick your favorite article of clothing and look up other ways to style it. For instance, if you have a pair of dark jeans that make you feel like you can rule the world whenever you wear them, look up “how to style dark jeans men” or “how to style dark jeans women” to get inspired."

      "content": "A Capricorn woman won't be happy if you're threatened by her big aspirations. When faced with any extremely successful person, it can be easy to feel insecure, especially if you aren’t as far along in your career goals. The Capricorn woman doesn’t need you to have her intense aims, but she does need a partner who won’t get in her way. Show her you aren’t attracted to her despite her drive, but because of it, and you’ll immediately stand out from the crowd. [8] X Research source Talk to her about her work. Ask her what her goals are for one year, five years, and ten years, and watch her decide to include you in them! Sometimes ego goes the other way: it can be intimidating to see a put-together woman who knows what she wants. Don’t let your own insecurity ruin your chances. Instead, let her good habits motivate you to change yours."

Capricorns are career women, and even if she wants to try a relationship with you, she might be worried you’ll be so all-encompassing that her grand plans will fall by the wayside. [9] X Research source Show her she can have both. You don’t need to prove that you’ll be invisible —you need to prove you’ll be a value-add. Try practical gestures like offering to bring dinner to her while she’s working late, or offering her rides to work while her ride’s getting an oil change.

      "content": "Give thoughtful gifts that hit her right where it matters: her confidence. Capricorns’ ambition can seem unending and all-consuming, but their relentless drive comes from a deep desire to accomplish something during their own lifetime. [11] X Research source Caps are famous for being hungry for status-symbols and material goods, but really what they want is concrete proof they’ve made it. Great gifts include framed photos of meaningful accomplishments, clothing items she can wear to work events, or hand-written “merit certificates” offering sexy favors as a reward for reaching important work milestones."

      "content": "Learn who else is important to her. Capricorns will do anything for their families and for their small friend group. Both friends and family are treated with the same care, and showing that you care about getting to know them will matter a lot to her. Make an effort to spend time with her family around holidays. This will show her that you know her family connections are important to both of you. Take the time to really get to know her parents or the family members she is closest to. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "It will take a Capricorn woman time to make up her mind about you. Don’t be discouraged if your Capricorn crush doesn’t rush to say “I love you” — and don’t be in a hurry to say it to her, either. Capricorns feel deeply, but they often feel uncomfortable with sentiment. As long as she’s still showing up, she’s in the game, and she probably assumes the same of you. Capricorn women value stability, structure, and goals, and the longer you’re around, the more convinced she’ll be that you truly do fit in her life. [13] X Research source Pay special attention to how she shows her friends and family that she cares. This will give you valuable clues for how you can share your feelings with her too."

When they don’t, though, the disappointment and regret can be crushing. [14] X Research source Soothe your Capricorn’s bruised confidence by taking her to see an inspirational movie or by giving her a massage while encouraging her to talk about times she’s overcome failure in the past. She’ll remember how capable she is and you’ll be one step closer to enjoying a Capricorn’s surprisingly passionate side. [15] X Research source"

The Capricorn woman you can’t stop thinking about is ambitious, trend-setting, goal-oriented, and successful, but you don’t need to be her mirror . . . only her match. Women fall in love with those with complementary brain chemistry profiles, not identical ones.
