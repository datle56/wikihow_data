      "content": "Live purposefully. In order to achieve your dreams and be the person you want to be, you will have to start paying attention to your actions. Ask yourself, \"Is what I'm doing going to lead me to where I want to be in life?\" [1] X Research source If you find yourself constantly bored, daydreaming about the future or past or counting down the minutes until the day ends, it is probably because you feel disconnected from what you're doing. Cherish your time. Try to spend your free time doing things that you enjoy doing, rather than wasting time. For example, rather than spending your weekends watching television, spend them partaking in your hobbies or spending time with loved ones and new friends. Measure your productivity by engagement, not achievement. Not everything you do has to be productive in the conventional sense, but activities should be engaging and enjoyable. Keep in mind that it is perfectly fine to spend some time doing nothing and just being lazy each day. This can actually help with your imagination and self-awareness. Strive for a balance between doing things you want to do and allowing yourself to just “be.”"

[2] X Expert Source Kamila Tan Life and Recovery Coach Expert Interview. 24 June 2022. While it may take years to realize what you want to do with your life, identifying your passions, interests, and values will help you set goals and give your life a sense of meaning. If you have trouble identifying these things, then ask a friend or family member to help you. Ask yourself the following questions: What do you want your legacy to be? How would you like to be remembered by others? How do you want to make your community a better place? What are some favorite subjects of interest in your life? For example, think of subjects you enjoyed studying in school. Ask why you liked them. [3] X Research source For instance, you may have loved musical theater. Think: was it because you loved the music, or was it because you loved working with a big group towards a common goal?"

Be sure to address both short-term and long-term goals; try to think beyond financial and career goals, such as relationship goals, personal goals for bettering yourself, things you would like to experience, or things you want to learn. Draw up a timeline that says when you want to achieve each part. Set SMART goals ; goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. Break big goals down. For instance, if your goal is to see the world, you can set the goal of saving money and visiting certain countries.

Similarly, don't tell someone you will do something if you're not sure you can. Be honest about your limits. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Avoid canceling plans, and try not to cancel twice on the same person. Make commitments to yourself, and stick to them. Write down your commitments and hang them in places you can see. Make sure that your commitments are gradually moving you towards your goals.

In terms of financial success, statistics have shown that the more education you have (i.e. the higher degree you achieve), the more money you are likely to make. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source In 2011, the median weekly earnings for high school graduates was $638 while those with bachelor's degrees made $1053. That same year, those with masters or doctoral degrees made $1263 and $1551 respectively. Not all education has to be formal. Apprenticeships and long-term training programs are also positively correlated with higher incomes. Obtaining a Certificate in your field can help to increase your salary. Educate yourself for pleasure as well. The more you know about the world you live in, the more questions you will have and the more interested you will be."

[7] X Research source Keep track of your expenses. Subtract your monthly expenses from your monthly income to determine how much spending money you have available each month. Also, review your bank statements often and notice where you spend your money. This will help you prevent overspending and ensure that your bank statements are correct. Understand your income. When calculating your income, be sure to take into account the federal, state, and social security taxes that will be deducted from your gross pay. Don't overlook miscellaneous deductions, such as health insurance premiums, savings bonds and loan payments. The resulting number is your net pay, which is what you end up taking home with you. Cut back. If you are not earning enough money to cover your net expenses, then look into your expenses to see where you might be able to cut back. Save money . Every month, you should deposit some of your money into a savings account. Consider asking your employer to directly deposit a portion of your income into your savings account. Invest cautiously . If your workplace offers a retirement savings plan, put your excess incomes in that."

Remember that the past and the future are simply illusions, and that real life takes place here and now. Start paying attention to negative thoughts so that you can move on from them and enjoy the present moment . If a negative thought arises in your head, then acknowledge it, label it a negative thought, and then let it fade away. [9] X Research source Regular meditation or mindfulness exercises can help to make this feel more natural for you. Get in the habit of paying attention to small details around you. Appreciate the feeling of the sun on your skin, the sensation of your feet walking on the ground, or the artwork in the restaurant you are eating in. Noticing things like these will help you silence a rambling mind and appreciate every moment."

If you want to feel accomplished and happy, you will have to value your life for its own sake. Many people have the tendency to compare the low points of their own lives with the high points of other peoples' lives. Remember that no matter how perfect somebody's life may seem, behind closed doors everybody deals with tragedy, insecurity, and other difficulties. [10] X Research source Pay attention to and limit your use of social media to help you remember this. Rather than comparing yourself with people who are \"better off\" than you, think about all of the people who are homeless, chronically ill, or living in poverty. This will help you appreciate what you have rather than feeling sorry for yourself. Try engaging in volunteer work to help make this more apparent. This can help to boost your happiness and confidence as well."

Choose to spend time with the positive people, not the ones sucking your energy. If you have friends or family members who always make you feel bad about yourself, limit the time you spend with them. Also, make sure to identify relationships that are not helping you to move towards your goals, that stress you out, or that require too much of your time and energy without being reciprocal. Look for mentors among the people you admire. If you think you could learn from someone, ask for their advice."
