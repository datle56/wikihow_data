After letting the chicken livers soak in water for about 10-15 minutes, drain the water from the bowl and dry each liver with a paper towel.

To make sure your dog doesn't eat too much chicken liver, feed them a small serving that corresponds to their size. For the most accurate serving suggestion, talk to your veterinarian. For an approximate serving size, feed small dogs up to 10–15 grams (0.35–0.53 oz), medium dogs up to 25–30 grams (0.88–1.06 oz), and large dogs up to 40–60 grams (1.4–2.1 oz) of chicken liver 1-2 times a week.
