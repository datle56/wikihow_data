      "content": "Try the viral $3 hack to save some money. Although the online ordering version of the $3 hack doesn’t work anymore, you can still pull it off in person. Order a single taco and ask for them to load it with your preferred ingredients. Ask for a side tortilla and some extra sides, then pay for your food. Once you get your food, roll the taco into the burrito to get a burrito for the price of a taco (and a side tortilla). [1] X Research source If you order too many sides, you may end up getting charged, so be careful."

      "content": "Order a burrito and grill it over cheese for a unique, tasty entree. The Cheesy Burrito has become all the rage on TikTok, and it’s easy to make at home. Order a burrito, side of sour cream, side of vinaigrette, and a side of cheese. Use butter or cooking spray to lubricate your pan, then heat it. Sprinkle cheese over the heated pan and place your burrito on top of it before it melts. Wait a few minutes, then flip to see results. [2] X Research source Combine the sour cream and vinaigrette to use as a dipping sauce (or drizzle). The Cheesy Burrito isn’t the same as the Quesarito, which Fast food expert Wayne Dang says is a burrito wrapped in a cheese quesadilla that’s more cheesy and flavorful than a regular burrito."

      "title": "Load your bowl, ask for a side tortilla, and roll the extra into a burrito.",
      "content": "Load your bowl, ask for a side tortilla, and roll the extra into a burrito. Before you order, ask for a large side tortilla. Then, order your food. If you really want to load up, ask for double rice, beans, veggies, salsa, and dairy products. Once you get your order, open your tortilla on a flat surface and spread some of your bowl into the center. Then roll the front end of your tortilla over the food, fold the sides inward, and roll it again to close. Boom! Two entrees for the price of one. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Order \"half and half\" to potentially get a little extra food.",
      "content": "Order \"half and half\" to potentially get a little extra food. Whether you want to load up on rice or get away with a little bit of extra protein, ask for half and half. When the person preparing your food is scooping your food, they may have a harder time properly portioning your rice and protein, which can result in some extra food in your entree."

    {
      "title": "Ask for a scoop of protein and after they scoop ask for another one.",
      "content": "Ask for a scoop of protein and after they scoop ask for another one. If you want double protein, don’t ask for double protein! At least at first. Order the rice and beans, then ask for a single scoop of protein. Give it a second, then sincerely ask for a second scoop of protein. The person serving your bowl is more likely to give you bigger portions with two individual scoops rather than two simultaneous scoops. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Order a veggie entree to get free guacamole.",
      "content": "Order a veggie entree to get free guacamole. If you’ve got a taste for guac but don’t want to spend the money on it, get a veggie entree. Chipotle offers vegetarian options for each entree on their menu and each of them comes with free guac. If you don’t order protein, you get guac for free, so take advantage of it if you want free guac!"

      "title": "Get a large side of salad lettuce and an empty bowl to double your portion.",
      "content": "Get a large side of salad lettuce and an empty bowl to double your portion. Before you order your bowl, ask the person preparing your food for a large side of salad lettuce and an extra bowl. If you really want to go big, ask for an extra side of salad lettuce in an empty bowl. When you’re ordering your food, ask for double everything. Once you have your bowl, split the contents into the second bowl so you get two for the price of one! Depending on the location you visit, they may charge you for the side of salad lettuce. But, it will be significantly cheaper than the cost of a second entree. If you want to save money, avoid getting double protein."

      "title": "Get a side of rice and beans for a cheap and healthy way to save money.",
      "content": "Get a side of rice and beans for a cheap and healthy way to save money. You don’t have to get a full bowl when you order at Chipotle. If you’re strapped for cash or just looking to save money, ask for a side of rice and beans, as you’ll only be paying a few dollars as opposed to double digits. Rice and beans are also a complementary protein and provide all of the essential amino acids when paired together, which help build muscle, break down food, and repair body tissue.

      "content": "Order taco shells instead of chips. The taco shells and chips are made out of the same tortilla, and the shell is cheaper! Chipotle’s taco shells and chips are both made out of corn tortillas, and while the chips are around $2-$3, the shells are $0.50-$1.00. You can break the shells down and use them like chips, too, so you’ve still got a snack to dip!"

      "content": "Order through the app or website to get ahead of the line. When you don’t feel like waiting in line to get your delicious Chipotle, order ahead through the website or mobile app. When you order ahead, they prepare your food in advance so it’s ready upon your arrival. They even tell you when to come so you won’t have to wait! If you plan on picking up during a rush, you may want to schedule your order in advance so it goes through before everyone else’s."

      "content": "Take advantage of Chipotle's promotions. Chipotle has plenty of promotions for free or discounted food. As you order food on the mobile app, you rack up points that can be used for future rewards, like chips, drinks, and entrees. Even if you don’t have the mobile app, Chipotle tends to run promotions year-round whether it’s for sports wins, holidays, or their annual Boorito event, where you can get $6 entrees if you show up in a Halloween costume.

      "content": "Ask for sides of veggies and non-proteins to maximize your entree. If you want to beef up your bowl or have some more food for your burrito or tacos, ask for sides of veggies and non-proteins. Chipotle generally lets you get sides of rice, beans, fajitas, tomato salsa, corn salsa, red salsa, green salsa, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce for free. But, they will start to charge you if you get a bunch of sides, so choose your options wisely. This hack works even if you already doubled your entree. This hack doesn’t work with sides of guacamole, protein, and queso. Those all cost."

      "title": "Ask for your burrito to be mixed up to play around with flavor.",
      "content": "Ask for your burrito to be mixed up to play around with flavor. The worst thing is when you bite into a Chipotle burrito and get a mouthful of rice or beans instead of all the ingredients you asked for. To avoid this, ask the person preparing your burrito if they can mix up the ingredients so everything’s even and spread out. Be careful, though, they may not be able to do this if you come during a rush."

Chipotle’s Kids Meals are cheaper than their entrees, with as much as a $10.65 difference between the two depending on what you order and what location you visit. You also get two options. [7] X Research source The Kids Build Your Own comes with two tortilla shells, a choice of protein, and two sides. The Kids Quesadilla comes with a choice of a cheese or meat quesadilla and rice and beans. Both come with a choice of a Kids Chip or fruit, and a milk, chocolate milk, water cup, or juice. Talk about a steal!"

      "content": "Be kind to your server, as they control your portions. When you order in person, make sure you’re kind to the person preparing your food. They have control over how much food they give you, and if you’re nice to them, they may be willing to be a little heavy-handed. On the flip side, if you’re rude to them, they may end up shorting your bowl. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "As a regular, employees may be more inclined to give you better portions. As you continue to frequent the same Chipotle location, employees may start to recognize you. If you make small talk with them and are kind whenever you visit, they may be inclined to be a bit heavy-handed when it comes to portioning your meal. Aside from that, those who regularly visit a business tend to have more close friends they can depend on in their community, so it’s a win win! [9] X Research source"

      "content": "You’ll get the freshest food when you go after the morning rush. At the end of the night, Chipotle keeps certain food to be reheated and reused the next day, like chicken, carnitas, and barbacoa. To avoid reheated food and secure a fresh entree, make sure you go right after the morning rush, as they’ll be cooking fresh food that they may have run out of prior to your arrival."

      "content": "Does Chipotle have a secret menu? Yes, Chipotle offers a secret Quesarito item on their secret menu . A Quesarito is a cheese quesadilla that’s opened and used for a burrito, making for a crunchy, cheesy taste. Although they may not advertise it, you can ask for one if you order in person. Just let the person making your food know that you want a Quesarito before they start preparing it. [10] X Research source If they say they can’t prepare it, ask for an uncut cheese quesadilla on the side. Make sure they fold it in half instead of fourths, then open it and roll your burrito into it on your own."

Yes, you can get free Chipotle by racking up points on their mobile app. All you have to do is download the mobile app, make an account, and start scanning the QR code whenever you order in person. If you prefer to order ahead, do it through the mobile app so they reward you with points automatically. Once you rack up points, you can redeem them for free chips, drinks, entrees, and sides."

      "content": "What should I get at Chipotle for the first time? If you’re ordering at Chipotle for the first time, Dang says to get the bowl. This is because in the bowl, the employees usually fill it up with way more food than any other item. If you want to try a burrito, ask for a tortilla on the side and roll some of the contents of your bowl into the tortilla to save money and try both entrees in one go."
