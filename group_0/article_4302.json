      "content": "Pick out a few firm, ripe plantains. Since the hot water will soften the fruit up quite a bit, it’s best to start with plantains that are ripe but still firm to the touch. Yellow plantains should have just a little give, with few (if any) brown spots. Green plantains should be harder, with a uniform color and no spotting. [1] X Research source If you use overly ripe plantains, they may become mushy by the time they’re done. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Slice the ends off the plantains.",
      "content": "Slice the ends off the plantains. Lay out your plantains on a cutting board and use a sharp knife to remove the stems roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top and bottom of the fruit. Getting these parts out of the way will make it easier to peel the plantains. [3] X Research source Removing the stems also lets in more heat, helping the plantains cook through faster."

      "title": "Cut the plantains in half.",
      "content": "Cut the plantains in half. Lay out the plantains on a cutting board and slice them through the middle width-wise. This will reduce them to a more manageable size, allowing them to fit more easily inside a pot. [4] X Research source Plantains can be pretty tough, so make sure the knife you’re using is nice and sharp."

      "title": "Peel the plantains to reduce their cook time slightly.",
      "content": "Peel the plantains to reduce their cook time slightly. Once you’ve cut the plantains in half, use the tip of your knife to score the skin from one end to the other. Take hold of the skin on either side of the cut and pull it apart to expose the fruit underneath. Be gentle to avoid damaging the fruit. [5] X Research source Your plantains won’t take as long to boil if you remove their skin first. If you prefer, you can also simply score the skins from end to end and finish peeling them once they’re fully cooked. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Fill a large pot with water.",
      "content": "Fill a large pot with water. Make sure the pot you’re using is big enough to hold all the plantains you want to boil. A full-sized stockpot is recommended for boiling several plantains at once, but you may also be able to get by with a deep saucepan if you’re only preparing 1 or 2. [7] X Research source Be careful not to overfill the pot, or the water could slosh out once it comes to a boil."

      "title": "Bring the water to a boil.",
      "content": "Bring the water to a boil . Turn on the cooktop to high heat and allow the water to begin warming up. Depending on the size and volume of your pot, the water should reach a boil within about 6-10 minutes. [8] X Research source If you’re in a rush, you can save a few minutes by putting your water on while you slice and peel the plantains."

    {
      "title": "Add a pinch of salt to the water.",
      "content": "Add a pinch of salt to the water. If you like, you can throw some salt in with your boiling water. A little bit of salt will impart a subtle savory note, balancing out the starchy sweetness of the plantains. [9] X Research source If you’re not sure how much salt to use, start with about 1 teaspoon (4.2 g). You can always add more once the plantains have finished cooking in order to get the desired flavor. [10] X Research source Avoiding adding too much salt, as this could overpower the mild flavor of the plantains and make them unappetizing."

      "title": "Boil the plantains for 15-30 minutes.",
      "content": "Boil the plantains for 15-30 minutes. As the plantains cook, the heat from the water will begin breaking down their rich sugars, unlocking more of their natural sweetness. By the 15-20 minute mark, the fruit should have taken on a deep yellow color and become nice and tender. [11] X Research source Set a timer to help you keep track of how long the plantains have been boiling. If there are still white spots in the fruit at the end of your cook time, it means it’s not quite ready. Leave the plantains on the stove for another 5-6 minutes until they’re a uniform yellow color. [12] X Research source Green plantains may need as long as 30 minutes to cook all the way through."

      "title": "Remove the plantains from the hot water using a pair of tongs.",
      "content": "Remove the plantains from the hot water using a pair of tongs. The plantains will be extremely hot, so be sure to fish them out with a separate utensil. If you don’t have any tongs handy, you could also spear them with a knife or scoop them out using a metal spatula or serving fork. Place the plantains on a layer of paper towels to absorb some of the excess water, or simply transfer them straight to their intended serving dish. Never attempt to remove cooked items from a pot of boiling water by hand. Doing so could result in a serious burn!"

      "content": "Allow the plantains to cool for 2-3 minutes before serving. Once most of the steam has dissipated, the plantains will be ready to eat. They're best when they're warm, but not scalding hot. If you dig in before your plantains have had time to cool down sufficiently, you could burn your mouth."

      "title": "Peel the plantains if you boiled them with the skin on.",
      "content": "Peel the plantains if you boiled them with the skin on. To avoid burning your hands, use a fork and knife to safely open up the peel and uncover the delicious fruit underneath. Once that’s done, discard the skins and enjoy! [13] X Research source Plantains should always be peeled prior to eating."

      "content": "Mash boiled plantains to savor their soft texture. As an optional final step, you can use the flat side of a fork to mash your plantains to a smooth, creamy consistency. Keep mashing and stirring until the purée is mostly free of lumps. This is just another way to enjoy the versatile fruit. [14] X Research source Mashed boiled plantains are an incredibly popular breakfast dish in the Dominican Republic, where they’re known as mangú . Traditional versions of mangú also incorporate olive oil and onion powder for more of a savory take on a sweet treat. For every 2 plantains you use, add roughly 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of oil and ½ tablespoon (7.4 g) onion powder."
