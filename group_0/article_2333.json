      "title": "Manifest your target reality by repeating the words “I am.”",
      "content": "Manifest your target reality by repeating the words “I am.” Lie on your back, or get into a comfortable position, and relax or meditate for 5-10 minutes. Then, close your eyes and repeat the words “I am” over and over until you naturally start to change the statement into more than “I am.” Once you do, slowly count to 100. When you reach “100,” open your eyes. For example, you might begin to think, “I am going to my desired reality.” That means it’s time to start counting. There’s no need to visualize with this method, just let the “I am” statements do the work."

Then, recite positive affirmations or “I am” statements while vividly visualizing your DR. Once you feel a change, slowly open your eyes. Use specific statements that target your DR, like, “I am a successful actress.” If you like, count slowly to 100 once you feel the change before opening your eyes to strengthen the shift."
