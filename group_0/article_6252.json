You won't unlock these two areas until later in the game, so if you can't yet go to Pacifidlog town as part of the main quest, you can't get Rayquaza just yet. [1] X Research source Pacifidlog town is west of Route 131, and is encountered later in the game than most areas. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Carry at least one Pokémon capable of using the HM move \"Surf. \" You'll need to hit the ocean in order to get to Rayquaza, but this should be common by the time you're ready to fight the beast. If you don't have a Pokémon in your party with Surf, grab one from earlier in your adventures. [4] X Research source"

Rayquaza is the most powerful natural Pokémon you'll find in the game and is already at lv70 when you encounter it. In order to weaken it enough to capture it, you'll need some Pokémon that can hold their own against a high-level monster. [5] X Research source You can get Rayquaza either before or after the Elite 4, it is your choice."

      "content": "Purchase at least 30-40 Ultra Balls to be safe, or decide to use your one Master Ball. This is probably your best chance to use the Master Ball, which will capture Rayquaza automatically, no questions asked. But if you don't have it anymore, Ultra Balls will do, so long as you have a strong team capable of weakening it first."

      "content": "Make sure you have a Pokémon with a high-level move that inflicts a status effect if not using your Master Ball. Status-effecting moves that inflict sleep, freeze, or paralyze make it much, much easier to successfully capture the Legendary Monster, and they prevent it from fighting back for a few turns. Note, of course, that the higher-level the Pokémon using the move is, the more likely it will succeed. You can use moves like Sleep Powder, Blizzard, or Thunder Wave to inflict these statuses."

It'll immediately fly away, but you see it again later when he fights Kyogre and Groudon. In this necessary cut-scene (unlocked by flying to Sootopolis after awakening Rayquaza), Rayquaza appears and breaks up the fight, then flies away. As soon as this is finished, you can return to the Sky Pillar to catch Rayquaza for real. If you haven't gotten this far in the quest, you can't catch Rayquaza. [6] X Research source"

Use them to move up to the top layer. Whenever you see cracks on the floor, use the Mach Bike to quickly skate over them without stopping. You'll fall through if you try to walk or stop. The Sky Pillar stages are filled with strong Pokémon, but they can be avoided if you use a Max Repel. This is a good way to save your Pokémon's HP for the big battle with Rayquaza later."

Keep in mind that Ultra Balls don't get better the more you throw them—it ultimately depends on the Pokémon's HP going down in order for the catch rate to become more likely."
