Each additional resistor placed in a circuit adds to the total resistance of that circuit. [1] X Research source The formula for calculating a total of n number of resistors wired in series is: R eq = R 1 + R 2 + .... R n That is, all the series resistor values are simply added. For example, consider finding the equivalent resistance in the image below [2] X Research source In this example, R 1 = 100 Ω and R 2 = 300Ω are wired in series. R eq = 100 Ω + 300 Ω = 400 Ω"

      "content": "What it is. Parallel resistance is when the \"in\" side of 2 or more resistors are connected, and the \"out\" side of those resistors are connected. [3] X Research source The equation for combining n resistors in parallel is: R eq = 1/{(1/R 1 )+(1/R 2 )+(1/R 3 )..+(1/R n )} [4] X Research source Here is an example, given R 1 = 20 Ω, R 2 = 30 Ω, and R 3 = 30 Ω. The total equivalent resistance for all 3 resistors in parallel is: R eq = 1/{(1/20)+(1/30)+(1/30)} = 1/{(3/60)+(2/60)+(2/60)} = 1/(7/60)=60/7 Ω = approximately 8.57 Ω."

      "content": "What it is. A combined network is any combination of series and parallel circuits wired together. [5] X Research source Consider finding the equivalent resistance of the network shown below. [6] X Research source We see the resistors R 1 and R 2 are connected in series. So their equivalent resistance (let us denote it by R s ) is: R s = R 1 + R 2 = 100 Ω + 300 Ω = 400 Ω. Next, we see the resistors R 3 and R 4 are connected in parallel. So their equivalent resistance (let us denote it by R p1 ) is: R p1 = 1/{(1/20)+(1/20)} = 1/(2/20)= 20/2 = 10 Ω Then we see the resistors R 5 and R 6 are also connected in parallel. So their equivalent resistance (let us denote it by R p2 ) is: R p2 = 1/{(1/40)+(1/10)} = 1/(5/40) = 40/5 = 8 Ω So now we have a circuit with the resistors R s , R p1 , R p2 and R 7 connected in series. These can now simply be added to get the equivalent resistance R 7 of the network given to us originally. R eq = 400 Ω + 20Ω + 8 Ω = 428 Ω."
