      "content": "Get a soft, clean cloth. [1] X Research source The cloth should be free of lint and made from cotton or ultra-fine microfiber (like an eyeglass cloth). Avoid using anything abrasive, like paper towels or toilet paper. If you don't have a soft cloth, use a cotton t-shirt. Be sure to use an area of the shirt that doesn't have any logos. Logos are made from heavy inks and decals and could scratch the surface of your game."

      "content": "Use the cloth to gently wipe the shiny side, using straight strokes from the center out. [2] X Research source Avoid wiping back-and-forth or in circular strokes, as they can scratch the surface! Instead, wipe from the center to the edges, carefully rubbing out any smears or oily fingerprints."

      "title": "Dampen a corner of the cloth to wipe more the difficult areas.",
      "content": "Dampen a corner of the cloth to wipe more the difficult areas. [3] X Research source If there are tough-to-remove spots remaining, wet a corner of the cloth with cold water and rub the area again. Be persistent, but be gentle—scrubbing will only make things worse. If you have a water-based CD/DVD/game cleaner in a spray bottle, apply it to the backside and gently wipe with a dry area of the cloth. If there are specific instructions on the bottle, follow them. Try using distilled vinegar on difficult oily spots. Vinegar can break down thicker residues and stains. [4] X Research source If you clean the game with vinegar, give it a quick rinse in lukewarm water after. Avoid using household cleaning products on your PlayStation games. Many products contain solvents that will irreparably damage the game."

      "title": "Get some non-abrasive toothpaste that isn’t a gel.",
      "content": "Get some non-abrasive toothpaste that isn’t a gel. [5] X Research source If you see some light scratches on the shiny side of your game, they can be buffed out with toothpaste. It’s important to make sure you’re using a variety that doesn’t have any chunky ingredients, like crystals or bits of dental strips—those additives can scratch the disc’s surface. It’s also important not to use a gel toothpaste, as it won’t be able to fill in the scratches. To test your toothpaste, apply a little bit to the front of your hand and rub it in with your finger. If it feels gritty, don’t use it. Most toothpaste labeled “sensitive” or “children’s” is non-abrasive. If the scratches are too deep, toothpaste won’t work."

Any scratches remaining after using this method will need to be buffed out by a professional."
