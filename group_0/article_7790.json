      "content": "The clean girl aesthetic focuses on minimalist beauty and fashion choices. Similar to the “that girl” aesthetic , this curated style presents as fresh, effortless, and low-maintenance, but it actually takes a lot of effort to put together. The minimalist approach usually calls for sleek hair and subtle makeup, prioritizing an effortless, understated vibe. [1] X Research source The slicked-back bun hairstyle with gold hoops and glossy skin (main components of the clean girl aesthetic) has been popular for decades, especially among Black and Brown women. While the recent TikTok trend featuring Hailey Bieber and Bella Hadid has brought this look into the mainstream spotlight, it's important to recognize that this style originated within communities of color long before it became a viral sensation.

      "content": "Opt for sleek buns and slicked-back edges. The clean girl aesthetic favors a slicked-back hairstyle, using oil, gel, and a bristle brush to smooth down hair. A bun or ponytail is usually positioned at the nape of the neck or the crown of the head and typically features a subtle center part. To create a slicked-back bun/hairstyle , begin by washing your hair how you normally would and towel-drying it. Apply hair gel and use a bristle brush to smooth back the top. Secure the back in a ponytail or wrap it around to form a bun. Alternatively, a low, twisted braid ponytail is also acceptable. Regardless of the chosen style, it should appear frizz-free, flyaway-free, shiny, and glossy."

      "content": "Aim for minimal makeup. To achieve a natural, no-makeup look , focus on enhancing your features with rosy cheeks, full brows, and glossy lips. You can also incorporate subtle highlighting, contouring, and neutral eyeshadows, but be sure to keep the overall look balanced and understated for a seamless, fresh-faced finish. [3] X Research source Opt for makeup products that discreetly conceal blemishes . Glossy, subtly-colored lips are an essential finishing touch."

      "content": "Choose dewy skincare products. The current skincare trend calls for a plump, glass-like complexion. Similar to past trends like \"dolphin skin,\" the goal is a shiny, dewy base. To achieve this look, add highly hydrating products to your skincare regimen—a nourishing cleanser , a glowy serum, and a plumping moisturizer."

      "title": "Go for a \"your nails but better\" manicure.",
      "content": "Go for a \"your nails but better\" manicure. When it comes to the clean girl aesthetic, well-kept, natural-looking nails are essential. Neutrals, nudes, and sheer pinks are the name of the game, and you can't go wrong with a classic French , either. Whether you're donning a short square shape or a long oval, your nails will be considered \"clean girl\" as long as they don't draw too much attention or distract from the rest of your ensemble."

      "title": "Fill your wardrobe with classic basics.",
      "content": "Fill your wardrobe with classic basics. The \"clean girl\" aesthetic values a polished look, but it should look like you didn’t have to try. The key is to exude effortlessness. Stick to well-fitting basics like black or white t-shirts, tank tops, boyfriend-cut blue jeans , white button-up shirts, oversized black blazers, and slip dresses. This preppy style is both stylish and timeless—the overall effect should be sophisticated but not stuffy."

    {
      "title": "Stick to a neutral color palette.",
      "content": "Stick to a neutral color palette. The clean girl aesthetic is all about neutrals like black, white, beige, taupe, etc. You will rarely catch a clean girl wearing neon yellow, as the style calls for soft, muted shades. If you do enjoy adding color into your wardrobe, opt for a pop of color here and there rather than going all out."

      "content": "Accessorize with minimal gold jewelry and hoop earrings. All jewelry should be neutral yet chic. Large statement necklaces or gaudy jewelry should be kept to a minimum, as simple staples like plain gold chains or hoop earrings are in favor. Items like a pair of bold black sunglasses can help elevate an outfit for some added fashion."

      "content": "Stick to a clean and minimalist lifestyle. The clean girl aesthetic extends beyond personal appearance, shaping a woman's daily habits and lifestyle. Mornings call for matcha lattes over regular coffee, and smoothies or green juices should be regular indulgences. When it comes to home decor, minimalism is the preferred choice for the \"clean girl,\" as it photographs best.

      "content": "Some feel that the trend encourages unrealistic beauty standards. Social media often presents a curated, idealized version of life that is pleasing to watch but fails to show the true effort required to maintain that \"clean girl\" aesthetic. These unrealistic portrayals set standards that are difficult, if not impossible, for most women to meet in their daily lives. [5] X Research source Even a seemingly simple \"no-makeup\" makeup routine demands as much time and energy as any other beauty regimen. Yet, women feel pressured to conform to these new societal norms in pursuit of an unattainable perfection."

      "content": "It has been considered by many as cultural appropriation. The predominantly white influencers promoting the \"clean girl\" aesthetic have been called out by people of color (POC) for encouraging the trend without acknowledging its cultural origins. For example, gold hoop earrings have been worn by African American and Latinx women for generations, yet were previously dismissed by mainstream white culture as \"ghetto\" and unsuitable for formal settings. [6] X Research source The clean girl aesthetic also draws inspiration from South Asian cultural practices, such as the tradition of using hair oils to achieve a slick, glossy look. Hair oiling has been commonplace in South Asian communities for generations. Yet, this hairstyle has sometimes been criticized by those who perceive it as unkempt or unclean."

      "content": "Some argue that the clean girl aesthetic implies other girls are dirty. The clean girl aesthetic promotes the harmful notion that individuals with flawless, clear skin are \"clean\" while those with acne or blemishes are somehow \"dirty.\" This association is problematic and misleading, as acne is a complex skin condition often influenced by factors beyond one's control, such as genetics.

      "title": "The clean girl aesthetic has been labeled non-inclusive.",
      "content": "The clean girl aesthetic has been labeled non-inclusive. The trend is said to promote a narrow standard of beauty, centering mostly on young, white, cisgender women as the ideal. This lack of diversity in the trend excludes BIPOC women, plus-size women, women with acne or disabilities, older women, and non-binary individuals. [8] X Research source Additionally, the use of the term \"girl\" can diminish womanhood and reinforce harmful fears around aging."

      "title": "Some see the clean girl aesthetic as classist.",
      "content": "Some see the clean girl aesthetic as classist. The \"clean girl\" aesthetic subtly conveys the idea that hyper-consumerism is linked to cleanliness. Hyper-consumerism, the habit of consistently buying more than one needs, is actually pretty harmful to the environment. This aesthetic tells young women that they must purchase overpriced health foods, excessive skin care products, and a wardrobe of neutral-toned clothing to be considered \"clean.\" [9] X Research source Not only is this likely wasteful, but it is also inaccessible to those of lower financial means. Not everyone can afford luxuries like Pilates classes, and this does not make them any less \"clean.\""

      "content": "The clean girl aesthetic embodies a minimalist, simple look, but it has its flaws. Simply put, the clean girl aesthetic is an internet trend that values low-maintenance and “effortless” beauty and fashion. The style, with its emphasis on young, thin, and \"flawless\" white women may seem innocent on the surface. However, this narrow ideal may reinforce the systemic devaluation of women of color and anyone who doesn't fit the mold of stereotypical beauty in our society. Remember, there’s nothing wrong with embracing a certain look if it’s truly your style and something you enjoy creating; however, following along with trends just because they’re what TikTok says is beautiful can do more harm than good, because it’s simply not true! You’re beautiful in your own way, no matter the aesthetic you choose to rock."
