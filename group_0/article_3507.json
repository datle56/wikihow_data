This can help you connect with a grieving friend. Always be looking for these kinds of shared values. Think about the emotions behind a situation. A friend finds out her husband has been unfaithful, for example. The base emotions here are likely loss, heartbreak, and betrayal.

Maybe Jess has been cheated on many times in the past. This would explain her insecurity."
