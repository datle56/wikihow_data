      "content": "A brownout is a partial reduction in power to an electrical grid. Though they’re sometimes accidental, utility providers often plan brownouts in advance to prevent electrical grids from getting overloaded due to sudden spikes in demand. [1] X Research source For example, a heat wave could cause millions of people to turn on their air conditioners at roughly the same time of day. To prevent a dangerous power surge, utility providers may momentarily reduce voltage across the grid. When a brownout happens, the lights in your house may dim a little. Electronics may turn off or stop working properly. After a few moments, the power level usually returns to normal. A brownout can affect part or all of an electrical grid."

      "title": "A blackout is an unplanned, total loss of power to an electrical grid.",
      "content": "A blackout is an unplanned, total loss of power to an electrical grid. They’re often caused by a failure of electrical equipment, such as a substation going offline due to a power surge. Local blackouts, like when you’re neighborhood loses power, can also happen when power lines and transformers get knocked down or short-circuited by falling trees, heavy snow, strong winds, or even bird strikes. [2] X Research source A blackout can affect part or all of an electrical grid. When a blackout happens, everything in your home that requires electricity will turn off. Smartphones and other battery-powered electronics can still work, as long as they’re charged. Your power may stay offline for minutes, hours, or days, depending on the cause of the blackout and how widespread it is. Your power won’t come online until the utility company fixes the problem. This could require anything from reconnecting a single power line to restarting entire power plants, depending on what went wrong."

      "content": "Prepare for brownouts by plugging your devices into surge protectors. Surge protectors and power strips protect your electronics in the event of a power surge, which sometimes occurs after a brownout. [3] X Research source Use power banks and battery backups for super-important things, like desktop computers and home security systems. These deliver a constant supply of electricity, regardless of a brownout or blackout. [4] X Research source The initial drop in power during a brownout could cause computers and other electronic devices to malfunction. Battery backups can help prevent this. [5] X Research source Make sure your home’s circuit breaker is working correctly. Have an electrician inspect it periodically to ensure it’s in working order. There are also whole system surge protectors that connect to the main circuit breaker panel, protecting more than just a couple of devices. into that has a little strip. You want to get your system (inaudible) the main circuit breaker panel."

      "content": "Prepare for blackouts by having an emergency kit handy. Prepare an emergency kit with flashlights , batteries , potable water, and shelf-stable food. Stash your kit where you can access it easily, like a cabinet in the kitchen or bathroom. [6] X Research source When the power goes out, check your home’s circuit breaker for any tripped switches. Unplug any computers, TVs, and other electronic devices before the power comes back online. This will prevent damage in the event of a power surge. [7] X Research source Avoid using candles due to the risk of fire. If you have to use a candle, keep it away from anything that could catch fire. Never leave it unattended. [8] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Always keep at least one smartphone plugged in to ensure you’ll have a working phone in the event of a blackout. Solar panels absorb the energy from the sun, which turns into electricity that is stored in a battery bank. If you can install solar panels in your property, you might be able to use the electricity during a power outage."
