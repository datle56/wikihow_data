      "content": "Geminis prefer to be spontaneous. For a Taurus lady who prefers the stability of well-laid-out plans, this can be hard for you to handle. The best way to approach a date with your Gemini guy is not to have a plan at all—he's great at winging it and you won't have to fret when your careful itinerary falls by the wayside. Even if he knows that you don't tend to play it fast and loose, he'll appreciate the fact that you're willing to let go a little when you're with him. If you do need to make specific plans for something—say, a dinner reservation or concert tickets—let him know about that commitment and keep everything around it loose. That gives him the opportunity to do something spontaneous."
