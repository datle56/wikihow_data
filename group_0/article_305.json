      "content": "Turn off aquarium light and dim the lights in the room where you're aquarium is set up. Do this before you remove your fish from the carrying container, since fish are sensitive to light and may be traumatized by a sudden change in lighting. [2] X Research source Once your fish is used to the tank, you can be less strict about lighting. It's a good idea to initially introduce your fish to a dim environment, as this will reduce the shock of being introduced to a new environment."

Your fish likely came in a bag from a pet store. If your fish did not come in a bag, you can transfer the fish and water to a small, plastic bag. Tie the end of the bag together and use a rubber band to seal the bag. It's important the bag is sealed tight, as your want your fish to stay in its original water for the initial 15-30 minutes minutes. [4] X Research source Simply set the bag on top of the water in the quarantine tank. The fish bag should float on the water's surface. Set a timer for 15 minutes. Keep an eye on the bag during this time to make sure it does not fall over or come undone. For about 15 minutes, allow the bag to float. This way, the water in the bag will gradually become the same temperature as the water in the tank. [5] X Expert Source Craig Morton Aquarium Specialist, Aquarium Doctor Inc.

This pocket will allow the bag to float as you begin adding water from the tank to the bag.

When 4 minutes have passed, add another half cup of aquarium water to the bag. [7] X Research source Keep adding water from the aquarium every 4 minutes until the bag is completely full. How long this process will take varies. For a smaller bag, you may only need to add a couple of half cups. For a larger bag, you may need to add water 3 or 4 times before the bag is full."

Antibiotics may be administered to a fish's tank, or you may give your fish food with antibiotics. Symptoms of infections changes in color, frayed or rotting fins, a lack of appetite, gray marks on the scale and fins, and open sores on a fish.
