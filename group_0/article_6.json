      "content": "Half of ⅓ Cup is 2 tablespoons + 2 teaspoons. In order to find an accurate measurement of half of ⅓ cup, convert it to smaller units of measurement. Convert to tablespoons : there are 16 tablespoons (tbsps) in 1 cup, so divide 16 by 3 to get 5 ⅓ tbsps in ⅓ cup. Convert to teaspoons : There are 3 tsps in 1 tbsp, so multiply 5 by 3 to get 15 tsps. Because ⅓ of a tbsp is 1 tsp, add 1 to your total of 15 tsps for a total of 16 tsps in ⅓ cup. Divide in half : 16 tsps divided by 2 is 8 tsps in half of ⅓ cup. You can measure out 8 tsps or convert to tbsps. Because there are 3 tsps in a tbsp, divide 8 by 3 to get 2 tbsp with 2 tsps left over."

You can use a knife or spatula to level off the excess ingredients. Brown sugar is the exception to this rule. When spooning brown sugar, press on the sugar with the back of your scooping spoon until the measuring cup is full, and then level off. [6] X Research source"

[10] X Research source Either eyeball half of the whisked egg or weigh it on a scale and then remove a little of the egg mixture at a time until you have half of the original amount.
