      "content": "Attend a locomotive engineer training program. All entry-level railroad positions require training to learn the basics of railroad work. Many community and state colleges offer courses and even associates degrees in railroad operations and locomotive engineering. You can also find directories online that can help you locate a training center or program near you. Look for training programs that are often run in partnership with small regional or local railroads. In addition to providing you with the training you need, these can be helpful for connecting you to job opportunities in your area."

      "content": "Apply for beginner-level positions with a railroad. Many locomotive engineers start out as conductors, rail yard engineers, switch operators or yardmasters, where they learn about the policies, operations and routes of the railroad before moving into training to become a driver. Getting your foot in the door in a starter position will give you a chance to build familiarity with railroad work while earning a living. [3] X Research source Applications are online through railroad websites by following links for job and career opportunities. Check out a variety of railroad jobs online on forums like the one hosted by RailServe.com. If you want to drive commuter trains or subway trains, check for jobs with area public transit authorities.

      "content": "Complete the required training. During the training period you will learn all the procedures, operations and route details you will need to operate the train. Training will involve a combination of classroom and hands-on exercises, including working with train simulators and, eventually, real trains. [9] X Research source Some railroads may have onsite training or they may partner with a college or University in the area. Others will require you to go offsite to a centralized training facility for up to 2 months or more. Amtrak, for example, requires it’s trainee locomotive engineers to spend 8-10 weeks at their training center in Wilmington, DE before they begin their on-the-job training.

      "content": "Take a written knowledge test. The Federal Railroad Administration requires each railroad company to oversee its own certification process. The written test is the first part of the certification process and is based on studying each railroad’s operating practices, equipment inspection procedures, train route knowledge and Federal safety regulations. [12] X Research source There are three levels of certification that you can test for based on your experience and job specifications: student engineer, locomotive servicing engineer and train service engineer. [13] X Research source Train service engineers are the most skilled and experienced. They may drive locomotives with cars attached. Locomotive servicing engineers may operate trains but cannot drive them with cars attached. Student engineers may only operate trains while under the direct supervision of an instructor."
