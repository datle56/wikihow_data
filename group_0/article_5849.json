      "content": "Capricorn's practicality may clash with Cancer's sensitivity. Capricorn men can be logical and practical to a fault. They lack Cancer's sensitivity, and though they can fall in love just like any sign, they may not always express it openly in a way that Cancer can easily pick up on. Cancer ladies might be looking for more open displays of affection than Capricorn is prepared to give. Reach a compromise ! Capricorn, do your best to be more affectionate with your Cancer woman. You're generous and always ready to help, but she also wants physical affection and sweet words. Cancer, remember that your Capricorn guy may express himself differently than you do. Remember to take his kind gestures and support for what they are: a sign that he truly loves you."
