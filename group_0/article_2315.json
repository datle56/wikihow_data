      "content": "Use condoms for reliable, inexpensive birth control. If you're having heterosexual sex, condoms are one of the easiest to use birth control options. Remove the condom from the wrapper and roll the condom onto the erect penis. Make sure that the rim of the condom is on the outside, so that it will roll on more easily. Condoms last a long time, but they do expire. Check the date before using one. [1] X Research source You can buy condoms at any drugstore, and you can also get them for free at many schools and health centers. You and your partner should both be comfortable putting on the condom. Try the female condom. These condoms go inside the vagina and are used to prevent pregnancy. Follow the directions on the package. Both male and female condoms also protect you from STIs (also known as STDs)."

[2] X Research source Talk to your doctor about possible side effects, such as weight gain or spotting and bleeding between periods. You might also suffer from mood swings or depression. The pill is most effective when taken at the same time each day. Set a reminder on your phone to help you remember to take the pill. You have to take the pill daily because it is out of your system after a day. [3] X Expert Source Aimee Eyvazzadeh, MD, MA OB/GYN & Fertility Specialist Expert Interview. 24 March 2020.

At 99%, the IUD is one of the most effective forms of birth control. A medical professional will insert the IUD. While it can be removed at any time, it can remain in the uterus and be effective for up to twelve years. [6] X Research source There are two different kinds of IUDs: copper and hormonal. Ask your doctor about which one is right for you. One of the great things about copper IUDs is that they can be used as emergency contraception. If you have one inserted within five days after having intercourse, it can prevent pregnancy. Side effects can include cramping and irregular periods. These usually go away after three to six months. It can be free, but could cost up to $1,000. Costs of birth control depend on your individual provider and your insurance plan."
