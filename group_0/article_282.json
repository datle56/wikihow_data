If you don't know the Wi-Fi password, you can also use this guide to help you find it. Depending on your router, you may be able to access it through a mobile app on your Android, iPhone, or iPad.

For example, if you have an Xfinity XFi Gateway, you can access and set up your router using the Xfinity app. [1] X Research source"
