      "content": "Don’t wear diamond earrings all the time. It’s easier to clean diamond earrings if you don’t get them very dirty in the first place. So, it’s a good idea to remove them for activities that could dirty them such as going to the beach, playing sports, gardening, and even washing dishes. Keep diamond earrings away from chlorine bleach. It can cause them damage. Natural oils can leave a coating on diamond jewelry that needs removing to restore the earrings to their proper brilliance. Contact with skin, lotions, powders, and soaps can leave such a film. Put your earrings on last, after you style your hair and put on perfume and lotion. All of these products can damage the earrings, so reduce the exposure."

Diamonds are almost impossible to scratch – unless it’s with another diamond. Thus, you shouldn’t store them right next to each other because the diamonds can scratch each other. Avoid touching the earrings too much. The hands contain body oils that can turn diamonds dull.

      "content": "Consider having your earrings professionally cleaned. Ask your local jewelers if they offer an ultrasonic or ionic cleaning for diamond jewelry. Many will only charge a nominal fee for such services. Search for a jeweler that offers sulfuric acid cleaning if you have extremely dirty diamond earrings that you cannot clean any other way. Sulfuric acid boils are still relatively inexpensive but cost a little more than ultrasonic cleanings. They can damage jewelry if not done properly."

Put the jewelry in the ketchup only for a few minutes."
