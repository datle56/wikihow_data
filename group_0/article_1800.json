    {
      "title": "Watch where you ash.",
      "content": "Watch where you ash. Before attempting this method, make sure you have an acceptable place to ash. An ashtray is preferable, but in the absence of one you should ash in the sink, in a cup, on asphalt, or a surface that can be easily cleaned. Avoid ashing on wood, carpet, tile, or cloth as these will be stained and/or burned."

    {
      "title": "Hold your cigarette steadily between your index and middle finger.",
      "content": "Hold your cigarette steadily between your index and middle finger. The cigarette should be firmly held at a point where the middle finger acts as the fulcrum. Your middle finger will hold it in place, keeping it firm so it doesn’t move while being flicked. Your grip on the cigarette shouldn’t be too rough otherwise you might split it in half. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Flick downward",
      "content": "Flick downward once or multiple times to get rid of ash. Press down firmly on the filter with the pad of your thumb with your index and middle finger holding the cigarette in place. The tip of the cigarette will shake so the ash falls below."
    },
    {
      "title": "Grab your cigarette with your thumb and middle fingers.",
      "content": "Grab your cigarette with your thumb and middle fingers. The cigarette should be held at its filter with the index finger hovering above. The grip should be firm without crushing the filter in the process."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tap lightly on the top of the cigarette with your index finger.",
      "content": "Tap lightly on the top of the cigarette with your index finger. Be sure not to tap it too hard or else the cigarette will bend a bit or break. Avoid touching the ash or the point where the cigarette is lit so you don’t burn yourself."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flick the cigarette multiple times.",
      "content": "Flick the cigarette multiple times. This method doesn’t provide a great amount of pressure on the cigarette so it’s likely that you’ll have to “ash” it multiple times. Always find a proper place to ash that doesn’t damage yours or someone else’s property."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rest the cigarette in between your index and middle finger.",
      "content": "Rest the cigarette in between your index and middle finger. This starting position is similar to the one used in the thumb flick method where your middle finger serves as the fulcrum while the index finger holds it in place. Keep the pressure between your fingers strong enough to hold the cigarette in place, but avoid squeezing too hard so you don’t split it in half. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold it over the ashtray.",
      "content": "Hold it over the ashtray. Make sure the cigarette is only an inch or so above the edge of the ashtray, with the tip of the cigarette hovering over the inside of it. This way the ash falls in the ashtray, instead of falling outside of it. This common pitfall could damage the table the ashtray is on and make you look like a novice. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your thumb to tap the cigarette on the edge of the ashtray.",
      "content": "Use your thumb to tap the cigarette on the edge of the ashtray. Use the top of your thumbnail to strike the bottom of the filter, causing the front of the cigarette to hit downward on the ashtray. Make sure the cigarette hits the side of the ashtray because it provides a solid surface to loosen the ash. The impact with the ashtray should cause your cigarette to ash."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use this method at bars or at home.",
      "content": "Use this method at bars or at home. This trick is great if you need to ash into an empty beer bottle or any glass bottle. It’s especially useful because the bottle acts a receptacle for the ash, so you can just throw your ash away with the bottle after you’re finished. Make sure you’re done with your beverage so you don’t end up drinking ash, which could have dangerous health effects."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the cigarette between thumb and index finger.",
      "content": "Hold the cigarette between thumb and index finger. In this grip, you’re firmly holding it at the filter but not forcefully enough where the filter becomes crushed. Hold the cigarette upright as the ash will easily fall down if it’s pointed downwards. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn the cigarette upside down over the bottle’s opening.",
      "content": "Turn the cigarette upside down over the bottle’s opening. Be careful that the tip of the cigarette is hovering over the bottle so the ash falls straight into the bottle. Keep the bottle stationary as well to ensure the ash doesn’t fall anywhere else."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put the cigarette inside the bottle.",
      "content": "Put the cigarette inside the bottle. Flick the bottom of the filter with the fingernail on your middle finger. This will cause the tip of the cigarette to hit the inside of the bottle, causing the ash to fall inside the bottle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make it quick.",
      "content": "Make it quick. Flicking the cigarette over for too long while cause it to burn more quickly. It might take a few times to get the ash in the bottle, so make sure to flick the cigarette with enough force to loosen the ash up in a couple of tries."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the cigarette filter between your thumb and index finger.",
      "content": "Hold the cigarette filter between your thumb and index finger. Keep the tip of the cigarette pointed upwards so stray ash doesn’t fall down. Ensure the grip is light but firm, allowing the cigarette to stay in place without crushing the filter. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the lit end of the cigarette directly on the ashtray.",
      "content": "Place the lit end of the cigarette directly on the ashtray. Have the cigarette hover over the center of the ashtray with a roughly 45-degree angle between the cigarette and ashtray surface. Don’t point the lit end of the cigarette downward until you’re directly over the ashtray, ensuring the ash falls directly in."
    },
    {
      "title": "Roll the cigarette between your thumb and index finger, pressing it against the loose ash in the ashtray.",
      "content": "Roll the cigarette between your thumb and index finger, pressing it against the loose ash in the ashtray. Put the lit end of the cigarette in the center of the ashtray, and roll it between your fingers without actually moving it back and forth. The cigarette will naturally rest on the unburnt tobacco on the cigarette tip when it makes contact with the ashtray. By rolling the cigarette you brush off the majority of the loose ash, as well as making a smooth, symmetrical, and sophisticated cigarette."
