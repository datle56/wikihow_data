      "content": "Try to craft a birthday caption that’s short, sweet, and snappy. According to social media expert Kasey Dunn, your caption should be concise to “captivate the audience in the first eight seconds” of seeing your post. After a few lines of text, Instagram hides the rest of your caption, so include the most eye-catching details at the beginning. Most users won’t read a lengthy caption, so when in doubt, keep it sweet and simple. Play around with different birthday-related emojis to add more personality to your caption. Some great options include: 🎉, 🥳, 🎂, and 🌟! Include questions in your caption to increase engagement . For instance, you could caption your post with “What should I add to my birthday checklist?” or “Am I officially an adult now?” Social media and digital marketing consultant Candace Gasper also recommends “seeing what’s trending in pop culture and utilizing it in your post.” If there’s a viral song or meme, for example, you could reference it in your caption."
