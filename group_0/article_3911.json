      "content": "Latin is the foundation of many modern languages and continues to grow. Although you may have heard that Latin is a dead language, this is not entirely the case. “Dead” languages are primarily defined as languages that have no more living speakers, which is certainly untrue of Latin. In fact, it’s estimated that there are up to 10,000 Latin speakers alive today, with podcasts and novellas being released in the ancient language. [6] X Research source The only validity to the idea that Latin is “dead” is that there are no native speakers, or generations of families who learn Latin as a primary language in the home. Latin has been around for 2700 years, and is the bedrock of all the major modern Romance languages: Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian. Neo-Latin dictionaries include the addition of words like “astronaves” or “spaceships,” “astronautae” or “astronauts,” and “interrete” or “the internet.” Although Latin vocabulary has expanded, speakers of Latin speak it in the same way that their ancient counterparts did. Learning Latin provides the opportunity to read classic literature, like Ovid’s Metamorphoses , in its original form."

Although some lawyers may prefer to do away with the ancient tongue altogether, others recognize the importance of maintaining this tradition, since Latin can convey straightforward ideas in few words, as opposed to their lengthy and complicated English versions. Some common Latin legal phrases include: [8] X Research source “Alibi,” meaning a defendant’s claim that they were elsewhere when the crime in question was committed. “Subpoena,” meaning a summons to appear in court to deliver a testimony. “Affidavit,” meaning a written statement usually signed by a witness."
