      "content": "Visit the help portal to solve specific issues. Open the portal and click “games,” “accounts,” or “enterprise” depending on whether you need help with a specific game, your Epic Store account, or Unreal Engine. Then, follow the flow chart of options by clicking on each relevant option. Eventually, Epic will either give you the specific solution, or provide you with a relevant link to get more help. For example, if you have a problem communicating with players in Rocket League, you’d click “games,” then, “Rocket League,” then, “How do I use Push to Talk in Rocket League.” This may or may not lead you to a link to communicate with an employee at Epic."

Make sure your tweets and messages are less than 280 characters long or else it won’t fit on the site. Epic Games may not respond over X. It looks like they only occasionally respond in public, so you may have better chances in direct messages. Epic Games seems most active on X, so this is probably your best shot."
