When you kiss a partner with your mouth — whether you just use your lips or French kiss with your tongue — there's no possible way you can get pregnant simply by doing that. Even if you give them oral sex (or they give it to you), you still won't get pregnant from that act alone. You also can't get pregnant by hugging each other tightly or dry humping with your clothes on. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Yes, but the risk of getting an STD or STI from kissing is very low. The main sexually transmitted disease or infection to be aware of is oral herpes, a common infection affecting half of adults in the US that causes sores (called cold sores) around the lips and mouth. It comes and goes throughout your lifetime when you're stressed or ill. However, you can usually avoid it as long as the person who has it isn't experiencing a flare-up of sores when you kiss them. [2] X Research source The only other time you should be worried about getting an STD or STI from kissing is if your partner has HIV or syphilis accompanied by open, bleeding sores in or around their mouth. Both of those STDs can spread through the blood. Therefore, it's best to avoid kissing anyone with sores on or in their mouth. There are rare cases of people getting infections after engaging in oral sex. But that can only happen when you have oral sex with someone who has an STD like chlamydia or gonorrhea and you swallow some of the fluid that comes out of their genitals. The infection occurs in your throat."

      "content": "Pregnancy happens when a sperm from a male fertilizes a female egg. Most biological women are born with 3 reproductive organs: ovaries, fallopian tubes, and a uterus. Once a month (for most women), one of the ovaries releases an egg into its corresponding fallopian tube. When a male orgasms inside a female's vagina, he releases a fluid called ejaculate (or semen) containing millions of cells called sperm. These sperm travel up the fallopian tubes. If just one of those sperm attaches to the female's egg and fertilizes it, the egg transforms into a group of cells called a blastocyst. If the blastocyst completes its journey to the uterus and implants inside it, this group of cells develops into a baby.

You also don't have to worry if you gave your male partner oral sex and he ejaculated in your mouth and you swallowed it.

If he does it anywhere else on your body or on clothes or any other surfaces, the sperm won't be able to get from there to your fallopian tubes.

The odds of the sperm making it into your vagina in all that water — not to mention surviving for more than a few seconds in the water amid all those chemicals — are zero.

You can get pregnant this way even if he pulls out before he orgasms. That's because males release a small amount of pre-ejaculate (or pre-cum) before they \"finish.\" Pre-ejaculate doesn't contain as many sperm as regular ejaculate, but a woman can definitely still get pregnant if any of those sperm make it into the fallopian tube.

Or what if he fingers you right after masturbating and gets some of his ejaculate inside you that way? In either case, there's a slight possibility you'll get pregnant. Anytime sperm comes in close contact with your vagina, even on the outside, there's a risk of it transferring inside through your vaginal fluids, fingering, or your male partner inserting his penis inside you when the ejaculate is still fresh. Sperm can survive for up to 1 hour outside the vagina, providing it's allowed to sit at room temperature at 68 °F (20 °C). They die quickly when exposed to other temperatures.

Normally, this wouldn't cause a woman to become pregnant because sperm can't travel from the anus to the fallopian tubes. However, if some of the ejaculate spills out of the anus and trails into the vagina, that might cause pregnancy.

If you plan on being sexually active, one of the best ways to prevent pregnancy is to start birth control with medication (commonly referred to as \"the pill\") or a contraceptive device. Contraceptive devices include the NuvaRing , intrauterine devices (IUDs) like Mirena , or patches. All of these options, including the pill, work by releasing hormones into your body that stop you from getting pregnant. The exception is the copper IUD, which doesn't release hormones but instead create a hostile environment in your uterus so the sperm can't survive.

If you don't want to or can't take a pill or use a contraceptive device (or if you want extra protection just in case), ask your male partner to use a condom when you're having sex. A condom is a plastic sheath that fits over an erect penis and catches the ejaculate. Avoid having your partner wear more than 1 condom at a time. Condoms are specially designed to stay intact during sex, so there's no need to double up. Plus, wearing two of them at once can actually increase the risk the plastic will break because of the way the condoms rub against one another. [19] X Research source"

Put the cap back on and wait 2-3 minutes (or however long the instructions tell you) while watching the window in the stick. If you see 2 lines or the test says, \"Pregnant,\" it's a positive result (you might be pregnant). If only 1 line appears or the test says, \"Not pregnant,\" you're probably in the clear.
