      "content": "Avoid harsh cleaners for routine cleaning. Some solvents and acids can soften or erode rubber flooring if used regularly.

      "content": "Do not clean rubber flooring within 72 hours of installation. Rubber flooring is softest immediately after installation. It cures, becoming harder and more durable over time.

      "content": "Use a vinegar solution for water-based stains. For occasional water-based stains, for example beverages or sweat, treat your rubber floor with a white vinegar solution. Mix a solution that is 50% water and 50% white vinegar. Use a towel to rub the mixture on the stained area in small circles to lift as much staining as possible. When finished, mop the area with mild dish soap and water just as you would when performing routine cleaning. Allow the area to air dry."

      "title": "Use turpentine on oil-based stains.",
      "content": "Use turpentine on oil-based stains. Turpentine is highly toxic and should be handled with care. Wear rubber gloves, ventilate the area well, and secure all pets and children elsewhere before handling. Pour up to 3 teaspoons of turpentine on a clean, dry cloth, and blot the area to lift staining. [4] X Research source When finished, mop with soap and warm water as normal, allowing the area to air dry. Turpentine is a last resort for severe, oil-based staining. Used to excess, it can even stain your rubber floors."

      "content": "Lift paint stains with paint thinner. If you get some paint on your rubber floor, use a small amount of paint thinner to clean the drips. Wear rubber gloves, ventilate the area well, and secure all pets and children elsewhere before beginning work. Pour a small amount of paint thinner on a clean, dry cloth and wipe the dripped areas in a short sweeping motion, using a new part of the cloth each time. The bits of paint will begin to peel and lift. Sweep paint flecks up into a dustpan and discard. When finished, mop with soap and warm water as normal, allowing the area to air dry."
