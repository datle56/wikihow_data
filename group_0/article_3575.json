      "content": "Decide if being a mail carrier is right for you. Before beginning the application process, you will need to figure out if you would be happy as a letter carrier. Like all jobs, this will depend on your personality, lifestyle, and skill set. The happiest and most effective letter carriers will be \"morning people.\" Most postal carriers start their day at 7 am and finish around 3 pm. If you're an early-riser who would like to avoid rush-hour traffic, you may be an excellent fit. The typical workday for most mail carriers is a physically strenuous one. Your job will likely consist of a lot of walking and lifting heavy objects. If you do not enjoy physical activity or you have health problems that would make these tasks difficult or impossible, you would probably be better suited for a different job. Unless you live in a dense urban center, you will need to be a skilled driver. The mail needs to be delivered no matter the road conditions. If you are prone to traffic accidents or you find driving to be stressful, this may not be the right career for you. [2] X Research source"
