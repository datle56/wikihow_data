      "title": "Choose traditional sports tape for more rigid support.",
      "content": "Choose traditional sports tape for more rigid support. A conventional sports tape provides rigid structure to your joints when applied correctly. So if you’re more interested in toe support than the flexibility of wearing the tape for days at a time, select regular sports tape over kinesiology tape."

      "title": "Buy non-elastic zinc oxide sports tape.",
      "content": "Buy non-elastic zinc oxide sports tape. Visit a drugstore or sporting goods store and buy adhesive sports tape that’s 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) thick. It should be a waterproof zinc oxide tape that doesn’t have any stretch to it. [1] X Research source Look for tape with a grid printed on the back for easier measuring and cutting."

      "content": "Measure and cut four arch strips. Unroll some of the tape and wrap it all the way around the arch of your foot, perpendicular to your toes. Mark the tape about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) past where it rounds the edge of your foot. Cut the tape at this mark, and then cut three more strips that are the same length. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Measure and cut two strips of tape for your toe. Unroll more tape and wrap it around your big toe this time. Mark the point where the tape overlaps by about 1 inch (2.5 cm), and then cut the tape at that spot. Cut a second piece of tape that’s the same length. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Trim the width of the toe strips to fit your toe.",
      "content": "Trim the width of the toe strips to fit your toe. If the thickness of the tape you bought causes the edge of the toe strips to extend beyond the tip of your toe, trim the width back. Leave about a centimeter of your big toe peeking out the top of the strip when it’s wrapped. This will prevent big gaps from forming along the edge of the tape. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Measure and cut three edge strips. Unroll some tape and hold it along the inner edge of your foot. Hold the end in line with the bottom of your big toenail, and pull the tape back to about where your ankle is. Mark the tape there and cut it, then cut two more strips the same length.

Wrap the edges up around the middle of your foot and press the tape into your skin. [7] X Research source These anchor strips should adhere firmly to your foot, but they should not be overly tight."

But this time, offset the tape a little toward your toes. Most of this second strip should still overlap the first, but taping about a centimeter of the second strip directly to your skin will create a stronger anchor. [8] X Research source"

[18] X Research source 80% stretch will feel like it’s pulled almost as tight as it will go.

Talk to your doctor if you have severe bunion pain, or if taping does not correct your bunion after a few months. If you have any rash or irritation around the tape, you may be having a reaction. Talk to your doctor about using a non-adhesive bunion treatment. If you have a latex allergy, you should look for a non-latex tape."
