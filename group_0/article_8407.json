Then, you can add 2 to 3 citrus slices or 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vinegar to the water. If your microwave is really dirty, consider adding both the citrus and the vinegar. [1] X Expert Source Susan Stocker House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 20 April 2020. You can use any type of vinegar, such as plain white vinegar or apple cider vinegar.

      "content": "Put a wooden skewer into the bowl. If you're going to heat the water in a perfectly smooth bowl, the microwave can superheat the liquid and cause the bowl to burst. To prevent the liquid from superheating, add a wooden skewer or wooden spoon to the bowl. [2] X Research source Avoid putting a metal skewer or spoon into the bowl since it can overheat and scorch your microwave."

Remove the turntable and wash both sides of it with soapy water. Put the clean turntable on the counter while you clean the inside of the microwave. [5] X Research source If the bowl is still hot after 5 minutes, wear oven mitts to remove it. If the turntable is really greasy or has burnt-on stains, you could soak it in a sink full of soapy water while you clean the inside of the microwave."

If you have an older microwave, it's probably got yellow stains from years of use but these are easy to remove with a little nail polish.
