[7] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source A good rule of thumb is to add five pounds of weight for every inch of height. For instance, if your 5’4” friend is 120 pounds and you are 6 inches taller, you might want to weigh about 150 pounds. This guideline will vary based on your frame size and lifestyle. For instance, if you’re an athlete, you might weigh more due to muscle mass."
