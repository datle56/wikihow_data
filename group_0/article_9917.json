      "content": "Blanch the corn for three to five minutes. Blanching the corn first will make the kernels easier to remove. Set a timer and blanch your corn for three to five minutes to start. [2] X Research source To blanch the corn, you need to bring the water to a boil first. You can also add a few teaspoons of salt to the water. You should also have a bowl of ice water prepared. [3] X Research source After blanching the corn for three to five minutes, remove it from the boiling water. Place it in the ice water until it's cool enough to touch."

      "content": "Cut off the kernels. Hold each cob of corn on its side with one hand. With your other hand, take a sharp knife and slowly run it down the side of the corn. This should remove the kernels. [4] X Research source Make sure to move slowly so most of the kernels stay intact. If the corn is slippery, pat it dry with paper towels to avoid an accident while cutting it."

      "content": "Place the kernels on a dehydrator tray. You want to make sure you only have one single layer of kernels. You should spread them evenly over the dehydrator tray. If you notice any kernels stuck together, break them up before placing the kernels in a dehydrator. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Dehydrate the corn until crispy. The dehydrator should be set to 120 degrees Fahrenheit (about 49 degrees Celsius). Dehydrate your kernels until they're hard and crispy. How long this will take depends on how many kernels you're dehydrating, but it can take between 12 and 14 hours. Check on the kernels every hour or so and remove them when they're done.

      "content": "Place your kernels in a blender. As glass gem corn is a flint corn, you can use it to make cornmeal which can be used in meals likes grits. Use the strongest blender you have, as this will make the finest cornmeal. Add as many kernels as you want to your blender. It depends on how much cornmeal you want to make. More kernels will produce a greater amount of cornmeal. [9] X Research source If you don't have a very strong blender, you may be unable to grind kernels fine enough for cornmeal. Consider splurging on a stronger blender if you want to make cornmeal with your glass gem corn."

After a few more seconds, increase the speed to high. Increasing the speed gradually will prevent kernels from clogging the blades. [10] X Research source"

Place it in the bottom of a three quart sauce pan. Allow it to heat over medium-high heat. [14] X Research source After a few minutes, place three to four kernels in the oil. If they pop, it's heated. If not, remove the kernels and try again in a few minutes. Your oil will be ready to use when a few kernels pop."
