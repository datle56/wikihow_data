      "title": "Know whether you can use this method.",
      "content": "Know whether you can use this method. If your Roku was once connected to a Wi-Fi network that no longer exists, you can create a Wi-Fi hotspot that has the same Wi-Fi network name, which will trick your Roku into thinking your computer, phone, or tablet is that same network. You can then connect a phone or tablet to the same hotspot, which makes it so you can use the Roku mobile app as a remote. Before you give this method a try, you'll need to know a few important things: You must have at least one device that supports creating a personal hotspot. This can be a Windows PC or Mac that has internet access, or an Android or iPhone that supports tethering . Most Androids and iPhones support tethering, but the service is not always free. Check with your provider to be sure. You must have the exact Wi-Fi network name and password that the Roku last connected to. If your device allows you to create a hotspot with a blank password, you can leave the password field blank instead. You will also need a second mobile device—a phone or tablet—that can also connect to the hotspot. This second device is the one you'll use as a replacement for your Roku remote. It might be easiest to create the hotspot on your computer and then use your phone as the remote. Or, if you have a friend or family member around who also has a phone, one of you can create the hotspot, and the other can connect to it and use the Roku app as a remote."
