      "title": "Get a pair of quality leather or canvas gloves.",
      "content": "Get a pair of quality leather or canvas gloves. You should always wear quality leather or canvas gloves when you are handling any animal traps. The gloves will protect your hands from getting scratched by the skunk and reduce your risk of infection due to exposure to feces or urine. You can use a pair of gardening gloves or work gloves as long as they are thick leather or canvas. Do not use gloves that have holes or cuts in them as you do not want your skin exposed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find a canvas tarp or a large towel.",
      "content": "Find a canvas tarp or a large towel. You will use the towel or the tarp to cover the live trap. This will temporarily blind the skunk and make it easier for you to release the skunk from the trap. Find a towel or a tarp that you do not plan to use again, as it may be at risk of getting sprayed by the skunk. Make sure the tarp or towel is made of durable materials that cannot be cut or chewed by the skunk. Canvas, denim, and towel like material is best. You can also use a thick trash bag in a pinch. Look for a towel or a tarp that is long and wide enough to cover the entire trap. Most live traps for skunks are 24 inches x 7 inches x 8 inches (61 cm x 18 cm x 20 cm)."

      "title": "Wear old clothing.",
      "content": "Wear old clothing. You should also put on some old clothing, such as an old long sleeve t-shirt and long pants. If you follow the approach and removal steps properly, you should not be sprayed by the skunk. But there is always a chance it could happen so you should opt for an outfit that you do not mind throwing out if it does get sprayed. [2] X Research source Opt for clothing that covers your legs and arms, as you do not want to be at risk of getting scratched by the skunk. You can wear a scarf around your neck if you want to cover up further, but you will likely not come too close to the skunk to get scratched."

      "title": "Check the door of the trap.",
      "content": "Check the door of the trap. There are two types of live traps: a trap with a gravity door and a trap with a spring-loaded door. You will need to use different techniques to open each one so you should stand several feet away from the trap and confirm the type by looking at the door. Gravity door traps use gravity to open and close. A locking mechanism on the door prevents the skunk from getting out of the trap. You will need to push on the trap and flip it over to open the door. Spring loaded door traps use a spring latch on the door to open and close it. They will require you to get close to the trap door to open it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Move slowly and quietly.",
      "content": "Move slowly and quietly. You do not want to appear threatening or large to the skunk. Crouch low to the ground and talk quietly to the skunk as you approach the trap. This way, the skunk will not view you as a threat. You should also avoid making any sudden or jerky movements. Walk low and slow to toward the trap with the tarp or towel in your hand. Skunks will pound their front feet, making a steady thumping sound, when they feel agitated or stressed. If you hear thumping in the cage, take it as a warning that the skunk may spray you. You may need to back off and wait until the noise goes away to approach the skunk again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drape the towel or tarp over the trap.",
      "content": "Drape the towel or tarp over the trap. Once you have gotten close enough to the trap, carefully lay the towel or tarp over the trap. You want to cover the trap completely, save the door of the trap. Covering the trap will temporarily blind the skunk and make them less likely to spray what they cannot see. Once you lay down the towel or tarp you should wait a moment and listen for any thumping in the trap. Sometimes, the towel or tarp can startle the skunk and make them agitated."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a good spot to release the skunk.",
      "content": "Choose a good spot to release the skunk. You should release the skunk in an area that is at the edge of your property, close to trees or a spot near a forest. Keep all outdoor areas and doors closed, such as your garage door or your barn door, so the skunk cannot run into these areas once you release it from the trap. [3] X Research source If you are setting the trap yourself, you should try to set the trap in an area where you have seen skunks before, at the far end of your property. It will then make it easier to release the skunk into the wild, rather than risk it running somewhere on your property. It might be a good idea to place the skunk in the bed of a truck and drive farther away, or it might come back to your property."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flip over a gravity door trap.",
      "content": "Flip over a gravity door trap. If you have a gravity door trap, you will need to flip over the trap so the door opens and allows the skunk to leave. You can use a painters pole or a pole that is 10 feet (3 m) long at least to gently push the trap onto its roof. Once the trap flips over, the gravity door should pop open. You can also approach the trap from the side and use your hand or foot to gently flip over the trap. Make sure the trap is covered completely with the towel or tarp before you approach it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Open a spring loaded door trap.",
      "content": "Open a spring loaded door trap. Spring loaded trap doors are a little trickier to open. You will need to approach the door and open it manually by pressing the spring loaded latch or button on the door. Make sure the trap is covered at the end opposite to the door so you can access the door easily. If you set the trap yourself, you may want to practice opening and closing it beforehand so you can do it quickly when it comes time to release a skunk. Opening the door quickly will reduce your risk of getting sprayed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Walk away from the trap quickly.",
      "content": "Walk away from the trap quickly. Once you have opened the door, you should walk away from the trap quickly and quietly. You may hold another towel or tarp over your body and back away facing the trap so you are protected if the skunk does spray. [4] X Research source Do not jump or run away from the trap as this can startle the skunk. Instead, walk away slowly and quietly so the skunk has time to come out of the trap on their own."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the trap the following morning.",
      "content": "Check the trap the following morning. Though the trap is now open, it may take the skunk some time to actually leave the trap. Noises around the trap may deter the skunk from leaving. Skunks are also nocturnal animals so they may not exit the trap until nightfall. You should wait and check the trap the following morning, as the skunk will likely be gone by then. If you are in a rush to get the skunk out of the trap, you can use a garden hose to lightly wet the skunk. Do not spray the skunk with the force of the water. Instead, you should make the skunk wet with a light spray of water so it is encouraged to exit the trap. Make sure any enclosures nearby are closed and sealed so the skunk does not run out of the trap and hide in these areas."

    {
      "title": "Clean your clothing if you do get sprayed.",
      "content": "Clean your clothing if you do get sprayed. If you do end up getting sprayed by the skunk in the process of approaching and releasing it from the trap, you should make sure you clean your clothing and your body well to remove the smell. You will need to combine hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, and liquid dish soap to get rid of the skunk spray. [5] X Research source Wash your clothing and your body with the hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, and liquid dish soap mixture. You should also flush your eyes with water if you get sprayed in the eyes."
