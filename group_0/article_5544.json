      "title": "Find out international billing rates.",
      "content": "Find out international billing rates. Before you make your call, you should find out what you can expect to pay to connect a call from the UK to Canada. Visit your mobile carrier's website or call its customer service line to inquire about any flat fees or per-minute rates. Be sure to be thorough so that you're not surprised by any extra fees or hidden charges. It may be worth it to purchase an international phone card. A phone card or calling card allows you to pay in advance for a specific number of minutes for international calling. They often have cheaper long distance rates than regular telephone providers. You should be able to find them in most convenience stores."

      "title": "Dial 00 for the UK international access code.",
      "content": "Dial 00 for the UK international access code. To call any number outside the UK, you'll first have to dial 00. This tells your phone company that the number you're about to dial will not be a domestic UK number. [1] X Research source If you're dialing from a mobile phone, you can substitute the + button for 00. Access the + button by holding down the 0 button for a few seconds. After dialing 00 or +, don't press send yet. Continue onto the next steps before placing the call."

    {
      "title": "Dial 1 for Canada's country code.",
      "content": "Dial 1 for Canada's country code. Each country has its own country code for receiving international calls. To call a Canadian number from the UK, you'll have to dial 1 to indicate that Canada is the country you want your call routed to. [2] X Research source So far, you should have dialed 00 1, or +1, depending on if you're on a landline or mobile phone."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dial in the rest of the number and press send.",
      "content": "Dial in the rest of the number and press send. For example, if the Canadian phone number you're calling is listed as (613) 555-0123, then the full number you should have dialed is 00 1 613 555 0123. If you're calling on your mobile phone, the number could also look like +1 613 555 0123."

      "title": "Use Skype's VoIP service to make international calls.",
      "content": "Use Skype's VoIP service to make international calls. VoIP stands for Voice Over Internet Protocol, and it means using the internet to place calls rather than a regular telephone line or mobile phone network. Skype is a popular VoIP provider that offers free international calling to other Skype users, and calling for non-users for a low rate. [3] X Research source Visit https://www.Skype.com to find and download the right version for your machine and to set up a free account. You can find your contact's Skype name by searching by name or email address. [4] X Research source Purchase Skype Credit for dialing mobile or landline numbers. If you want to connect to a person's mobile or landline phone, rather than their Skype account, you'll first need to purchase either prepaid Skype Credit or a subscription for a monthly fee. Although there is a fee for international calling via Skype, it's often quite a bit cheaper than conventional telephone service providers."

      "title": "Use WhatsApp to make free international calls.",
      "content": "Use WhatsApp to make free international calls. WhatsApp is another VoIP service allowing users to make free voice and video calls on their mobile devices to other WhatsApp users. Like Skype, WhatsApp uses the internet to place calls rather than regular phone lines. However your Canadian contact also must have WhatsApp for this method to work. [5] X Research source Download WhatsApp and register a free WhatsApp account. Simply enter your contact's phone number in the app, starting with + for the UK international access code and 1 for Canada's country code. For example, if the Canadian phone number you're calling is listed as (613) 555-0123, then the full number you should dial is +1 613 555 0123. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the Viber app to place free calls internationally. Another VoIP option for international calling is Viber. Similar to WhatsApp, Viber allows you to communicate with other users for free. And similar to Skype, Viber will connect you to an international mobile or landline phone for a small fee. [7] X Research source Download the Viber app and register an account. If you're calling somebody who doesn't have a Viber account, you'll need to purchase Viber Out Credit or a calling plan. These costs will usually be significantly less than your landline or mobile provider charges for international calling. Once you've purchased Viber Out credit or a calling plan, dial your contact's number normally within the app, using the + key and 1 for Canada's country code."
