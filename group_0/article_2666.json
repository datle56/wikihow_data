      "title": "Choosing a quality paddle",
      "content": "Choosing a quality paddle helps you get better ball control. Look for a ping pong paddle that has thicker layers of rubber and spongy material to help get a better grip on the ball each time you hit it. The paddle’s rubber grips onto the ball for better control over its direction and spin, so it’s easier to make quick plays against your opponent. [1] X Research source There are a variety of handle styles based on how you like to hold your paddle . Use a paddle with a longer handle if you use a traditional \"shake-hand\" grip, and use a shorter handle if you hold the paddle with a \"pen-hold\" grip. Use the same paddle for every match you play if you’re able to. As you get used to the feel of your paddle, you’ll have a more consistent game of ping pong."

      "title": "Maintaining a ready position helps you maneuver and reach shots faster.",
      "content": "Maintaining a ready position helps you maneuver and reach shots faster. Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width and keep your weight on your toes. Bend your knees and push your hips back to lower your center of gravity. Keep your back straight, bend slightly forward at the waist, and hold your arms out in front of your body. That way, your body stays balanced, relaxed, and ready to move in any direction. Try to return to the ready position immediately after hitting the ball so you’re prepared to return the volley. If you are right-handed, stand with your left foot slightly forward. If you’re left-handed, stand with your right foot slightly ahead of the other."

      "title": "Following through with your whole body gives you more power.",
      "content": "Following through with your whole body gives you more power. When you’re hitting a forehand shot, rotate your hips and shoulders backward during the backswing. Then, keep your feet planted and turn forward to swing through the ball. That way, you get the most power and consistency with your shots. [2] X Research source Avoid trying to hit the ball really hard each time you swing because it could leave you in a vulnerable spot where you’re unable to defend. Try to use the same power with each shot and then smash the ball when your opponent least expects it."

      "title": "Putting spin on the ball makes it harder to predict how it bounces.",
      "content": "Putting spin on the ball makes it harder to predict how it bounces. Keep your wrist loose and brush against the ball instead of hitting it firmly with the paddle. If you’re trying to hit the ball with topspin , try to brush the paddle against the ball moving from low to high. To put a backward spin on the ball, move the paddle from high to low. [3] X Research source Try perfecting the sidespin to make the ball bounce to the left or right to make your opponent struggle to hit the ball. Move the paddle from left to right to make the ball spin right, or go from right to left for a left spin."

      "title": "Aiming for the corners forces your opponent to move out of position.",
      "content": "Aiming for the corners forces your opponent to move out of position. Try to guide the ball toward the corner that your opponent is furthest from. If they manage to move over and return the ball, then hit the ball toward the opposite corner to catch your opponent off guard and score a point. [4] X Research source Trying to hit the edge of the table can make the ball bounce erratically away from the table, but it’s a risky play if you miss the table."

      "title": "Reading the ball's spin helps you position your paddle correctly for a hit.",
      "content": "Reading the ball's spin helps you position your paddle correctly for a hit. When your opponent is about to hit the ball, watch the angle and position of their paddle to see if they’re trying to add spin to the ball. If you notice they’re putting a spin on their ball, quickly adjust your paddle to correct the spin and get a powerful shot on your opponent. [5] X Research source If your opponent moves their paddle from low to high, the ball has a topspin and spins upward. Angle your racket down and hit the ball above its center. When they move their paddle from high to low, the ball has a backspin and spins downward. Angle your racket up and hit the ball below its center. If the paddle moves from left to right, the ball has a right sidespin. Position your paddle on the right and hit the ball on the left side to hit back. When your opponent moves the paddle right to left, then the ball has a left sidespin. Move your paddle to the left and hit the ball on its right side to correct the spin."

      "title": "Hitting the ball just over the net makes it harder for your opponent to hit.",
      "content": "Hitting the ball just over the net makes it harder for your opponent to hit. Instead of hitting the ball high above the net where your opponent could easily hit it, try to hit the ball so it just barely clears the net. Your opponent will have to take a more defensive position to hit the ball and prevent you from scoring, so they won’t be able to hit it with a lot of power. [6] X Research source Practice Drill: Tie a string between 2 sticks. Clamp each stick onto the ends of the net so the string sits a few inches above it. Practice hitting the ball so it goes between the top of the net and the string. As you get more consistent with your shots, lower the string slightly."

      "title": "Changing your shots makes your opponent work harder to return the ball.",
      "content": "Changing your shots makes your opponent work harder to return the ball. Rather than hitting the ball at the same speed or into the same spot on the table, switch it up every now and then. Hit some balls closer to the edge of the table and try to position others so they barely cross over the net. Vary the speed, spin, and type of shot you use so your competition has trouble predicting your next move. Staying in your ready stance makes it a lot easier to transition between different shots so you can easily maneuver to wherever your opponent hits the ball."

      "title": "Perfecting your swings repeatedly makes it easier to hit the ball with ease.",
      "content": "Perfecting your swings repeatedly makes it easier to hit the ball with ease. When you first start playing ping pong, it can take a lot of mental energy to figure out how to hit the ball. Keep practicing your volleys back and forth so they become engrained in your memory. Once you can automatically hit the ball with the same power and consistency without a lot of thought, the game will be a lot easier. Try to stay relaxed and don’t overthink your swings. Soon, you’ll get a feel for how to hit the ball so it lands exactly where you’re aiming."

      "title": "Practicing as much as possible will help you develop and hone skills faster.",
      "content": "Practicing as much as possible will help you develop and hone skills faster. Whenever you have a chance, try to play different opponents so you can practice playing against another player and reacting to their shots. If you aren’t able to play with someone else, try hitting the ball against a wall or adjusting the other side of the table so it’s vertical. As you get in more time playing, you’ll only get better at ping pong. It takes time to develop your skills, so don’t get discouraged if you aren’t able to hit every shot right away Check local rec centers to see if they have any table tennis leagues you could join so you’re able to play games consistently."
