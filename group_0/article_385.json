      "content": "A dominatrix is a woman or nonbinary person who dominates in bed. She exudes power and issues demands or instructions to her submissive, who is usually (but not always) a man. She might dominate her submissive in physical ways or in mental ways through humiliation and degradation. [1] X Research source Dominatrix play is a type of role play associated with kink and the BDSM (bondage, discipline, sadism, and masochism) lifestyle. Typically, when people use the word \"dominatrix\" specifically, they're talking about someone who does this sort of work professionally. People in the BDSM lifestyle typically prefer \"domme\" to \"dominatrix.\" Many women who work professionally as a dominatrix don't have any sexual relationship with their clients or allow their clients to touch them sexually—some don't even consider themselves sex workers. But when people play dominatrix for fun, it's almost always sexual. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Get the attire that you feel most confident wearing. A full-bodied cat-suit is a mainstay of fetish and bondage culture. Make sure your suit is made from leather or rubber latex. If suits aren’t your thing, find some sexy, black dresses or lingerie. Your partner also may request for you to wear a certain outfit. [3] X Research source There's a difference between a dominant lifestyle and fetishism, but the skin tight black bodysuit remains an iconic garment in both communities. Depending on the interests of your submissive, you might want other types of fetish attire. But most dominatrixes save the high-end fetish attire for shows and events. [4] X Research source Devlin notes that she's \"all about leather gear because it's just easy.\""

Or, wear platform boots or stilettos. If you can’t (or don’t want to) wear heels, go for flat black boots instead. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear a corset . A corset is a close-fitting undergarment (often worn as outerwear) that helps shape your body. A bondage corset has become a staple of fetish wear. If you aren't a fan of a corset, try a bustier instead. Wear it with lingerie or over a dress rather than under a cat-suit. [6] X Research source Corsets and bustiers aren’t strictly necessary, but they do help add to the overall look and can help you feel more confident."

      "content": "Add accents with other accessories, like stockings. Fishnet stockings or garter stockings are some staple accessories that pair well with dresses and lingerie. You can also wear gloves that are finger-less or elbow length. If concealing part of your identity helps your confidence, wear a mask that conceals part of your face. [7] X Research source Keep a few accessories around and try out which ones feel good for you. Dominatrixes tend to rotate through several different outfits, depending on the desires of their submissive."

      "content": "Make a list of your sexual limits or boundaries. Swenson notes that \"the first thing in establishing boundaries is first for yourself, figuring out what it is you want to do and what you don't want to do.\" Figuring these out ahead of time makes it less likely that you'll go too far in the heat of the moment and do something you regret. As Swenson explains, you want to \"make sure that you don't take action further than what you would like to and maybe feel bad about the next day.\" Devlin notes that \"it's pretty common for partners not to have completely matched desires.\" She recommends starting off by talking about what you like and why you like it, and then your partner \"can cherry pick, from the menu of activities, what they're comfortable with.\""

      "content": "Talk to your partner about what they want in a scene. Devlin notes that \"there's a big difference between desire and fantasy. Fantasy is something that feels really good to think about and desire is something that we actually want to do.\" Work out with your partner which things fall into which category so you can outline a scene that you'll both enjoy. Devlin notes that typically, \"what subs want is to be held in a cocoon of their dom's attention and they want the whole world to melt away. So they don't have any responsibilities. They don't need to worry. All they feel is their dom's warm fuzzy attention around them.\" That need for your attention can be fulfilled in many ways, so don't worry if you don't enjoy or feel comfortable doing all of the things that your partner wants. Don't forget aftercare! Swenson recommends that subs think about what they'll need afterwards to feel loved and cared for."

      "title": "Agree with your partner on safe words and gestures.",
      "content": "Agree with your partner on safe words and gestures. A safe word is something either of you can say to halt all play immediately. It should be something that's easy to remember and that would have an unmistakeable meaning in the context. If your partner won't be able to speak or if they have a tendency to go nonverbal, include a safe gesture as well, such as knocking on something 3 times. For example, you might choose a word such as \"pineapple.\" Speaking directly and simply using words such as \"no\" or \"stop\" for their true meaning is fine as well, provided they wouldn't be misunderstood in the scene. Devlin emphasizes that when you take on the dominant role, you have to be able to \"understand other people's boundaries and even kind of notice when people are beyond their boundaries by not speaking up.\" If your partner doesn't seem to be enjoying themselves, pause and check in on them—it's your responsibility. Don't use \"they never said their safe word\" as an excuse to keep going if your partner no longer seems enthusiastic about it. Many people in the D/s community use the traffic-light system for check-ins. If the sub says \"green,\" it means that they're enjoying everything that's going on and want it to continue. If they say \"yellow,\" they mean that they're approaching their limits and want to de-escalate things a bit. If they say \"red,\" they want to stop play immediately."

      "content": "Brainstorm phrases, words, and commands to use. Watching videos or reading erotic stories can give you a good idea of the way a dominatrix normally speaks to a submissive. Practice by yourself to get a hang of the right volume and tone you want to use issue commands with authority. Word play is a big part of being a dominatrix. Ask your partner what sorts of words and phrases turn them on, so you can incorporate those as well. For example, your partner might like when you describe them as \"little\" because it turns them on for a dominatrix to make them feel small."

      "content": "Test all of your tools and implements out on yourself. Before you use anything on your sub, you want to make sure that you know how to use it correctly and you aren't going to accidentally injure them or cause them more harm than you intend. Practicing on your own arm or leg also gives you an idea of how much force is necessary to create the impact your partner craves. Some implements, such as whips, are more dangerous than others and might require more hands-on training and practice before you use them on any person (including yourself)."

But if you're serious about learning how to act like a dominatrix (or perhaps you're even interested in becoming the real deal), get an experienced professional to show you the ropes. [9] X Research source Your local kink community will typically have resources and community members who are happy to give you advice and pointers. These communities typically aren't out in the open, so you might have to do some digging online to find one near you. You might also check out books and videos for ideas and inspiration."

      "content": "Speak and move with confidence. Focus on the fact that you're in charge of the situation and what you say goes. You might feel shy issuing commands at first, and that's totally normal! That just means that you're not usually a demanding person, which is a good thing. But here, you're issuing commands to fulfill your partner's desires—not to insist upon your own. [10] X Research source You might even find that you get a little thrill out of issuing a command to your partner and watching them immediately obey—that's part of what makes this play fun for people. [11] X Research source Confidence is necessary to take on a dominant role, but it's not enough alone. Devlin equates dominance with responsibility for your submissive, noting that \"aggression, confidence, and assertiveness are different things than domination.\""

      "content": "Stand tall and take up space to show that you're in charge. Maintaining good posture is a great way to send a subconscious signal that you're in charge. You might stride across the room or stand with your feet apart and your arms crossed. Show with your body language that you are a force to be reckoned with and you mean business. A lot of submissive people get really turned on by displays of authority or by using an authoritative tone. If your partner enjoys that as well, you can have a lot of fun striding across the room and lecturing them on something."

Devlin cautions that \"if you don't agree upon the menu of activities beforehand and if you're not paying attention to how much your sub is enjoying their experience, then you're not dominating them. You are just harming them.\" Since you are responsible for your partner, it's your duty to pay close attention to them and make sure that they're consistently enjoying everything you're doing. You can work these check-ins into the regular dialogue of the scene so that you don't have to break character or derail the mood. For example, you might command your partner to tell you how something makes them feel."

It is a gift that the dom gives to the sub and it is also a responsibility.\" Work from the list of your partner's desires and do things that you feel comfortable doing. Since their pleasure is paramount, always make sure they enthusiastically enjoy everything that's going on. Keep in mind that if your partner desires pain, there might be some times when it seems as though they're not enjoying themselves but they actually are. After you've done several scenes together, you'll get better at reading their signals."

What you and your partner each find comforting and grounding is a matter of personal preference. Devlin notes that she's \"a big fan of the naked cuddle, getting in bed, putting on some music, lighting some candles, and just snuggling up to each other.\" \"[T]aking a bath together, taking a shower together , giving each other massages ,\" Devlin continues, \"those are all ways that we can intimately connect and focus on that connection and focus on calming the body.\""
