      "content": "Bad juju means bad vibes or bad luck. It’s a term that people use when they feel like something has a negative vibe or aura. [1] X Research source For example, you could say that a spooky old house on your street has bad juju because it seems like it might be haunted. Or, you could say that a necklace that was a gift from a terrible ex has bad juju because it still carries some of that ex’s negative energy. The term is usually used in a superstitious context, and it’s often associated with a belief in negative supernatural forces that can bring you misfortune. Actions that people believe bring bad luck (like walking under a ladder or opening an umbrella inside) can also be described as bringing “bad juju” to your life. “Bad juju” is primarily used as a noun (“I don’t like that place—it has bad juju,” or “A black cat ran in front of me today, and now I’m afraid of the bad juju”)."

      "content": "The term “bad juju” has roots in West African spiritual traditions. In this context, “juju” refers to an object infused with magical or spiritual power, like an amulet, charm, or fetish. The practice of juju can be used for positive, healing purposes, but it can also be used for negative deeds. For example, objects infused with negative juju are thought to bring negative spiritual effects to any person who comes in contact with them, which is likely where the colloquial term “bad juju” evolved from. [2] X Research source The word “juju” can refer to the object, the magical power itself, or the belief system as a whole. [3] X Research source"
