In this case, addressing the underlying issue will help to make your cat more comfortable and your cat may even start grooming himself again. Treatments might include dental attention for a cat with a sore mouth or pain killing medications for the elderly arthritic. [2] X Research source If your cat’s fur is severely matted, then seek the help of a professional to remove the matted fur. It is traumatic to the cat to have large matts removed and it is often kindest to sedate the cat so that he is happily oblivious to the procedure."

When your cat is not grooming himself as well as he once did, one of the best things you can do is to incorporate regular brushing into your routine. Brushing the cat from head to tail removes loose fur, dirt and other debris and stimulates circulation and sebaceous gland secretions. This helps return shine and luster to the coat and prevents the formation of painful mats, especially in long-haired cats."

He will respond better to you. If your cat is not used to being groomed then he may resent being brushed. Try to help him understand it is a pleasant experience and keep the first sessions short so that he doesn't lose patience. Try brushing your cat right before you feed him so that he associates being brushed with a food reward afterwards. This may increase his tolerance levels for being brushed. [4] X Research source Keep in mind that brushing can be a bonding experience between owner and pet. But if your pet is agitated or stressed, he may start to associate negative feelings with you instead."

For example, if you cat has soiled himself, then it might be necessary to groom your cat even if he is agitated. In these cases there are several options to help you calm and control your cat. Use a towel . If it is essential to groom the cat right away and he is agitated, try wrapping him in a towel with only the dirty area left out. Having his eyes covered can help to calm him down. Plus, having his teeth and claws inside the towel will protect your hands from bites and scratches. Hold onto your cat’s neck scruff . Some cats will calm down if you hold onto their scruff, which is the skin on the back of a cat’s neck. When a mother picks her kittens up by the scruff it has a calming effect, and this persists in some adults. However, do not pick the cat up by the scruff, merely grasp a handful of skin over his shoulder and hold it firmly while he rests on a flat surface. Work at a height that is comfortable for you . It might be easier to clean your cat is you put him on a high tabletop or on top of a dryer. This will prevent you from having to bend and strain your back. Help the cat to feel secure by placing a blanket or towel on the table top so that he is less likely to slip and slide around."

Cats have very delicate skin underneath their fur. If it gets nicked, your cat might get an infection. In worse cases, your cat may need stitches. If you do not feel comfortable removing the mat yourself, contact a groomer who is experienced with cats or contact your veterinarian. If you do not have clippers, use scissors but with care. The safest method is to slide a comb between the skin and the base of the knot. Then cut above the comb on the knot side. The comb shields the skin and makes it less likely you will nick it. If you cannot get a comb under the knot then this is a job for a professional groomer or the vet tech, and do not attempt it yourself."
