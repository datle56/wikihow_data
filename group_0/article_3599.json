Before you can approach a teacher with the intention of becoming a monk , you must be quite learned in the Buddhist tradition, well read in Buddhist teachings, and well versed in Buddhist thought. Begin your journey to monkhood by devoting yourself to the study of Buddhism . [1] X Research source As you devote yourself to your religion, begin studying daily and engaging in prayer several times a day. Strive to embody your faith in every aspect of your life.

      "content": "Find a teacher. In order to become a monk, you will need a teacher who can give you permission to be ordained. It may take a little while to find a teacher depending on your background and where you live, but it’s not impossible. Seek out Buddhist temples in your area, or travel to a part of the world where Buddhism is more prevalent. Stay open in your heart and allow it to lead to you the teacher you seek. [2] X Research source You may try writing letters or emails to Buddhist teachers in your area and opening a correspondence. Let them know who you are, how long you’ve been learning about Buddhism, and why you want to become a monk. You can also reach out to Buddhist temples and teachers in your area to see if they’re open to having a face-to-face conversation. When you find a potential teacher, ask them as many questions about their practice as possible. This way, you can determine if you’re a good fit or if you should keep looking."

      "title": "Research different monasteries and their requirements.",
      "content": "Research different monasteries and their requirements. While most Buddhist monks follow the same general guidelines, different monasteries will have different requirements, like how old you must be to join. Try practicing these rules before joining a monastery to see if the path is right for you. Here are some common requirements to consider: Celibacy: Most Buddhist monks practice a life of celibacy . Take a step away from romantic and sexual relationships to determine if this is something you’re comfortable with. Life away from loved ones: Most Buddhist monks live at the temple and some orders only allow members to go visit family once every few years. You can still write letters to them, and they’re sometimes allowed to visit you at the monastery, however. Communal living: Most monastic orders live in close community with each other and share meals, quarters, and belongings. If you want to try this out beforehand, look for communal housing in your area. Giving up worldly possessions: In most cases, you’ll be expected to relinquish all of your personal items, including cell phones, and enter the community empty-handed. No debt or financial ties: Some monastics have no bank accounts as they dedicate their lives to their community and don’t use money. Be sure to research whether your monastery requires you to freeze your bank account or close your credit cards. Most monasteries also have age and health requirements. In most cases, you must be younger than 50 to become a monk, but the maximum age may be younger for some temples. Additionally, most traditions require that you be in good physical and mental health and that you don’t have any terminal illnesses or severe disabilities."

      "content": "Visit a monastery. While the exact requirements may differ depending on the monastery, you will typically stay at a monastery for a few weeks to a few months. During this time, you will experience life as a Buddhist monk and the sangha (the monastic order) will observe whether you’d be a good fit for the temple. [3] X Research source Long-term stays must be approved by the monastery, so reach out beforehand to find out exactly what you need to do. You may need to write a letter to request an extended stay if you plan to stay more than a week or two."

      "content": "Become an aspirant. After staying at the temple for the length of time required by that specific monastery, you may request to become an aspirant and get ordained. If approved by the sangha, you’ll be assigned a monastic mentor to guide you in your training. [4] X Research source In some orders, you may need to write a letter to the sangha requesting to become an aspirant. This letter typically includes your personal background, experiences with the practice, and aspirations to become a monk. While the sangha is considering your request, you become a postulant and participate in activities and practices like a monastic member."

The exact time frame of novicehood may vary, but in many cases, it’s a 3-year period. At this time, you do not have full ordination but you will continue to learn and train as a monk.

      "content": "Serve in your temple for at least 5 years. When you are ordained to be a Buddhist monk, you traditionally stay with that monastery for 5 years. Becoming a Buddhist monk means joining a religious community: the sangha. The purpose of this community is to study and practice the teachings of Buddha, as well as to share them with others. As a Buddhist monk, you will strengthen the bonds of the Sangha over your 5 (or more) years with that group. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Determine if God is calling you to monastic life.",
      "content": "Determine if God is calling you to monastic life. There are 4 Catholic vocations: single life, married life, priesthood, and religious life. Most monasteries encourage potential monks to explore the other vocations before committing to monastic life. If you feel God is calling you to monkhood, research the vocations and pray several times a day. Ask friends, family, and religious leaders for advice and learn what God has called them to do. This can help you decipher God’s will for you. [7] X Research source Vocations are roles within the Church that respond to God’s call for you and the needs of His people. Monkhood falls under religious life, as those with this vocation seek an intimate relationship with Christ. Priesthood is for men who want to fully understand and teach the word of God, and married life is for those who seek a life of holiness and selflessness through a commitment to their spouse. Single life typically refers to the time before someone has made a commitment to one of the other vocations. Monasteries encourage you to try out other vocations so you don’t regret monkhood later on. For example, you might try meeting and dating new people to see if you’re more drawn to and fit for married life, as monks make a lifelong commitment to celibacy. If you’ve tried all 4 vocations but are still not sure what’s right for you, try again with different people and communities. Continue praying and seeking God, and consider speaking to a Vocation Guide (similar to a spiritual director)."

In general, monasteries share similar rules, but the exact requirements for joining vary. Visit a monastery to learn about their daily routine and what is expected of the monks. [8] X Research source Most monasteries are open to visits from potential devotees, and some allow you to stay for a few days at a time. You may want to visit a few times to fully understand the monastic call. Some monasteries offer guest house accommodations to outsiders who agree to follow certain rules, such as observing curfews and periods of silence. You may want to consider a monastic retreat, in which you will take part in the daily routine of the monastery. Some monasteries have age requirements for those wishing to join. When researching and visiting abbeys, make sure you fall in the correct age range."

If you still feel called to monastic life after visiting a monastery, it’s time to truly consider if you’re willing to make personal sacrifices and step away from worldly experiences. You do not have to give these things up before joining the monkhood, but it might be a good idea to practice beforehand to determine if it’s something you want to do. Here are some common monastic requirements: [9] X Research source Committing to celibacy: Almost every monastic community practices celibacy . Take a personal vow of celibacy to gauge if this is a practical goal for you. This will also show the depth of your devotion when you approach a monastery to join. Communal living: Most monastic orders live in close community with each other. This means sharing meals, sharing quarters, and in some cases sharing all worldly belongings with one another. Test out this lifestyle by joining a communal living situation. Look for community houses in your area with open rooms. Relinquishing worldly possessions: Most monks typically relinquish ownership of their possessions and sometimes donate their belongings to the church. You can get a taste of this life and move closer to monkhood but giving away some of what you own and living a simpler life."

[10] X Research source The exact rules for applying for candidacy may vary, so reach out to your monastery to find out how to apply. Should you decide monastic life is not your calling, you may leave at any time during this period.

In general, after completing your candidacy, you will state your intentions of becoming a monk in front of the community and be gifted with the monastic habit. This is typically a year-long experience in which you’ll continue to explore the vocation within the community. [11] X Research source In general, the work of a novice includes exploring the monastic vocation and teaching humility and obedience. Depending on the monastery, you may study with an Abbot, religious scholars, and/or the formation director. Depending on the order, there may be more than one level of novicehood. Like candidates, novices may leave at any time, or the community may ask them to leave. Some monasteries may have different names for the phases of monastic life, but they should generally include the same expectations and requirements. For example, some abbeys refer to those in the first year of monkhood as postulates rather than novices. The novitiate, then, is the period that follows."

As a juniorate, you’ll have more freedom than a novice as you gain a clearer experience of the life of solemnly professed monks. Your work will also be more focused as you’ll explore new hobbies, gain new practical skills, and advance your professional studies. [12] X Research source The vows will vary depending on the specific order, however they will almost certainly involve a deep devotion to God, a celibate disposition, and the rejection of material belongings. Depending on the order, the juniorate may be called the postulate or another term."
