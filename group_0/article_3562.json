The practical is designed to identify individuals that have never really performed the work in the field but have a very good understanding of the code. Some jurisdictions, such as New Jersey, do not require an exam as part of the licensing process. [23] X Research source Use of the electrical code book may or may not be permitted during the exam.

It is not uncommon for 6,000 to 8,000-hour minimum time requirements.
