      "content": "Avoid getting angry over sibling rivalry. Many older siblings struggle with jealousy towards their younger sisters. They often think that their younger sisters get more attention from their parents. Even if this is true, it’s not your little sister’s fault. She has no control over the behavior of your parents. Instead, talk to your parents about your feelings and offer solutions. For example: Schedule some time to spend alone with your parents each week. Ask your parents if you can stay up an hour later than your sister. This will give you one-on-one time with your parents. Schedule family activities that will let you spend time with your parents and your sister together."
