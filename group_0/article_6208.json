      "title": "Mix equal amounts of granulated sugar and plain breadcrumbs together.",
      "content": "Mix equal amounts of granulated sugar and plain breadcrumbs together. This is cricket food! If you want to catch a few dozen crickets, a cup of sugar and a cup of breadcrumbs should be plenty. Don't use spicy or flavored breadcrumbs. Plain breadcrumbs are best for catching crickets, and extra ingredients might deter them. You can mix up a big batch of sugar and breadcrumbs and store whatever is left over in a jar for later use. This way you can catch more crickets every few days."

      "title": "Sprinkle this mixture on the ground where you have seen crickets congregating.",
      "content": "Sprinkle this mixture on the ground where you have seen crickets congregating. This method may be best to use outside, since sprinkling this mixture indoors may draw other pests, like roaches and mice. Sprinkle the mixture at dusk just before the nocturnal crickets will come out to play."

    {
      "title": "Cover the mixture with a single layer of newspaper.",
      "content": "Cover the mixture with a single layer of newspaper. Lay it out over the area where you sprinkled the sugar and breadcrumbs. Use no more than a single layer, since you want the crickets to be able to get underneath it."

      "title": "Choose a large jar with a lid for capturing the crickets.",
      "content": "Choose a large jar with a lid for capturing the crickets. Get a big glass jar or a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid. Poke holes in the lid if you want to keep the crickets alive once you catch them. [1] X Research source There are special containers you can use for storing live crickets. Visit a bait store to check out their options, or look online and order one. You can sprinkle some of the sugar and bread mixture in the jar to keep the crickets fed."

      "title": "Return in the morning before the dew dries.",
      "content": "Return in the morning before the dew dries. This is prime time for catching crickets. Their bellies will be full and they'll be calmly waiting for you under the layer of newspaper. If you wait until the sun dries the dew, the crickets will have time to hop away."

      "title": "Lift the newspaper and sweep the crickets into the container.",
      "content": "Lift the newspaper and sweep the crickets into the container. You can use a scoop or a small brush to nudge them into the container. Place the lid on tightly once you've caught your crickets."

      "content": "Place a strip of duct tape sticky side up where you have seen crickets congregating. Common areas are on the floor along the baseboards or on windowsills in rooms where you suspect crickets are hiding. This method works best indoors, since tape placed outside will collect dirt, leaves and other creatures."

      "content": "Return to the tape the next day. The crickets will get caught in the glue as they try to walk across, making it easy for you to pick up and dispose of them. A more expensive option would be to use the sticky traps or \"motels\" made for catching roaches."
