Your state or other legislating bodies may set seasons for harvesting oysters. [1] X Research source Your local department of natural resources or fish and wildlife management agency will publicize when these seasons are. The exact dates of the seasons can vary from year to year, and are determined based on a number of factors, including: The number of tides The condition of beaches and of the seawater The number of people expected to go harvesting The average harvest size"

      "content": "Harvest at the best time.Traditional advice recommends harvesting oysters only during cooler winter months (those with an “R” in their name). Nevertheless, oysters are safe to harvest and eat all year round. However, oysters reach their peak condition during winter and early spring."

      "title": "Wait for the right weather.",
      "content": "Wait for the right weather. It is best not to harvest oysters within three days following a heavy rain (1 inch or greater). Runoff from soil can contain bacteria and other contaminants. In some locations, it is expressly forbidden to harvest oysters following rainfall. Instead, plan to harvest oysters during clear weather."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go at low tide.",
      "content": "Go at low tide. The best time to harvest oysters is during the day, and when the tide is lower than 2 feet. This makes it easier to find oyster reefs, and to remove clusters from them. Pay attention to water conditions when harvesting oysters so that you don’t become trapped as the tide comes back in."
    },
    {
      "title": "Inspect the site.",
      "content": "Inspect the site. Even when you're going to an approved collection site during ideal weather conditions, you should double-check the area before you start harvesting the oysters. Oysters feed by filtering seawater, which means they can collect all sorts of pathogens and pollutants. [2] X Research source If you notice dead oysters or fish, foul smelling water, or any other warning signs, seek another harvesting ground."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go into the water.",
      "content": "Go into the water. Some harvesters like to use a flat-bottomed oyster boat. However, all you really need to do to collect oysters is wade into the water and approach a reef.Be careful, however, since the mud near oyster beds (sometimes called “gumbo mud”) can be very thick and sticky. Make sure to wear good footwear when wading to collect oysters, to protect your feet from sharp oyster shells, thick mud, and debris."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove oysters from the reef.",
      "content": "Remove oysters from the reef. Whether you are wading in the water or standing in an oyster boat, rake your oyster dredge across the reef.The toothed portion of the dredge will help knock oysters off of the reef, which will then be collected in the basket portion. When your dredge seems full, empty it on deck or into a collection bucket. You can also simply use a hammer or similar tool to knock clusters of oysters off of their reef. Make sure to wear thick gloves when handling oysters. This will protect your hands from their shells and any sharp tools you may be using to handle the clusters."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for clusters with large oysters.",
      "content": "Look for clusters with large oysters. Oyster reefs will contain both larger, older oysters, and smaller, younger oysters. Many locations will set a minimum size (often 3”) for oysters that can be collected. [3] X Research source [4] X Research source These minimums are designed to prevent over-harvesting and to preserve oyster populations. Larger oysters are also more desirable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Break the clusters apart.",
      "content": "Break the clusters apart. Using a hammer, screwdriver, or other tool, separate individual oysters from each cluster. Remove any smaller oysters and carefully place them back in the water.You should also remove any dead oysters and discard them by placing them back in the water. Live oysters, if open, will close their shells when lightly tapped."

      "title": "Collect edible oysters in a bucket.",
      "content": "Collect edible oysters in a bucket. Oysters which are alive and large enough can be kept. Many harvesters prefer to use a floating bucket (attached to the harvester with a cord), since it will keep oysters moist in the water and allow you to keep your hands free. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Stay within collection limits.",
      "content": "Stay within collection limits. Each state or local area may set a limit (by number, weight, or volume) on the amount of oysters each person is allowed to collect. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source There may be fines or other penalties for illegally harvesting oysters in your area. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Keep your oysters cool.",
      "content": "Keep your oysters cool. While you are collecting oysters, you must keep them moist and in the shade. Put them on ice if you will transport them in a cooler or bucket, but do not allow them to freeze. Refrigerate them as soon as possible (within 4 hours). Once you bring them home, cover them with a clean wet towel and put them in your refrigerator until cooking. Do not keep your oysters in an airtight bag or other container, as this will kill them prematurely. Keep the oysters on a low level of your refrigerator, below any cooked food or food that will be eaten raw."

    {
      "title": "Don’t eat dead oysters.",
      "content": "Don’t eat dead oysters. Oysters with open shells that won’t close when you tap them, broken shells, or that appear dried and shriveled are probably dead and should be discarded. Cooking oysters that are already dead (or eating them raw) can be hazardous to your health."

      "title": "Cook oysters thoroughly.",
      "content": "Cook oysters thoroughly. Many people like to eat oysters raw or lightly steamed. However, this will not kill potentially harmful pathogens. No amount of cooking will remove chemicals or biotoxins that the oysters may have collected from seawater, so always only harvest oysters from approved locations. Oysters can be prepared a variety of ways: roasting, steaming, baking, grilling, frying, stewing, etc. Cook oysters according to recommended temperatures and times. For instance, they should be boiled or simmered for at least 3 minutes, fried at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 3 minutes, or baked for 10 minutes at 450 degrees Fahrenheit.

      "title": "Freeze any oysters you do not want to use right away.",
      "content": "Freeze any oysters you do not want to use right away. Shuck oysters and freeze them in small batches in their natural juices, or in any liquid you have cooked them in. They can remain in your freezer for up to a year, but are best if used within 3 months. Thaw frozen oysters in your refrigerator for 24 hours prior to using them. Remember to thoroughly reheat any cooked oysters or oyster dishes."

      "title": "Find out if your state recycles shells.",
      "content": "Find out if your state recycles shells. Young growing oysters need older shells to attach to. Returning undesired oysters to the water and leaving cast off shells on the beach helps ensure that young oysters have a good surface to grow on. In some areas, there may even be opportunities to recycle shells after harvesting. The Oyster Recovery Program maintains a list of these states and information about how to participate. In some cases, you may be required to shuck on the beach, and leave the shells there."

      "content": "Obtain a license. Exact licensing requirements will vary from state to state, but having a fishing or shell fishing license is usually required to legally harvest oysters. [10] X Research source Contact your local department of natural resources or fish and wildlife management agency to find out more about licensing costs and requirements. Licenses can often be purchased directly from the relevant agency, or from vendors such as bait and tackle shops. In many cases, these agencies also allow you to easily purchase a license online. You may be required to carry proof of your license while harvesting oysters. Make sure to learn about all harvesting requirements (such as size limits) when you obtain your license."
