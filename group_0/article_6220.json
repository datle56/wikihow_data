Have high level Pokémon that are at least level 50 or higher. You'll be in a cave, so Dusk Balls are very good balls to use to catch Giratina. Ultra Balls work well, too."

      "content": "Have Pokémon that know the moves Rock Smash, Surf, Rock Climb, and Defog. A good Pokémon to use is a normal/flying Pokémon like Staraptor because Giratina's offensive moves (apart from Slash) won't hurt it. This comes in use because Giratina's move (Shadow Force) is also very powerful."

      "content": "Enter the cave called Turnback Cave. It is called this because once you enter a room from another, if you come back the way you came, you won't end up in the same room you came from. It can be very confusing as it is a maze. You need to find your way past three pillars in the cave before you go through thirty rooms. If you encounter a pillar, it will tell you how many pillars you've passed (the number on the top) and the number of rooms you have been through (the number on the bottom.) Thirty rooms is a lot to go through and many people make it past three pillars and to Giratina before reaching that."

Ice, Ghost, Dragon and Dark type moves are very effective. Use Fire, Water, Electric, Bug, Grass and Poison type moves to get the health down slowly so you won't make Giratina faint."
