      "content": "Identify the style of your internal hard drive. The two main designs of hard drives are SATA (usually from new laptops/desktops and have a card edge connector) and PATA(from older laptops/desktops and have two rows of pins on the end. PATA hard drives may be labeled ATA). These designs are not interchangeable. SATA hard drives are identifiable by the two flat connectors while PATA hard drives use two rows of pins as connectors."

      "content": "Determine the dimensions of your hard drive. Laptop computers usually have hard drives that are 2.5 inches (6.35 cm) in diameter while desktops usually have hard drives that are 3.5 inches (8.89 cm). This can easily be checked with a ruler or tape measure. The height of a 2.5-inch drives varies. Most are 9.5 mm, but some are 12.5 mm, so take note when choosing an enclosure."

      "content": "Choose the type of material for your hard drive enclosure. The two most commonly available types of enclosures are made out of aluminum or plastic. There are many properties to consider here including the style of hard drive (SATA or PATA), the enclosure's ability to cool the drive, a material used in constructing the enclosure, connection type, and cost."
