Some academic policies separate cheating on a test from plagiarism. Before admitting to academic wrongdoing of any kind, define your actions and look up the potential consequences. Cheating is usually defined as copying or sharing answers, using concealed information during an exam, or submitting the same assignment for multiple classes. Plagiarism is generally considered to be using materials created by another a person without permission or citation. Some schools take a harder stance on plagiarism and may even define it as paraphrasing another person’s viewpoint as your own. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Own up to your actions. Don’t try to dodge the issue if you cheated and your teacher caught you because it likely will not prevent you from getting into trouble. Instead, explain why you cheated. Be clear about why you made that choice. For example, if you didn't have time to study or couldn't grasp the material, be straightforward about it. You can say something like, \"I made the choice to cheat because I didn't have time to study, which was in error. Next time, I will give myself more time to properly prepare.\" Be clear about which assignment or test you cheated on. If it was just on one assignment, you will want to clarify that you did not cheat on other assignments. Be aware that your teacher will probably want to review your previous work or keep a closer eye on your future work to make sure cheating is truly a one-time incident. Try to put yourself in a humble perspective as you apologize."
