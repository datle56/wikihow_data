      "content": "The bottom of the bottle breaks off due to “cavitation.” [3] X Research source The bottle briefly and suddenly moves downward when you strike the top. The water inside of it doesn't move as quickly, creating an extremely brief void (vacuum) at the bottom. The water does catch up with the glass and comes crashing down into the bottom. If the force is great enough, the bottle can no longer support the water crashing down and cracks or breaks at the bottom. Even if the crack is minor, the inertia and weight of the water will break the bottom out of the bottle. [4] X Research source"
