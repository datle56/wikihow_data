      "title": "Use the organization's name and year of publication for in-text citations.",
      "content": "Use the organization's name and year of publication for in-text citations. APA style requires an in-text citation every time you quote or paraphrase from a source. Unless the information is included in your text, place a parenthetical at the end of the sentence with the full name of the organization followed by a comma and the year of publication. Place the sentence's closing punctuation outside the closing parenthesis. In your first citation, you can include the abbreviation \"APA\" in square brackets after the full name of the organization. For example, you might write \"Ethics rules require psychologists to correct the misrepresentation of their work (American Psychological Association [APA], 2017).\" In subsequent in-text citations, you would only use \"APA\" rather than writing out the name of the organization in full. For example, a subsequent citation might be \"(APA, 2017).\""

When you quote directly from a source, APA style normally requires you to indicate the page number or page range where the quoted material appears in the original source. Since the code is not paginated, use the section numbers instead.

Even though the name of the organization isn't listed first in your Works Cited entry, it's still appropriate to use it as the \"author\" in your parenthetical in-text citation. Use abbreviations to keep the parenthetical from getting too long. You can find a list of acceptable abbreviations in your MLA style guide. Instead of a page number, use the section number where the material you've paraphrased or quoted appears. Place the sentence's closing punctuation outside the closing parenthesis.
