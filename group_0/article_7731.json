If you have exposed drywall, you should only dust your wall and limit the use of water and other cleaners on it due to the material's porous nature. [2] X Research source Dust your walls at least once a week to maintain them."

Dampen your sponge but don't fully saturate it. Apply pressure on the sponge and move from the top to the bottom of your wall. Saturate your sponge when it becomes too dry. Continue to do this until you've washed the entire wall. In addition to being soft on your walls, cellulose sponges are made of bio-degradable materials that are good for the environment.

      "title": "Evaluate the damage.",
      "content": "Evaluate the damage. If mold has started to form on unpainted drywall, you may have to remove and replace the moldy portions of the wall. If your drywall's structural integrity is being affected by the mold and your wall is crumbling, warped, or covered with black or bluish splotches, you will have to replace it. If there is mold on the wall but the structural integrity is not compromised, you may be able to clean it off. Mold on painted drywall is much easier to remove."

Start by vacuuming up all the dust that you managed to gather in the center of the room. After the initial dust is cleaned, continue to go over the entirety of the floor to suck up the remainder of the drywall dust. [8] X Research source Go over the floor again if you notice that your Shop Vac didn't get all the dust on the first vacuuming. If you don't have a Shop Vac than you can rent one from a department store. Make sure to use a HEPA filter to trap all of the drywall dust when using the Shop Vac."
