      "content": "Add an in-text citation to the end of the sentence that referenced the term. Use parentheses to make an in-text citation. Simply write the term you’ve defined in quotation marks, and place parentheses around it. Note that you should capitalize the first letter of the term. [1] X Research source A basic parenthetical citation would be: (“Onomatopoeia”). Instead of placing the period after sentence, add it after the citation, like this: Onomatopoeia is a word that imitates or suggests the sound it describes (“Onomatopoeia”)."

      "title": "Include the definition number for words with multiple entries.",
      "content": "Include the definition number for words with multiple entries. The goal of an MLA citation is to point the reader to the exact location of your source. Some words have lots of definitions or can be used as multiple parts of speech, so you'll likely need to specify which entry you’re citing. Add a comma after the term you’ve referenced, write “def.,” then include the part of speech and entry number. [2] X Research source For example, your in-text citation would look like this: (“Turn,” def. V. 2a). Note the “V.” stands for verb; use “Adj.” for adjectives and “N.” for nouns. Write the part of speech and definition number as it appears in the dictionary. A dictionary might organize entries with numbers and letters (such as 1a) or with numbers alone (such as 1.2). If the word has multiple entries but only a single part of speech, just include the entry number: (“Wonderful,” def. 2)."

      "content": "Put the dictionary’s title in brackets if you’ve included multiple entries. To distinguish between entries in multiple dictionaries, write the term in quotation marks and the dictionary title in italics. Place a comma after the term, then put the dictionary title in brackets. [3] X Research source An example would be: (“Emoticon,” [Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary]). Suppose your paper references the definition of “Emoticon” in both Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary . If your in-text citations were just (“Emoticon”) or (“Emoticon,” N.), the reader wouldn’t know which dictionary you were referencing."

N. 1c. [5] X Research source Since there’s no known author, use the first letter of the term when you alphabetize your works cited page.
