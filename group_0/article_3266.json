This attitude is, like your becoming a young adult, just another natural transition in life. Their generation (and each before it) was filled with 18 year olds who didn’t want to grow up. Though this transition has always been difficult for humans, it is still very important to accept the challenge. Life isn’t always enjoyable, but maturing proactively can make it a little easier."

      "content": "Learn to respect your parents (or your guardian). This is important, firstly, because they are probably the most emotionally and financially equipped people to offer help when you need it. There are also larger reasons for respecting your parents. You have a lifelong bond that can be an incredible source of strength for everyone involved. Sure, you may have quarreled while you were growing up, but it’s time to do the adult thing and put your differences aside. Some people have mean or abusive parents . If your parents harm you in any way, you aren't obligated to respect them. This respect should go both ways. Now that you're a legal adult, your parents shouldn't treat you like a little child."

You’re not the first person to experience them, so check in every now and then with an adult you look up to. They can help you through problems and offer advice on how to ‘be an adult’ in a given situation. Having a mentor to talk to is also an important part of maintaining mental health. The early adult years are when you are most susceptible to showing signs of mental illness.

      "content": "Research and explore career options. The key to surviving the work culture of the 21st century is forgetting the clichéd question “what do I want to do for the rest of my life?” Almost no one these days will work for one company their entire life, much less have anyone job title. Many jobs that are available right now might become obsolete in the future. The best thing to do at 18 years old is think about general tasks you enjoy, and environments you enjoy being in. See this guide for a detailed description of the process of choosing a career. For example, if you keep your room tidy and keep track of all your expenses, you may enjoy a job in logistics or data management. Your ideal work environment may be as simple as indoor or outdoor. Or, for example, if you enjoy concerts, you should look into careers in audio engineering or event planning. You shouldn’t forget about your teenage dreams and hobbies, but most people aren’t going to become successful rock stars. Consider putting off spending too much time on unrealistic dreams until they are a viable way to earn a living. If you do want to follow your dreams, you can try following your dreams in a more \"scaled down\" and realistic fashion. For example, you may want to become a rock star, but think about starting a band and playing in your local community at a local coffee shop or lounge, etc. Getting a part time job while you explore your career options is a great idea. Just don’t get complacent with a job that doesn’t fill you with self-respect just because it puts a few bucks in your pocket."

      "content": "Look into ‘adult’ hobbies. It is important to have fun, but you should start thinking of ways to enjoy the world as an adult. There is a world of culture that you may have previously found dull or uninteresting. Now that you have matured some, try those activities again and see what all the rage is about – there is probably a reason ‘adult’ hobbies have been around so long. For example, if you like reading but mostly stick to young adult fiction, consider branching out into other genres as well. Or, try going to a music concert that is not rock, hip hop or pop music. You don’t need to force yourself to tolerate activities you still don’t enjoy, but try to expose yourself to them and see how you like them."

      "content": "Move into an apartment you can afford. If you live in an area that allows you to move out of your parents’ house, do it! You may have to have roommates the first few years, but see that as an opportunity. Unlike high school friends, who often move in opposite directions, the friends you make as a young adult are probably there to stay. Roommates you have as a young adult can become lifelong friends. You will learn to be mature and responsible. Check out this guide for more on choosing an apartment. Look at the neighborhood. You want to factor in accessibility, safety, public transportation, and nearby amenities. Make a budget. After rent, utilities, renter’s insurance, and any other housing related expenses, you shouldn’t be spending more than one-third of your monthly income. Find roommates at a similar place in life. You may be able to successfully live with older or younger roommates later, but keep your life more simple by rooming with like-minded people in this phase of your life. Remember that living on your own might give you more freedom and independence (and might make you feel more grown-up), but that for some people, living with your parents is the more practical option. If you're not financially independent yet or aren't able to say goodbye to that phase of life (a lot of people never live with their birth family again once they move out), or don't want to move out for whatever reason, there's no shame in staying where you are. If you’re still in high school, you probably shouldn’t move into an apartment just yet – this advice is for a little later."

This will be important in giving your life a sense of direction, but don’t feel bound to it. As the saying goes, life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans. Therefore, write down where you want to be in a few months, or next year. This should be a smaller, more achievable goal that will make your daily life more enjoyable. [2] X Expert Source Michelle Shahbazyan, MS, MA Life Coach Expert Interview. 18 March 2020. Long-term goals involve personal relationships, whether or not to attend college, being in an ideal career or job title, etc. These should be something you strive for, so making a plan is a good idea. However, be aware that your plan will change. For example, marriage may happen when you don’t expect it to, and not happen when you want it to. Be ready to roll with the punches. Short term goals may simply be, for example, that you want to start a weekly exercise regimen by next summer. Or, you may want to simply get a part time job in the next couple months while you explore career options."

Though they may not personally know your professors, they have come across many types of people in their life, and may have helpful advice for you. Parents may be a good source for relationship advice. Now that you’re a little older and more or less on your own, they may be able to identify with your relationship problems better than a few years ago. Seek advice from your parents about your resume.

It is also the schedule you will probably need to abide by if you get a full time job one day. Make the transition easier on yourself by getting in this rhythm when you have fewer responsibilities early in the day. It is easy for many college students to schedule all classes in the late morning, at the earliest. Try giving yourself a reason to get up earlier in the day by signing up for the earlier courses instead."

It is a good idea to go ahead and get a part-time job, even as you search for something you would enjoy more. It is easy for job searches to drag on much longer than you intend, and you can always quit a little part-time job. Getting a job as a restaurant server is fairly easy, and quick turnover is expected in that industry. Other service industry jobs like cashiering are easy to get and relatively painless to quit.

You may only have a crappy job right now, and think you deserve much more. You probably do deserve more, but look at this period as putting in your time. The best way to get promoted or impress your bosses is to put in a hard day’s work for your own sake if no one else’s. Look at the part-time job for what it is – a way to pay the bills and save up some money while you figure out what you want to do with the next part of your life. Try living day-to-day if you hate your job. If it was a beautiful day and a customer gave you positive feedback, put today in the ‘win column.’ Being grateful doesn’t mean you should accept your unenjoyable job indefinitely. Look around for openings at night, and apply to jobs you think you won’t get. If you don’t apply for these jobs, you’ll never have the possibility of getting lucky with a job offer from your dream company."

You can even itemize trips to see family and friends if you know how much you’ll spend on gas and food. If your paycheck doesn’t automatically subtract income tax, put away some money every month for this. You should be saving somewhere between 20% and 30%, depending on your tax bracket."

Since only half of people under 25 in many areas get credit cards, whether or not you should depends on your situation. Do some budgeting and ask your parents and mentors what they think.

As far as activities go, consider seeing movies at home rather than going to the movie theater every time, for example. The more you commit to outings, the more time and money you will lose."

You don’t always need to blindly accept the world as it is. However, this is a ‘pick your battles’ situation. Reinventing the wheel every time you walk out the door will make it impossible for you to actually live your life. For example, you may not like paying local taxes. However, this is an important part of maintaining basic services and infrastructure. Get involved in local government to learn more about why the laws and regulations are the way they are. You also may not like that you are expected to get married and have children, especially in more conservative and family orientated communities (think small town and suburban America).
