      "content": "Stop the spill at the source and place a barrier to stop the spread. Before you get too worried about how to clean a gasoline spill, you’ll want to keep it from getting any worse. If you’ve accidentally knocked over a fuel tank or container, return it to an upright position immediately and secure the lid or cap over the opening. If the spill originated from a pump, make sure that it’s shut off and that the nozzle has been replaced. If the gas is leaking out of a pipe or tube, place a large container (like a bucket or washtub) under the dripping petrol. [1] X Research source To prevent the spill from spreading to a larger area, throw down some object or group of objects that can stop or slow its movement. An obvious choice is a beach towel, but a piece of lumber or a few heavy boxes may also work (keep in mind that whatever you use will likely have to be thrown away). Position the barriers closely around the perimeter of the spill. [2] X Research source Be especially vigilant in preventing the spill from reaching electrical equipment or objects that produce or give off heat, such as stoves, space heaters and electrical outlets. Use a plastic tarp to cover and protect objects that are vulnerable to damage. If you’ve spilled fuel at a gas station, notify an employee immediately. If it’s a large petrol spill, do not start your car. If no employee is available and the spill is sizable, call the local police."

      "title": "Once the spill is contained, ventilate the area and clean yourself off.",
      "content": "Once the spill is contained, ventilate the area and clean yourself off. Gasoline emits powerful fumes that can be very harmful to inhale and may potentially cause dizziness, lightheadedness, shortness of breath or disorientation. Put on a respirator mask and safety goggles, if you have them. Open all nearby windows and doors to get air circulating throughout the room. If the spill occurs somewhere inside with no windows, turn on the ceiling fan or air conditioning. [3] X Trustworthy Source State of Massachusetts Official website for the State of Massachusetts Go to source Gas fumes are also a severe fire hazard. Avoid doing anything that may lead to an accidental ignition. In addition to avoiding the fumes, avoid touching the gas with your bare hands throughout the clean-up process. If the gas spilled onto you or your clothing, remove and throw away any garments that are soaked with gas. Do not wash your clothing items and toss them in the dryer—they may ignite from the heat of the machine. Wash your body with water and a non-abrasive soap as soon as possible."

      "title": "Cover the spill with a dry absorbent agent and let sit for 1-2 hours.",
      "content": "Cover the spill with a dry absorbent agent and let sit for 1-2 hours. Ideally, you should choose a substance like clay cat litter or trisodium phosphate (commonly packaged as the cleaning powder \"T.S.P.\"), as these are useful for neutralizing odors as well as wicking up moisture. However, other items like sawdust, sand, straw or even dirt will also be effective. Search the area and use whatever happens to be on hand—speed is the key here. [4] X Research source Apply the absorbent agent liberally. It may take quite a bit to soak up all of the standing gasoline. Let the absorbent agent sit for 1-2 hours, keeping the immediate vicinity clear and well-ventilated for this entire time period. If you’re near the kitchen, you could also use baking soda, cornstarch or flour. Some companies now manufacture special sorbent pads that can be used in the event of a sudden accident. The synthetic materials these pads are constructed from makes them a very efficient way of dealing with petroleum-based spills."

      "title": "Reapply the substance until most of the gasoline is absorbed.",
      "content": "Reapply the substance until most of the gasoline is absorbed. For larger spills, it may be necessary to clear away clumps of gas-soaked dry material in order to make room for more. Sweep or scoop the saturated material into a trash bag or bucket, then shake more onto the wet spots underneath. Leave the fresh absorbent agent to sit for half an hour or more. [5] X Research source Repeat this process until most of the gasoline has dissipated. You may not be able to get up every last trace of gasoline. What you can’t remove you’ll have to let evaporate, then scrub the resulting residue clean with water and detergent or an industrial-grade degreaser ."

      "title": "Sweep the absorbed gasoline into a clean, uncovered container.",
      "content": "Sweep the absorbed gasoline into a clean, uncovered container. Using a broom and dust pan, collect the gasoline and dry material from the affected surface. Dump the mess into a trash can, garbage bag or similar receptacle. If the spill occurred indoors, move the container outside to prevent fumes from building up in the confined space. [6] X Research source Don’t cover or seal the container holding the gasoline. Trapped fumes can build up inside, leading to an increased risk of fire or explosion. Be prepared to deep clean or throw out whatever container you use. If possible, wear gloves, safety goggles, and a respirator mask for this step."

      "title": "Scrape up any remaining gasoline.",
      "content": "Scrape up any remaining gasoline. Once the worst of the mess is up, turn your attention to the surface affected by the spill. The best way to do this is with a squeegee or plastic scraper. Transfer the last of the gasoline into a plastic bag and leave it with the rest of the materials for disposal. [7] X Research source For spills on carpet or upholstery, vacuum up the lingering bits of gasoline and dry material before giving the fabric a thorough cleaning. Since you’ll be getting close to the gasoline in this step, wear a respirator mask, safety gloves, and protective goggles if possible."

      "title": "Clean the area thoroughly with hot water and detergent.",
      "content": "Clean the area thoroughly with hot water and detergent. Wet a washcloth or sponge with hot water. Apply a liquid detergent or dish soap directly to the site of the spill and work it in until it forms a thick, foamy lather. Scrub the stain vigorously to coax it out, then flush the area with fresh water and pat it dry with a towel. [8] X Research source If you’re worried about causing water damage to the surface you’re attempting to clean, try sprinkling it with a powdered dish detergent or dry solvent instead. Afterwards, you can mop up the cleaner with a damp cloth. After you’re finished cleaning, wash your hands and any other parts of your body that may have come into contact with gasoline or gas fumes. If your stain is extra stubborn, try using an industrial-grade solvent or degreaser—just make sure to follow all safety steps listed on your product."

      "content": "Contact your local hazardous material management center for disposal options. Place a call to the fire department or pollution control agency to inform them of the spill and ask for instruction on how to proceed. In most cases, they’ll dispatch someone to deal with flammable substances. Otherwise, they can advise you on how to safely dispose of the mess yourself—often, this will mean taking the spilled gas to a hazardous waste disposal center. [9] X Research source Never throw gasoline away in a standard trash receptacle. Toxic and flammable materials require special disposal methods. Gasoline can still present a fire hazard even when it’s been absorbed into another dry material."

[12] X Research source Use a vacuum: Gasoline is highly flammable, and a vacuum’s electric motor could lead to a dangerous fire. Rinse gas down the drain: Doing so is not only illegal, but harmful to humans, animals, and the environment. [13] X Trustworthy Source State of New York Official website for the State of New York Go to source Mix gas with household trash: Gasoline is highly flammable and harmful to the environment. It may cause a fire or poisoning if left to sit at a dump or mixed into a trash truck with household items. [14] X Research source"

Gasoline fumes in your home can be incredibly dangerous, so it’s important to address the smell before trying to deodorize it. [15] X Research source Turn off all gas appliances and pilot lights, open all windows and doors as wide as possible, and shut off your gas main. If the smell of gasoline still isn’t dissipating, call a licensed emergency gas line plumber and leave the house immediately. [16] X Research source If you’ve called a professional and addressed the source of the issue but there’s still a lingering scent, use charcoal to absorb the odors. Fill aluminum pans with barbecue charcoal and leave them in rooms that smell like gas. Let the charcoal sit until the gasoline smell is gone, then discard it."

To rid your car of a gasoline smell , try hanging a few commercial car air fresheners from your rearview mirror. If you prefer a natural option, place a bowl of baking soda, coffee grounds, or white vinegar in your car and let it sit for a few days. [17] X Research source If you don’t know where the gas odors came from , make sure you find the source. Check for exhaust leaks under the car and look to see if your gas cap is loose. [18] X Research source If your car is parked in the garage, look for leaks in your gas tank, lawnmower, or gas cans. If you can’t find the source of the odor, take your car to an auto repair shop for an expert opinion. Gas fumes can be highly dangerous if left unchecked."
