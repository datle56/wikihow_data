      "content": "Remove any sink stoppers. If your stopper has a pivot rod, then you will need to remove this to remove the stopper. Look under the sink and locate a locking nut where the pivot rod goes into the drainpipe. Unscrew the nut, pull out the rod, and remove the stopper. Then screw the nut and rod back in place without the stopper. [1] X Research source If you are plunging a kitchen sink, make sure to clamp the dishwasher drain hose. Do this by tightening a clamp around the bendable drain line before you begin plunging. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a coat hanger or wire to clear obstructions. Take a metal coat hanger and unwind it, or find a piece of wire. Bend 1 end of the hanger or wire into a small hook shape. Stick the end with the hook into the drain and use it to pull out clumps of hair, paper, or other obstructions."

      "title": "Begin to fill your sink with water.",
      "content": "Begin to fill your sink with water. As your sink is filling, place a plunger over the drain entrance. Fill your sink until the plunger is completely submerged in the water, about 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) of water. The water will suction your plunger to the sink. [3] X Research source If you have a double sink, then you will need to cover the other sink’s drain with a wet rag or another type of cover. This will prevent water from spewing out of the sink’s drain while you plunge the other drain. If you have a small vanity sink and your plunger is too large to create a tight seal around the drain, pick up a small plunger from a hardware store."

      "title": "Pump your sink vigorously.",
      "content": "Pump your sink vigorously. Do this by rapidly moving the plunger up and down for at least 20 seconds. On your final upstroke, make sure to pop the plunger off of your drain to create extra pressure. This will help release the clog in your sink trap. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep plunging if necessary. If the water in your sink whirls down your drain easily, then the clog is clear in your sink trap. If not, then you will need to keep plunging. Repeat the plunging process until the water whirls smoothly down your sink. [5] X Research source"

Then, add a few drops of dish soap to the water and agitate it with a spoon or spatula. Pour the water down your drain. The boiling water should clear away any remaining residue in your sink trap. The dish soap helps remove grease and oil."

You can do this either manually, using your hands, or you can use a wrench. Once the joint nuts are loose, continue to untighten them with your hands. If your sink trap has a decorative or metal finish, then use a strap wrench to loosen the slip joints to prevent scratching. You can also place duct tape on the parts of the wrench that come into contact with your pipes to prevent scratching."

Then place the sink trap between the tail and waste pipes. Use your hands to tighten the slip joint nuts over the ends of the sink trap. Use your wrench to finish tightening the slip joint nuts. Only tighten the slip joints nuts a quarter turn more. Try not to tighten them too tight. This can cause your pipes to crack and break, especially plastic ones. If there’s rust on the P trap, replace it before it has a chance to leak."
