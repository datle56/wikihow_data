[2] X Research source Example Problem. A village grows from 150 people at the start of the year to 275 people at the end of the year. Calculate its growth percentage this year as follows: Growth Percentage = 275 − 150 150 ∗ 100 {\\displaystyle ={\\frac {275-150}{150}}*100} = 125 150 ∗ 100 {\\displaystyle ={\\frac {125}{150}}*100} ≈ 0.8333 ∗ 100 {\\displaystyle 0.8333*100} = 83.33 % {\\displaystyle 83.33\\%}"

The formula for calculating the annual growth rate is Growth Percentage Over One Year = ( ( f s ) 1 y − 1 ) ∗ 100 {\\displaystyle =(({\\frac {f}{s}})^{\\frac {1}{y}}-1)*100} where f is the final value, s is the starting value, and y is the number of years. [6] X Research source Example Problem: A company earned $10,000 in 2011. That same company earned $65,000 four years later in 2015. What's the annual growth rate? Enter the values above into the growth rate formula to find the answer: Annual Growth Rate = ( ( 65000 10000 ) 1 4 − 1 ) ∗ 100 {\\displaystyle =(({\\frac {65000}{10000}})^{\\frac {1}{4}}-1)*100} = ( 6.5 1 4 − 1 ) ∗ 100 {\\displaystyle =(6.5^{\\frac {1}{4}}-1)*100} ≈ ( 1.5967 − 1 ) ∗ 100 {\\displaystyle (1.5967-1)*100} = 59.67% annual growth Note — raising a value a to the 1 b {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{b}}} exponent is equivalent to taking the b th root of a . You will likely need a calculator with an \" n x {\\displaystyle n{\\sqrt {x}}} \" button, or a good online calculator."
