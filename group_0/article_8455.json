      "content": "Check your manual to see if you can activate a clean from the control panel. Get out the manual that came with your printer and find “cleaning” or a similar term in the index. Follow the directions to use the buttons on the printer to start an automatic clean. Each printer is different, so that’s why it’s important to use the directions that came with your make and model. Typically, this is all you need to do to clean the interior of your printer. If you can’t find your manual, you can locate it online by searching the type of printer you have and “manual.” To get to the maintenance control panel via PC, search \"maintenance\" in the Windows search bar and click on the \"Security and Maintenance\" page that comes up (from the control panel)."

Some printers don’t have the option to run the cleaning function directly from the printer buttons. If your manual doesn’t indicate that option, you can launch the cleaning application from your computer. To access these options, right click on the printer icon on the bottom of your computer screen. [1] X Research source When the menu opens, select whichever of these appears: “Maintenance”, “Utility”, “Toolbox”, or “Properties.” The term will vary depending on what type of printer you have. Next, select the cleaning option."

Don’t worry, you can easily unsnap the clips holding the rollers in place and remove them. Just put them pack and fasten the clips after you’ve wiped the rollers clean.
