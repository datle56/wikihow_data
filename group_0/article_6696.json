      "content": "Be aware that the legal name change is simple in cases of marriage or divorce. Changing your name in the case of marriage or divorce is possible when you obtain a marriage license or divorce decree that indicates the old and new names on the form. Nothing else is required to legally change your name, and the certified marriage license or divorce decree can be used to notify other parties and agencies of your name change. If this applies to you, you may skip to Part 3. [1] X Research source Name changes due to marriages and divorce make up the majority of name changes in the United States. Make sure you have certified copies (i.e., NOT photocopies) of your marriage license or divorce decree. These will be needed to notify other public and private institutions of your name change.

      "content": "Meet the requirements for a legal name change. Note that for an official name change to be granted by the circuit court in your county, the court must find the reason for the change satisfactory, or in 'good faith', and also consider it consistent with public interest. The most common reasons for name changes include marriage or divorce. In general, however, any lawful reason that does not violate any state laws or infringe upon the rights of anyone else typically satisfies most courts, whether that reason be for religious, personal or social reasons. There are cases in which name changes are not allowed, such as individuals with criminal records or who have cases pending against them and those who seek to avoid paying debts. More generally, name changes are not allowed for the purposes of defrauding others. Note that you need to be a resident of the county in which you seek to change your name. [3] X Research source"

When a minor, someone defined as under the age of 18, wants to change his name, there are additional requirements, though in general the procedure of legally changing a name is the same. Here are the following amendments to the general procedure: [4] X Research source The petition is filed by the minor's parents or \"next friend\", the child's physical custodian. The name change requires the written and notarized consent of both known parents. This consent is to be filed along with the petition for name change. If the consent of each known parent is not filed, then 30 days before the hearing, a copy of the petition along with a notice stating the date of the hearing is served by registered mail to the last known address of each parent. As with adults, the change of name is conditional upon publication. See Steps 7 and 8 below. It is the petitioner's responsibility to ensure the publication of the minor's name change."
