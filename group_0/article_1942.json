    {
      "title": "Put your request in the subject line of your response email.",
      "content": "Put your request in the subject line of your response email. If you’re responding to a job posting or an ad listing an open position, write up a clear and actionable subject line for your response email. In the subject line, include your request for an interview for the job you want so the hiring manager or your potential future boss knows right away why you’re contacting them. Send the email to the address listed in the job posting. [1] X Research source For instance, you could craft a subject line like “Interview Request for Personal Assistant Position.” If the company has multiple locations, include the one you’re applying for in the subject line. Keep it professional and avoid using demanding or rude language like, “I want an interview.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Email your resume to a hiring manager if there isn’t a job posting.",
      "content": "Email your resume to a hiring manager if there isn’t a job posting. Update your resume and look for the hiring manager’s email on the company’s website or social media. If there isn’t a hiring manager, look for a human resources (HR) manager. Shoot them an email or a message that includes your resume and ask them for the opportunity to interview for a potential position. You might just land your dream job. [2] X Research source If you want to take a shot at applying to work for your favorite company, it might be worth a shot! Some people may have an email filter that blocks messages with attachments. If your email gets returned to you as undeliverable, try sending it again without your resume attached."
    },
    {
      "title": "Close your cover letter",
      "content": "Close your cover letter with a call to action for an interview. If a job you’re applying for asks for a cover letter, grab their attention with a well-written one and include a request for an interview in the letter so you stand out from any other candidates vying for the job. Keep up your enthusiasm and excitement when you’re wrapping up your letter and add a subtle, polite request to interview for the job. [3] X Research source For example, you could say something like, “I’d love the chance to talk more about the position! Let me know if you’d like to set up an interview.” Go with something like “Sincerely” or “Best” as a professional complimentary close."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask a hiring manager for a short interview at the end of a phone call.",
      "content": "Ask a hiring manager for a short interview at the end of a phone call. If you’re calling a company about a potential job, be friendly to the receptionist or whoever answers the phone—it could make a big difference! Politely ask to speak with a hiring manager or someone in the human resources (HR) department who makes hiring decisions. Introduce yourself and explain that you’re calling about a specific position. Before you end the call, ask them for a 20-minute interview to talk more about the position. [4] X Research source For example, you could end the call by saying something like, “I’d love to discuss the job more with you. Can we set up a 20-minute meeting to talk in person?” Twenty minutes won’t eat up too much of their time and they may be more likely to agree to a short interview. If they aren’t available any time soon, ask them if you can schedule a short meeting for a specific time and date. Leave your name and number so they have your info."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring your resume and ask a hiring manager in person.",
      "content": "Bring your resume and ask a hiring manager in person. Another option is to simply walk into the company’s office and ask for an interview. Be courteous and ask to speak with a hiring manager or an HR rep. Make sure you bring a few copies of your resume with you so you can give one to whoever you speak with about the job. [5] X Research source Tell them who you are and why you’re interested in the position. At the end of the conversation, ask for a short, 20-minute meeting to talk more about the job. [6] X Research source For instance, after you talk to a manager about why you’re interested in the job, you could say something like, “But listen, I know you’re super busy. If it’s alright with you, could we set up a short, 20-minute meeting to talk more about it?” If a manager isn’t available to speak with you, try leaving your name and number with a receptionist or another work and ask them to give you a call."
    },
    {
      "title": "Explain who you are and state your request clearly at the top of the email.",
      "content": "Explain who you are and state your request clearly at the top of the email. Tell your potential employer your name and why you’re contacting them right off the bat in the opening lines of the email. [7] X Research source Make it clear that you’d like to interview for the position you’re applying for by mentioning it as well so they know you’re serious. [8] X Research source For example, you could start your email with something like, “Hello, my name is Chris Smith, and I’m writing in regards to the office manager position. I’d love the opportunity to be considered and potentially interview for the position.”"

    {
      "title": "Reference 3 skills you have that would benefit the company.",
      "content": "Reference 3 skills you have that would benefit the company. Make a strong impression and help yourself stand out by demonstrating what you bring to the table and how you can benefit the company you’re applying for. Include at least 3 talents, skills, or experience that you have that make you an ideal candidate for the job. [9] X Research source Try to mention skills that are relevant to the job you’re applying for. For instance, if you’re trying to get an interview for a copy editor position, talk about your writing skills and work ethic rather than your love of graphic novels or hiking. If you’re applying for a receptionist position, for example, you could say something like, “Anybody who knows me knows that I love talking to people and helping them find what they need, which should come in handy as a receptionist. I’m also a fast learner and I’m happy to try new things if something comes up that I can help out with in the office.”"

      "title": "Keep your email brief and be flexible in your request to meet.",
      "content": "Keep your email brief and be flexible in your request to meet. Don’t make any more work for your potential boss than necessary. Remember, they’re a busy person, and they may be going through lots of emails looking to hire somebody. Make their job easier and make your email look better by keeping it direct and brief. End your email by asking to meet for an interview whenever it’s most convenient for them. [10] X Research source If your email is really long, it may get ignored. Try a friendly and flexible request like, “I’m really interested in the position, and I’m available to meet for an interview whenever it’s most convenient for you.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Format your email",
      "content": "Format your email and use professional language. Make your email look really good by using a professional email address and font (something like Times New Roman or Arial), as well as a proper salutation by addressing the recipient by name along with their title. Use complete sentences and polite phrasing and proofread your message to make sure there aren’t any spelling or grammar mistakes. If your email address isn’t super professional, you might want to make a new one that’s a little more formal. Whatever you do, do not use decorative fonts like Comic Sans! Make sure you spell the person’s name correctly if you know it and use the right title. For instance, if they’re a doctor, use the “Dr.” title rather than Mr. or Ms."

      "content": "Attach your resume if it’s requested and send your email. Once you’ve wrapped up your email, send it off to your potential future employer and hang tight for a response from them. If a position specifically asks for you to include your resume, definitely attach it to the email before you send it. If it isn’t requested, don’t attach it, but mention that you can provide it if they’d like to review it. [11] X Research source You could add a line like, “Let me know if you’d like to see a copy of my current resume.”"

      "title": "Send a thank you email if they respond to you.",
      "content": "Send a thank you email if they respond to you. If you receive a reply from the company and they’re interested in setting up an interview, reply with a friendly email to work out the details and thank them for the opportunity. If they respond and aren’t interested in hiring you—it’s still a good idea to send a thank you! You never know what future positions will open up with them. Better to end on a good note. [12] X Research source Waiting for a response can feel agonizing. But try not to follow up with emails asking about your potential interview or you could turn them off to the idea of hiring you. You may not receive any reply at all. If you don’t hear anything after a week or so, you can try sending a follow-up email. [13] X Expert Source Adrian Klaphaak, CPCC Career Coach Expert Interview. 18 December 2018. Try saying something like, “I just wanted to make sure you received my email. I know things can get lost in an inbox all the time.”"

      "content": "Research the company and read the job ad before you call. Prepare yourself before you make the actual call by visiting the company’s website and social media to learn more about the products and services they offer so you’re super knowledgeable and able to talk about them. If there’s a job posting, read it carefully so you can reference it and have a clear idea of what they’re looking for.

      "content": "Use a landline so the call is less likely to get dropped. Cell phones can drop calls and have poor reception. If you can, use a landline so the reception is crystal clear and don’t have to worry about getting cut off. [15] X Research source If you can’t use a landline, try to find a place where your phone has full service."

      "content": "Call the company’s main number and ask for the hiring manager. If you don’t know anybody at the company, don’t call somebody’s office directly if you can help it. Instead, call the main public line and ask to be transferred to the hiring manager. [16] X Research source If they’re unavailable, try asking for their voicemail. You can leave a short message asking them to call you back. Make sure you leave your name and number so they can reach you."

      "title": "Introduce yourself and ask if it’s a convenient time for them to talk.",
      "content": "Introduce yourself and ask if it’s a convenient time for them to talk. Start the conversation by greeting the manager and telling them who you are. Ask them if they have a quick moment to talk so you seem courteous and respectful of their time. [17] X Research source If they don’t have time for a call, ask them when would be a better time for you to call back."

      "content": "Mention your experience and education to show them you’re capable. Talk about your interest in the potential job and how your experience has prepared you to handle it. Be polite and listen to them whenever they speak. Mention your education as well to demonstrate your credentials. [18] X Research source For instance, if you’re calling about an accounting position, you could say something like, “I’ve always been good with numbers. That’s why I majored in accounting in college and started working at a firm as soon as I graduated.” If you don’t have a ton of academic credentials, try focusing more on your experience. For a construction manager position, for example, you could say something like, “I’ve been on job sites all my life and I’ve been a manager for the past 6 years.”"

      "content": "Print out copies of your resume to bring with you. Update your resume so it’s current and neatly formatted to fit on 1 page. Print out at least 2-3 copies and take them with you so you can give them to a manager if you land an interview. [20] X Research source Avoid having a resume longer than 1 page or you could turn off a potential employer."

      "title": "Practice a 15-second pitch so you can impress the manager.",
      "content": "Practice a 15-second pitch so you can impress the manager. Write down your experience, your education, and what qualifies you for the job. Narrow down the info into a 15-second pitch and rehearse it over and over until you’ve got it memorized. [21] X Research source For instance, let’s say you want to try to land an interview for a copy editor position, you could say something like, “I love writing, I love reading, and I love reading and editing writing. I’ve always had a knack for helping people improve their work and I believe in the work you guys do. I think I’d be a great fit if you’d be willing to give me a shot.” You may not have much time to catch their attention. A strong, short pitch could land you a potential interview.

You don’t want to make any enemies before you even talk to the manager! If you aren’t able to speak with a hiring manager, ask if you can leave your resume with the front desk. That way, they’ll have all of your contact info and work experience handy."

      "content": "Ask the manager if they have 20 minutes for an interview. When the manager arrives, give them your short pitch. If they seem interested, ask them if you can have 20 minutes of their time, which isn’t too burdensome and will allow you to further demonstrate how and why you’d be a great employee. [23] X Research source If they don’t have time for an interview then, ask if you can schedule one for another time.
