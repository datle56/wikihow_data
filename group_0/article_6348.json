Before you can find the shiny Haxorus, you’ll need to collect all 8 Unova Gym Badges, beat the Elite 4, and defeat the Pokémon Champion. Find these competitors on the north end of Victory Road—just be prepared to battle some trainers along the way! As a refresher, the Elite 4 include Shauntal, a Ghost-type expert; Grimsley, a Dark-type expert; Caitlin, a Psychic-type expert; and Marshall, a Fighting-type expert. Pokémon Champion Iris is a Dragon-type expert. Expect to fight a level 57 Hydreigon (Dark/Dragon), a level 57 Druddigon (Dragon), a level 57 Archeops (Rock/Flying), a level 57 Aggron (Steel/Rock), a level 57 Lapras (Water/Ice), and a level 59 Haxorus (Dragon).

Walk down to the bottom of the screen, past the plane—then, walk to the right. Go up through the opening in the trees; after a few moments of walking, find Haxorus sitting in the center of a clearing."

      "content": "Saving allows you to redo the battle infinitely if anything goes wrong. Pull up the main menu in your Pokémon game and hit the “Save” option. At this point, make any necessary changes to your roster. It’s ideal to have a Pokémon on your team that knows the “False Swipe” move, which allows you to safely lower Haxorus’s health without knocking it out. [5] X Research source Don’t have False Swipe? You can pick it up from a Pokémon researcher on Reversal Mountain. [6] X Research source Haxorus is level 60. Chances are, your current team is more than strong enough to defeat the Pokémon without any issues—the main challenge will be not knocking it out."

      "content": "Walk up to the Haxorus and hit A to start the battle. Pay attention to the sparkles on the Pokémon at the beginning of the battle—this is proof that the Haxorus is indeed shiny. Hit the Haxorus with a few powerful hits to get the majority of its health down, being careful not to KO it in the process. Once its health is low, hit it with False Swipes until it’s down to 1 HP. Moves that immobilize the Haxorus (like Sleep or Paralyze) can make it easier to capture. Haxorus is a Dragon-Type Pokémon, which means that it’s especially weak to Dragon-, Ice-, and Fairy-Type moves. [7] X Research source Just don’t use too many of these abilities—you don’t want to knock it out!"

Once the Haxorus is at 1 HP (and possibly incapacitated), use the best Pokéballs you have on hand to catch it, like Ultra Balls. Keep in mind that it might take a few tries before you successfully make the capture!"
