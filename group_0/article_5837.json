      "content": "The error appears if your Mac cannot verify that an app has no malware. Your Mac automatically runs a program called Gatekeeper that checks software you install for malware. If you’re running Catalina or later on your Mac, you’ll receive a “developer cannot be verified” error if the app hasn’t been notarized by Apple and it could potentially have malware. [1] X Research source This error only appears when you download apps from the Internet or directly from a developer. Downloading from the official App Store will not trigger an error message."

Look under the heading that reads Allow apps downloaded from: and choose App Store and identified developers. Try opening the app again to see if that resolves your issue. [2] X Research source On older versions of Mac, you may be able to select “Anywhere” from the list so you don’t receive any more warning messages. However, this could put your computer at risk if you install and open malware from an unknown or untrustworthy developer. If you're running Ventura or later, get the \"Anywhere\" option back in your settings by opening Terminal and typing in sudo SPTCL --global-disable . Hit ↵ Enter and type in your password to make the option appear. Make sure you only download and install apps from trusted sites and developers because using this setting could make your Mac more vulnerable to malware."

If you still get a pop-up warning saying the app is unable to be opened, then move on to the next step. Download the app from the official developer’s site instead of another third-party site so you’re less likely to run into malware. [5] X Research source"
