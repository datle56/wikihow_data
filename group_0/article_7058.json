Your pulse will give you the basic information you need to estimate if your systolic blood pressure is relatively normal. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Keep in mind this is a very rough estimate and really only tells you if your systolic blood pressure is not low—it doesn't indicate high blood pressure. Take two fingers, preferably your index and middle fingers, and place them just below the wrist creases on the thumb side of your hand. Don't use your thumb, as your thumb has a strong enough pulse to interfere with this process."
