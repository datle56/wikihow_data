      "content": "Ask about the hiring process. It's common for employers to ask you if you have any questions about the job or the process, but they may not always ask. Asking about the next step directly will show initiative and that you're excited about the job. [1] X Research source Ask: \"What happens after the interview in your hiring process?\" or “When do you expect to make a decision?” Depending on the type of work, they may tell you they’re going to check your references or hold another round of interviews."

    {
      "title": "Inquire if there's anything you need to do before they make an offer.",
      "content": "Inquire if there's anything you need to do before they make an offer.

Depending on the work, you may need to get fingerprinted, submit a background check, or take an assessment test. [2] X Research source Ask: \"Is there anything I need to do before you make an offer?\" or “Do you need any documents from me?”"

    },
    {
      "title": "Set up a point of contact.",
      "content": "Set up a point of contact. A point of contact is someone you can call to inquire about your application status.

    {
      "title": "Clarify whether you should call or email them to follow up.",
      "content": "Clarify whether you should call or email them to follow up. Your potential employer may have a million things going on, so it's important to respect their boundaries and preferences—you don't want your phone call to disrupt their day! It's more respectful to ask how you should contact them instead of assuming what works for you will also work for them. [7] X Research source Ask: \"How do you prefer I reach out to you?\" or \"Do they prefer that I email or call them?\" If they have given you a business card, circle the preferred contact information so you don't forget. If possible, ask what a good time to call would be."

    {
      "title": "Reiterate your interest in the job.",
      "content": "Reiterate your interest in the job. Letting the interviewer know how excited you are about the opportunity will show passion and drive.

    {
      "title": "Thank the interviewer for meeting with you.",
      "content": "Thank the interviewer for meeting with you. Showing gratitude is a sign of respect and will leave a good impression. Whether your interview is in person or via phone or video chat, thanking them is one of the last things you should say before you leave or end the call. Use their first name if they've established you can call them that. Otherwise, use their full name. [9] X Research source Say: \"Thank you for your time, Mary, I enjoyed our discussion” or \"I appreciate your taking the time to speak with me, Mrs. Normet.\" If they offer you a handshake, shake their hand confidently with a firm (but not too firm!) grip."

    {
      "title": "Call your point of contact 1 or 2 days later via their preferred method.",
      "content": "Call your point of contact 1 or 2 days later via their preferred method. If the interviewer is your point of contact, reach out to them a day or 2 later. Note that this isn't a formal follow-up inquiring about the status of your application. You should still contact them to ask about the process 1 to 2 weeks later or whenever the day they said they'd contact you has passed. [10] X Research source Say something like: \"Good afternoon, Mrs. Normet. I enjoyed our conversation the other day. I’m just curious to know what comes next in your hiring process?\""

    {
      "title": "Send a friendly email asking what you can expect.",
      "content": "Send a friendly email asking what you can expect. If the potential employer requested that you email instead of call, do that. Send it at an appropriate time between 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM and write in a friendly semi-formal tone. Use a proper address at the beginning and a friendly salutation at the end. [11] X Research source “Dear Mrs. Normet, I enjoyed getting learn more about the role. It seems like a fantastic opportunity for me if I were to be offered the position. I have a few more questions for you: What can I expect with regards to the hiring process? Is there anything I need to do before the next stage? Have a great week, Tom Lemere”"

      "content": "Choose a non-intrusive time to call and ask what to expect. Don't call first thing in the morning or at the very end of the day because those times can be extremely busy. If the interviewer gave you a preferred window to contact them, abide by their suggestion and call within that window. Otherwise, rely on clues you gathered about the company culture during your interview. [12] X Research source “Good afternoon, Mary, this is Tom Lemere. Thank you for meeting with me the other day. I’m calling to ask what I can expect to happen next in the hiring process?” For instance, if it’s a laid-back place with slow mornings and busy afternoons, call during the morning hours so you’re not interrupting their rush hour."
