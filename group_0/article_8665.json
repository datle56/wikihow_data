      "content": "Use running water to refresh your crystals. Just like we shower or bathe to wash off negative energy, washing crystals allows negativity to flow into the water and run down the drain. Hold your crystals under any kind of running water (even your sink tap) for about a minute.

      "title": "Submerge your crystals in salt water for healing.",
      "content": "Submerge your crystals in salt water for healing. This method promotes cleansing the same way that salt water promotes cleansing for cuts. [3] X Research source Use Himalayan salt or Celtic salt, and soak your crystals for a few minutes to an hour. This method also combines the elemental forces of water and earth, since salt is considered a pure form of earth. Don’t do this with blue/black kyanite, or selenite since they’ll dissolve in water. Similarly, hematite will rust in water. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Place your crystals on snow to promote meditation and reflection.",
      "content": "Place your crystals on snow to promote meditation and reflection. When fresh snow falls over the earth, it creates a beautiful blank canvas for nature. Cleaning your crystals with snow allows them to reset and find stillness. If you’re fortunate enough to have access to snow, gather some pure snow into a bowl. Set your crystals on top of the snow and let them soak in until you sense their energy has been refreshed. Only use crystals that will not dissolve or rust in water. Don’t use black/blue kyanite, selenite, or hematite."

      "title": "Cover your crystals with earth for stability.",
      "content": "Cover your crystals with earth for stability. Earth is an element of beauty, steady change, and growth. When you’re feeling a little anxious or need to reconnect with your body, let your crystals rest in the soil. Bury them outside in the dirt and leave them overnight. [5] X Research source Crystals that resonate with earth energy include red jasper, mookaite jasper, and black tourmaline. [6] X Research source Don’t bury blue/black kyanite or selenite because those crystals may dissolve from the moisture in the ground."

      "content": "Submerge your crystals in a bowl of dry salt for earth energy. This is a great earth energy alternative for crystals that can’t be submerged in salt water or moist ground. Fill a bowl with Himalayan or Celtic salt. If possible, take the bowl out of your house to leave behind any negative energy. Let the crystals sit for 24 hours.

Simply hold each crystal and pass it over the smoke several times until you feel the negative energy lift. [11] X Research source As you perform the ritual, ask the sacred smoke to clear the crystals of their energy. Likewise, ask the crystals to release the energy they’re holding.

Healing bowls are special instruments that produce powerful resonant harmonics when played. Set your crystals in an arc around the speaker or healing bowl so they can absorb the vibration as you play the music. [13] X Research source"

As a result, it has strong connections to lunar cycles and divine femininity. [14] X Research source Set a selenite log on a flat surface and let your crystals sit on the selenite log overnight.

Keep it in your palm for a few minutes and ask yourself: “Does this make me feel calm or active?” If the crystal’s energy doesn’t match the intention you’d like to set, try another crystal.

      "content": "Carry the crystal with you. You and your crystal both have an energy field, and you want to let those fields resonate. Wearing the crystal or putting it into your pocket allows you to absorb the vibration of the reality you manifested in the crystal. In turn, the universe will match the vibration you’re putting back out and return it to you. [29] X Research source Just remember, the universe won’t make your manifestations a reality on its own. For instance, if you’re hoping to find love, the universe won’t send a significant other to your door. However, if you go out and meet new people with your crystal, you might encounter new opportunities. [30] X Research source"
