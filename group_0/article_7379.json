      "content": "Consider a canary if you want a singing bird. Canaries are most widely known for their beautiful songs, but only the males sing. They don’t squawk or scream like other species, but they also sing often through the daylight hours. You can’t train a canary to stop singing, so only buy this species if you are okay with having a canary’s song in your home. [3] X Research source The most common species known for their beautiful singing are the Waterslager, the German Roller, the Russian Singer, the Spanish Timbrado, and the American Singer.

      "content": "Decide between buying or adopting. You can buy your canary from a local breeder, a pet store, or a bird show. Reputable breeders may be the best way to guarantee you are not going to get a bird from a bird mill. You also may choose to adopt a bird who has been abandoned and needs a home. [5] X Research source Contact local vets and animal shelters to find out where you can adopt or purchase canaries in your area. You can also check online using pet finder websites."

      "content": "Decide between a yellow or red canary. There are two types of canaries, those with yellow or white bases or those with a red base. Red birds can also be shades of orange.

      "title": "Determine how old you want your canary to be.",
      "content": "Determine how old you want your canary to be. Most canaries have a lifespan of ten years. You may want to buy a younger bird so you can enjoy them for most of their life. However, you may want to buy or adopt an older bird who needs a good home, even if it is seven or eight years. Ask how old the bird is so you can decide if the age is right for you. [7] X Research source Make sure the bird is old enough to determine gender. All young birds sing, so it’s easy to mix up a male and a female."

      "title": "Determine if you want a male or female.",
      "content": "Determine if you want a male or female. One of the things you should consider when buying a canary is whether you want a male or female. Males are the only canaries that can sing, but they need to be the only bird in the cage. They will fight with other males, and may even fight the females. [8] X Research source Females are very social and can be put together with other females."

      "title": "Get a written guarantee if you buy a male.",
      "content": "Get a written guarantee if you buy a male. Sometimes, people will buy a male canary and find out later that it is actually a female. Male canaries cost more than females, so you don’t want to get the wrong sex. If you are buying from a store, ask for a written guarantee that your bird is male. [9] X Research source Ask about any return policies. Your bird should start singing within two weeks. If it doesn’t, return it or ask for a refund for the difference. Birds can also be DNA sexed. This is a test that will allow you to know whether the bird is male or female. It is the most common way to sex birds."

      "title": "Ask to see the canaries in a listening room.",
      "content": "Ask to see the canaries in a listening room. If you are choosing a canary because of their singing, you should hear it sing before choosing it. You can ask a pet store if you can take the canaries into a room without other birds so you can listen to them. If you contact a breeder, request to see only the birds you can buy. [11] X Research source Separating the canaries from other birds gives you a chance to hear their singing voices without interference."

      "content": "Look for signs of physical problems. Your bird should look healthy. The eyes should be bright and clear, with no signs of swelling or discharge. There should also be no nasal discharge. Take the bird in your hand and feel the chest. If you can feel the bone there, the bird might be too skinny. [14] X Research source Bring the bird close to your ear and listen. Any clicking or wheezing in the respiration or breathing may point to disease. If you have experience handling canaries, then gently catch it in your hands so you can inspect it. If you don't know how to catch it, ask the breeder or pet store worker to catch it or take it out of its cage so you can inspect it closely while they hold it."
