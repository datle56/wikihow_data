      "content": "Decide whether you will bring the entire car seat. First, decide if you will bring the entire car seat, or just the seat part of it. Rear-facing and infant car seats clip into bases that are secured in cars. Some car seats work well without the base, and for some it is required. Decide if you will bring the base on your trip. It is an extra hassle and a large item to take care of, but can be safer if you plan on spending a long time in the car. For convertible car seats for older children, you generally have no option but to bring the entire thing."

      "content": "Call the airline well before your trip to ask about their regulations on car seats. An airline representative should be able to answer your questions and offer suggestions. Some airlines treat car seats like carry-on luggage, some will let you check it for free, and some consider it part of the regular checked luggage allotment and will charge a fee. Many airlines consider car seats to be fragile items and don’t accept liability for any damage. Find the airline car seat policy online and bring a printed copy with you to the airport to clarify if there are any issues. Based on the airline guidelines, you can decide between the three options for checking a car seat: luggage check, gate check, or to bring it on the plane."

      "content": "Understand the advantages and disadvantages of checking the seat at the gate. Checking your car seat at the gate allows you to bring it with you all the way to the gate and check it right before you get on the plane. Most airlines allow baby items to be gate checked for free, but double check with your airline to be sure. Gate checking is only available for domestic flights, and is great for smaller babies who sit in their car seat clipped into a stroller. It also potentially minimizes the amount of damage to the car seat because it is the last thing on the plane and the first thing off, plus it avoids being put through baggage claim. However, checking items at the gate means you have to bring them through security, which can be an ordeal."
