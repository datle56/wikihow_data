      "content": "Give the MC a written list of names. Your wedding party is a big part of your special day. When you introduce them, you want to make sure that they get the recognition that they deserve. Make sure the DJ or MC has a written list of the names of the entire bridal party. If necessary, include a pronunciation guide for the announcer. You don’t want them stumbling over an uncommon name. Make sure the names are written in the order in which the members of the party will enter."

      "title": "Choose a good song.",
      "content": "Choose a good song. Music is a traditional component of the bridal party entrance. You can use it simply as soft background noise, or as a prominent feature of the announcement. If you are planning a traditional entrance, you might want to pick a popular song for the moment. Some typical choices include: ”Walking on Sunshine” by Katrina and the Waves ”The Way You Make Me Feel” by Michael Jackson ”Bittersweet Symphony” by The Verve ”Viva La Vida” by Coldplay \"Waiting for Tonight” by Jennifer Lopez"

      "content": "Plan the timeline. Decide what you are going to do between the ceremony and the reception. Many people choose to take formal pictures during this time. Others plan a cocktail hour so that they can mingle with guests. Whatever you do, make sure that you figure out how much time you want to have between the ceremony and the bridal party entrance. [1] X Research source Communicate this timeline to the MC. You could say, “The ceremony will end at 5:30, and the cocktail hour will begin. At 6:30, we want the guests to be escorted into the dining room. At 6:40, we would like the bridal party to be announced.”"

      "title": "Communicate the plan to the wedding party.",
      "content": "Communicate the plan to the wedding party. Make sure that each member of the bridal party understands where they need to be and when. You don’t want to be missing any members of the party when it’s time for the big announcement. Plan the timeline in advance, and give them clear instructions. [2] X Research source You could send an e-mail the week before to everyone in your wedding party. It should give a detailed timeline of the entire wedding day. You can also remind everyone on the big day. During pictures you could say, “Remember, everyone, we’ll line up to enter the reception right at 6:35.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Line everyone up.",
      "content": "Line everyone up. Gather your wedding party near the door where they will enter the reception. Traditionally, they will line up in the order that they entered the ceremony. That means the bridesmaid and groomsmen pairs will enter first, followed by the maid of honor and best man. The newly married couple will be the last to be announced. If you have a wedding coordinator, you can have them organize the line-up."

    {
      "title": "Choose the people who will be part of the entrance.",
      "content": "Choose the people who will be part of the entrance. Traditionally, the bridesmaids and groomsmen are introduced to the guests during the entrance. In addition to their names, the MC should also state their relationship to the couple and their role in the wedding. For example, “Please welcome Anne Webster, Maid of Honor and sister of the bride.” If you have a flower girl and ring bearer, it is traditional to include them in the entrance. You might want to have an adult escort them, as they could be nervous."

    {
      "title": "Give them specific instructions.",
      "content": "Give them specific instructions. If your wedding is somewhat formal, you might be going for a more sedate entrance. Make sure to communicate your wishes directly to the bridal party. You don’t want to start your reception off on a bad foot by having an entrance that you don’t like. You might send an email describing the entrance you want. You could say, “I know lots of entrances include fun dances, but my wedding is going to be more formal. I’d appreciate it if you could just walk sedately and smile.”"

      "content": "Double-check the details. The key to your big day going smoothly is careful planning. This doesn’t mean you have to run yourself ragged checking every little thing, but it’s a good idea to make sure you have the entrance planned exactly the way you want it. A few days before the wedding, make sure to: Give your MC the list of names and pronunciation guide. Ensure you are comfortable with your choice of music. Follow up with the bridal party members to make sure everyone knows the plan. If you are using a wedding coordinator, check to make sure they know your specifications."

      "title": "Choose your style.",
      "content": "Choose your style. Are you looking for a more unique entrance? Consider having a theme instead of just the traditional entrance. If your wedding has a theme, you could go with that. Or, you could create a separate theme for the entrance. [3] X Research source Maybe you are huge sports fans. Many fans of the University of Nebraska football team choose to enter to the team’s “Tunnel Walk.” If you are really into Hollywood glamour, you could make the entrance a red carpet style announcement and encourage people to snap lots of photos."

      "content": "Mix up the order of the party members’ entrance. Don’t feel like you have to be tied to the traditional wedding party entrance. This is your wedding reception, and you should feel free to do it however you like. Maybe you would like to enter first with your new spouse. Then you can join the guests in cheering on the wedding party. You could also choose to have the bridesmaids enter as a group, and then the groomsmen, instead of in pairs."

      "title": "Plan choreography.",
      "content": "Plan choreography. Some fun dance moves can help your bridal party’s entrance really stand out. Traditionally, members of the group walk in. Ask your party to learn a few easy steps to get the party going. For example, if you choose a song by Michael Jackson, ask the groomsmen to try to moonwalk. A song by Donna Summer might inspire you to teach the crew a few disco moves. Respect your wedding party. If your friends don’t feel comfortable learning complicated steps, don’t force the issue. You don’t want them (and the rest of your guests) to feel uncomfortable. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Have individualized entrances.",
      "content": "Have individualized entrances. Generally, each pair in the wedding party walks or dances in to the same song. Mix things up by changing the music for each pair or person. For example, let your Irish cousins lead the way by dancing an Irish jig. [5] X Research source You could also consider letting each person or pair choose their own music. This is a great way to allow your friends to express their individuality."
