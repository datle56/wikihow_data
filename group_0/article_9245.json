Check for the following connection ports: HDMI: HDMI ports are about 3/4 of an inch wide, with the top part of the port being slightly bigger than the bottom. Most newer flatscreen and HDTVs and many newer laptops and desktop computers support HDMI. DisplayPort: DisplayPort is mostly used on Macs and some PCs. They have a small rectangular port that is cut at the bottom corners. These ports have an identical shape as the Thunderbolt ports, but they are NOT the same. Check the ports' labeling to ensure you are using the right port. DVI: A DVI port has a white connection with 24 square holes. These are also used in most older computer models. VGA: VGA cables are rectangular ports with 15 pins. These are most commonly used on older computers. They are supported by some TVs and computers. USB: If your computer has no video output ports, you can purchase an adapter that can convert a USB port into an HDMI out port on your computer. This may require you to install additional software on your computer. [1] X Research source"
