      "title": "Purchase fresh broccoli.",
      "content": "Purchase fresh broccoli. Look for broccoli that is uniformly green, without a lot of brown or yellow areas. Feel the stem and crown to make sure they are firm and not limp. Check that the florets are in a nice, tight bunch. [1] X Research source You can store raw broccoli in your refrigerator drawer for at least a week. However, its nutritional properties will begin to decline after three days."

      "title": "Clean the broccoli with vinegar and water.",
      "content": "Clean the broccoli with vinegar and water. Fill a spray bottle with three parts water to one part white vinegar. Spray the broccoli well. [2] X Research source Alternately, soak the broccoli in vinegar water before cooking it, which will also drive out any insects that may be in it. [3] X Research source Rinse the vegetables under cold tap water. You can wash produce with water alone, but using the diluted vinegar method first removes about 98% of surface bacteria. To make rinsing easier, place the broccoli in a colander inside of a clean sink basin. Use the spray setting on your faucet to rinse the vegetables."

      "title": "Cut the stalks away from the florets.",
      "content": "Cut the stalks away from the florets. Use a sharp knife to cut through the vegetable stem about two inches below the crown. Break the crown apart into big florets. Slice each floret’s trunk to get bite-sized chunks. Remove any damaged or wilted leaves. [4] X Research source If desired, save the stalks to add to stew, salad, or stir-fry. [5] X Research source You can leave the stalks on if your recipe calls for it. Just peel back and remove the outermost layer, which is tough to eat, with a knife or vegetable peeler."

    {
      "title": "Bring a pot of water to a boil.",
      "content": "Bring a pot of water to a boil. Pour enough water in a pot that it will completely submerge your broccoli. Add a sprinkle of salt to the water. Set the heat to high. [6] X Research source You can use regular table salt or sea salt. If you’re unsure whether you’ll have enough water in the pot to cover the broccoli, you can put the broccoli in the pot and cover it with water. Then take it back out and set it aside."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cook the stalks first.",
      "content": "Cook the stalks first. Wait until the water has reached a rolling boil. If you want to cook the stalks, add them to the pot. Cook them for two minutes. [7] X Research source Broccoli stalks take longer to cook then florets."

    {
      "title": "Add the florets.",
      "content": "Add the florets. Lower the florets gently into the boiling water with a slotted spoon. [8] X Research source Cook them in the pot with the stalks, if applicable, for four to five minutes. Don’t overcook them, or they will lose texture and taste. [9] X Research source The broccoli is done when it is tender enough to easily insert the tip of a knife."

      "title": "Cool the vegetables.",
      "content": "Cool the vegetables. Remove them with tongs or drain them with a heat-safe colander. Spread the broccoli on a baking sheet. Allow it to cool down at room temperature. If you believe you may have cooked the broccoli too long, you can place the baking sheet into your fridge to speed up the cooling process."

    {
      "title": "Boil water.",
      "content": "Boil water. Put a large pot of water over high heat. Add between a sprinkle and a tablespoon of salt to the water, if desired. [10] X Research source Allow the pot of water to come to a boil. Adding salt is optional. The advantage is that it will enhance the broccoli’s flavor. The disadvantage is that, over time, the sodium will cause the broccoli to be mushier."
