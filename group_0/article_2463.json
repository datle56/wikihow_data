      "content": "Select and obtain tree bark. White oak gives the leather a yellowish shade while chestnut oak turns hides a dark brown. Hemlock bark will give the leather a dark reddish-brown color. Decide on what kind of finish you want for your hide and then visit a saw mill or pull off the bark from trees on your own property. [2] X Research source Fresh bark is the best type to use for the solution. You’ll need 30-40 lbs of bark for the solution. [3] X Research source Bark is best extracted during the spring."

    {
      "title": "Grind up the bark.",
      "content": "Grind up the bark. Use a wood shredder or chipper to grind up the bark until the bark is chipped to the size of corn kernels. You can rent a wood chipper from a hardware store if you don’t want to purchase one. [4] X Research source You can also manually break up the bark using a shovel, though this method will take much longer."

      "content": "Pour 20 gallons (75.7 liters) of boiling water into a plastic container. Get a large plastic bin or container and pour boiling water into it. You’ll most likely have to boil the water in batches and add it in small increments. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Let the solution sit for 15-20 days.",
      "content": "Let the solution sit for 15-20 days. As the bark sits in the solution, the tannin will transfer to the water and will create a concentrated bark liquor."

Move the dull blade over the surface of the flesh carefully, making sure not to tear or rip the hide. Continue to work over the hide in sections until it is free of traces of flesh. [6] X Research source Scraping the flesh is a time intensive process so work in one-hour sessions. If you don’t own a fleshing knife, you can use a butter knife."

Sprinkle a handful of salt or 100% sodium chloride over the surface of the hide. This will help preserve it. [7] X Research source Do not sprinkle rock salt on the hide."
