      "title": "Locate the flaps at the top of the box.",
      "content": "Locate the flaps at the top of the box. To find the top of the box, look for the flaps that are connected by small cardboard tabs. Only the flaps at the top of the box will have these tabs. You can also look for letters or arrows on the box that indicate which side is the top."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the top flaps down on both sides.",
      "content": "Fold the top flaps down on both sides. Keep the box flat when you fold down the flaps. The box should still lay flat after you fold the flaps down."
    },
    {
      "title": "Open up the box so it’s no longer flat.",
      "content": "Open up the box so it’s no longer flat. To open up the box, pull the corners on opposite sides of the flattened box away from each other. When you’re finished, the box should be square. The top flaps should still be folded down after you open the box. The cardboard tabs connecting the flaps will lock them in place. If your box doesn't have lock tabs, just fold the top flaps down so they're not in your way."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn the box upside down.",
      "content": "Turn the box upside down. Now the folded-down flaps at the top of the box should be near the floor. The 4 bottom flaps should be pointing up at you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the bottom flaps down over each other.",
      "content": "Fold the bottom flaps down over each other. Fold the shorter flaps down first, and then the longer flaps. When all of the bottom flaps are folded down, you shouldn’t be able to see into the box anymore. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Run a piece of packaging tape down the seam between the bottom flaps.",
      "content": "Run a piece of packaging tape down the seam between the bottom flaps. Avoid using other kinds of tape, like masking or cellophane tape, that are less secure than packaging tape. Have the ends of the tape go 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) up the sides of the box. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Run another piece of tape along each side of the first piece.",
      "content": "Run another piece of tape along each side of the first piece. Overlap the second and third pieces of tape over the first piece of tape. The extra tape doesn't need to cover the seam between the bottom flaps — it's just there to make the bottom of the box extra secure. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn the box back over.",
      "content": "Turn the box back over. The open end of the box should be at the top, and the taped end should be at the bottom. Now that the box is open and taped together, it’s ready for packing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pack your things in the box",
      "content": "Pack your things in the box . Check the bottom or side of the box for a weight limit and make sure your belongings don’t exceed it. When you’re finished, there shouldn’t be anything sticking out over the top rim of the box, or you won’t be able to close it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the tabs on the top flaps with a utility knife.",
      "content": "Cut the tabs on the top flaps with a utility knife. Cutting the tabs will free the flaps so you can fold them and close the box. Carefully cut down the center of the tabs until the flaps are no longer attached to each other. If the flaps don't have tabs, you can skip this step."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the top flaps down over each other.",
      "content": "Fold the top flaps down over each other. Fold the flaps just like you did with the flaps on the bottom of the box — short flaps first, then the long flaps. When you're done, the box should be closed with nothing sticking out of it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tape the top of the box closed like you did on the bottom.",
      "content": "Tape the top of the box closed like you did on the bottom. First, run a piece of packaging tape down the seam between the top flaps so the ends go down the sides of the box. Then, run another piece of tape along each side of the first piece to make the box more secure."

    {
      "title": "Label the moving box.",
      "content": "Label the moving box. If this isn't the only box you'll be packing, number it so you can keep track of how many boxes you have. Then, write the name of the room you'll be unpacking it in after the move, like \"kitchen\" or \"master bedroom.\" If there's anything fragile in the box, like glass or ceramics, write \"fragile\" on the outside.
