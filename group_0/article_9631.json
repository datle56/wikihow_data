      "content": "Understand why this works. In the \"base two\" binary system, n binary digits can be used to represent 2 n different numbers. For example, with four binary digits, you can represent 2 4 = 16 different numbers. Since hexadecimal is a base sixteen system, a one digit number can be used to represent 16 1 = 16 different numbers. This makes conversion between the two systems extremely easy. You can also think of this as the counting systems \"flipping over\" to another digit at the same time. Hexadecimal counts \"...D, E, F, 10 \" at the same time binary counts \"1101, 1110, 1111, 10000 \"."

You use decimal notation every day without having to stop and think about the meaning, but when you first learned it, your parent or teacher might have explained it to you in more detail. A quick review of how ordinary numbers are written will help you convert the number: [3] X Research source Each digit in a decimal number is in a certain \"place.\" Moving from right to left, there's the \"ones place,\" \"tens place,\" \"hundreds place,\" and so on. The digit 3 just means 3 if it's in the ones place, but it represents 30 when located in the tens place, and 300 in the hundreds place. To put it mathematically, the \"places\" represent 10 0 , 10 1 , 10 2 , and so on. This is why this system is called \"base ten,\" or \"decimal\" after the Latin word for \"tenth.\""

Let's rewrite the number 480,137 10 . (Remember, the subscript 10 tells us the number is written in base ten.): [4] X Research source Starting with the rightmost digit, 7 = 7 x 10 0 , or 7 x 1 Moving left, 3 = 3 x 10 1 , or 3 x 10 Repeating for all digits, we get 480,137 = 4 x100,000 + 8 x10,000 + 0 x1,000 + 1 x100 + 3 x10 + 7 x1."

To convert to decimal, multiply each place value by the corresponding power of sixteen. Start this process by writing the powers of sixteen next to the digits of a hexadecimal number. We'll do this for the hexadecimal number C921 16 . Start on the right with 16 0 , and increase the exponent each time you move left to the next digit: [5] X Research source 1 16 = 1 x 16 0 = 1 x 1 (All numbers are in decimal except where noted.) 2 16 = 2 x 16 1 = 2 x 16 9 16 = 9 x 16 2 = 9 x 256 C = C x 16 3 = C x 4096"
