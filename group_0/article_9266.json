      "content": "Check the outputs on the back of the keyboard. Some MIDI controller keyboards have MIDI out ports, which are round, with a notch at the top and five pinholes along the bottom. Many newer models can also do MIDI over USB, which means you won't need a MIDI cable to connect it to your computer–just a USB cable that can transmit data."

      "title": "Get an audio interface if needed.",
      "content": "Get an audio interface if needed. If your keyboard has a USB output, you don't need an audio interface to connect your MIDI keyboard. However, if your keyboard only has a MIDI output, you will need an audio interface with MIDI inputs. You can purchase a stand-alone MIDI audio interface or an interface with multiple inputs. If you're looking for a standard audio interface that's easy to find, not super spendy, and officially supported by Pro Tools, consider a Focusrite Scarlett interface, such as the Scarlett Solo. Avid also offers some professional audio interfaces that work with the latest versions of Pro Tools. [1] X Research source It's a good idea to get an audio interface even if your keyboard has a USB output. An audio interface can allow you to connect microphones, guitars, and other instruments to your computer as well as a keyboard, and many also have more capable sound cards than what is in your computer. If you don't have an AVID audio interface, install your audio interface's software and drivers. If you don't, you will run into problems using your MIDI keyboard in Pro Tools. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Connect the MIDI keyboard to your computer.",
      "content": "Connect the MIDI keyboard to your computer. If you are using the MIDI out port on your keyboard, connect a MIDI cable to the \"MIDI Out\" port on your keyboard and the other end to the MIDI input on your audio interface. Then, connect the square-shaped end of a USB cable to the USB port of your audio interface and the standard USB end to a USB port on your PC or Mac. If your MIDI keyboard has a USB port, you can connect a USB cable directly from your keyboard to your computer. Alternatively, if your keyboard also has built-in sounds, you can connect it to your audio interface using its audio-out ports, which may be RCA, USB, or even a standard instrument cable port. Using this method, you will need to treat your keyboard as an audio instrument instead of a MIDI instrument."

For example, to map buttons to functions in Pro Tools, you may need your keyboard's software. Windows or macOS will automatically scan for the drivers when you connect the keyboard to your computer. On some keyboard models, you may need to install the drivers using the install disk that came with the keyboard or by downloading the drivers from the manufacturer's website and installing them."
