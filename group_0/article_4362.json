      "content": "Understand how booting from a USB works. By default, your computer starts up by reading the operating system information from its built-in hard drive. You can change this by telling it to prioritize plugged-in USB items over the built-in hard drive. The settings for your computers boot behavior are in a menu called the BIOS, which is a pre-startup menu you can access by pressing a key specific to your computer model as your computer turns on. In order to boot from a USB flash drive, the flash drive must be set up as a bootable item, and it must have a disk image (ISO) file with an operating system or similar service installed on it."

      "content": "Determine your computer's BIOS key. The key that you press to access the BIOS varies depending on your computer manufacturer and model. You can look up your computer's BIOS key by typing your computer's manufacturer and model name, along with \"bios key\", into a search engine and reviewing the results, or you can consult your computer's manual if you still have it. Most computers use one of the function keys (e.g., F12 ) as the BIOS key, though some computers will use the Esc key or the Del key."

For example, if you're attempting to install or use Ubuntu Linux from the flash drive, you would paste the Ubuntu ISO file into the flash drive's window. Skip this step if you created a bootable USB using the Windows 7 or 10 installation tool."
