      "title": "Cook the noodles in boiling water.",
      "content": "Cook the noodles in boiling water. Make sure you keep the entire lasagna noodle from breaking, as you will need unbroken sheets when you layer the dish later. Add a pinch of salt to the pot right before you add the noodles and let them cook according to the time on the box, usually 10-12 minutes. Stir occasionally, every 1-2 minutes. When they are done, drain the water and set aside the noodles to cool. [1] X Research source You will likely need you biggest pot, filled 2/3 with water, to fit the noodles. As you wait for the water to boil and noodles to cook you can move on to making the filling, however. Put your cooked noodles onto a glass dish with olive oil drizzled on the bottom and between layers. This way they won't stick and will be ready when you are ready to layer them. Some companies sell \"Oven Ready\" noodles that don't need to be boiled, so be sure to read the box to check. You may opt for this kind of noodles to simplify making your lasagna. In this case fresh pasta will cook right in the lasagna baking process."

      "content": "Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large pan on medium heat. Do not move on until the oil is shimmering. This means it is hot, and adding ingredients too soon can lead to soggy, oily food."

      "content": "Add a diced medium white onion and 2 cloves of chopped garlic and cook for 2-3 minutes until they start becoming translucent. Translucent simply means that the edges of the onions have begun to turn clear. You do not need the onions to be fully cooked just yet. Looking to get more vegetables in your lasagna? Add 1/2 cup chopped carrots, celery and/or green peppers here as well for a heartier sauce. If you do, allow the vegetables to cook and extra 1-2 minutes."

      "title": "Add the 1lb of ground meat to the pan and cook until browned.",
      "content": "Add the 1lb of ground meat to the pan and cook until browned. Mix the meat in with the onions and garlic, stirring well, and cook on medium heat until completely browned. Add salt and crushed black pepper, to taste, as it cooks. If you have time, cook the meat in a separate pan, though this is not necessary. If you are using sausage, cut the casings off so you only have the ground meat inside. You can also take this time to add 1 ⁄ 2 tablespoon (7.4 ml) dried oregano, basil, or rosemary, or simply 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of dried Italian seasoning."

      "content": "Transfer the meat and vegetables to a large sauce pot on medium-low heat. The pot needs to be big enough to hold your sauce and tomatoes as well. This is a good time to check on your noodles if you've forgotten them. They should be pliable and soft, but still firm."

      "content": "Add the sauce and tomatoes to the saucepot and bring to a simmer. Pour your 28 ounces of sauce, 12 ounces of crushed tomatoes and 6 oz of tomato paste to the meat and vegetable mixture and stir well. Raise the heat to medium until the sauce comes to a low simmer, when occasional bubbles break the surface of the sauce. You can substitute 36 ounces of pre-made pasta sauce instead of the three different tomato products for a simpler sauce. Take this time to add any additional spices you want, such as garlic powder, sugar, or more seasoning, 1 teaspoon at a time. Many cooks like sugar to balance out the natural acidity of the tomatoes. Lower the heat if it is bubbling too much, you only want a low simmer."

      "content": "Cook the sauce on a low simmer for 10-15 minutes. The longer the sauce has to cook, the richer it will be. Stir it regularly, being sure to get down to the bottom so that nothing burns. When you're ready to build the lasagna, remove the sauce from heat and let it cool gently. The sauce does not have to be cold to move forward, but letting it cool slightly will make it easier to handle."

      "content": "Bake for 30-40 minutes at 375℉, covered with aluminum foil. Put a layer of aluminum over the lasagna before it goes into the oven. To prevent the sauce from spilling over the edge as it heats up, you can also place the entire dish on a baking tray to keep the sauce from getting on your oven. [ citation needed ] Since the dish is technically already cooked, putting it in the oven is meant to melt the cheese and let the flavors meld deliciously. That said, you can take it out when you feel like it is hot and ready to serve. Remove the foil for the last 5 minutes to brown and bubble the cheese on top. [3] X Research source"

This can be a great substitute for meat, but vegetables can also become fantastic complements to a meat sauce as well. Cook the vegetables in the oil for 5-7 minutes, until tender, along with the onions and garlic, then proceed to make the sauce like usual. If you are using it along with meat, cut the following amounts in half and cook the vegetables separately, then add to the sauce with the meat. 1 large eggplant, diced. 1 large zucchini, sliced. 1 lb small white mushrooms, sliced."

This ingenious, low-carb recipe is not layered exactly the same way, but that doesn't make it any less delicious. To make it: Cut the squash in half and remove the seeds. Cook the squash in a baking dish, cut-side down, for 45-60 minutes (450℉) or until easily pierced with a fork. Pour roughly an inch of water into the pan to prevent them from drying out. Fill each squash half with layers, starting with 1-2 dollops of ricotta, then sauce and mozzarella. Repeat until full. Cook the mini lasagnas for 20 minutes in the oven (450℉), until the cheese is melted on top of the squash."

The principles are all the same as Italian lasagna, but you can get a totally different dish with some simple swaps: Tomato Sauce → Taco Sauce Ricotta/Mozzarella → Queso Fresco/Cheddar Noodles → Corn Tortillas Italian seasoning → Ground Cumin, cayenne, red pepper, onion powder Add 1 can of black beans and 1 can of yellow corn to sauce mixture."
