[1] X Trustworthy Source Association of American Medical Colleges Nonprofit organization repsonsible for the administration of the MCAT and for facilitating the medical school applications process Go to source This is the first step on the road to becoming a doctor. Classes like biology, physics, and chemistry will prepare you for the type of coursework you will be studying in medical school. How you perform in these types of courses will be a good indicator of whether medicine is the right field for you. If you do not like or struggle with science, consider finding a private tutor to help you. Some universities offer extra help services to their students so take advantage if one is available for you. If you hate science, you may want to reconsider becoming a pediatrician. If you are still having trouble even with the help of a tutor, consider becoming a pediatric nurse. Unlike doctors, nurses do not need to take the MCAT (which is a very difficult test) or Physics, but should ideally have a strong background in biology and chemistry. Knowing basic math is essential. It also provides flexibility in time and money because it only requires two years to complete compared to the traditional four years of medical school. Getting good grades in high school will be important when it comes to applying to a four-year university. The grades you receive during your sophomore and junior years are important. Be sure to complete assignments on time, study for tests and quizzes, and keep up with reading assignments."

      "content": "Graduate from a four-year university. You should apply to several universities and choose the most prestigious one, as this will increase your chances of getting into medical school. [2] X Research source Most students who pursue medicine choose pre-med majors like Biology or Chemistry, but you don't necessarily have to graduate with a Bachelor of Sciences (BS). Students who graduate in social sciences and humanities can also be accepted to medical school. Even if you don't graduate in sciences, you may need to complete certain requirements in chemistry, physics, general biology, and calculus. The specific requirements will vary between schools, so check around with the various medical schools you plan on applying to. Increase your chances of being accepted to a top medical school by volunteering or working in an environment that deals with public health. Volunteer at a hospital or nursing home, or find a job working in a pharmacy. [3] X Research source"

Once you have graduated from medical school, you will need to complete a three-year pediatric training program at a hospital before you can start your own practice. [8] X Research source During this time, you will be given hands-on training and develop your skills in treating and dealing with sick patients. Over the course of the three years, you will be given an increasing amount of responsibilities and learn how to properly interact with patients. [9] X Research source The training program must be accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) or the American Osteopathic Association (AOA). Residencies are the most challenging part of becoming a doctor. You will be working very long hours (80â€“100 hours per week) and will be paid a minimum wage. [10] X Research source Expect to devote all of your time to completing your residency; you will have very little time to spend with friends and family."

You will need to receive and maintain a certification to practice pediatric medicine by the American Board of Pediatrics (ABP) or the American Osteopathic Board of Pediatrics (AOBP). There is a limit of seven years that can pass between the time you finish your pediatric training and become board certified. Certifications expire on December 31 of the specified year of expiration, and doctors will have to renew their certifications to continue practicing."

      "content": "Be prepared for the physical and emotional challenges involved. Pediatricians work with both healthy children and sick children whose illnesses will vary in their severity, and may meet patients who do not survive their illnesses. Parents of sick children may be extremely emotional and touchy, so it is important to be empathetic, patient, and have strong communication skills. Physicians usually work long hours and have limited time to spend with friends and family. They also experience a great deal of stress when it comes to both time-management and the prospect of losing patients."

      "content": "Know what to expect in medical school. Many students feel overwhelmed and discouraged by the heavy workload and breadth of study in medical school. The best way to prepare for medical school is to have a thorough understanding of the basic subjects, which include anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry, among others. Be prepared to spend a majority of your time either in school or studying. Take advantage of the months before medical school starts to travel and spend time with loved ones, as your free time will be very limited once the program begins."

      "content": "Start early. It is important that you fully apply yourself in all levels of your education, from high school through medical school. Getting good grades early on in life will increase your likelihood of being accepted to a reputable university, medical school, and residency program. More importantly, being able to grasp the basic subjects early on in life will build a foundation that will help you throughout your education and work as a doctor."

      "content": "Determine whether you enjoy working with children. Pediatricians should love children and feel comfortable working with them. Remember that your patients are children (from newborns to 17 years of age). Treating younger patients requires more patience and intuition as a doctor, as patients may be uncooperative or unable to speak for themselves (especially infants). You will also have to ask teenagers if they are having sex, smoking cigarettes or cannabis, vaping, or drinking alcohol because these are very common among high school students. Teens are in the process of becoming adults both physically and mentally making them more susceptible to mental health issues like depression and OCD, which do not happen in prepubescents (younger children). Make sure you take time to listen to parents and children when they explain how they're feeling rather than rushing through consultations.
