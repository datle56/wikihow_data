Put the child at ease by showing them you're friendly. Smile at the child, keep your arms open, and angle your body toward them. When you need to talk to them directly, try to get down on their level.

Show them the present right away so they warm up to you. [2] X Research source For example, you might bring something like a slinky, a mini box of legos, an inexpensive doll, a container of Play Dough, a coloring book, or a piece of candy. Check with the child’s parent before you give them a gift or candy to make sure it’s okay."

Little kids are excited about the world around them, so they’ll want to show you things like butterflies, leaves, or a new toy. Always display excitement and wonder when a child engages with you.

What do you think the cloud looks like?” If the child hands you a leaf, you could say, “Thanks, buddy! This is a cool leaf!” If they have a new toy, you might say, “What does this toy do?” or “Are you having fun playing with it?”"

On your first meeting, introduce yourself to them and offer a high-five or handshake to show you respect their boundaries. Then, ask their permission before touching them, giving them a hug, or picking them up. [4] X Research source You might ask, “Is it okay if I help you with your shoes?” “Can I help you with your coat?” or \"Do you want a hug?\" If the child doesn't want you to touch them, keep smiling at them and tell them it's okay.

When you’re first meeting a child, stick to handshakes, high fives, and fist bumps. Once you establish a relationship with them, they might feel ready to give you hugs. If you’re in a caregiving role, they may eventually like to cuddle while you’re reading or watching TV together. Follow the child’s lead when showing affection.

Go to source Little kids are very cute, so it's totally understandable that you want to hug them or pick them up. However, this can be scary to the child if they aren't used to you yet.

You likely have a lot on your mind, but try not to let that stop you from being fully present during playtime.

[6] X Research source If you’re babysitting the child, you might spend all of the time you’re with them playing. If you’re a parent, caregiver, or other adult, you might designate a set period of time for play.

Then, come up with your gadgets and super powers. Pretend you’re doing things like fighting bad guys or flying around. Build the ultimate fort. Use blankets, pillows, sheets and cushions to make a soft, cozy and safe fort. Have the kids suggest what shape or style of fort they'd like.

[12] X Research source Don’t worry as much about the rules while you’re playing the game with the child. You might gently remind them of rules when they break them, but try to just have fun. If you’re outdoors, try playing tag, drawing with chalk, or kicking a ball around. Make chores and clean-up a fun game to play. For example, you may say, “I bet you can’t clean up all of your toys in 1 minute.” Make up your own card game. With the help of the child or children, assign an activity to each suit, like hearts as jumping jacks and diamonds as making funny faces. Upon each draw of a card from the pack, the child has to perform the fun task the card requires. For example, if you draw the 6 of hearts, you must do 6 jumping jacks!"

It’s okay to shift your eyes away for a few seconds at a time. Consider getting down on the child’s level to make it easier to make eye contact.

[14] X Research source It's okay to use silly voices and baby talk to entertain the child during play. Very young children may like baby talk. Pay attention to how other adults talk to the child to see if baby talk may work with them. Not only will this show the child you respect them, it might also help their verbal skills."

[15] X Research source You might ask questions like, “What’s your favorite part of Frozen?” “What are you building with your blocks?” or “What did you find on your walk today?” Raise the pitch of your voice when you reach the end of a question so the child recognizes when it’s time to respond. Don’t pepper the child with questions because they might get overwhelmed. Instead, stick to a few specific questions you think they can answer."

However, it’s important to stay excited and nod along so the child knows you care about them. They’re sharing something important with you, so smile, nod, and give interested responses, like “Wow,” or “Cool!” [16] X Research source Try not to interrupt the child while they’re talking. It’s okay to make little comments like, “That must be exciting” or “What happened next?” to show you’re following along. Don’t use your phone while you’re listening to the child.

Be generous with praise so the child feels encouraged and loved. Look for opportunities to dish out a compliment. [17] X Research source Give them compliments like, “Wow! Great job stacking your blocks!” “Good job coloring!” or “Great job putting your toys up!” Even if the child did something you don’t want them to do, you can still praise them as long as you give them a warning, too. For example, you could say, “I love that you practiced drawing, but let’s try it on paper instead of the wall this time.”"
