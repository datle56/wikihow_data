      "title": "This is a perfect way to ask if you have a class together.",
      "content": "This is a perfect way to ask if you have a class together. After class ends, go up to her desk and see if she wants to cram for the upcoming final together. Make it fun by offering to bring over snacks and soda. This is a good way to establish some common ground between the two of you, which makes asking to hang out at her house a lot easier. You both want to ace this test, right? Say something like, \"That final is gonna be a doozy. Want to study at your place tomorrow? I'll bring the snacks!\" Alternatively, text her when you're both home from school. Try texting, \"Hey I just got my grade back on that quiz. I think I need a study buddy. Wanna study at your place later this week?\""

      "content": "This is a casual, friendly way to suggest hanging out at her house. Maybe the other day she mentioned that she's never seen the Star Wars trilogy. Volunteer to bring over your box set and a pizza so you can have a fun movie night. Pick a movie that you want to show her, or alternatively, see if she has any suggestions. Try, \"You've never seen Jaws? We've gotta change that! Want to watch it at your place this Friday?\" You can also say something like, \"I've never seen Spirited Away. You said it's your favorite movie, right? Maybe we can watch it at your place this weekend!\""

      "content": "This is a fun activity and a great excuse to hang out at her place. If you enjoy playing board games and she's never played your favorite game, ask if you could bring it over to her house so you can both play. Maybe you both really like board games. Offer to plan a board game night at her house where you play a few rounds of all of your favorite games. You can even make this a group hangout to accommodate whichever board game you choose. If you really want it to be one-on-one, though, choose a game that works for 2 players (or bring a deck of cards)."

      "title": "Hinge the ask on something to do with her interests.",
      "content": "Hinge the ask on something to do with her interests. Let's say her favorite band is Green Day and you've got a DVD of one of their concerts. Offer to bring it over so you can watch it. Maybe she loves playing video games. Tell her you just bought a new game and would love to come over and play it with her. Bringing up something you know she's into will probably increase the likelihood of her saying yes, and it will make you feel more comfortable asking. Maybe you're reading The Great Gatsby in class and she mentioned she really likes the book so far. Say, \"I've heard the movie version is pretty cool, too. Wanna watch it at your place this weekend?\""

      "content": "This method takes courage but it's definitely worth it. [1] X Research source If you're nervous, focus on your body language. This can help trick your mind into feeling more confident. Hold your head high and keep your shoulders back. When you walk up to her to ask, make direct eye contact. It'll show her that you're secure and sure of yourself, no matter how she responds. These are very attractive traits.

Go to source Most likely, she'll be happy to hang out with you. If you're asking her to hang out after class, make eye contact with her and walk up to her confidently. Then, simply ask her. Say something like, \"Hey Maria, want to study at your place tonight?\""

      "content": "This is a good option if you're nervous to ask in person. It's also a great choice if you don't run into her often at school. Make sure you've got her number (or message her on social media sites like Instagram or Snapchat), and ask like you would in person. Try to think of an activity that would make sense to do at her house (studying, watching a movie, playing video games, etc.) and draft out the perfect ask before sending your text. [3] X Research source Keep your text brief. You don't need to write her a novel to ask her to watch a movie! Just make sure you include all the necessary details. Text her, \"Hey Kara, I just rented Point Break. Wanna watch it at your house this Friday? I'd be down to order some pizza, too.\""

      "title": "Send her a funny GIF or meme to break the ice.",
      "content": "Send her a funny GIF or meme to break the ice. Humor is a great way to help you both relax, and it can also be really charming. Maybe you were joking together about an old episode of Spongebob Squarepants the other day. Send her a funny GIF of Spongebob crying with the caption, \"This'll be me if you can't hang out this Tuesday.\" Don't be afraid to be a little goofy. If she's already crushing on you, she'll probably find it really endearing. [4] X Research source Make sure your humor's coming from a positive place. Try not to make fun of anyone else or overdo it on the sarcasm. This won't come across well over text, and it could potentially offend her."

      "content": "Do this to ensure the hangout really happens. Vague statements like, \"We should hang out sometime\" leave too many questions unanswered. Pick a time and a date and include both when you ask her to hang out. This will communicate that you really want to make this happen.

      "title": "If you want this hangout to be a date, tell her that.",
      "content": "If you want this hangout to be a date, tell her that. Asking someone to hang out can be a little vague, and it usually implies more casual or platonic intentions than asking someone out on a date. If you just want to be platonic friends go ahead and just say hang out. Consider asking some other friends to come along if you really want to make your platonic intentions clear. If you're not sure if you like-like her or just want to be friends, that's totally okay. Many relationships start as friendships first. There's no harm in just getting to know each other and being friends for now."

      "content": "If you really enjoy your time, mention hanging out again as you leave. This shows the girl that you're interested in really becoming friends and spending more time together. If you're romantically interested in her, it's also another way to show her you like her. Ask her to hang out at your house next time, or suggest another activity, like seeing a movie, going to the park, or getting some ice cream.

      "content": "Rejection is a part of building new relationships. Sometimes people aren't looking for new connections, or they simply aren't super compatible with you. Regardless, it's best not to take it personally. Remind yourself that plenty of girls will want to hang out with you in the future. Brush off the rejection as best you can, and keep putting yourself out there. It's also okay to feel a little sad. Let yourself feel your emotions so that you can take it as a learning experience and move forward.
