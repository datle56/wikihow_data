      "content": "Scrub stubborn gunk with a baking soda paste, if needed. Mix equal parts water and baking soda to form a paste. Dip a non-metallic brush or sponge into the paste, and gently dab it onto the sides and interior of the pan. [6] X Research source Allow the paste to sit for fifteen minutes. Rinse the pan thoroughly to remove the paste. Never use steel wool or any metallic sponge to scour your nonstick pan. Baking soda is abrasive, so don’t rub or scrub the pan with it.

      "content": "Protect your pan from heat. Coat your cold pan evenly with butter, oil or fat before switching on the heat. [9] X Research source Don’t use high heat for cooking with your nonstick pan. Use low or medium heat. [10] X Research source A coating of fat both protects and aids the nonstick surface of your pan.

Rub a teaspoon of oil on the inside of the pan with a paper towel. [16] X Research source Put the pan in an oven preheated at 300°F (149°C) for one hour. Once the pan has cooled, wipe off the oil with paper towels. [17] X Research source If your pan has a nonstick coating, it may wear off with use over time. Seasoning your pan can make it last longer. For example, you may want to completely season your pan semiannually. Rub it with a small amount of oil every time before you use it."
