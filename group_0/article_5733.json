      "content": "Yes, as long as the dress code is casual and they’re not the focal point. In general, wearing white to a wedding is strictly reserved for the bride, but shoes and accessories usually don't count for more casual weddings. Wearing white shoes to a wedding with a white tie, black tie, or formal dress code is strongly discouraged, but wearing white shoes to a casual wedding in a backyard, barn, or beach setting is considered appropriate. [1] X Research source Still, you’ll want to consider reaching out to the bride out of an abundance of respect just to make sure wearing white shoes is alright with her."

      "content": "Check the dress code. Although there’s different opinions when it comes to wearing any white article of clothing to a wedding, the general consensus is that white shoes should definitely be out of the question if the dress code is white tie, black tie, or formal. White tie is the most formal dress attire, outside of royalty or military regalia, with black tie and formal dress codes trailing close behind. [2] X Research source A white tie dress code typically requires an evening tailcoat, evening trousers, and a white formal evening bow tie for men, along with formal ballroom gowns for women. A black tie dress code consists of relatively modest, floor length gowns for women and high heels, along with tuxedos and bow ties for men. [3] X Research source A formal or black tie optional dress code gives you a little bit more flexibility. [4] X Research source Men can wear a dark suit in place of a tuxedo, and women can opt for a tea or cocktail-length dress as long as it remains modest. A casual dress code truly depends on the venue. White sandals or espadrilles may be most appropriate for a beach wedding, while white flats or heels may be better suited for a garden party setting."

      "content": "Consider the venue and theme. If the venue and theme are both pretty relaxed, then white shoes could be a perfectly acceptable way to complete your outfit. White, ivory, or cream-colored shoes are likely to fit the vibe of any backyard wedding, summertime beach wedding, or country-themed outdoor wedding. Make sure you double check the invitation or the couple’s wedding website for more information about the venue. If it seems super posh and upscale, reconsider the white shoes."

      "content": "Think about the weather and season. Wearing white shoes to a wedding may not be the best option for more reasons than one. White boots are perfect for fall and winter time, but they’re not exactly the ideal footwear for weddings in any case. White sandals and heels are most appropriate for weddings, but they’re also usually worn in spring and summer, so selecting another shade of neutral for a November or December wedding is best. [5] X Research source Beige, taupe, or metallic colors are the way to go for fall or winter weddings."

      "content": "Factor in your relationship with the bride. Maybe the bride is your childhood best friend and you’re so close that she wouldn’t care whether you wore white shoes, green shoes, or no shoes, as long as you showed up. Or, maybe, you’re the plus one of the bride’s third cousin and have never met her before. [6] X Research source If it’s the latter, you want to approach with the utmost caution so as to not offend the bride, which probably includes not pushing the envelope by wearing white shoes. Remember: it’s always a good idea to check in with the bride if you have any questions about what to wear."

Of course, this could be a tough ask if you’re wearing a black cocktail-length dress and your white patent leather pumps draw everyone’s attention towards them. On the other hand, if you’re wearing a floor-length gown and your white shoes are barely peeking through, it’s totally okay to wear them. [7] X Research source Longer garments or dresses with prints won’t highlight your white shoes as much as shorter garments. If you do want your shoes to be the most eye-grabbing part of your look, consider wearing colorful shoes instead, since these won’t result in any fashion faux pas."

      "content": "Reflect on cultural and religious customs. Not all weddings are alike, especially when it comes honoring unique cultural and religious customs. For example, when attending an Indian wedding, which can go on for several days, guests are encouraged to wear yellow during a part of the ceremony called Haldi, to reflect the turmeric that is traditionally applied to the skin of the bride and groom. [8] X Research source Some of these customs could extend over to footwear, so be sure to check in with the couple for clarification should you need it."

Instead, she suggests picking out a color that makes sense for the venue, season, and time of day. Yellow and blue are excellent for spring daytime weddings, while pink and orange match the aesthetic of a tropical summer destination wedding at sunset. Darker colors, like hunter green and burgundy, should be reserved for more formal, indoor weddings that take place in fall or winter. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid looking like a bridesmaid. Although it’s not a crime to dress like a bridesmaid, it’s probably not what the bride would want, as bridal parties typically consist of the bride’s closest and dearest family and friends. It can also give the impression that you wanted to be a bridesmaid and are insulted that you weren’t asked, which is not a good look. To avoid confusion, consider reaching out to the bride or the bridesmaids for guidance on what they’re wearing and, in turn, what you should not. [10] X Research source"

Papageorge suggests researching the venue ahead of time, not only to determine the vibe, but also to asses environmental concerns. “People are getting very creative with where their ceremonies are now,” she warns. “You might be on the side of a cliff, in a horse pasture— you just never know anymore.” She advises that ladies have a backup pair of comfortable shoes in the car and to bring a jacket or a coat in case the temperature cools down at night. Additionally, she offers a tip for male guests: “I've actually had two groomsmen split their pants, so be careful when you're renting pants.”"

      "content": "No, you shouldn’t otherwise wear white to a wedding. Although white shoes and accessories are acceptable in some situations, particularly if the wedding has a casual dress code— that’s where it should end. In Western Cultures, wearing white has traditionally been reserved for the bride, since Queen Victoria popularized the custom during her own wedding to Prince Albert in 1840. [11] X Research source ​​ Unless specifically instructed to do so, wearing white to a wedding is considered hugely offensive to the bride and the couple in general, and is considered a major social blunder. Papageorge offers some simple, straightforward advice when it comes to wearing lighter colors as a wedding guest. She says, “Don't wear white. And stay away from blush, because that's going to be too light that in a flash is going to look white.” If your dress is a solid color with a white print, this may be acceptable. However, it’s best to discuss this with the bride ahead of time."
