[2] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Add milk to your protein shake for a carb boost — use 2% or skim milk for low-fat options. Experiment with blending fresh fruit into your shake for added carbs and sweetness. Be creative — you can use strawberries, bananas, raspberries, blackberries, peaches, pineapple, mango, and many more. Blueberries and açaí also contain antioxidants, which are good for your body because they fight free radicals.

[4] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Vegetables, grains, and legumes like beans and peas are good fresh sources of starch. Whey protein is the most common choice for bulking up a shake with starch. You can get whey protein at many health food stores. On top of that, add some starchy vegetables like sweet peas, pumpkin, squash, or yams — it will add texture and flavor, as well. It may seem strange to add vegetables to your shake, but it can result in some tasty and nutritious outcomes. Use fresh veggies, not frozen or dried."

      "content": "Start your protein shake with a good base. Use a quality whey protein or other protein additive. Verify that your protein additive has all essential amino acids. Amino acids help your body maintain blood and organ functions. They also help boost your metabolism. Ensure that your protein has low levels of cholesterol, which is not a necessary addition to healthy protein options. Determine if the additive contains natural proteins. Artificially produced proteins aren't as effective in building muscles as natural proteins. This should be apparent on the label — if not, ask a sales representative."

      "content": "Try carb supplements. Although it's best to snack on fruits, veggies, and whole grains to get carbs, you can also add carbohydrate supplements to a shake before, during, or after your workout. These “high glycemic” carbs — dextrose, glucose, and maltodextrin — require little digestion and give you a quick blood sugar spike. This helps your body absorb protein and repair muscle better. Waxy maize is another complex carb supplement that helps your body refuel by replenishing its sugar stores (called glycogen )."
