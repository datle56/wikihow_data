      "content": "Turn 35 years old. When the original writers of the constitution were thinking of requirements, they wanted a president who would be wise and mature. The age requirement for the President of the United States is higher than any other political office, and it encourages people who have experience in government to apply. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source The average age of a sitting President is 55 years old."

      "content": "Live in the United States for at least 14 consecutive years. This means that you have to have lived on US soil for the past 14 years of your life, or longer. You can prove that you’ve lived in an area by showing your current passport or your birth certificate. [3] X Trustworthy Source USA.GOV Official website for the United States federal government Go to source [4] X Research source This is again to avoid foreign influence and to ensure that you’re up to date with politics in America."

      "title": "Prove you are a natural born American Citizen.",
      "content": "Prove you are a natural born American Citizen. Your birth certificate shows when and where you were born, so you’ll need that to get the process started. This is a requirement to avoid foreign influence, no matter how small it is. If you were born overseas, you can be counted as an American citizen if one or both of your parents was American at the time of your birth. [5] X Trustworthy Source USA.GOV Official website for the United States federal government Go to source [6] X Research source If you can’t find your birth certificate or you need a new one, you can request it from your state’s Vital Records office. As long as you’re a natural born American citizen, your gender, religion, and culture have no bearing on whether or not you can be the President."

      "title": "Get plenty of education.",
      "content": "Get plenty of education. While there are no educational requirements or experience necessary per se, most presidents have had advanced degrees and studied Law or Business before entering Politics. You're best off taking classes in History, Sociology, Law, Economics, and International Relations. [7] X Research source 31 presidents have had some sort of military experience, but that number is highly skewed to the past—it's not as common as it once used to be. So while joining the military is an option, it's not a necessity."

      "title": "Pick a political party.",
      "content": "Pick a political party. Every president runs on the platform of their political party, and you’ll need to take a hard stance on which one you support through your work and career. While you do have the option to switch up your party at any time, you should start researching policies and deciding which ones seem the best to you as soon as possible. When you register to vote, put down your political party to show your support for it. [8] X Research source The main 2 parties are Democrat and Republican, but there are also smaller parties, like the Libertarian Party and the Green Party that are smaller and more specific."

      "title": "Seek out a politically-related career.",
      "content": "Seek out a politically-related career. Though this isn't written in the books, generally presidential hopefuls start in the political arena on a much smaller scale. So get involved in your community! Run for mayor , governor , senator, or some other representative of your state. It's the best way to get your name out there. You don't have to do this. You could be some type of community organizer, lawyer, or activist, too. It's just that getting your name in the ring, getting to know people, and getting people to know you is the simplest way to getting your name on the big ticket at the end of it all."

      "title": "Volunteer within your community.",
      "content": "Volunteer within your community. Just like starting a career is good for getting your name out there, putting in your time and effort for free is a great way to show your dedication and sacrifice. You can volunteer for political parties and candidates to help out causes you believe in and get your face out there as a thriving member of society. If you’re still in college, look around for internships nearby to get your foot in the door. Volunteer experience can also lead to career opportunities down the line. Reader Poll: We asked 188 wikiHow readers if they volunteer regularly, and 55% of them said yes.

      "content": "Think about why you’d like to become the president. Becoming the President of the United States isn’t easy, and doing the actual job is pretty tough too. Before you continue down the path towards your goal, do a little soul-searching to see why exactly you’d like to become the president and whether you can handle the pressure and hardships it may come with. There is also a large chance that you won’t become the president, so you should come to terms with that, too."

      "content": "Talk to your family and friends. Becoming president includes a grueling campaign where every bit of your personal and professional life will be picked apart by the media and your competitors. It'll be tough on you, but it'll also be tough on your family. You'll be flitting to and from during your campaign with very little time for your spouse and children, so talk to your loved ones before you continue. [9] X Research source There are also safety issues that come with running for president. You should talk to your family and friends about the extra security you all might need in the coming months."

      "title": "Talk to your political party about running.",
      "content": "Talk to your political party about running. Find out what they’re looking for, who your competition is, and what you’d need to do to get their support. If you’re backed by your own political party, you’re much more likely to get ahead during campaign season. They can also help you find funding for your campaign."

      "content": "Appoint your campaign manager. When it’s time to get going on your campaign, you’ll need to hire someone to handle the logistics. Pick someone you know and trust who also has experience in politics, fundraising, and rallies so they can help you promote yourself.

      "content": "Raise money from donors. Political campaigns are expensive, and you’re going to need a lot of cash to get started. Call anyone you can think of who might back your campaign and ask them for a small, moderate, or large sum of money to help you promote yourself and your policies. [11] X Research source You can contact local corporations, nonprofits, or just American citizens. You can also ask your political party if they’ll help to fund your campaign."

      "content": "Form an exploratory committee. This committee can \"test the waters,\" or determine what your chances are. It's the standard first step to starting out on the presidential path. Have your campaign manager gather a group of political professionals to figure out your chances of winning the presidency, then change your strategy from there. [12] X Research source Utilize your exploratory committee to assess the level of visibility you have in the public (i.e, your chance at succeeding) and recommend campaign strategies, themes, and slogans. The committee should also recruit potential donors, endorsements, staff and volunteers, and write position papers and speeches. If it all goes well, they'll start organizing in the key beginning states (Iowa, New Hampshire, etc.)"

While this doesn't mean you're officially running, the FEC basically assumes that you are. Be sure to file a Statement of Candidacy within 15 days of reaching the $5,000 threshold. After that statement is filed, you have 10 days to file a Statement of Organization. You must also report campaign income and expenditures to the FEC on a quarterly basis."

      "content": "Declare your candidacy publicly. This is an opportunity to hold a rally for supporters and voters. Pick a place in your hometown or an area where you have a lot of support, then host a rally with guest speakers and supporters. You can also use this as an opportunity to sell T-shirts, buttons, and bumper stickers with your name on them. Make sure you invite the media so you can televise your candidacy as well."

      "content": "Appeal to average Americans. To become president, you will need to shake hands, attend small town events and visit factories, veterans, churches, farms and businesses. You'll need to put away those diamond cufflinks of yours and roll up your khakis. [13] X Research source Al Gore said he invented the Internet. John Edwards had an affair. Mitt Romney said half of US voters don't pay taxes. That's just three things Americans don't like. Wherever you are—whether you think you're being recorded or not—be on your best behavior. The public doesn't easily forget these things. The presidency (or any position of power) is not as bright as it seems; the real challenge is to win key supporters that can help keep your campaign going, win the presidency, and stay in office.

      "content": "Win primary elections, caucuses, and delegates. Each state has a different way of choosing a president: a caucus, a primary, or some combination of the two. Winning those grants you delegates that choose you to be on the presidential ticket, celebrated at the party's national convention that year. [15] X Trustworthy Source USA.GOV Official website for the United States federal government Go to source Every state is a bit different, and the party themselves are different as well. Republicans have \"pledged\" and \"un-pledged\" delegates; Democrats have \"pledged delegates\" and \"super delegates.\" Some are a winner-take-all system, while others give you a percentage of delegates to match the percentage of votes you received."

      "content": "Attend your party's convention. Once you emerge as the strongest candidate in your political party, your party will hold a convention where all the delegates will pledge their support for your candidacy. It used to be that the convention was actually where the delegates voted, but now there's media coverage where everyone already knows who won, so it's a bit more symbolic. Either way, it's a party in your name. [16] X Research source It's one day where each party prefers to concentrate on how awesome they are instead of how terrible the other is. So enjoy the short-lived positivity! This is also where you will declare your running mate. This is pretty big—if people don't approve of your choice, you could lose votes, so think it through."

Get the word out there about what you believe in and what you want to do for the country, and then stick to it. Keep your image as consistent and clean as possible. [18] X Research source Not only will it be your word, but it'll be your image everywhere—commercials that you've endorsed (including attack ads), YouTube videos, pictures from your past, etc. No matter what gets thrown at you, you have to take it in stride."

      "content": "Do well in presidential debates. Not only do you have to know your views, you must know your opponent's views, too. Speak in a way that is convincing to the general public, simultaneously beefing up your own campaign and deflating the other. Do some research beforehand on what is polling well in the general public and stay on-brand for your campaign. [19] X Research source When John F. Kennedy stared right into the camera with his tan, young self, sweaty, coming-out-of-the-flu Nixon didn't stand a chance. Charisma will get you a long way here, so play it up to the max."
