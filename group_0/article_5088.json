      "title": "Purchase bundles or sticks of dried sage.",
      "content": "Purchase bundles or sticks of dried sage. You can also get loose-leaf sage, but pre-wrapped sage bundles are easier to handle and use. White sage is the most common option; this type of sage was traditionally burned by the indigenous peoples of the American Southwest. [1] X Research source Other types of sage, like blue, cedar, and lavender sage, also work for cleansing and purification rituals. If you're getting sage from a farmers market, any kind that grows locally will do the trick. Look for dried sage at herb shops, health stores, farmers' markets, smoke shops, and anywhere incense is sold. Be conscious about where you are getting your sage since it's a ceremonial, sacred product. Your intention matters, the cultivation of the sage matters, and even the intention of the seller matters. These subtle energies may pass from the people into the sage, and from the sage into the space you're purifying."

      "title": "Pick wild sage if you can find it growing nearby.",
      "content": "Pick wild sage if you can find it growing nearby. Sage grows naturally, in the form of various subspecies, throughout the Americas, Asia, and the Mediterranean. Read about the varieties that grow near you, and consult a botanical field guide to identify the plant in the wild. Leave at least half the plant so it can sustain itself and continue growing for years to come. [2] X Research source Use sustainable wild-crafting practices. Never pull wild sage up by the root, and do not harvest the entire patch. Indigenous peoples believe that the most respectful way to harvest sage is to take only a few leaves at a time. [3] X Research source Take the tallest, most mature stems, and leave the rest. Be careful not to shake away too many of the seeds and flowers. Use scissors or a knife to trim the stem as close to the ground as possible. [4] X Research source Ask for permission before harvesting sage on private property, or within the bounds of a state park. In some areas, you can purchase a cutting or wild-crafting permit for a small fee. Keep in mind that if you harvest wild sage, you'll have to dry it before burning it."

      "content": "Consider growing sage yourself if you plan to use it often. If you keep an herb garden, you may want to cultivate your own sage plant to ensure a steady and sustainable supply. It's easy to grow and quite hardy in most zones. Buy sage seeds online or a sage plant at your local nursery. Scatter or bury seeds from an existing sage plant in your garden. Water them consistently, make sure that they have space to grow, and be patient. Whether you transplant a living sage bush or grow your own from seed, give the plant plenty of time to establish itself in your garden. Avoid harvesting more than half the plant since you might accidentally kill the plant. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Dry fresh sage",
      "content": "Dry fresh sage for about a week before using it. Gather the sage in a bundle, tie it tightly, and hang it up in a dry space so the leaves and stalks dry evenly. This should take about a week or so, depending on the weather. The sage is dry enough to burn if it crackles when you gently squeeze it. If you hang your sage outside, remember to bring it inside or cover it at night. If dew or moisture seep into your sage bundle overnight, this will undermine the drying process. Do not dry your sage in an oven or microwave. This will toast the essential oil out of the bundle, speeding up the deterioration of the plant and muting the purifying effect of burning it."

      "content": "Plan your ritual and specify your intention . The practice of burning sage is ancient, rich, and steeped in cultural tradition. Decide what you are trying to accomplish by burning this sage. The power of intent is integral here, so think carefully about what you'd like to achieve. [6] X Research source For example, you could burn sage with the intention to cleanse your home of negative energy. Indigenous peoples believed that sage smoke attaches to negative energy and carries it away to the Great Spirit. Your intention could be to interact with an ancient herbal tradition and rekindle the ancient rites. Or maybe you simply want to burn incense and spruce up your home with a pleasing scent. Turn off all the electronics in the areas where you'll be saging so you can focus without distractions."

      "content": "Learn about the benefits and uses of sage. Many of the benefits of sage are spiritual and psychological in nature. That said, there is a physical component, too. On a spiritual level: People use sage burning and smudging to connect with ancestral tradition. It's also a common belief that the strong scent of sage can purge the negative energy from a room, a home, and a heart. Burning sage is believed to promote healing, wisdom, and longevity, and leaves were traditionally burned to fumigate living spaces after serious illnesses like measles, tuberculosis, and smallpox. [7] X Research source On a psychological level: The act of burning sage can mark a beginning, a resolution, or the turning-over of a new leaf. Accept the time-honored ritual and put your faith in the power of burnt sage to purge yourself of negativity and find true peace of mind. On a physical level: Sage releases negative ions into the air when it is burned, and research suggests that exposure to negative ions may correlate to lower rates of depression. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Studies also show that burning sage can reduce airborne bacteria in a space.

      "content": "Place the burning vessel on a flat surface. Use a ceramic dish, bowl, incense tray, abalone shell, or any other vessel that can catch the ash on a flat, stable surface. Fill the vessel with clean sand or rich earth. If you're using a pre-wrapped sage bundle, you can just hold one end of it for the smudging ritual rather than use a vessel. [10] X Research source Choose a vessel that holds significance to you. This can be anything: your favorite coffee mug, a piece of your grandmother's china, an ivory bowl from your trip to India; any personal relic that will make the ceremony more meaningful to you. Some Native American tribes have traditionally burned sage in abalone shells. [11] X Research source Avoid placing sage on wood, paper, rubber, or anything flammable. Keep water on hand to extinguish the burning sage if the flame grows out of hand."

      "content": "Open a window or a door before you light the sage. This will give the sage smoke—along with any negative energy—a way to leave your home. You want the smoke to cleanse, but you do not want it to linger. [12] X Research source Turn on a fan if you want the smoke to dissipate more quickly. You may not like the pungent smell, or the smoke may irritate your sinuses. This process may set off your smoke alarm. Either moderate your smoke-spreading or avoid rooms with smoke detectors."

      "content": "Light the sage in the vessel and blow out the flame after a few seconds. Alternatively, hold the sage bundle at a 45-degree angle and light the end. Use a candle, a match, or a lighter to set the sage stick ablaze, let it burn for a few seconds, and then blow out the flame. Allow the embers to smoke. [13] X Research source Dried sage will catch fire very quickly, so be careful. Let the sage burn enough so the embers will continue to smoke. If the smoke ceases before you're done with your ritual, light the sage again."

      "content": "Keep your intention clear in your mind. Consider saying a prayer of cleansing. Burning sage is the spiritual equivalent of opening up all of your windows and letting light shine into the soul. Dedicate your act to this light.

I dedicate this room to life, and to love, and to light, and to all that is good.\""

      "content": "Let the sage smoke slowly fill the room. Walk around each room wafting smoke into every corner. Allow smoke waft along the walls, the windows, and the ceiling. Imagine negative energy flowing away from the edges of the smoke, out of your home, and out of your life for good. You can also use your hand to gently wave the smoke in specific directions. [15] X Research source Concentrate on gateway areas: windows, doors, closets, hallways. Use your intuition. You may notice that some areas are more in need of cleansing than others. Consider focusing on busy areas like work spaces, kitchens, entryways. If you have a pet, consider saging their space, but do not disturb them with the smoke. Moderation is key. Do not fill the area too thickly with smoke since it can have a cloying effect. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Let the sage burn out on its own in a fireproof vessel. After you spread the smoke to all of the areas in your home that you want to cleanse, nestle the sage bundle into a vessel and place it on a flat surface. Let the sage burn out on its own rather than extinguish it so your space gets the most benefits. Then, discard the ashes outside by scattering or burying them. [17] X Research source If you need to leave your house and don't want to keep the sage burning, press the burning tip of the sage bundle into sand or a fireproof container to extinguish it. Wait 30-45 minutes for the sage to cool completely before storing the leftover sage away. Avoid extinguishing sage with water since it will ruin the tip and make it too hard to light in the future. If you do crystal work, let the sage smoke waft over your collection a few times to cleanse your crystals ."

      "content": "Try burning incense directly after a saging session. Pungent sage is known for its yang (male) aspect, and incense may lend a complementary yin (female) energy to your space. Incense can also soften the sage scent and make it more pleasant (especially if you aren't loving the way burnt sage smells). Palo santo incense is wonderful after a saging session.

You don't necessarily need to perform a full smudging ceremony each time you burn sage; it depends on how strictly you wish to adhere to the traditional rituals. Consider burning sage casually, as you would burn incense. Try burning sage to acknowledge significant changes in your home: a new member of the family, a new pet, a new job, a new passion. [19] X Research source The practice of burning sage can be whatever you want it to be. The important thing is that you believe that the sage can help you make your life more meaningful."
