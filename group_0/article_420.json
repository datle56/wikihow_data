Then agree on the best choice together, so you can both enjoy the movie.

For example, you may say, “Is it okay if I kiss you?” or “Are you comfortable with me putting my arm around you?” If your date says “no,” don’t pressure them. Accept their response and go back to enjoying the movie. If your date says “yes,” you can kiss them, put your arm around them, or hold their hand (depending on what you asked). Make sure you check in with them often to confirm they’re still comfortable. Remember, going on a movie date does not mean you have to kiss in the theater. You and your date may be happy just watching the movie and enjoying the experience together. The end of a first date is often a good time to go in for a kiss—however, not everyone feels comfortable kissing on a first date, so make sure to still ask for consent.
