Feelings often develop and progress the more time that we spend alone with someone, so respectfully avoid them and keep your 1-on-1 time brief to nip those feelings in the bud. Use vague excuses to end the conversation , like, “Sorry, but I’ve got to be somewhere.” Try not to say things like “I’ll see you later.” If possible, hang out in groups to make sure any time spent near the person who likes you is spent in the presence of others, as well, to provide a social buffer."

For example, you might still greet them if they greet you, and speak to them like you would any acquaintance. Avoid rolling your eyes, or glancing away like you’d rather be somewhere else, which are negative body language cues that can still be rude."

If they see the person approaching you, they can intervene by either pulling you away or by interacting with both of you so you don’t have to be alone with them. If your friends aren’t around and you’re alone with the person, text your friends and ask them to call you, giving you an “exit” from the situation."

In these instances, you might still keep interacting with them, but try to limit the number of interactions to keep some emotional distance between you. For example, let them initiate contact, and don’t be afraid to respond or even spend time with them if they do, but don’t reach out yourself.

Start by saying something like, “I get the feeling that—and please correct me if I’m wrong—you may have a crush on me. I’m flattered, but not interested in the same way.
