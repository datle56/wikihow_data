      "title": "(n.) The Boston Bruins.",
      "content": "(n.) The Boston Bruins. “The Bs” are the Boston Bruins, Boston’s professional ice hockey team in the NHL. Hockey is a super popular sport in Boston, given the weather and the proximity to Canada, so it’s no surprise that locals show a ton of love to their affectionately-named “Bs.” Example: “I miss Bobby Orr, there hasn’t ever been a Bs player like him.”"

      "title": "(v.) To make a U-turn.",
      "content": "(v.) To make a U-turn. To “bang a u-ey” means to make a U-turn while driving in a car. In most cases, you can probably assume this is an illegal U-turn, given that Massachusetts reportedly has the worst drivers in the U.S.! [1] X Research source Example: “Ugh, I missed the turn for Harvard Ave., I’m gonna have to bang a u-ey .”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) A trash can or garbage bin.",
      "content": "(n.) A trash can or garbage bin. A “barrel” is a trash can or garbage bin. Most likely, this term comes from early practices of burning trash in barrels, which was eventually made illegal. However, the slang word stuck around, which is why a Bostonian might ask you to take out the “barrel!” [2] X Research source Example: “Can you go take out the barrels ? It’s pick-up day tomorrow.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "n (pl.) Potatoes.",
      "content": "n (pl.) Potatoes. “B’daydas” is a colloquial term for—you guessed it—potatoes! Whipped, smashed, baked, or roasted, a true Massachusite will call ‘em “b’daydas.” If this one isn’t quite clicking for you, try saying “potatoes” in a Boston accent …sounds just like “b’daydas!” [3] X Research source Example: “How are we cooking the b’daydas for Thanksgiving this year? Mashed or smashed?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) A nickname for the city of Boston.",
      "content": "(n.) A nickname for the city of Boston. Beantown is one of the most nationally-known nicknames for Boston. However, it’s much more common to see it used by tourists and in the tourism industry—locals usually only use it in a mocking way and they don’t identify much with it. The name comes from the fact that beans (particularly molasses-sweetened baked beans) were a staple in the city’s colonial-era diet. Unsurprisingly, most modern Bostonians don’t relate much to a pre-Revolution menu! [4] X Research source Example: “I feel like going out in the city tonight, let’s hit the streets of Beantown !”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) A turn signal.",
      "content": "(n.) A turn signal. A “blinker” is the Massachusetts word for a turn signal on a car. A true Bostonian is more likely to pronounce it as “blinkah.” (And, you didn’t hear it from us, but most true Bostonians also won’t use their blinker as much as they should!) Example: “Turn on your blinker , you’re driving like a M*sshole!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(adj.) Cold (as in temperature).",
      "content": "(adj.) Cold (as in temperature). “Brick” is an adjective meaning “freezing” or “cold.” And Bostonians are no strangers to below-zero temperatures! This slang word is usually used in the phrase, “it’s brick out.” Example: “Grab your parka, it’s brick out today.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) Drinking fountain.",
      "content": "(n.) Drinking fountain. A “bubbler” is a public drinking fountain (also called a water fountain). In the Boston accent, however, it’s typically pronounced as “bubblah.” [5] X Research source Example: “I need a drink of water, do you know if there’s a bubbler nearby?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) The Boston Celtics.",
      "content": "(n.) The Boston Celtics. The “C’s” are Boston’s professional basketball team, the Boston Celtics. The Celtics are a pretty big deal over in the Cradle of Liberty, with players like Larry Bird and Jayson Tatum counting themselves among the city’s local legends. [6] X Research source Example: “I’ve got season tickets for the C’s this year, I’m wicked excited.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) Cape Cod.",
      "content": "(n.) Cape Cod. “The Cape” refers to “Cape Cod,” which is a popular vacation destination for both tourists and locals alike. The difference is that you’ll never hear local Bostonians saying “Cape Cod.” They always shorten it to simply “The Cape.” [7] X Research source Example: “I wanted to drive down to the Cape last weekend, but there were huge traffic jams so I took the ferry to P-Town instead.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) Shopping cart.",
      "content": "(n.) Shopping cart. In Boston, a “carriage” is a shopping cart that you’d use at the grocery store… not something that’s pulled by a horse to some magical Disney-esque castle. You can frequently find carriages at Star Market, Wegman’s, and Mah -ket Basket. [8] X Research source Example: “I need more groceries than I thought, can you grab me a carriage ?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) Basement.",
      "content": "(n.) Basement. A “cellar” is just a normal basement, so the words are used interchangeably in Boston. Secretly, we just think that Bostonians want to take any chance they can to flex their accent…which is why they call even the poshest and most furnished of basements a “cell- ah .” [9] X Research source Example: “Let’s head down to the cellar to watch the Sox game!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) The Charles River.",
      "content": "(n.) The Charles River. “The Charles” refers to the Charles River, which famously flows through the cities of Cambridge and Boston.

    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) Idiot or dummy.",
      "content": "(n.) Idiot or dummy. “Chowderhead” is an insulting term for someone who’s being stupid or foolish. It’s similar to other words like “blockhead,” “dummy,” and “idiot.” It’s no surprise that this term comes from New England, a region famous for their clam chowder—aka, a thick stew, similar to how a “chowderhead” might be “thick-headed” or “dense.” The insult is generally lighthearted, but it’s still an insult, so use it with caution. [11] X Research source Example: “Whaddya mean you like Mike’s better than Modern? What a chowderhead .”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) Remote control.",
      "content": "(n.) Remote control. “Clicker” (or “click- ah ”) is just another word for a remote control, which you might know if you have Boomer relatives or have spent a lot of time in New England. “Clicker” isn’t totally unique to Boston, however, as many people (particularly from older generations) in Northern California use the slang term. [12] X Research source Example: “Another commercial for TD Bank, can you pass me the clicker ?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) Commonwealth Avenue.",
      "content": "(n.) Commonwealth Avenue. “Comm Ave” is short for “Commonwealth Avenue,” one of Boston’s largest, longest, and most important streets.

    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) Dorchester.",
      "content": "(n.) Dorchester. “Dot” is the nickname for Greater Boston’s Dorchester neighborhood, which is the largest and most diverse area in the city.

[14] X Research source Example: “My brother lives over in the Dot , we’re gonna take my nieces to the Franklin Park Zoo tomorrow.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "n (pl.) Jeans.",
      "content": "n (pl.) Jeans. “Dungarees” is the term that many older Bostonians use for a classic pair of jeans. Specifically, any pair of blue jeans or denim trousers can be called “dungarees” in Boston—and other parts of Massachusetts and New England. Example: “Did you see that Old Navy is having a sale on dungarees this weekend?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) Dunkin’ (Donuts).",
      "content": "(n.) Dunkin’ (Donuts). “Dunks” is short for Dunkin’ (formerly Dunkin’ Donuts). The Quincy-founded coffee-and-a-donut chain company is prized among Massachusites—to say the least. So much so, in fact, that they have to have their own nickname for it! Hence, “Dunks!” [15] X Research source Example: “Let’s get some Dunks on the way to work today, I’m craving an iced coffee.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) East Boston.",
      "content": "(n.) East Boston. “Eastie” is the affectionate nickname that Bostonians use for East Boston. Many of the city’s neighborhoods have shortened nicknames, and this one is no exception! “Eastie” is known for its diverse immigrant population, encompassing the communities of Winthrop, Revere, and Chelsea. It’s also home to the Boston Logan International Airport, which locals refer to simply as “Logan.” [16] X Research source Example: “I’m heading out to Eastie tomorrow to play a pick-up game at Lo Presti Park.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) A peanut butter and marshmallow fluff sandwich.",
      "content": "(n.) A peanut butter and marshmallow fluff sandwich. “Fluffernutters” are a type of sandwich made with white bread, peanut butter, and marshmallow fluff. This sandwich is considered to be a classic and common treat among New Englanders, with marshmallow fluff being more popular in the region than it is nationwide. You can also find Fluffernutter-inspired treats around the Greater Boston Area, including Fluffernutter cookies, candy bars, and ice creams. [17] X Research source Example: “I’m craving something sweet, I think I’ll whip up a fluffernutter .”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) Milkshake.",
      "content": "(n.) Milkshake. A “frappe” is the general word for milkshake—which can be very confusing for out-of-towners who associate “frappe” with a blended coffee beverage. Not in Boston! You can get a strawberry frappe, and mint chocolate chip frappe, a blueberry frappe…you name it! There will only be coffee involved if you order a coffee frappe (aka, a coffee milkshake). [18] X Research source Example: “Do you want to go to Wahlburgers for lunch? I’d love a vanilla frappe .”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(adv.) Semi-vulgar expletive, similar to “damned.”",
      "content": "(adv.) Semi-vulgar expletive, similar to “damned.” “Frickin’” is a softer alternative to a similar term that starts with “f”...you know the one. Bostonians and New Englanders, in general, use “frickin’” quite often, especially around polite company or children. Example: “This frickin’ ref doesn’t know what he’s talking about, the Revs should’ve gotten that point.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) TD Garden.",
      "content": "(n.) TD Garden. “The Garden” is TD Garden, or the home of the Boston Celtics basketball team and Boston Bruins hockey team. TD Garden borrows its name from its sponsor, TD Bank. However, locals nearly always shorten it to “The Garden.” [19] X Research source Example: “Were you at the Garden last night for the Bs game? Unreal!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) Fenway Park’s left outfield wall (which is green).",
      "content": "(n.) Fenway Park’s left outfield wall (which is green). The “green monstah” (or “green monst er ,” if you don’t have a Boston accent) is the tall outfield wall on the outside of Fenway Park’s left field. The green wall itself is iconic, as is the stadium it belongs to—Fenway is the oldest MLB stadium still in use, with the Boston Red Sox remaining one of the U.S.’ most famous teams. As for the Green Monster, it’s a unique size and shape, leading to lots of funny, famous, and memorable gameplay moments over the years. The wall is also represented as the Red Sox mascot—Wally the Green Monster. [20] X Research source Example: “Wow, he hit that one all the way to the Green Monstah !”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) The Boston Harbor.",
      "content": "(n.) The Boston Harbor. “The harbor” refers to Boston Harbor, a natural estuary of Massachusetts Bay that hugs the city of Boston. The harbor (or “hah-bah”) is beloved amongst locals for its beautiful seaside views. However, it’s also famed for its historic significance—ever heard of the Boston Tea Party? Yep, all that tea went straight in the harbor. [21] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source Example: “We did a cruise on the harbor last night, it was beautiful!”"

      "content": "(n.) A small cup of ice cream made by the Hood dairy. A “hoodsie” is a small, single-serve, pre-packaged cup of chocolate and vanilla ice cream. Hoodsies are ice creams specifically made by HP Hood, a New England ice cream company that produces a lot of the dairy used in the area.

    },
    {
      "title": "(v.) “Dibs.”",
      "content": "(v.) “Dibs.” “Hosie” is used to call “dibs” on something (which is slang in itself!). Pronounced “HOE-zee,” you can say “hosie” at any time to playfully stake your claim on a place or item. [23] X Research source Example: “I hosie the front seat!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) A nickname for the city of Boston.",
      "content": "(n.) A nickname for the city of Boston. “The Hub” is one of Boston’s nicknames, so it refers to the city itself. It captures the sense of Boston’s importance and influence, making it feel like it’s the “hub” or center of the universe. Nowadays, however, “The Hub” is mainly used by locals with a playful or self-deprecating tone. [24] X Research source Example: “Is there anything fun going on this weekend? We are in the Hub , after all!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "n (pl.) Chocolate sprinkles.",
      "content": "n (pl.) Chocolate sprinkles. “Jimmies” is the Boston (and New England) slang word for chocolate sprinkles. [25] X Research source Some claim that this term comes from the Just Born Candy Company, who named their chocolate sprinkles after an employee, while others believe that “jimmies” is an homage to the Jimmy Fund or the Brigham’s Ice Cream company (who charges extra for “jimmies” and donates the proceeds to the Jimmy Fund). There’s also some question of whether the slang word has racist origins in relation to Jim Crow laws, but there’s no evidence to prove this is true. [26] X Research source Example: “I’ll add some jimmies onto my sundae, please!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) Term of endearment similar to “bro.”",
      "content": "(n.) Term of endearment similar to “bro.” “Kid” (or “kehd”) is a term of endearment that applies to everyone who steps foot in Boston—regardless of age. While other dialects might only use “kid” with, well, actual kids, New Englanders use it indiscriminately. It’s similar to how you might say “dude,” “bro,” or “this guy.” Example: “Nah, kid , I don’t have time to come out to Southie tonight, sorry.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) Marathon Monday.",
      "content": "(n.) Marathon Monday. “Marmon” is short for “Marathon Monday,” which refers to the day on which the Boston Marathon is hosted. Many students and workers have the day off, both because the marathon shuts down the city and because it’s usually hosted on Patriot’s Day (a state holiday). Wellesley College and Boston University, in particular, celebrate MarMon because the marathon runs through their campuses—meaning they always have the race day off. Instead, they have “MarMon” traditions of wearing unique outfits, throwing day-parties (or “darties”), and cheering on the runners. [27] X Research source Example: “I’m so excited to have the day off on MarMon , I’m gonna head down to Copley to watch the finish line.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) Abbreviation for Massachusetts.",
      "content": "(n.) Abbreviation for Massachusetts. “Mass” is short for “Massachusetts” and is preferred by locals when discussing their lengthily-named home state. You’ll hear a similar abbreviation with “Mass. Ave,” which refers to Massachusetts Ave, one of the major roadways running through several important neighborhoods and towns in the Greater Boston Area. Example: “I love Vermont, but Mass will always be my top-tier New England state.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) Combination of “Mass” and “a**hole.”",
      "content": "(n.) Combination of “Mass” and “a**hole.” “M*sshole” is a jokingly derogatory term from Massachusetts residents—combining the word “Mass” (short for the state’s name) with a delightful and insulting curse word. Originally, this word was used to genuinely insult Bay Staters, who are known for their brusque and bull-headed nature—especially when behind the wheel. However, it’s since been reappropriated and is proudly used by many MA residents. [28] X Research source Example: “The light just turned green and he’s honking at me…what a m*sshole .”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) A cyclonic winter storm common in the Northeast.",
      "content": "(n.) A cyclonic winter storm common in the Northeast. A “nor’easter” is a type of storm that affects the Boston area (and the East Coast, in general). Colloquially described as a cross between a blizzard and a tornado, a nor’easter is actually a large extratropical cyclone whose winds blow from the northeast direction (hence the name). It usually involves large amounts of snow, rain, flooding, winds…and panicking in the grocery aisle. [29] X Research source Example: “We need to go pick up some milk and bread tonight, they forecasted a nor’easter for this weekend.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(int.) “No sir.”",
      "content": "(int.) “No sir.” “Nosuh” means “no sir,” an exclamation with a similar meaning as “no way” or “you’re kidding me.” It’s typically used to express surprise or disbelief. Bostonians who use this slang word really are saying “no sir,” but the combination of speed and the “r” being omitted from their accent makes it sound like “nosuh.” [30] X Research source Example: “ Nosuh! She didn’t really say that to you, did she?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(adj.) “Originally From Dorchester.”",
      "content": "(adj.) “Originally From Dorchester.” “OFD” means “Originally From Dorchester” in Boston slang. Dorchester is a notably diverse and historically working-class town in Massachusetts, so its natives are very proud to be from there. The phrase “OFD” honors these townies, showcasing their pride in and connection to the area. Example: “He’s a real OFD , Dorchester born and raised.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(int.) “I’m serious” or “I swear.”",
      "content": "(int.) “I’m serious” or “I swear.” “On dogs” is a way to emphasize that you’re telling the truth, like “I swear” or “I’m serious.” You may also hear or see “on dawgs” or “on dead dogs.” All of these phrases are said after a phrase to reaffirm that the speaker is totally serious. [31] X Research source Example: “I honestly don’t know if I’m up for St. Paddy’s this year. On dogs .”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) A liquor store.",
      "content": "(n.) A liquor store. “Packie” is short for “package store,” which is a liquor store in Boston-speak. Just be cautious when using this term outside of Mass—it’s pronounced the same way as a British slur. [32] X Research source Example: “We’re out of beer, I’ll run down to the packie real quick.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) The New England Patriots.",
      "content": "(n.) The New England Patriots. “Pats” is short for the New England Patriots. The Pats are arguably the most beloved sports team in Boston—let alone in the entire state of Massachusetts. While the Pats aren’t so loved outside of New England, some of the most famous ball-players of all time come from their roster, including Tom Brady, Mike Haynes, and Rob Gronkowski. They’re also the NFL team with most Super Bowl wins, as of 2025. [33] X Research source Example: “I’m heading out to Gillette tomorrow to watch the Pats play.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) The Massachusetts Turnpike.",
      "content": "(n.) The Massachusetts Turnpike. The “Pike” is the Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90), the state’s major roadway. This highway runs through the city of Boston to Western Mass. But, rather than calling it “the turnpike” or “I-90”, locals refer to it as the “Pike,” or sometimes the “Mass Pike” if they must to differentiate it from another state’s turnpike. [34] X Research source Example: “I’ll be late for work, traffic’s backed up on the Pike.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(adj.) “Awesome” or “great.”",
      "content": "(adj.) “Awesome” or “great.” “Pissah” (sometimes spelled “pissa”) means “great” or “awesome.” Keep in mind that the true word is “pisser,” but it’s evolved into “pissah” due to the “r”-dropping Boston accent. You’ll also see it paired with “wicked” on many a souvenir item. [35] X Research source Example: “You should’ve been at the party last night, it was wicked pissah .”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) A purse or handbag.",
      "content": "(n.) A purse or handbag. A “pocketbook” is a purse or handbag, but it’s used more often by New Englanders than by folks in other regions. Due to the Mass accent, it usually comes out more like “pockabook,” so don’t be shocked if you hear that pronunciation when someone’s asking for their bag! Example: “I can’t find my lip balm, I thought it was in my pockabook .”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) The Prudential Center.",
      "content": "(n.) The Prudential Center. The “Pru” is the local nickname for the Prudential Center, which is a mall in the Back Bay neighborhood. The Pru is more than just a mall, however—it’s a large shopping center that sprawls across several blocks, fitted with many luxury and specialty shops. The Pru is also topped off by the Prudential Tower, which boasts 52 floors, a popular skywalk, and a notable spot in the Boston skyline. The tower also lights up for special days and events—on game days, for instance, you might see “GO RED SOX” or “GO PATS” spelled out on the side of the tower. [36] X Research source Example: “Kelsie decided on Earl’s for her birthday, it’s that rooftop bar in the Pru .”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) An iced coffee with cream and sugar.",
      "content": "(n.) An iced coffee with cream and sugar. A “regular” (or “regul- ah ”) is the most popular coffee order in the great state of Massachusetts—an iced coffee with cream and sugar. Nine times out of ten, this iced coffee will be from Dunks, of course. And, don’t think that the regular changes with the seasons! Bostonians are known to order their iced coffees well into the winter—even in below-zero temps. Example: “Hm, I’ll have a regular , and let’s make it a large.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) The New England Revolution",
      "content": "(n.) The New England Revolution “Revs” refers to the New England Revolution soccer team. While not one of Boston’s most well-known teams, the Revs have a strong local presence as the city’s professional soccer club. Their name, “the Revolution,” pays homage to Boston’s significant role in the American Revolution. Fun fact: their logo’s font is based on the East India Company, whose tea was thrown into the Harbor during the Boston Tea Party. The logo’s red strikethrough is also meant to represent the American Revolution’s spirit of defiance and patriotism. [37] X Research source Example: “Have you heard they might build a stadium for the Revs in Everett?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) A huge party.",
      "content": "(n.) A huge party. A “ripper” is a truly wild party…the type only a Bostonian could throw. Similar to “rager,” “bash,” and “blowout,” a “ripper” is any shindig that gets out of control (in a good way!). And, as America’s College Town, you can rest assured that plenty of “rippahs” are happening in Boston at any given time. [38] X Research source Example: “I went to an MIT frat for Halloweekend…it was a ripper .”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) Roundabout or traffic circle.",
      "content": "(n.) Roundabout or traffic circle. A “rotary” is what most of the country calls a “roundabout.” It’s also sometimes called a traffic circle or a “place-that-you-drive-through-while-screaming,” but in Boston? It’ll always be a simple rotary. Example: “Is there any way to get there without going through the Newton Corner rotary ? I’d love to not die today.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(int.) “So do I” or “Me too.”",
      "content": "(int.) “So do I” or “Me too.” Perhaps confusingly, “so don’t I” means “Me too” or “So do I.” While this phrase contains a negative that doesn’t grammatically belong, it makes total sense to New Englanders. [39] X Research source Example: “I have a pet cat.” “ So don’t I ! Mine’s named Charleston.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "(n.) South Boston.",
      "content": "(n.) South Boston. “Southie” refers to South Boston, an iconic section of the city that’s historically been home to Irish immigrants and their Irish-American descendants. Today, Southie is most famous for its annual St. Patrick’s Day festivities, as well as local grumblings about it being taken over by so-called “yuppies” and Ivy League grads. [40] X Research source Example: “My great-grandma grew up in Southie , her parents immigrated there from Cork.”"

    {
      "title": "(n.) An object you place in a parking spot during a snowstorm to reserve it.",
      "content": "(n.) An object you place in a parking spot during a snowstorm to reserve it. A “space-saver” is a large household object that’s used to prevent anyone from taking your parking spot during a winter storm. Common space-savers include lawn chairs, traffic cones, barrels, etc. As a town that gets around 52 inches (1.3 m) of snow per year and also has a severe lack of street parking, Bostonians put a lot of effort into shoveling out their on-street parking spots. So, they’ll place a “space-saver” in their dug-out parking spot while using their car! However, this practice is only legal during and up to 48 hours a declared snow emergency, and it’s completely banned in the South End. [41] X Research source Example: “Can I borrow your camping chair to use as a space-saver ? I spent nearly an hour digging my car out this morning.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "n (pl.) State police officers.",
      "content": "n (pl.) State police officers. “Staties” are state police offers. They’re often seen patrolling the Pike and looking for traffic infractions, so local drivers are keen to keep an eye out for them. Example: “Watch out for Staties on the Pike today, I passed four or five of them.”"
    },
    {

      "content": "(n.) A vehicle inspection sticker. A “sticker” is the state inspection sticker that’s placed on your car. These stickers (or “stick- ahs ”) must be renewed on the same month each year. Otherwise, you risk getting pulled over by a Statie! Example: “I’m headed to the RMV this afternoon, gotta renew my sticker .”"

      "title": "(v.) To crash a moving truck into an overpass on Storrow Drive.",
      "content": "(v.) To crash a moving truck into an overpass on Storrow Drive. To “storrow” essentially means to drive a tall moving truck into a bridge or overpass on Boston’s Storrow Drive—but let us give you some context to this seemingly-grisly term. As a city with a lot of university students, basically everyone in the city moves on September 1st. Traffic is terrible, furniture litters the streets, and there are moving trucks everywhere! A lot of these moving trucks have to drive on Storrow Drive, one of Boston’s major throughways, which has several unexpectedly low bridges and overpasses. When a too-tall truck collides with one of these overpasses, it’s called “storrowing.” [42] X Research source Example: “Pay attention to the height limits when driving tomorrow so you don’t get storrowed .”"

      "content": "(n.) Dinner. “Supper” is the third meal of the day in Boston—aka, dinner. While “supper” certainly isn’t an unknown slang term in other parts of the country, it’s particularly popular in Boston and New England. Residents of the “Athens of America” use “dinner” and “supper” pretty much interchangeably, perhaps due to some lasting influences of Boston’s strong colonial roots. [43] X Research source Example: “What’re we having for supper tonight? Chowder?”"

      "content": "(n.) Boston’s underground train. “The T” is short for the “MBTA,” which is Massachussetts’ public transit system. However, while the buses, commuter trains, and even boats are technically all part of the MBTA, “the T” is usually only used when talking about the underground (sometimes overground) subway system. [44] X Research source Example: “Do you have your Charlie Card with you? I want to take the T home.”"

      "content": "(n.) Soda. “Tonic” is the common term for any soft drink or soda in Boston. While other regions distinguish between “tonic” and “soda,” Bay Staters do not! They use “tonic” to describe any carbonated beverage—including Pepsi, Coke, root beer, Sprite, and other soft drinks. However, this slang term is becoming less common, particularly in younger neighborhoods due to the high number of out-of-towners who move to Boston and prefer the word “soda.” Example: “Ooh, I’d love a tonic . But do I want a Dr. Pepper or a Fanta?”"

      "content": "(n.) Someone who lives in the same area they were raised in. A “townie” is a native of Boston who’s never left the neighborhood (or “town”) that they grew up in. They likely still hang out in all the same spots and with all the same people that they’ve grown up with. [45] X Research source Example: “He grew up in Charlestown, a real townie with a real thick Boston accent.”"

      "content": "(n.) The Commuter Rail. The “train” is the simple way to refer to the Commuter Rail, an aboveground train that travels at higher speeds between Boston and its neighboring towns and suburbs. [46] X Research source Note that while the Commuter Rail is technically part of the T (or the MBTA), it’s never referred to as the T. That’s saved for the underground subway! Example: “My car’s out of service, I’ll grab the train out to Natick tomorrow.”"

      "content": "(n.) A three-story and -unit building with a porch on each floor. A “triple decker” is a three-story apartment building where each floor has a front porch or balcony. Typically, each floor contains a single apartment, and they often have both front and back porches—so neighbors can sit outside and holler at each other at any time! These buildings are super common in Boston, especially in Southie and Dorchester, as many of them were built to house European immigrants during the second half of the 19th century. [47] X Research source Example: “I just moved into a triple decker last weekend, and I’m loving it so far!”"

It’s also very commonly used by New Englanders, so you’re sure to hear it if you ever spend time with some true townies! “Wicked” is also used as a way to describe something as extreme, like “wicked smart,” meaning very smart, or “wicked pissah,” meaning very awesome. [48] X Research source Example: “The pastries at Tatte are wicked good.”"
