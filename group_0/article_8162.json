Make sure you have at least 20% of your hard drive free at all times to ensure the computer can function at its highest levels.\" Deleting files you don't use will help optimize your computer. Both Windows and macOS have easy built-in tools to help you find and remove unnecessary files: Windows: Disk Cleanup is a great tool that can help you delete unneeded system files on your PC.

To run this now or turn it on, go to Settings > System > Storage . If Storage Sense isn't enabled, you can switch it on now. However, Storage Sense only works on the drive where Windows is installed (most likely the C: drive), so you will need to run other cleaning programs like Disk Cleanup to get other drives.

      "content": "Check for viruses and other malware. If your computer is running slow, locking up, or crashing, your computer could be infected with malicious software (malware). Run a malware scan to check for threats and remove them if found. Both Windows and macOS have pretty good built-in antivirus/antimalware protection. If you're using Windows, your PC periodically scans for (and gets rid of) malware, and you can even run deeper scans yourself . If you have a Mac, you cannot run any malware scan without installing a third-party app. Both Mac and Windows users can download a simple, awesome malware scanner called Malwarebytes. Malwarebytes is free for scanning purposes, but if you want to use it for ongoing protection, you'll need to pay for an upgrade. Download the software, open it, and click Scan Now to find any malicious files. If Malwarebytes finds any, it will automatically quarantine those files so they can't harm your computer."

      "content": "Remove programs you don't use. According to Colburn, sometimes software you install, such as printer drivers, comes bundled with extra programs, toolbars, and other things you don't mean to install. \"It's kind of sneaky,\" he says, \"and over time, these things build up.\" There's no use in having apps you don't use clogging up your hard drive. Fortunately, it's pretty easy to uninstall apps from both Windows and macOS: Windows: Open the Start menu, click Settings , and then click Apps . You'll find your installed programs in the right panel—to delete an app, click its name and select Uninstall . Mac: Open Finder and click Applications in the left panel. To delete an app, just drag it down to the Trash icon on the Dock, which is usually at the bottom of your screen. Alternatively, if the app has its own uninstaller, double-click that file in the app's folder to remove the app. Colburn also recommends preventing programs you don't use often from starting up automatically when you boot up your computer. You can usually turn this off in each program's settings."

As long as you've made a backup of files you don't want to lose, you can easily bring new life into your computer with a fresh install. Windows: You can reset Windows 10 , which gives you the option of keeping your personal files and settings (if you didn't do a backup) or deleting those as well. Mac: If you're using a Mac, you can reinstall macOS by booting into macOS Recovery.

To safely and efficiently clean your computer's exterior, you'll need a few inexpensive items: Lint-free cloths, such as microfiber screen or eyeglass wipes. Cotton swabs. Electronics cleaner—if you don't have any, you can mix equal parts rubbing alcohol (99%) and clean water. A can of compressed air (for cleaning out your keyboard and ports). A flat, clean, dust-free surface to work on."

For desktop computers, this means shutting down the computer, turning off the surge protector or power strip, and unplugging the cord from the back of the tower (computer box). If you're cleaning a laptop, shut it down completely, unplug any power cords from it, turn it upside down, and remove the battery pack (if removable). To prevent scuffing on a glossy finish laptop, you can set your laptop upside-down on paper towels before you remove the battery pack."

      "title": "Use compressed air to clean ports and vents.",
      "content": "Use compressed air to clean ports and vents. Over time, your computer's vents and ports could become cluttered with debris. Holding the can one to three inches from the area you're cleaning, spray quick bursts into all visible openings and dirty areas. Spray it everywhere else you can reach, and don't forget to pop open your optical drives and briefly spray them out. Obviously, the goal is to remove crumbs and dust, not push them farther into your computer. Be mindful of this as you aim your compressed air. You may need to gently tilt your laptop or tower to encourage difficult particles to roll closer to where you can flush them out, but don't ever shake or slap it. If overused, compressed air can hurt/ruin sensitive components. Always spray from a little distance and in short bursts rather than a sustained stream. If you feel comfortable opening your computer to clean the inside, you can use compressed air to do that as well. However, Kats advises against opening up your computer to clean internal parts unless you have experience working on computer hardware. If you're spraying around the CPU cooling fan(s), be extremely careful not to get too close or spray for too long—you could easily crack or break the blades this way. However, according to Kats, getting rid of the dust around the fans is important, and should help keep your computer cool."

      "title": "Use electronics cleaner or alcohol to remove larger or stuck-on debris.",
      "content": "Use electronics cleaner or alcohol to remove larger or stuck-on debris. You can use an electronics cleaner (or rubbing alcohol) to remove sticky substances from most external surfaces—just dampen your microfiber cloth (or a cotton swab) and then rub it over the affected area. Use the swab or cloth to brush away anything stuck on your computer and any gunk or dirt that has collected around the edges, in cracks, and around ports. Run the dampened cotton swab along every seam and edge of your machine. Change swabs as often as needed until the job is done. Don't reuse the same swab for the entire job; it can get dirty and only smear dirt around your computer case. Be careful not to get liquid inside your computer! If you are using a water/alcohol mixture, use the dry side of a cotton swab or a microfiber cloth to remove excess moisture left behind from cleaning."

      "title": "Clean the keyboard.",
      "content": "Clean the keyboard. Start by turning your keyboard upside down over some newspaper or paper towels and shaking out all the crumbs you can. If you're cleaning a laptop, shake it very gently to avoid damaging it. Once you've gotten out all the crumbs you can, hold a can of compressed air one to three inches from the keyboard, and then spray short bursts into the cracks and crevices to flush out more. Shake the keyboard again afterwards. Finally, use a small amount of rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab to clean the tops of the keys. Don't use a vacuum cleaner on your keyboard, especially if you're using a laptop. The vacuum can create a static charge that could damage components underneath. You can also suction keys right off the keyboard and into the vacuum dust container. Touchpads and trackballs can be cleaned the same way as keys: With a cotton swab and a bit of rubbing alcohol. As always, discard each swab when it gets dirty and switch to a new one."

      "title": "Clean the monitor.",
      "content": "Clean the monitor. For LCD displays like those found on most laptops, use a drop of plain water on a soft, lint-free cloth such as microfiber. Apply the water to the cloth (wring it out so it's damp, not wet!), then gently wipe it across the screen until it's clean. If using water in a spray bottle, spray the cloth, not the monitor. Avoid getting the cloth too wet—you wouldn't want any liquids creeping into the monitor or laptop's inside components. Don't use any ammonia-based cleaners on your monitor."
