While you can't anticipate everything they might ask, here are some of the more common questions. How long have you felt this way? Think back to your first crush. Try talking about how happy you felt, or how happy you feel now that you're ready to be yourself. Are you sure? Tell them that you wouldn't have told them if you weren't serious about it, and that you're hoping for their support. What if people mistreat you? You can't change whether you're gay. You can choose to only come out to people who have good attitudes, and to surround yourself with positive people. You can also tell the person that their acceptance and support will help you feel happier. Will you be able to have children? If you'd like, you can talk about options like adoption, gestational carriers, or sperm donors. You can also bring up potential future options such as creating synthetic sperm from a woman's bone marrow.

You might reply that you believe God loves all His children, and you may choose to add that you think that this is God's plan for you or that you think a life full of good deeds will please God. I'm worried about you. Acknowledge that it's okay to be worried, since society is still homophobic. Assure the person that being yourself is what makes you happy. Tell them that their love and support would make a difference to you."

You don't owe anyone (not even family) information about your orientation, and you have every right to keep it quiet if you think you need or want to do so. If your safety, emotional well-being, or financial security (such as your college fund) would be jeopardized by coming out to your family, then stay closeted for now.
