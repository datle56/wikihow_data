      "content": "Add a few drops of dish soap to a bowl of club soda. Choose sodium-free club soda or seltzer water as salt may damage the jewelry. The carbonation in the soda or seltzer helps dislodge grime from the necklace. Put a few drops of any mild dish soap (free of dyes, perfumes, and moisturizers) in the club soda, then agitate the liquid to mix it up. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Put the necklace in a strainer and soak it in the bowl for 5 minutes. If you don't have a strainer, you could put the necklace directly in the bowl, though the strainer helps you remove and rinse the necklace. [2] X Research source If the strainer is too large to fit in the bowl, reserve it for rinsing the necklace."

      "content": "Scrub the necklace with a new, soft toothbrush. After 5 minutes, swish the necklace around in the solution to dislodge grime. Then, use a new, soft toothbrush to clean the chain, settings, crevices, gemstones, or charms. Scrub in a gentle, circular motion applying a minimal amount of pressure. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Rinse the necklace.",
      "content": "Rinse the necklace. Use warm, running water to rinse the club soda, soap, and debris off the necklace. The strainer is helpful for this step, as you can let water run over the necklace and through the strainer. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Dry the necklace with a lint-free cloth.",
      "content": "Dry the necklace with a lint-free cloth. Choose a soft, lint-free cloth to pat the necklace dry with, paying special attention to nooks and crannies. Then, lay the necklace out on the cloth to continue drying. A lint-free cloth is necessary to ensure fibers don't become stuck in the crevices or chain. [5] X Research source You could use a blow dryer on a warm setting to speed up the process, if desired, or simply let the necklace air dry completely."

      "title": "Line a heat-safe dish with aluminum foil and place the necklace on top.",
      "content": "Line a heat-safe dish with aluminum foil and place the necklace on top. This method is intended for plain sterling silver chains that do not contain gems or stones. Ensure the dish or bowl is heat-safe and that it is deep enough to hold a few inches of water. The aluminum foil is essential for the chemical reaction. [6] X Research source Alternatively, you can use an aluminum pie plate."

Bring it to a rolling boil, then add 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (14 g) of baking soda to the pot. The solution will bubble and froth. [7] X Research source Adjust the amounts if necessary so you can completely cover the necklace in bottom of the dish: use 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (14 g) of baking soda per 1 cup (240 ml) of water."

      "content": "Pour the solution over the necklace and let it soak for 2 to 10 minutes. Take care not to burn yourself when pouring the boiling water into the dish. The amount of time you let it soak depends on how dirty or tarnished the silver is. Watch the change in the necklace itself due to the chemical reaction so you will know when it's clean. [8] X Research source Letting the necklace soak longer than this can lead to tarnish, so remove the necklace after 10 minutes."

You don't need to rinse the necklace, just lay it out on a soft cloth to dry. The dirt and tarnish should be gone and your necklace will look like new! [9] X Research source"

Agitate the liquid to mix it thoroughly. Chemicals and other cleaners can damage pearls, so do not use them to clean pearls.

Gently scrub it away using a new, dry toothbrush with soft bristles. A toothpick also works well to dig gunk out of small crevices.

If your necklace is plated or made from pewter, nickel , or brass and has imitation stones, like cubic zirconia or lucite, it's costume jewelry."
