      "content": "Open your router's configuration page. You can access your router's configuration page through a web browser on a computer connected to your network. If you can't connect via Wi-Fi because you don't know the password, use an Ethernet cable to connect your computer directly to the router. This will bypass the need for the Wi-Fi password. [1] X Research source This is the easiest and most secure way to boot someone off your network. While all your devices won't connect with the old password anymore, you'll at least be able to sign in. Unauthorized users won't be able to. Default router addresses are 192.168.1.1 , 192.168.0.1 , 192.168.2.1 , or 10.0.1.1 (Apple) or 10.0.0.1 (Xfinity). Enter the address into your browser's address bar. If you use a service provider similar to Spectrum or Xfinity and rent a router/modem, you most likely have a mobile app to use instead. However, the process looks the same as logging into your router to change the password. Instead of logging into the router's admin page, open the app and sign into your account with the ISP. If none of the above addresses grant you access to the configuration page, open the Command Prompt by pressing the Windows key + R and entering cmd . Once the Command Prompt opens, type ipconfig and press Enter . Look for your active connection in the list and find the Default Gateway address. This is typically your router address. [2] X Research source If all else fails, press and hold the \"Reset\" button on your router for about 30 seconds to revert it to factory default settings. Then, look up the default address for that router model and enter it into your browser. Some routers come with configuration software. If you've previously installed your configuration software, you can use that instead of the web browser interface."

If you never changed this when you first configured the router, chances are the username is \"admin\" or \"userAdmin\" and the password is \"admin\", \"password\" or your current Wi-Fi's password. Of course, this varies from model to model, so you should search your model online to see your exact login info. [3] X Research source If you've changed the login in the past and since forgot it, or received the router as a hand-me-down and the previous owner didn't reset it, you'll need to press and hold the \"Reset\" button on the router for about 30 seconds. This will reset the settings to default, allowing you to log in with the default username and password."

Some routers will ask that you type the password again to ensure that you entered it correctly. [4] X Research source Try to create a strong password that would be difficult if not impossible to guess. It should not be related to anything personal, and should include a mix of numbers, random capital and lower-case letters, and special characters such as \"!\", \"$\" and \"#\". A strong password is usually at least 8 characters long."

You may run into issues connecting older devices, however, in which case you could switch to WPA or WPA/WPA2. Selecting WEP is NOT recommended, as WEP encryption is straightforward to break (it can take less than 30 minutes to crack a WEP password). [5] X Research source"
