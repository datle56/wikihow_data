      "content": "If someone snaps your bracelet, they want what you’re offering. Jelly bracelets are most commonly worn at school and parties to say, “Hey! This is what I’m into.” This is also known as a “sex game.” If someone is also into the same thing or is ready to try the sexual act out, they’ll snap that color bracelet on, or even break it off, the wearer. For example, say Lisa is wearing an orange jelly bracelet. This means she is willing to kiss someone. If Johnny goes up and snaps the orange bracelet on her wrist, he’s willing to kiss her."

      "content": "Jelly bracelets bring up concerns about sexual consent and readiness. Many people have expressed concern about teens being peer-pressured into wearing “sex bracelets” and performing sexual acts. If you feel pressured to wear a bracelet or someone snaps it and you don’t want to participate in the act, it’s okay to say “no” or change your mind. Even if your friends are ready to have sex, it doesn’t mean you have to be. Sexual readiness is different for everyone, so go at your own pace and only do what you're comfortable with . [2] X Research source Just because you wear a jelly bracelet doesn’t mean you give consent to a sexual act. Consent is a willing agreement where there’s no pressure to say “yes.” You always have the power to say “no.” [3] X Research source Try to walk away from uncomfortable situations if you can. When saying “no,” be clear and direct. Use a serious tone and speak with confidence. [4] X Research source You have the right to feel safe. If you don’t, confide in a trusted adult or call RAINN’s Hotline (1-800-656-4673) for support and guidance. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "No, jelly bracelets don’t always have a sexual meaning. For every generation, company, or person, jelly bracelets can symbolize different things. Teens and young adults may use them to indicate their sexual status or preferences, but the bracelets can also be used to raise awareness for specific causes. For instance, pink bracelets are often worn to spread awareness for breast cancer. Similarly, different colors can also be associated with specific months, such as orange in March for Women’s History Month and blue in September for Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. Keep in mind that this is all a matter of opinion! If you like the look of jelly bracelets, wear them. They can mean whatever you want them to mean."

In 2004, colored silicone bracelets made a resurgence when athlete Lance Armstrong started wearing and selling them. As a cancer survivor, Armstrong designed yellow bracelets with the words “Live Strong” on them. Eighty million bracelets were sold, raising millions of dollars for cancer research. [8] X Research source The bracelet was originally produced by Nike, but after Nike cut ties with Armstrong in 2012, Armstrong continued production through his own company, Livestrong.
