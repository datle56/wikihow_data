      "content": "Find the area of your property to build the dog run. Most people prefer to build the dog run in their backyards as it provides an environment where a dog is less likely to be disturbed by traffic. The dog run should be constructed in an area you can easily see and monitor from inside your home. Area should be well-shaded to keep your pet cool in the summer months. [1] X Research source Make sure there are no poisonous plants. If you have an outside water tap, consider placing your dog run around it or nearby so you can easily get water for your pet."

      "content": "Consider the size of your pet. While a dog run doesn't have to be very big, you may need a less or more depending on the size of your pet. At a minimum, a dog run should be at least 4 feet by 8 feet. This will allow most dogs to move a little and get a little exercise. Ideally, longer cages give your dog a chance to run back and forth, hence the name \"dog run.\" Dog runs can be long or square. Choose a shape based on what works best with your yard. If you have a doghouse you want to incorporate inside the dog run, you should figure the size of it in your planning as well."

      "content": "Clear the area. Put stakes in the ground and run a line around the area for your dog run. Use a garden tiller or rake to remove the grass and loosen the dirt on ground. Excavate the pad to a depth of up to six inches. In most cases 3-4 inches is adequate, go for six if you plan to pour concrete. You may choose to leave grass in half of the run and excavate the other half and train your dog to use that area. Before digging be sure to check for any utility lines that might be in the way. If you aren't sure where the lines are located, contact your local providers and they can come out and mark them off for you."

      "content": "Dig holes for the fence posts. Use a post-hole digger to dig a hole one to two feet deep. It should be twice as wide as the post that you will be using for your fence. Start at the corners and make post at even distances along the sides. Leave several inches of space between the hole that was dug out for the floor and the fence post holes."

      "content": "Select the material for the flooring. Constructing the flooring is crucial to creating a good dog run. You can use inexpensive materials like mulch or gravel, however if your dog likes digging you might need a different idea. Concrete is often used, but care must be taken to create an adequate solution for draining. Flooring systems are interlocking panels or grids that are raised off the ground. They allow a nice surface for pets to walk on, but still provide adequate drainage. You can even cover the floor with artificial grass."

      "content": "Fill the dug out area if doing a mulch or gravel dog run. Use a rake or shovel to evenly spread the material. Keep adding until it comes about 2 inches above the ground. Use boards or small plastic landscaping borders to keep the material in the desired area. While this is one of the more affordable flooring solutions for your dog run, eventually the material will need to be dug up and replaced. Even if you clean the area regularly, replacing the flooring will be the only way to avoid build up of odors and bacteria."

      "title": "Pour a concrete base.",
      "content": "Pour a concrete base. To construct a concrete base, first spray the dug out area with water. This will prevent your concrete from drying out too much while pouring. Build a \"form\" around the desired shape of the concrete pad using 2\" by 6\" boards. Mix the concrete in a large wheelbarrow according to the directions. Then, prepare a bed of three inches of medium gravel. Finally, pour three inches of concrete into the form. Use a board to smooth over the surface so the concrete Wait at least 48 hours for the concrete to become completely solid. In cold climates, add reinforcing fiberglass mesh to prevent the concrete from cracking. Finish the surface so it is medium smooth. Excessively rough surface can irritate your pet's paws. Make sure the concrete drains properly, ideally not into the doorway. If you feel like pouring the concrete might be too much for you, it might be best to hire a professional."

Use a level to check that the post is straight and adjust it if necessary before it dries. Allow a day or two for the concrete to dry before proceeding If you don't have someone to hold the post, use cable or rope to tie the post to two stakes in the ground to keep it steady."
