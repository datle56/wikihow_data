You can wear anything you like, some ideas for what to wear are: Graphic tees from Billabong, Quicksilver, Nike, Vans, etc., long sports shorts, sandals or flip-flops, sweatshirts, and jeans or khakis.

      "content": "Say, \"Hi.\" It's so easy to be popular. All you have to do is say hi to everybody in your school or compliment others if you want to. Saying hi definitely breaks the ice. You can also compliment others, by saying things like: \"Hey dude, nice shoes. Are you a skater dude or something?\" He most likely will respond back - if he doesn't then find somebody else. Same goes with complimenting girls; don't say something like: \"Hey, I love your hair.\" Or \"I really like your shirt today.\" Treat her like a Guy. Say similar things. If she doesn't respond then move on. There are tons of boys and girls who like you. You just have to find the right people."
