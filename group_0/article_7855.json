      "content": "Scrape any excess paint off of the brush. Before you wash your brush, wipe the bristles on the inner rim of the open paint can a few times to scrape off as much paint as possible. Make sure you scrape both sides of the brush. [2] X Research source Scraping off as much paint as possible will make the cleaning process faster and easier."

      "content": "Wipe the brush with a piece of newspaper. Once you’ve scraped off as much paint as you can, wipe the brush off on some newspaper. This will help remove any remaining wet residue that didn’t come off when you scraped the brush. [3] X Research source Keep wiping the brush on the paper until it stops leaving marks."

      "content": "Fill a bucket with warm, soapy water. A mild dish detergent is ideal for this purpose. After filling a bucket with warm water, add a few drops of the detergent and mix it in. [4] X Research source Alternatively, you can wash your brush in a sink under warm, running water."

      "content": "Work hardened paint out of the bristles with a paintbrush comb. [5] X Expert Source Patrick Coye Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 22 July 2020. Dip a paintbrush comb in the bucket of soapy water and work the tines through the bristles of your brush. This will separate the bristles and loosen paint that is caught in between them. You can get a paintbrush comb at a hardware, home supply, or art supply store. Some painters prefer to use a wire brush rather than a paintbrush comb. However, the wires may damage your brush if you do this frequently."

      "content": "Bend the bristles with your fingers under the water. After working through the bristles with the comb, dip the brush in the bucket and massage it with your hand to remove any remaining paint. [6] X Research source Bend the bristles back and forth to help loosen the paint as you rinse. Keep doing this until the brush looks clean. If you’re rinsing the brush under running water rather than in a bucket, add a couple of drops of detergent to the base of the bristles. Keep working the bristles with your fingers until the water runs clear."

      "title": "Spin the brush to remove water from the bristles.",
      "content": "Spin the brush to remove water from the bristles. Attach your brush to a brush spinner and depress the plunger to spin it inside an empty bucket. This will help remove the soapy water and any paint residue still remaining in the brush. [7] X Research source You can buy a brush spinner at a hardware, home, or art supply store. If you don’t have a brush spinner, shake the brush at the top of a bucket to get the excess water out. [8] X Research source"

If you think there may be any stubborn paint remaining in the brush, repeat the rinse and spin process one more time. [10] X Research source You may need to reshape the brush a little with your fingers after spinning it. If you don’t have a spinner, shake the brush over a bucket and then gently blot it dry with a clean rag or newspaper."

Tie the paper in place with a bit of string. This will help keep the bristles nice and straight. [11] X Research source Many brushes come with a cover over the bristles. If you have your brush’s original cover, use that instead of the paper. In retaining its shape, you want to keep all the bristles on your brush running in the same direction as opposed to letting them fray or open up.

      "content": "Purchase a solvent-based brush cleaner. If the latex paint has hardened out and dried into your bristles, washing it in soapy water may not be enough. Purchase a solvent-based cleaner, such as Klean Strip Brush Cleaner or Crown Brush Cleaner. [13] X Research source Solvent-based cleaners will work for both natural bristle and synthetic brushes, and can remove a wide variety of paint types. There are also solvent-free brush cleaners on the market, but some of these are not suitable for natural brushes. Read the label carefully to determine if the cleanser is safe to use on your brush."

Use enough so that the bristles of your brush will be fully submerged. [15] X Research source You can also use a metal coffee can, but it won’t be as easy to see what’s happening inside the container if you do this."

      "title": "Suspend the brush upright in the cleaner.",
      "content": "Suspend the brush upright in the cleaner. Submerge the bristles in the cleaning solution, but don’t let them rest on the bottom of the jar. This will cause the bristles to become misshapen as they soften. You may need to use a clip or a piece of wire across the top of the jar to suspend your brush. [16] X Research source If you’re using a coffee can, cut a slit in the lid and pull the brush handle through. This will keep your brush upright and suspended. If you’re using a coffee can without a lid, you can suspend the brush in the can using a piece of coat hanger wire. Drill a hole through the handle of the brush above the ferule and slide the wire through it, then lay the wire across the top of the can with the brush suspended from it."

      "title": "Let the brush soak overnight or until the bristles soften.",
      "content": "Let the brush soak overnight or until the bristles soften. The brush will need to soak for several hours in order to soften the dried-on paint. Leave the jar or can in a well-ventilated area overnight, then check to see if the bristles have become soft. If not, let them continue to soak for a full 24 hours. [18] X Research source Depending on how much paint is dried into the brush, it may need to soak for a couple of days."

      "content": "Use a paintbrush comb to remove excess paint. Once the bristles become soft and pliable, run a paintbrush comb through them. This will separate them and help remove the softened paint buildup. [19] X Research source Since the solvent contains harsh chemicals, use gloves while you’re handling the brush. Durable gloves made of nitrile are the best option for handling most types of brush cleaning solvents."
