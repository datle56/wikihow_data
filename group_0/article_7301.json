      "content": "A chevron mustache is a classic style with a slightly inverted V shape. It was popularized in the 1980s by celebrities like Burt Reynolds and Tom Selleck, who were famous for playing masculine, rugged characters. [1] X Research source As such, a lot of people associate the chevron mustache with manliness and toughness. Having a chevron is also a sign that you take special care with grooming since it takes a long time to grow this style to follow the shape of the upper lip and maintain its length without it getting into your mouth. Today, you can spot actors like Henry Cavill, Donald Glover, and Pedro Pascal sporting modern chevron mustaches. Who looks good with a chevron mustache? Oval face shapes look great with a chevron, while more square-shaped faces may end up looking wider with one. These are just general guidelines, though—if you want to try the chevron, go for it and see how it looks!"

      "content": "Grow out your facial hair for 8 weeks or until your mustache is full. The growing period is different for everybody, but in general, it should take at least 2-3 months to grow out your mustache to the perfect chevron length and thickness. [2] X Research source You can trim your beard hair as you go if you want or leave it in case you want a beardstache or you change your mind about the chevron style later on. While your facial hair is growing, trim the hair on your neck and above your beard and mustache line to prevent the stubble from looking scraggly and unkempt. Just remember to leave the hair above your upper lip untouched for now. How long does it take to grow out a chevron mustache? It depends on how fast your hair grows, how full it is, and how much you have to start with. If you're growing out a mustache from scratch, it will usually take at least 2 months to look truly full."

      "content": "Apply beard oil to your mustache and beard stubble as it grows in. This step will moisturize your face, nourish the hair, and encourage it to come in faster. Pour 1 to 3 drops of beard oil into your palma and rub it into your facial hair once a day. Wait until after you shower or wash your face so you can apply the oil to a clean surface. For medium or long beards, use 6 to 10 drops."

      "title": "Wash your beard and mustache with beard shampoo and conditioner.",
      "content": "Wash your beard and mustache with beard shampoo and conditioner . To avoid drying out your skin and hair, only use the shampoo 2-3 times per week and the conditioner 3-5 times in the same period. This will keep it clean and eliminate bad smells from trapped food and oils. It will also help soften your stubble. [3] X Research source Only use shampoo and conditioner specifically designed for facial hair, as these are less harsh than regular shower products and won't strip the oils from your skin as easily."

      "content": "Shave your beard and all the hair above your mustache line. A true chevron mustache stands alone without any beard or stubble shadowing it. Turn on your electric beard trimmer and use it to shave your beard off. Take care to avoid your mustache and leave it completely intact for now. [4] X Research source While the classic chevron mustache doesn't come with a beard, feel free to buck the mold—trim your beard slightly shorter to make the mustache pop, or trim all your facial hair to the same length for a chevron-with-full beard look."

      "title": "Shape your mustache into a chevron with an electric trimmer.",
      "content": "Shape your mustache into a chevron with an electric trimmer. First, comb your dry, clean mustache hair downward with a mustache comb . Turn the trimmer on and clean up the bottom edge of the mustache so it aligns with the curve of your upper lip. [5] X Research source This will help you achieve the slightly inverted V-shape of the chevron style. Finally, trim the ends of your mustache so they rest just past the corners of your mouth, in line with your bottom lip. [6] X Research source Remember that the chevron mustache is supposed to look thick and full, so avoid trimming too much. You should trim just enough to align the mustache shape with the natural curve of your upper lip so it doesn't hang over your lip line. Remove any straggling, scraggly hairs. Use mustache scissors to snip any stray long hairs the trimmer misses."

      "content": "Trim your chevron mustache whenever it starts to look overgrown. Apply the same technique you used when shaping your chevron mustache: comb the mustache hairs downward, then clean up the edges just above your upper lip line while leaving as much length and thickness as possible. Use either an electric trimmer or mustache scissors as your hair-trimming tool. [7] X Research source How often should you trim your mustache? It depends on how fast the hair grows, but generally, trim about once a week or so, or whenever you notice it looks overgrown. Trimming too often can take away from the chevron's classic fullness. If you notice hair getting into your mouth or nostrils, that's a good sign it's time to reign the mustache back in with a trim. Mustache scissors will help you make smaller, more precise cuts if you're new to the mustache game. The electric trimmer will do the job faster, though, and help you cut an even line on the bottom edge. Just remember not to go overboard and trim too much; you can't glue the hair back on!"

      "content": "Work mustache wax into your mustache to make it easier to shape. Mustache wax contains beeswax and other natural ingredients. As the product dries, it stiffens and holds your mustache hairs in place. To use it , scoop out a tiny amount to start with and rub it between your fingers. Then spread the product evenly onto your mustache. [8] X Research source If the hairs aren't holding their shape the way you want, use a little more wax."

      "content": "Comb out your chevron mustache so it lays thick on your lip. Using a mustache comb, stroke the hairs downward to emphasize the fullness and thickness of the mustache. Angle the comb outward slightly when you reach the hairs that follow the curve of your upper lip. This will help you maintain the chevron's subtle inverted V silhouette. [9] X Research source The wax you applied in the previous step will help hold your mustache hairs down where you comb them."

This facial hair style features a full mustache above the lip and sides that grow straight downward down the sides of the mouth to the chin.

      "content": "Pyramid Mustache In the pyramid mustache, we see another style that's somewhat similar to the chevron, but with one key difference: the sides of the mustache have a more prominent downward angle. This is what gives the mustache its pyramid shape. While Burt Reynolds was known for his chevron mustache, he also wore the pyramid style well in one of his most famous films, Smokey and the Bandit .

The long ends of this mustache style are detached from the skin so they can be set with mustache wax and twirled into a spiral or a curl . The handlebar is also popular among people who enjoy wearing vintage styles with a modern twist, like hipsters. In other words, you don't have to be a swashbuckling bad guy to enjoy this look!

This style (which was worn by US president Theodore Roosevelt) is a bit on the bushy side, with the sides carefully combed to wisp out in either direction. It also somewhat resembles the whiskers on a walrus, hence the name. [13] X Research source"

The top of the Dallas mustache grows all the way up to the nostrils, with either side extending from that point at a slight downward angle. Both sides of the mustache protrude over the top lip and end similarly to the chevron: straight instead of curved and aligned with the bottom lip. [14] X Research source"

It all depends on how well you like the look of your beard and chevron mustache together and how prominent you want your mustache to look on your face."
