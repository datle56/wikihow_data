Create the part slightly off to the side so 60% of your hair is falling to one side and 40% is falling to the other.

      "content": "Massage pomade or styling clay into your hair. To help you style your hair and keep it in place, professional hair stylist Janet Miranda suggests using a matte pomade or clay. She says to add a small, dollop-sized amount to your hands and rub them together to “warm it up” so “the pomade dissolves in your hand”—this prevents the product from clumping in your hair. Then, run your hands through your hair and massage the product into your strands. Miranda notes that matte pomades and clays are great for fine and oily hair, as they don’t weigh down your hair. If you have thick, coarse, or curly hair, Miranda suggests using a liquid pomade or glossy pomade . She says these products are “really good because they're easier to disperse throughout the hair.” Professional hair stylist Steven Waldman says pomades and clays are great for hold and styling because they’re flexible. These products “stay malleable” and allow you to “run your fingers through your hair” without having a crunchy, over-styled feeling."

      "content": "Dry your hair with a hair dryer. To add more volume to your hair, aim the hair dryer so it’s blowing your hair upwards; professional hair stylist Martin Nepton says this “lifts the root more so you'll have maximum lift.” Alternatively, professional hair stylist Gina Almona suggests “blow drying the hair upside down,” with your “head upside down” to help add extra volume. If you have wavy or curly hair, dry your hair with a diffuser . This helps define your waves or curls without adding frizz. Almona recommends applying a thermal protectant to your hair before you blow dry it to “protect the hair from the heat.” Feel free to let your hair air dry, if you prefer."

      "content": "Keep the hair on the top of your head long and the sides shorter. To style the 60/40 haircut, you need enough length on top to achieve a voluminous, brushed-back look. So, simply ask your hairstylist or barber to keep the hair on the top of your hair long. Then, cut the sides and back of your hair shorter depending on the style you like. For instance, go for a high or low fade , or simply shorten the sides at a slight taper. Licensed cosmetologist Tiffany Carnevale-Russo highly recommends that you find the style that you want and bring in a few example pictures to show your barber or stylist so they can give you the look you like. Carnevale-Russo also advises that you let your barber or stylist know that you want to style your hair into a part. She says this allows your barber or stylist to “educate you on how to style it properly with the styling products that work best for your hair type.”"

      "content": "The 60/40 hairstyle looks great on most face shapes and hair textures. The 60/40 hairstyle is a classic and versatile hairstyle that complements most people. Since the side part isn’t severe and only slightly off-center, it works well on people with round, oval, square, rectangular, heart, and diamond face shapes. It’s also super easy to style, whether you have straight, wavy, or curly hair. While the 60/40 cut looks great on most people, Sanderson advises that you determine your face shape to help you choose a flattering haircut and style. He recommends consulting your barber or stylist, as they are “able to differentiate whether or not [a hairstyle] would be feasible” for you."
