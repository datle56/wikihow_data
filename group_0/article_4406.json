Brush out your hair once more to make sure there are no knots, and then you’re ready to start your braids. Blow-drying your hair will help stretch and relax the curls, reducing frizz and making the hair easier to manage during the braiding process."

      "title": "Prepare your packages of braiding hair.",
      "content": "Prepare your packages of braiding hair. Box braids use ‘braid hair’ – synthetic hair strands that are very long – to fill in the space on your scalp and give you plenty of fullness in your braids. Take each chunk of hair out of the packages individually, and hold them in the center, cutting off the elastic bands holding it together. With a grip on the center and the 2 tail ends of the hair hanging down, begin pulling the strands on 1 side of the hair. This will give the ends of your hair a more natural look, otherwise the packaged hair is blunt-cut straight across and your braids will look a bit unnatural when you’re finished. [3] X Research source Choose your braid hair in a color similar to your own, and get at least 2 large packages. The longer and thicker you want your braids to be, the more packages of braid hair you will need. If you want shorter braids, use fewer packages and cut the braid hair into halves or thirds. When you’re pulling the hair, gently tug at small strands rather than big portions of hair. Run your fingers through the hair when you’re finished evening out the ends to remove any knots that might have shown up."

Then, separate off ⅓ of this section. You should be holding 2 sections with 1 that is twice as thick as the other. Wrap the smaller strand around the larger one, so that the tail ends are facing opposite directions (like ‘><’). Take the smaller strand and grab it at the center where it is intertwined with the first strand. Carefully twist the strand over and under, so that the 2 tail ends form a single piece that sticks out between the original tail strands. You should be left with 3 strands of approximately equal size, which you can hold in 1 hand."

Use a bit of hair gel or edge control product to prepare this section, making it easier to manipulate.

Grab the section of hair closest to your scalp with your thumb and index finger, as close to the roots as possible. To start the braid: Reach your empty hand around your head and grab the third strand of braiding hair hanging behind the ones gripped in your hand. Simultaneously pull the 3rd strand of hair under and incorporate the hair from your scalp into the section between your thumb and index finger, and twist it over in the opposite direction. Pull the third loose section of hair into the middle, between the other 2 sections. You should now have 3 separate strands of hair that are held tight to your scalp, with your natural hair incorporated into 1 of the sections."
