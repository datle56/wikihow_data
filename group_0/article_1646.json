Here are some examples: [13] X Research source “Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues but the parent of all others.” – Cicero “There is no better excess in the world than the excess of gratitude.” – Jean de La Bruyère “One single grateful thought raised to heaven is the most perfect prayer.” – Gotthold Ephraim Lessing “Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it.” – William Arthur Ward “We must find time to stop and thank the people who make a difference in our lives.” – John F. Kennedy “When it comes to life, the critical thing is whether you take things for granted or take them with gratitude.” – G. K. Chesterton “The more you practice the art of thankfulness, the more you have to be thankful for.” – Norman Vincent Peale “No one who achieves success does so without the help of others. The wise and confident acknowledge this help with gratitude.” – Alfred North Whitehead “Appreciation is a wonderful thing. It makes what is excellent in others belong to us as well.” – Voltaire “Gratitude turns what we have into enough, and more.” – Melody Beattie “The smallest act of kindness is worth more than the grandest intention.” – Oscar Wilde “If the only prayer you said was ‘thank you,’ that would be enough.” – Meister Eckhart “Gratitude is the most exquisite form of courtesy.” Jacques Maritain “Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom.” – Marcel Proust “I can no other answer make but thanks, and thanks, and ever thanks.” – William Shakespeare"
