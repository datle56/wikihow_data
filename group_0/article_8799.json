      "title": "Place your foot on the back metal leg of the seat.",
      "content": "Place your foot on the back metal leg of the seat. While your Tommy Bahama chair is still in the upright position, set one of your feet on the back metal bar. At this point, make sure that all side pockets and storage pouches are empty, so nothing spills out. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Push the backrest forward to fold the chair.",
      "content": "Push the backrest forward to fold the chair. Keep stepping on the back metal bar as you begin collapsing your seat. Nudge the backrest forward with 1 hand, and let the seat fully collapse. [3] X Research source Check that the back towel bar is flat against back of the chair after you’ve closed the seat."

      "title": "Secure the buckle along the top of the seat.",
      "content": "Secure the buckle along the top of the seat. Find half of the plastic buckle attached to a strap on top of the backrest. Additionally, look for the pronged plastic buckle that’s attached to the base of the seat. Clip both buckles into place so that the backrest and seat portions don’t separate from one another in transit. [4] X Research source This buckle is identical to the style seen on many fanny packs. Shake out the chair to get rid of any loose sand before you start carrying the chair. Make sure that you pull the top buckle strap beneath the handle."

    {
      "title": "Slip your arms beneath the padded straps to carry the chair.",
      "content": "Slip your arms beneath the padded straps to carry the chair. Search for the 2 padded straps that run parallel to one another beneath the seat cushion. As if you’re putting on a backpack, place an arm under each strap and pull the straps onto your shoulders. Make sure that the seat is close to your back as you stand and walk. [5] X Research source This style of transportation is best if you need your hands free for other items, like bags and beach blankets. Alternatively, you can hold onto the rubber handle attached to the top of the backrest to transport the chair. Tommy Bahama chairs only weigh about 7 pounds (3,200 g), so they aren’t too difficult to carry."

      "title": "Unclip the buckle that holds the chair together.",
      "content": "Unclip the buckle that holds the chair together. Press the outer prongs of the buckle inwards. While these prongs are still pushed in, pull out the bottom buckle in a quick, swift motion. Flip the top buckle strap behind the backrest for safekeeping, and dangle the bottom buckle beneath the seat rest. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pull apart the backrest and seat cushion until the seat is extended.",
      "content": "Pull apart the backrest and seat cushion until the seat is extended. Set 1 hand on the top of the backrest and another on the edge of the seat cushion. Continue pulling these sections apart until the seat is in an upright position. If you’d like to recline your seat, apply some slight pressure beneath the right armrest while you’re seated. [7] X Research source Tommy Bahama chairs can recline to 5 different positions. The chair doesn’t click into place as you adjust, but moves in a fluid motion. If you want, you can make the seat lie completely flat. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Check that both metal legs are secure before sitting down.",
      "content": "Check that both metal legs are secure before sitting down. Make sure that your chair is placed a flat, sturdy section on the ground. Before sitting down, quickly examine both metal bars to ensure that they’re fully extended. After that, you’re ready to sit and relax in your Tommy Bahama chair! [9] X Research source"
