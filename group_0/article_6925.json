      "content": "Remove the cap on the trimmer’s head. The cap is covering the spool you need to access to change the wire. With the trimmer off, flip the trimmer upside down so you’re looking at the part that’s normally facing the ground. The cap is the container housing the spool of wire inside of the lawn trimmer. Take the battery out (or unplug the trimmer if it has a cord). Then, either unscrew or pop the cap off. On a lot of caps, you press on the 2 tabs locking the cap in place to remove it. [1] X Research source On some trimmers, there is a little divot where you just pry the cap off with your finger. If this is an older whipper snipper or it has been a while since the thread has been changed, the cap will probably stick a bit—you may need to use a bit of pressure. On some newer trimmers, you don’t even take the cap off. You just pull out the old line and feed a new one into it (Ryobi in particular seems fond of this design). There are some minor variations between brands, but the vast majority of lawn trimmer strings are changed the way we’ll outline here. Always refer to your instruction manual for unique instructions."

      "title": "Take out the old spool by hand.",
      "content": "Take out the old spool by hand. Reach inside the cap’s housing and gently pull the plastic disc out. The spool is the only thing inside of the lawn trimmer’s cap, so lightly jostle it loose if it won’t come free on its own. Remove the entire spool with the wire attached and set the trimmer aside. [2] X Research source You may need to cut the wire where it sticks out of the housing if it’s stuck. Use nippers, tin snips, or shears if you need to. Take a mental note of which side of the spool is facing out when you remove it. You can only install it one way normally, but it may make things easier if you remember the orientation now. What if the spool doesn’t move? Look on the sides of the spool for two little buttons. Press them both in and try to lift the spool out then."

      "title": "Remove the previous lawn trimmer string.",
      "content": "Remove the previous lawn trimmer string. Undo the old wire from the spool and inspect the connection to the spool. Pay close attention to how the final 5–6 inches (13–15 cm) of the thread are connected to the spool. You’re going to attach your new string in the exact same way. Usually, there is a loop or opening in the spool that the end of the string goes through to pin the string in place. [3] X Research source If the string isn’t inserted into a loop or opening, there may be a tiny clip that pins that wire against the center of the spool. If there are 2 or 3 different lengths of string, you may need to insert 2 or 3 lengths of string into the openings. What if there’s plenty of good string left? Then congrats! You don’t need to replace the string, you can just pull a new length out through the hole on the spool and then close the case. You only need to replace the string if you’re about to run out or the string has been damaged somehow."

      "title": "Feed the new wire into the hole on the spool.",
      "content": "Feed the new wire into the hole on the spool. Attach the new string the same way the old string was installed. Unpack your replacement wire and clip off roughly 10–25 feet (3.0–7.6 m) using shears, nippers, or tin snips. Take any end of the string and thread it through the spool the same way your old string was attached. [4] X Research source The round wire tends to hold up better than the flat plastic stuff, but whipper snippers aren’t universally compatible with any kind of string. Refer to your manual to determine what kind of wire you can use. Alternative: Some newer trimmer models sell pre-wound spools you can simply swap out instead of replacing the string (Black and Decker models are the most popular brand that does this). If you have a 2-string trimmer but there’s only one opening for it on the spool, pull the string through the opening until you’ve reached the middle so you have 2 equal haves hanging off the spool."

      "title": "Wind the new string up tightly around the spool.",
      "content": "Wind the new string up tightly around the spool. Evenly wrap your fresh line around the spool in even rows. You don’t need to be super precise here, but aim to keep the wire evenly distributed. There’s usually an arrow that tells you which direction the string goes, but when in doubt, roll it clockwise. Keep it taut and firm all the way around and build the spool up to just below the rim. Do not add so much string that it extends past the rim of the spool. If you have a 2- or 3-line trimmer, roll the wire evenly around each of the individual sections (a 2-line trimmer will have 2 slots, and a 3-line trimmer will have 3 slots)."

      "title": "Clip the excess wire off with tin snips or shears.",
      "content": "Clip the excess wire off with tin snips or shears. Leave 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) of wire at the end so the trimmer works. You need a little bit of extra wire to hang out and rip the foliage when your trimmer runs. Use your tin snips , nippers , or shears to cut the wire. Hold the rolled-up spool tight by hand and grab your trimmer to reinstall the cap and spool together. [5] X Research source On some trimmers, you can lock the spool in place by pressing on tabs or squeezing the spool together until you hear a click."

      "title": "Reinstall the spool in its housing on the trimmer.",
      "content": "Reinstall the spool in its housing on the trimmer. Flip the end of the trimmer over and carefully slide the spool into place. Set the opening in the middle of the spool over the axle in the lawn trimmer and thread the wire through the opening on the trimmer where the string sticks out and rotates. Remember to orient the spool the same way it was oriented when you removed it! There will typically be a logo or note on the side that’s supposed to face away from the trimmer."

      "content": "Set the cap on top of the spool to lock the assembly. Put the cap back on the spool the same way you took it off. Take the cap that you removed from the trimmer and set it in place. Push it down gently until you hear a click, screw the cap on, or align the tabs and lock them together. However you removed the cap, reverse the steps to put the cap back on. [6] X Research source Once the cap is locked, you’re good to go! Your whipper snapper cord will cut and trim like new. Why is my new trimmer making a funny noise? Your weed wacker string is too long and it’s banging against the protective cover. Just clip the end of the wire off."

      "content": "Choose your string based on the work you’re doing. There are a few different types of line trimmer string and they’re designed for different jobs. Read your lawn trimmer’s instruction manual to see what kind of string it can use, but you generally have 5 different options: [7] X Research source Round trimmer line : This is the most common type of stringer line. It’s good for all-purpose yard work and it generally doesn’t break very easily. If you’re doing basic yard work, this is probably the way to go. Twisted trimmer line : Twisted trimmer cuts much harder than the all-purpose stuff. If you’re cutting thicker weeds or dense plants, this is your best bet. Multi-sided trimmer line : Multi-sided trimmer line cuts through softer materials better than twisted line, but it breaks much more easily than other varieties if you hit something hard. Serrated trimmer line : Serrated trimmer line is for the toughest weeds. The cutting power is serious stuff though, and it’s usually overkill for amateur yard work. Square trimmer line : Square lines are like serrated lines, just without the miniature blades. It’s super powerful stuff that cuts through almost anything but it’s probably too much power for simple yard work."
