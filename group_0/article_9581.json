When you experience anger, your body undergoes a chemical process that activates your biological “fight or flight” response.

      "content": "Be aware of your triggers. Monitoring your outbursts of temper or thinking about what usually sets you off can help you identify your temper triggers. [2] X Research source A trigger is something that happens that makes you have an automatic reaction. Triggers are usually tied to past emotions or memories (even if you aren’t consciously aware of them). Some common triggers for anger include: [3] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Feeling out of control of your own life, another person’s actions, or your environment or situation Believing that someone is trying to manipulate you Getting mad at yourself for making a mistake"

      "content": "Avoid known triggers. If you are aware of specific circumstances that are likely to trigger your temper, do your best to avoid them. You may particularly need to focus on avoidance if you have other factors that may contribute to a shorter temper such as a lack of sleep, another emotionally-straining event, or increased life or job stress. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source For example, if getting yelled at by your boss is a trigger for your anger, you could avoid the trigger by removing yourself from the situation or asking for a moment to yourself.

To practice progressive muscle relaxation, take a few deep breaths, then do the following: [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Begin with your face and head muscles.

Remind yourself that you do not have to respond or react immediately. Leave the situation, think about a reasoned response, then react later, when the anger has subsided. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you cannot physically leave, you can still give yourself a delay by stopping to count to 10 (or 20, or 50, or 100) before you respond."

      "title": "Find humor in the situation.",
      "content": "Find humor in the situation. Because anger is, in part, a chemical reaction, if you can change the chemicals in your body, you can circumvent a temper outbreak. Trying to find humor in a situation, or getting yourself laughing about something else, will diffuse the situation by changing your body’s chemical reaction. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source For example, if you find that your children have dumped a bag of flour over your entire kitchen, your initial reaction may be anger. However, if you stop and try to look at the situation objectively (perhaps pretending that it is someone else’s kitchen!), you may be able to laugh about it instead. Having a good laugh and then rallying the troops to help you clean up the mess can turn a negative situation into a funny memory."

      "content": "Try cognitive restructuring. Cognitive restructuring helps you replace automatic negative thoughts with more functional or appropriate ways of thinking. [15] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Anger may distort your thoughts, but learning to apply reason to your thoughts can make them clear again and can help you avoid losing your temper. [16] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source For example, you may get a flat tire on your way to work. Your automatic negative thinking caused by anger may lead you to think “My whole day is ruined! I am going to get in trouble at work! Why does this kind of thing always happen to me?!” If you restructure your thinking to take a reasoned look at your comments, you may realize that one setback does not automatically ruin your whole day, that your workplace may understand that things like that happen, and that it’s unlikely that this “always” happens to you (unless you get a flat tire daily, in which case you may want to reevaluate your driving). It also may help to realize that anger at the situation will not help any; in fact, it could hurt by making it more difficult to focus on finding a solution (such as changing the tire)."
