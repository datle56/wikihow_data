Scented lotions can aggravate your skin and cause breakouts or an allergic reaction, and oily lotions will encourage acne. [3] X Research source For a more natural look, instead of using foundation, use a tinted moisturizer. Tinted moisturizers blend in while evening out your skin tone and commonly contain SPF. People with clearer skin will look best using tinted moisturizer. [4] X Research source"

[5] X Expert Source Charina Redugerio Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 26 May 2020. [6] X Research source Make sure this is the exact same color as your skin. When you apply the concealer, do so directly on the spot and not around it. This is to avoid a halo effect and emphasis of the spot. Optionally set with beige powder. Be careful not to overdo it on the concealer; you only need enough to cover the spot. You can also choose from a few different types of concealer, including liquid, stick, and cream products. Reader Poll: We asked 160 wikiHow readers about their preferred type of concealer and 54% of them agreed that liquid concealer works best for them.

      "content": "Apply a powder foundation on the oilier parts of your face. Before you start, it’s best to determine whether or not you’re using the right foundation color. Get in a natural light and test the foundation to make sure it's the right color for your skin. Dab a few marks on your cheek and angle your face different ways to see if the color matches. [7] X Research source Take your finger or a sponge dab in the foundation, and dab it on your face, blending it until it looks like your skin tone. Be sure to go underneath your jaw line; if you stop at the edge of your face, there will be a clear line where the foundation ends, making it look like you’re wearing a mask. You don't need to apply foundation to your entire face. Just put it on areas that don't have a consistent color and blend it in.

      "content": "Apply Bronzer. Some people wait until after they have applied makeup to their eyes to add bronzer or blush. Bronzer is a great way to give yourself a natural glow. Lightly brush bronzer all over your face (or just along your cheekbones and T-Zone for a natural suntan appearance). [9] X Research source However, bronzer can look silly on people with pale skin if applied incorrectly. Practice at home with bronzer to see if it looks good on you before going out with it on. If you don't like the way it looks, skip this step."

      "title": "Apply Blush.",
      "content": "Apply Blush. If you were not happy with bronzer, you can apply blush instead. Crème blush generally works better than powder because it gives you a dewy look and lasts longer. Using a champagne-tinted crème blush, rub a little on your ring finger and blend onto your cheekbones. Note that you should not apply both blush and bronzer; choose one."

      "content": "Line your upper lashline with a brown, black or gray kohl pencil. Some women prefer not to do this, as eyeliner looks a little less natural than an eye with just mascara. Other beauty specialists say to line your eyes with a roasted-colored gel liner. Pencil looks less natural than liquid or gel liner and gel is easier to blend. Line two thirds of your top lashline and one third of your bottom lashline. Smudge the line with a cotton bud."

      "content": "Consider using eyeshadow. Use two shades of eyeshadow for a professional look. The colors you choose should be golds, browns or silvers, depending on your skin tone and coloring. Apply a light, neutral tone all over your lid and just above your crease and use slightly darker to softly line the top lid and outline your crease. For a natural look, remember to blend the colors."
