This can be problematic around your gecko’s tail and toes, where blood flow can become constricted. If the problem goes untreated, your gecko might lose its toes or its tail due to a lack of oxygen. Fortunately, its tail will grow back. However, the toes will be gone forever. If you notice a buildup, you may want to moisten your gecko’s skin to help the excess fall off. In nature, geckos regularly lose their toes because of constricted blood flow due to skin buildup. Although this is disconcerting, your gecko should be fine. If it does lose a toe, keep an eye on the wound to make sure that it does not become infected."
