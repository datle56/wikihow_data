      "title": "Start by constructing the transition pieces.",
      "content": "Start by constructing the transition pieces. The transition pieces are the curved sections on the ends of your ramp. Begin with cutting out the curved sides of the transitions from sheets of plywood. Screw boards between the bottom corners of 2 transition pieces to form one side of the ramp. Then attach boards along the curved edges of the pieces to frame out the rest of the transition. [1] X Research source Typically, a standard beginner halfpipe is about 3 1 ⁄ 2 feet (1.1 m) tall and 8 feet (2.4 m) wide."

      "title": "Build and attach the flat bottom section of the ramp.",
      "content": "Build and attach the flat bottom section of the ramp. The flat bottom is the space between the transitions where you build momentum and prepare for the next trick. Frame a box shape for the flat bottom using 2 in × 4 in (5.1 cm × 10.2 cm) boards. Screw support boards inside of the box so the ramp doesn’t break. Place the flat bottom between the 2 transition pieces and screw them together. [2] X Research source When you’re finished, a beginner halfpipe will be about 27 feet (8.2 m) long. Make sure you attach the pieces on a level surface, or else the ramp will be crooked."

      "title": "Cover the ramp with plywood and ramp liner for a smooth surface.",
      "content": "Cover the ramp with plywood and ramp liner for a smooth surface. Start by securing a layer of plywood to the support boards on the flat bottom and transition pieces. After that, place another layer of plywood on top to help support your weight while using your ramp. Since plywood can be rough and difficult to ride on, put a final layer of ramp liner on top to smooth it out. [3] X Research source The liner material depends on where you use your ramp. If you’re building it indoors, you can use masonite since there isn’t a risk of water damage. If you’re outdoors, choose a weatherproof and waterproof ramp liner."

      "title": "Screw coping pipes on top of the transitions.",
      "content": "Screw coping pipes on top of the transitions. The copings are the straight metal pipes where the surface material meets the top corner of the transition piece. Skaters use copings for grinding without causing too much damage to their board. Simply drill holes through the pipes and set them into the lips on your transition pieces. Screw the pipes into the ramp so they stay in place. [4] X Research source You can use PVC pipe, but metal will last longer."

      "content": "Construct platforms next to the transitions for a place to stand. The platforms are the raised sections on the back of each transition so you have a place to relax and drop in to the ramp. Frame boxes that are the same length as your transitions and surface them with plywood. Attach the platforms to the transitions so they butt up against the copings. Screw more boards or posts to the bottom of the platform to support the weight of the platform. [5] X Research source"

[6] X Research source Get a 4 ft × 8 ft (1.2 m × 2.4 m) sheet of 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.9 cm) plywood that’s made for exterior use. Measure 3 1 ⁄ 2 inches (8.9 cm) in from one of the long sides and make a mark. Lay a straightedge on the mark so it’s parallel to the long side and use it to draw a straight line across the entire length of plywood. Then measure in the same distance from the other long edge and make another line. [7] X Research source The area between the lines will be the overall height of your halfpipe. If you want to make one that’s taller, you will need to use multiple sheets of plywood for a single side."

Keep the tape measure parallel to the short edges of the plywood and perpendicular to the lines you drew. Pull the measuring tape out until it’s extended 6 feet (1.8 m). [9] X Research source This means the horizontal distance from the front to the back of the transition is 6 feet (180 cm) and the ramp will have a gentle curve. You can always make the ramp steeper by decreasing the distance or gentler by increasing the distance, but avoid making it longer than the ramp’s height.

Hold a pencil vertically on the dot and wrap the string around it. [11] X Research source Always keep the string pulled tight, or else the string will be too long and screw up your measurements.
