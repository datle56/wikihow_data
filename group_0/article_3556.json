      "title": "Leverage your background in medical terminology.",
      "content": "Leverage your background in medical terminology. If you've already built up experience working in a doctor's office or hospital, use this to your advantage. Make sure you understand a wide variety of terms and classifications; if not, now's the time to brush up. If you don't have medical terminology experience, consider getting a part-time job in a local medical office. Or, if you don't have experience but you have a friend who's a home transcriptionist, ask him or her to show you the ropes. Sit in on a typical day and find out how the job is paced, what's expected, how doctors are invoiced, and so on."

      "content": "Know the odds. Most of the large agencies that hire at-home medical transcriptionists simply will not hire a person who has not had a course and/or real-time medical transcription experience at a hospital or doctor's office. Therefore, if you have the freedom to work outside the home for a couple of years it may well be worth looking for medical transcription experience outside of the home before attempting to start your home-based transcription business. [1] X Research source You can get into transcribing locally without training or real-time experience, but it will probably pay significantly less."

      "content": "Network with local doctors and hospitals. Visit offices and let them know you're picking up new clients. Leave your business card or a neatly printed slip with your contact information on it. [2] X Research source If you know anyone who works in the medical field, ask him or her to pass your name along if someone's looking for a transcriptionist. Go the extra mile to make your visit memorable. Instead of simply walking into a doctor's office and demanding time, leave a nicely written note and a small token, such as a small office plant or a specialty treat, such as toffee."

Present your prior medical terminology experience or training in a way that makes it easy for a potential client or employer to see that you have medical familiarity. A \"Skills\" section at the top of your resume that clearly lists medical terminology, typing speed, and any transcription experience is vital. [3] X Research source"
