      "title": "Keep your eyebrows completely dry for the first 24 hours.",
      "content": "Keep your eyebrows completely dry for the first 24 hours. This might be the most important thing you do after getting the lamination treatment! During the procedure, your technician spread several layers of chemical relaxer cream and shaped your brows. If you get your brows wet after the process, your brows don't have a chance to set and the style won't last long. Some technicians recommend keeping your brows dry for at least 48 hours, so ask your technician what they advise. It's completely fine to get your brows wet after the first day! If you get them wet within the first 24 hours though, you may want to talk with your technician about setting them again."

      "title": "Resist the urge to touch your eyebrows.",
      "content": "Resist the urge to touch your eyebrows. This is really hard, we know! Unfortunately, when you touch your brows, you introduce oil from your fingers and this can clog the pores in your brows. Try to distract yourself if you keep reaching for your brows. Pick something to do that keeps your hands busy, like a craft project, playing an instrument, or cooking something."

      "title": "Skip makeup for 24 hours after getting your brows done.",
      "content": "Skip makeup for 24 hours after getting your brows done. It can feel challenging to go makeup-free for a day, but remember, it's worth it. You want to avoid makeup since it can be oily and might clog your pores. [1] X Research source Your skin is also sensitive right now so give it a chance to recover from the procedure."

      "title": "Wait 2 days before you wash your face so your eyebrows don't get wet.",
      "content": "Wait 2 days before you wash your face so your eyebrows don't get wet. This is probably one of the hardest things about laminating your brows! As tempting as it is, it's not a good idea to wash your face since your brows will get wet. Instead, use a cleansing wipe to clean your face so you don't have to splash it with water. [2] X Research source Once you've waited a few days, it's totally fine to wash your face. Just try not to rub your brows when you do it."

    {
      "title": "Avoid swimming, showering, or sweating excessively.",
      "content": "Avoid swimming, showering, or sweating excessively. Again, you don't want moisture or oil anywhere near your brows for the first day after the procedure. This means no swimming, saunas, steamy showers, or intense workouts. [3] X Research source It's totally fine to do these things a few days after getting your brows done. By then, your brows will be set and it's okay to get them wet."

      "title": "Try to sleep on your back so you don't press on your brows at night.",
      "content": "Try to sleep on your back so you don't press on your brows at night. This might seem like weird advice, but if you usually sleep on your side, the pillow presses against your face and you might bend a few brow hairs. For the first night, try to sleep on your back . You might put bolsters or body pillows on your sides so it's harder to turn on your side while you sleep. [4] X Research source Can't sleep on your back? Don't stress! Just check your brows first thing in the morning and try to brush any bent hairs back into place."

      "title": "Avoid using exfoliating products or retinoids around your brows for 3 days.",
      "content": "Avoid using exfoliating products or retinoids around your brows for 3 days. If your brows feel extra-sensitive for a few days after the procedure, it's totally normal. The chemicals in brow lamination can also dry out your skin a little, which is why you shouldn't immediately use products like retin-A, alpha hydroxy acid, or harsh exfoliants that peel away the top layer of your skin. Wait at least 3 days and remember to keep the product away from your brows. If your brows still feel really dry 3 days after the procedure, you may want to wait until they don't feel sensitive before you use a retinoid or exfoliate."

      "title": "Dab brow conditioner or nourishing oil onto your brows every day.",
      "content": "Dab brow conditioner or nourishing oil onto your brows every day. Since dry skin is a common side effect, moisturizing your brows is important. Wait 2 days after your procedure and then soak a cotton pad with brow conditioner from your technician. If they didn't give you any, don't worry! Get a super-nourishing oil like castor, coconut, argan, or avocado oil. Then, dab the cotton pad into your brows so the hairs absorb the oil. Do this every day to keep your brows looking their best.

      "content": "Shape your brows twice a day with an eyebrow brush. Laminated brows are super low-maintenance since they hold their shape on their own. If you spot any stray hairs, just use a brow brush to comb your brows in the direction the hairs are growing.

      "content": "Brush on clear brow gel to give them a slight sheen. If you're going for a dewy, youthful style, clear brow gel can finish your look. Just brush the clear gel into your shaped, laminated brows and you're all set! [7] X Research source Don't have time to apply brow gel? No worries. It's totally fine to skip this step since your brows are already set in place. The gel just gives a little extra shine."
