      "content": "Leather repair kits have patches that match colors and textures. You can buy a leather repair kit from any craft supply store. If there's a tear, cut the backing patch so it’s slightly wider than the hole and stuff it inside. Apply the glue from the kit onto the backing and press the vinyl down to close the gap. Once it’s dry, mix the dye colors to match the color of your vinyl and apply a thin coat over the slit. You can also apply the dye directly onto cracks in your vinyl. [12] X Research source Most repair kits come with multiple texture pads to match the rest of your furniture. Press the texture down on the dye while it’s still wet and press it down firmly so it dries with the right texture. These work best for holes and tears that are only about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long."
