      "content": "Remove the racks from your oven. Before you get started, be sure to slide out the removable racks arranged in the center of the oven. This will get them out of your way and give you more room to work comfortably. It will also make the racks themselves easier to clean separately later on. [1] X Research source Scour the oven racks in the sink using hot water, liquid dish soap and an abrasive sponge or scrubbing brush. If your oven’s racks have seen a lot of drips and spills, you can soak them while the oven is cleaning itself to loosen whatever residue happens to be clinging to them. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Activate the oven’s self-cleaning cycle. Program your oven to the desired time and temperature setting. Make sure the oven door is completely shut and locked before initiating the cleaning process. Otherwise, heat and noxious fumes may escape into your kitchen and spread through the rest of your home. [3] X Research source Self-cleaning ovens use extreme temperatures to burn food particles off of their smooth interior surfaces. [4] X Research source Do not use any other chemicals or cleaning products in your oven while running the self-cleaning feature."

      "title": "Leave the room.",
      "content": "Leave the room. Because of the intense heat generated during the oven’s self-cleaning cycle, it’s best not to be around while cleaning is in progress. Set a separate timer or use the countdown on the oven display to let you know when it’s finished cleaning. [5] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Keep small children and pets out of the kitchen while the oven is being cleaned. The fumes released as chemical residues and burnt food are incinerated can be dangerous. [6] X Research source If possible, keep the doors and windows open, and exhaust fans on to provide proper ventilation to the room. Self-cleaning ovens typically take between 2-4 hours to complete a full cycle."

      "content": "Wipe away remaining residue by hand. After the self-cleaning cycle has ended, open the oven door to release excess heat. Give the oven a few minutes to cool down to a safe temperature before cleaning out the inside. At this point, you can simply use a damp cloth or paper towel to lift away the ash that’s settled at the bottom of the oven. It’s that easy!

      "content": "Mix baking soda and water together to form a paste. Shake one cup of baking soda into a large container and add enough water to thicken it. Pour in the water gradually, stirring as you go. The resulting mixture should be roughly the same consistency as cake icing. [9] X Research source The exact measurements aren’t important—the baking soda paste just needs to be thick enough to stick to the walls of the oven. Should you happen to be running low on baking soda, you can also use a combination of cream of tartar and hydrogen peroxide. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Smear the baking soda mixture over the inside of the oven. Use a spatula, soft sponge or similar implement to spread the paste in a thin layer over every accessible surface. You can apply the baking soda mixture more freely in areas with heavy grease stains or crusty, stuck-on buildup. [11] X Research source Don’t forget to cover the top of the oven as well. Keep the baking soda mixture away from the internal fans and heating elements."

The paste should remain in place for a minimum of one hour. Leave the oven door closed. [12] X Research source For best results, allow the paste to sit overnight, or between 8-12 hours. [13] X Research source If you’re dealing with particularly troublesome messes, spray the baking soda paste with a small amount of vinegar. This will produce a natural chemical reaction that will help dissolve hardened grime. [14] X Research source"

Following the baking soda treatment, any remaining food particles should come right off. Dig in and be persistent to chip away at lingering messes. Apply additional baking soda and water (or vinegar) and continue spot-cleaning as needed until the oven is pristine."

Wet a second cloth and use the fresh water to rinse out the oven. Repeat once more using a clean towel to wick up standing water, or leave the oven door open to allow it to air dry. [15] X Research source Wring out the wet cloth occasionally to clear it of dirty water. Turning the oven on to a low temperature for a few minutes will help it dry faster."

While spraying the oven cleaner, be careful not to let it come into contact with your eyes or skin—this may cause severe irritation. [16] X Research source Traditional oven cleaning products are often formulated using toxic chemicals. For your own protection, wear a pair of thick rubber kitchen gloves, keep your nose and mouth covered and work in a well-ventilated space to minimize your exposure to fumes. [17] X Research source If you own a fume hood, use it. Remove all objects nearby, including pots and pans, cooking utensils and kitchen storage containers, to avoid getting oven cleaner on them."

Turn on the ventilation hood or overhead fan while you clean so the chemical fumes are not overpowering. By the time you’re done, your oven will sparkle like it’s never been used before! Use a disposable cloth or sponge to wipe out the oven and throw it away once the project has been completed. In general, chemical oven cleaners should only be employed when other methods don’t produce satisfactory results. After deep-cleaning your oven, try to maintain it using gentler natural ingredients."
