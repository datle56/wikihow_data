Pull all of the strings out of the bridge and dispose of them. [2] X Research source Optionally, scrape up any grime on the fretboard with a popsicle stick. Clean the board with a toothbrush and a silicone-free guitar cleaner . Rub lemon oil on the fretboard with a soft cloth.

      "content": "Get a new pack of nylon classical guitar strings. Use normal tension nylon strings or strings made for classical guitars. Try to avoid steel strings or acoustic guitar strings that have a ball at one end. Try out different tension nylon strings to see if you like the sound better. [5] X Research source The tension in steel strings is much higher than nylon, which can put too much pressure on the neck, eventually causing it to bend or crack."

Push the E string through the far left hole so that about 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) sticks out towards the bottom of the guitar. [6] X Research source Take the end and wrap it behind the main length of the string so that the end is on the left side. Insert the end inside the loop created so that it faces to the right.

The bass strings on the left of your fretboard are thicker, and most only need to be wrapped around once to be secure. However, if your string is thinner, wrap it around 2 or 3 times. [9] X Research source To secure the string, professional guitarist Carlos Alonzo Rivera says “you slide one string in one end of the hole… Put in a little bit of the string there and then loop it back around. And then you have to tie a couple loops on the bridge, and then make sure the string is secure.” [10] X Expert Source Carlos Alonzo Rivera, MA Professional Guitarist Expert Interview. 18 August 2020."

Press your finger over the end of the E string so it lies flat just above the hole in the bridge for the string next to it (the A string). Pull on the main length of string to tighten the knot. [11] X Research source If the end of the string is too long, trim it with a pair of scissors or wire cutters. Make sure the end of the string comes down under the bridge before you tighten it.

Make sure that the bottom of each loop dips under the bridge with their ends just above the hole in the bridge. Leave the 4th (D) string slightly loose so you can tuck the tail of the 3rd (G) string next to it underneath. [12] X Research source The A string will go over the end of the E string, tying it down. This prevents the end of your strings from whipping the guitar and scratching the surface. Alternatively, just clip the ends of each string so they won’t be long enough to whip the guitar.

[14] X Research source Insert the end in the back of the loop created. Wrap the string around the right side of the loop twice.

Alternatively, you can attach the new E string before you remove the old A string and tune the guitar to itself. To do this, play the E string at the 5th fret and match it to the sound of the A string."
