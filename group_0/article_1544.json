Search for something that’s both sturdy and big enough to support the injured body part, like a rolled-up section of a newspaper. Items like rolled-up clothes and blankets can work if you’re in a pinch. [5] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Walking sticks and trekking poles are both great options. [6] X Research source For smaller injuries, like a finger fracture, you can use the neighboring finger as a “sturdy object.” [7] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source If the elbow or shoulder is injured, tuck the person’s arm close to their body and wrap the whole torso, immobilizing the limb against the body. For these injuries, it’s better to make a soft splint like a sling rather than making a rigid splint. This treatment also works well for wrist or forearm injuries. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Splint the injured body part without adjusting it. It can be concerning to find a bent or misaligned limb, but never try to straighten or realign the injury on your own. Any type of adjustment could risk making the injury even worse. Instead, treat and splint the injury in the exact position you find it in.

      "content": "Plan to splint around the neighboring joints. The goal of a makeshift splint is to keep the injury stable and immobile. Let’s say that someone injured their lower leg on a hike—to best support the injury, you’d splint the ankle and knee as well as the leg. [10] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Here are a few best practices for other types of injuries: Ankle: Splint from foot to mid-calf Thumb: Splint from mid-palm to mid-forearm Fingers: Splint from the injured fingers to the wrist Wrist: Splint from the hand to the elbow [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Pad the area between the injured limb and the splint.",
      "content": "Pad the area between the injured limb and the splint. Gently surround the injury with some sort of soft material, like a shirt or jacket—this will act as a cushion between the injury and the splint itself. Be sure to place plenty of padding around any bony and swollen parts of the injury, especially. [12] X Research source Make sure that the padding is snug around the injury without cutting off circulation."

Whenever possible, line the splint along the uninjured side of the limb. [13] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source For example, you could brace a leg injury by placing a long, rigid walking stick beneath the person’s leg (under the knee). You could brace an injured forearm by placing the rigid item beneath the arm (in line with the palm). [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Tie the splint to keep it in place. Anything thin and flexible can work for this, like a belt, necktie, or section of tape. Arrange these along the top and bottom of the splint (near the joints), so you aren’t putting any pressure on the injury itself. [15] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Tie your splint securely, but make sure that it isn’t too tight. A really tight splint could prevent circulation."

      "title": "Make a hand splint",
      "content": "Make a hand splint with a clean cloth. Treating hand injuries requires a different splinting process. Set a soft object (like a rolled-up sock) or a cloth ball under the injured person’s hand so their fingers are resting on top of the soft item. Then, stick strips of clean cloth in between the injured fingers to act as padding. Wrap a clean piece of cloth all the way around the injured hand, followed by a second layer of cloth to help hold everything in place. [16] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source You can use adhesive tape instead of cloth for the second layer of your splint. Wrap 4 strips of cloth or tape between the gaps of the fingers before you wrap the second layer of cloth around the injury. This helps keep them separated. Make sure the person’s fingertips are completely exposed and uncovered by the splint. This way, you can test their circulation easily."

Once your splint is in place, inspect the injury once every couple of minutes to see if it looks more swollen or pale than it did before. If so, loosen the bindings around the makeshift splint a little bit. Check the patient’s pulse to make sure they have enough circulation around their injury. If their pulse feels faint, loosen the splint ties a little bit. Check in with the injured individual, too. Ask them if their injury feels numb at all—if it does, loosen up the ties. [17] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Watch for any warning signs of shock, like short, quick breathing. If the person’s injuries allow it, lay them down with their legs elevated and their head a little lower than their chest.

Grab a section of stockinette that’s at least 10 cm (3.9 in) longer than the splint and slide it on top of the injured body part (wherever the splint will go). Once the splint is complete, you’ll fold the extra stockinette fabric over the edges to create a smooth finish. A stockinette is a thin layer of fabric that creates a barrier between the patient’s skin and the splinting."

      "content": "Measure and cut your splinting material. Hold the splinting material next to the injured body part and mark off a section that’s long enough to cover the surrounding joints. Then, measure around the injury—the splint needs to be wide enough to cover about half of the circumference of the injured body part. Cut the splinting material down to size once you’ve collected your measurements. [22] X Trustworthy Source State of Oregon Official website for the State of Oregon Go to source Finger splints are typically 2 in (5.1 cm) wide, arm splints are usually 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) wide, and leg splints are traditionally 5 to 6 in (13 to 15 cm) wide. Plaster splinting material usually comes in prefabricated splint rolls, with each roll having about 10-20 plaster sheets in it. Plaster of Paris is another popular type of splinting plaster—it usually comes in rolls or strips. Make your measurement slightly longer if you’re working with Plaster of Paris strips or rolls, since this material often shrinks a little when the splint sets.

[25] X Trustworthy Source State of Oregon Official website for the State of Oregon Go to source If you plan on splinting an arm with 10 layers of plaster, only use 5 layers of padding.

Thumb spica: Place the wrist in a completely neutral position with the thumb pointed out. Volar/Colles: Arrange the wrist in a neutral position with all 5 fingers slightly bent. Long arm or sugar tong: Lay the patient face-down and bend their arm around the side of the bed/stretcher at a right angle. Posterior (short) leg or stirrup: Sit the patient upright and have them bend their knee at a right angle. Make sure that the connected foot also creates a right angle with their leg."

Then, carefully squeeze out any leftover water from the soaked plaster so it’s not dripping wet. [27] X Trustworthy Source State of Oregon Official website for the State of Oregon Go to source It also helps to smooth out the damp plaster on a flat surface to get rid of any wrinkles or grooves. [28] X Trustworthy Source State of Oregon Official website for the State of Oregon Go to source It should have a really sloppy texture at this point. Never use hot water to apply a splint. Wetting the plaster generates heat—when combined with hot water (especially water that’s at least 40 °C/104 °F), the patient might get burned."

Then, loop an elastic bandage on top—this helps the splint stay put. If you don’t put a layer of padding down first, the bandage might meld with the plaster as it sets.
