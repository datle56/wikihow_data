    {
      "title": "Be direct about your referral request.",
      "content": "Be direct about your referral request. No matter which channel you use to ask for a referral, make sure to clearly state that you‚Äôre looking for referrals. You can attach your request at the bottom of an invoice so it doesn‚Äôt feel too demanding, or send an email that focuses on your referral program. It‚Äôs best to be direct so you don‚Äôt confuse your client and waste their time. [1] X Research source Instead of writing a vague sentence like ‚Äúwe appreciate referrals‚Äù at the bottom of an email, add a call to action. You might say, ‚ÄúPlease contact me if you know any high school students that would be interested in my program.‚Äù"

      "title": "Describe what type of clients that you‚Äôre looking for.",
      "content": "Describe what type of clients that you‚Äôre looking for. If you ask an existing client if they know anyone who could use your service, they might be overwhelmed and unable to give you an answer. Try to be as specific as possible by requesting new clients from a certain industry or demographic. [2] X Research source For example, if you run an advertising agency and you‚Äôve just finished social media work for an existing client, you might say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to add local beauty-related businesses to my portfolio. Do you know any hairdressers or makeup artists that need social media marketing?‚Äù"
    },
    {
      "title": "Personalize your referral request.",
      "content": "Personalize your referral request. Instead of sending a mass referral email to all of your clients, learn more about each client, then craft a targeted message to make them feel special. In your referral request, you could bring up their past orders, the type of industry that they‚Äôre in, shared interests or commonalities, or any positive interactions with them from the past. [3] X Research source For instance, if you‚Äôve been working with a client for several years, you might remind them of your favorite projects or the former wins you‚Äôve shared together. If possible, try to reach out to each client directly by phone, email, or in person. It makes your request seem more meaningful and personal."

    {
      "title": "Attach referral marketing materials.",
      "content": "Attach referral marketing materials. Your clients might be stressed or time-constrained, so create resources that make it easy for them to refer you. There are tons of ways to promote your business or service, but if you can‚Äôt think of anything, here are a few ideas: [4] X Research source Write a referral email template for your clients where they just need to add their names. Create an infographic that your clients can simply repost on their social media platforms. Send your clients a virtual business card that they can forward to friends and family. Write a blog post on LinkedIn and ask your clients to share the link with their network."
    },
    {
      "title": "Offer an incentive.",
      "content": "Offer an incentive. Even if you provide outstanding service, your client might need an extra push to share your business with others. Encourage referrals by offering incentives that your clients actually want, such as gift cards, store credit, free products, or a discount on future purchases. By highlighting the benefits that your client will receive, they are more likely to refer you to people in their network. [5] X Research source If you‚Äôre a property manager trying to fill empty units, you could offer your current tenants a small discount on next month‚Äôs rent if they refer a friend. If you own a clothing brand, you might offer customers 15% off their next purchase after their friend makes their first purchase of at least $100. If you‚Äôre an esthetician, you could run a referral competition where clients who refer their friends are entered into a drawing for a free facial or spa package."

      "title": "Ask loyal clients for a referral directly.",
      "content": "Ask loyal clients for a referral directly. If you‚Äôre reaching out to a loyal client, feel free to craft an email that‚Äôs solely focused on asking for a referral. Thank the client for their continued support, and be specific about how they‚Äôve helped your business grow. Toward the end of your email, ask the client if they would be willing to refer you to a friend, family member, or anyone else they believe would benefit from your product or services. [6] X Research source Subject: Beth, please recommend me to someone. Body: Hi Beth, Thank you for being such an amazing customer over the past 3 years. It has been an honor to be your makeup artist for some of the most memorable moments in your life, and I truly appreciate your support. As you know, prom is just around the corner, so I wanted to ask if you knew any high school seniors that might be interested in my services. If so, would you please send them my information? Here are 3 ways to refer: (1) Click here to tweet this link. (2) Share the attached infographic on your Instagram story. (3) Send my virtual business card to 1-2 friends."

      "title": "Ask customers for a referral after their purchase.",
      "content": "Ask customers for a referral after their purchase. People are more likely to refer you when they remember the product or service that you provided them. If you install blinds, for instance, you could ask for a referral 1-2 days after your service. Or, if you run an online store, you might wait 1-2 weeks until the client has received their product in the mail. Depending on your business, experiment with different times to see when you get the most positive results.

Services like Mailchimp and Constant Contact allow you to email to thousands of users at once, so schedule a referral request around 10 days after their purchase. To catch the client‚Äôs attention, be sure to include a compelling subject line that highlights any benefits or offers.

      "content": "Build rapport at the beginning of the call to sound more conversational. Instead of requesting a referral straight away, ask the client if they have any issues or concerns. If they‚Äôre struggling with something, try to provide advice or solutions to show empathy . For instance, if they can‚Äôt find a contractor, you could offer to send them a list of people you know. This strengthens your relationship and makes it harder for the other person to decline your request. [9] X Research source"

After chatting with the client for a few minutes, slowly bring up your request by asking them if they know anyone who would be interested in the product or service you offer. If they say yes, be direct and ask if they would consider referring you to their network. But, if it‚Äôs not possible for them, assure them that it‚Äôs not a problem and end the call politely.

If a client posts that they had a positive experience with your business, use it as an opportunity to message them for a referral.
