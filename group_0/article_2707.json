    {
      "title": "Don't care what people think.",
      "content": "Don't care what people think. Why should you anyway? You've only got this one life to live, so live it and spend you life openly loving the things that you love. Wear the things that show who you are, listen to music that expresses your soul, and never pay any attention to the haters. They're just upset that they don't enjoy their life that much."
    },
    {
      "title": "Appreciate new or forgotten things.",
      "content": "Appreciate new or forgotten things. This is really what being indie is all about. It is about liking things and appreciating things that are neglected or that deserve more love than they're getting. From small-time musicians trying to get by to lovingly crafted (rather than lovingly budgeted) films, indie culture is all about finding that diamond in the rough."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be independent.",
      "content": "Be independent. Like the indie movie directors and musicians you admire, make sure to approach life in an independent way. Do the things that make you happy and don't be afraid to deviate from the norm. Dye your hair weird colors because you like the color. Wear clothes that don't match because you like how the patterns clash. Take up a hobby that's considered weird because you don't think it should be weird."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't feel the need to have a normal relationship if you don't want to either.",
      "content": "Don't feel the need to have a normal relationship if you don't want to either. You can stay totally single, date whoever you want (regardless of what society would think), date more than one person at a time (as long as your significant others agree), and make sure to maintain your independence in any relationship you do have."
    },
    {
      "title": "Express yourself.",
      "content": "Express yourself. State your opinions, let your appearance express your individual personality, and take actions in your life that express who you are and what you believe in. If it is extremely important to you that employees get fair treatment, volunteer with a worker's rights organization. If you don't like something going on in your country, protest and work to get your issues on the next ballot."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have discerning taste.",
      "content": "Have discerning taste. In mainstream culture, people tend to just like things because everyone else likes them, not because they're actually good. In indie culture, people take quality seriously and you will need to as well. People can of course have different opinions about what is good, but you should evaluate new things to think about whether you think they are actually good. Set the standards bar high for music, food, clothing, and everything else in your life (especially concerning consumer products)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for the timeless, not the ephemeral.",
      "content": "Look for the timeless, not the ephemeral. Mainstream culture tends to be really trendy and most things that are popular will only be considered good for a short time. You should look for things, both past and present, which have a timeless quality. This is why indie music tends to take a lot of influence from folk music and fashion usually pulls from the 40s-70s."

    {
      "title": "Get into the music.",
      "content": "Get into the music. Indie means independent record label, after all. I won't bother with a list of well-known indie bands for you to listen to; there are new bands with new sounds coming out all the time and to tell you what to listen to would defeat the purpose. Being indie about music is about being open to new things. Do some research. There are many online services such as Pandora, YouTube, or Spotify that will allow you to put in the name of an artist you enjoy and will make recommendations for you of new artists for you to listen to. Try new things and find some new bands! Head down to your local record store, if it still exists. Picking through records for hours is how our predecessors found their music and there is a lot to be said for it. If you're lucky enough to still have a local record store, become a patron. Talk to your friends about music. The best way to learn about artists you will really enjoy is to talk to other people who love music. Being indie is about exchanging new ideas and sharing new things; when you find a band you like, share it with your friends! Get involved in your local music scene. No matter where you are, there are people playing music in your area. This is the heart of indie music, and a great way to get involved in your community. If you play music yourself, find people to make new sounds with! There's no better way to participate in indie culture than by making indie music. Don't worry about whether or not your tastes are popular or \"indie enough.\" Listen to what you love. There is no \"master indie playlist\" that tells us which songs are cool and which are not."

      "title": "Get into DIY.",
      "content": "Get into DIY. Part of being indie is about making your own stuff, and learning new skills. Take your existing interests and hobbies to the next step. Love to eat? Learn to cook! Love scarves and knitwear? Learn to knit! Really into your smartphone? Learn to develop apps yourself! The information is out there to self-educate, and the potential is limitless. Don't be afraid to be creative. Indie labels have always been known for new kinds of music that push boundaries. Push boundaries in your creative endeavors too. Get your friends involved in DIY too. You can complete more ambitious projects when you have help! Build a community garden or volunteer for a cause you all care about. Being indie is also about doing things together. There are many community organizations to get involved with in your local area."
    },
    {
      "title": "Constantly expose yourself to new things.",
      "content": "Constantly expose yourself to new things. New movies (from new directors!), new books (or old, neglected ones), new music, or a new look, you should always be open to new things. Even philosophies and ideas. Indie culture is about finding things to love that people have neglected, forgotten about, or haven't had the chance to appreciate yet."

    {
      "title": "Express yourself with your wardrobe.",
      "content": "Express yourself with your wardrobe. Almost as if you are a blank white canvas and your style is the art. What would you want to say to people? Indie is about finding your own voice and being proud to speak. Look for vintage clothes that you like. Older cuts and prints are often lost to time, and some of them are completely worth bringing back! Don't be afraid to wear something that you might think is a little crazy. Being indie is about being you! If you think it will look good, give it a shot."

    {
      "title": "Stay away from big brands and stores.",
      "content": "Stay away from big brands and stores. Visit your local thrift store instead â€” you will save money, help the earth by recycling, and find treasures you would never see at the mall."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make your accessories treasures.",
      "content": "Make your accessories treasures. Jewelry, watches, hats, scarves: all of them are avenues of expression. Look for treasures in your travels, but don't forget that you can make them yourself! Your accessories should look like they have significance to you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go for a natural look.",
      "content": "Go for a natural look. Indie culture tends to focus on a natural look. Minimize the makeup, wear organically shaped clothing (flowy tops or willowy pants), and keep your hair looking great but kind of like you just rolled out of bed or came off the beach."
