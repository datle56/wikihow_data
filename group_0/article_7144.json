If you're connected to a dual-band Wi-Fi router, you may be able to find out which band you're connected to based on the name of the access point on your iPhone. Here's where to look: [1] X Research source Open the Control Center by swiping down from the top-right corner of your screen (for iPhones without Home buttons) or swiping up from the bottom of the screen (for iPhones with Home buttons). Tap and hold the Wi-Fi icon in the top-left corner. The name of your Wi-Fi access point appears below \"Wi-Fi\" on the left side of the panel. If you see either \"2.4GHz\" or \"5GHz\" here, you'll know that you're connected on that frequency. If you're connected at home and your bands are not labeled this way, read on to learn how to change them on your Wi-Fi router ."

To get started, find your router’s IP address. On your iPhone, you can find the IP address by doing the following: Go into Settings . Open Wi-Fi . Click the Information button by your router’s network name. Scroll down until you find the number next to Router in the IPV4 Address section.

[13] X Research source So, for instance, a channel number of 6 would indicate a 2.4GHz network, while a channel number of 40 indicates a 5GHz network. If you live outside the U.S., the channel numbers may differ. For example, in most parts of the world, channels 1-13 are in the 2.4GHz range, while higher channel numbers are associated with the 5GHz band. In Japan, channel 14 is included in the 2.4GHz band.
