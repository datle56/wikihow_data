      "content": "The “Check VSC” message means the VSC system is turned off. If you see the “Check VSC” message on your Lexus’ dashboard display, it means the vehicle stability control (VSC) system is currently disabled. The VSC system is a safety feature that keeps your car from skidding, like when you drive in slippery conditions, brake hard, or make sharp turns. [1] X Research source The VSC system adjusts the engine output and applies the brakes to certain tires, helping your car gain traction and stay in control when you skid. The “Check VSC” message might come on because the VSC system is malfunctioning or other parts of your car are malfunctioning. In some Lexus models, the VSC system is a part of the car’s traction control system, which also activates when you experience skids or drive in slippery conditions. The traction control system reduces the spin of the tires to help your car grip the road."

      "content": "Reset the VSC system to see if that fixes the issue. Your Lexus has a VSC button that controls the VSC system. Simply park your car and find the VSC button on the steering wheel or near the gear selector. Press and hold the button for 3 seconds to turn the system off. Then, press and hold it again to turn the system back on. [3] X Research source The VSC button might have “VSC” printed on it or a car icon with wavy lines underneath it. If you can’t find the button, check your car’s owner’s manual. You might see “VSC Off” flash on the dashboard once the VSC system is turned off. When it turns back on, the dashboard might flash “VSC On.”"

      "content": "Disconnect the battery for 10 minutes, then reconnect it. Turn your car all the way off and put on a pair of gloves. Then, open your car’s hood and find the negative terminal on the battery (which is usually labeled “-”). Loosen the nut with a socket wrench and pull the negative cable back from the battery . Simply wait 10 minutes and then tighten the negative cable back onto the negative terminal. [4] X Research source Note : Disconnecting the battery can reset your car’s computer system and clear the “Check VSC” message. However, this is only a temporary solution, as it doesn’t fix any underlying issues. If the “Check VSC” message keeps coming back on, it likely means there’s an issue with the VSC system or parts it’s connected to. If your car was on, wait for the engine to cool down before disconnecting the battery. Warning : Always turn your car off before touching the battery. Keeping the car running can increase your risk of electrocution."

Then, turn your car’s electricity on, but do not start the engine. Simply follow the prompts on the OBD-II scanner to check for codes and clear any related to the “Check VSC” message. [5] X Research source OBD-II scanners read your car’s computer system and display codes that refer to problems with your car. Clearing the codes turns off any warning messages or lights related to the problem. Note : Clearing the error codes will not fix any problems related to the “Check VSC” message. So, the message might turn back on after you drive your car for a while."
