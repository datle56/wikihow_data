      "title": "Wait a day for the grout to set.",
      "content": "Wait a day for the grout to set. Grout haze often appears soon after the grout and tiles have been installed. If you are cleaning grout haze off of tiles that have recently been installed, wait a day for the grout to set. This will allow the grout to firm up so it is not damaged when you are removing the grout haze. This is key if you have smooth tiles made of glazed ceramic or porcelain. [1] X Research source Talk to the professional floor installer to find out the setting time for the grout. Most cement and ready-mixed grouts dry within 24 hours."

      "title": "Use a cheesecloth.",
      "content": "Use a cheesecloth. Start with the least aggressive method of removal first so you do not damage the tiles or the grout. Get a cheesecloth that is designed for cleaning grout haze at your local hardware store or online. Rub the surface of the tiles with the dry cheesecloth to remove the haze. [2] X Research source You may need an extra pair of hands to help you rub the tiles with the cheesecloth, especially if you are removing grout haze off a large area."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try a wet terry towel if the cheesecloth is ineffective.",
      "content": "Try a wet terry towel if the cheesecloth is ineffective. If the grout haze is too hard to remove with just the dry cheesecloth, try using a damp terry towel. Wet the terry towel and wring out as much water as you can before you use it. This will ensure excess water does not get on the grout. Then, rub the damp terry cloth over the tiles to remove the grout haze. [3] X Research source You can also try swiping a damp terry cloth over the grout haze to wet it. Then, use another damp terry cloth to remove the grout haze once it is wet."

      "title": "Apply a cleaner of vinegar and water for an easy solution.",
      "content": "Apply a cleaner of vinegar and water for an easy solution. If the grout haze has hardened and does not come off with a scrubbing tool, use a mild vinegar and water cleaner. Mix together 1 part vinegar to 4 parts warm water. Then, use a mop or a nylon scrubber to spread the cleaner and remove the grout haze. [4] X Research source Make sure you use a scrub pad that is soft and made of nylon. You do not want the scrubber to scratch the surface of the tiles. Use the scrub pad to loosen up any grout haze caught between the tile and the grout. Then, swipe the mop over the area to remove the grout haze."

    {
      "title": "Use a mild acid-based cleaner if you have one on hand.",
      "content": "Use a mild acid-based cleaner if you have one on hand. Make sure the cleaner is labeled mild and is made for grout haze removal. Using a strong acid-based cleaner can damage the tile and weaken the grout. Dilute the mild acid-based cleaner with half water. Then, spray the cleaning solution on the tile surface with a spray bottle. You may notice a fizzing effect on the tile as the cleaner reacts to the grout haze. Scrub the grout haze off with a mop, making sure you remove any excess cleaning solution on the floor. You can also use a nylon scrub pad to get rid of any hardened grout haze on the tiles."

    {
      "title": "Apply a non-acidic cleaner on stone tiles.",
      "content": "Apply a non-acidic cleaner on stone tiles. If you have tiles made of stone, never use an acid-based cleaner on the tiles as this can damage or stain them. Instead, get a non-acidic cleaner made for stone tiles at your local hardware store or online. Use a mop and a nylon scrub pad to apply the cleaner and remove the grout haze. [5] X Research source If you have tiles made of stone, do not wait a day for the grout to set before you remove the haze. Instead, clean the grout haze as soon as the installation is done, as the grout haze will be harder to remove on stone tiles if it dries overnight."

      "title": "Rinse the floor with water at the end of the cleaning.",
      "content": "Rinse the floor with water at the end of the cleaning. No matter what type of cleaner you use on the flooring, you should always rinse the floor well with water at the end of the cleaning. You do not want any excess cleaning products to remain on the surface of the flooring. Wet a clean mop or a damp terry towel and wipe the entire floor so any remaining cleaning solution is removed. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Dry the floor well.",
      "content": "Dry the floor well. You should also dry the floor with a clean cheesecloth or terry cloth once the cleaning is done. This will ensure the flooring looks fresh and polished once the grout haze has been removed. Dry the floor as soon as it has been rinsed, as you do not want excess water to remain on the flooring. Excess water can damage the tiles and the grout, especially if it has recently been installed."

      "title": "Clean the grout haze once the grout has set.",
      "content": "Clean the grout haze once the grout has set. Epoxy grouts are designed to withstand chemical exposure and repel staining. This makes the grout haze caused by epoxy grout the hardest to remove. Before you try to clean the epoxy grout haze, make sure the grout has been set, or cured. This will ensure the grout is not damaged when you clean off the grout haze. [7] X Research source Speak to the professional floor installer to find out how long the grout will take to set. You can also contact the manufacturer of the grout for this information. Most epoxy grout takes 4 to 14 days to cure."

      "title": "Use a strong professional grout cleaner.",
      "content": "Use a strong professional grout cleaner. Epoxy grout haze can be difficult to remove with mild cleaners or scrubbing tools. Try using a professional grout cleaner designed for epoxy grout haze. Use a mop or spray bottle to apply the cleaner to the flooring, then scrub each tile with a white tile sponge. [8] X Research source Avoid using a green tile sponge, as it may transfer color to the grout. Look for a professional grout cleaner and white tile sponge at a tile store, local hardware store, or online. Get an eco-friendly cleaner that is easy to apply. Eco-friendly cleaners usually do not contain toxic ingredients that can be bad for your health and for the tiles."

Some epoxy grout will require a specific type of cleaner to remove grout haze effectively. [9] X Research source You can also consult a professional floor cleaner if you need more information."
