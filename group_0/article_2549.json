[1] X Expert Source Rebekka Mars Meditation & Yoga Coach Expert Interview. 11 September 2020. Your sympathetic nervous system perceives that you’re under attack and kicks your body into high gear, boosting your heart rate, constricting blood vessels, restricting your breathing, and tensing your muscles.Try to get a hold of your emotions because the person who would be hurt will be you. [2] X Research source When you feel these symptoms, stop what you’re doing (if you can safely) and re-focus your senses on what your body is experiencing. This can help reduce what scientists call “automatic reactivity.” [3] X Research source Your brain develops “automatic reactivity” patterns to stimuli such as stressors. These are basically habits that your brain triggers. Whenever it encounters a particular stimulus, such as a fight with a person, it activates a particular set of pathways. Studies show that breaking this “habit” of reaction by re-focusing your senses on what’s actually going on can help your brain develop new, healthier habitual reactions. [4] X Research source Do a quick body scan, but don’t judge anything you’re feeling as “good” or “bad.” Try to stick to the facts. For example, if you’re angry, your heartbeat is probably pumping and you may even feel queasy. Simply acknowledge these sensory experiences.

My breathing is very quick. My face feels hot and flushed.” By identifying these physical experiences, you can separate them from the emotional reaction."

Focus on your lungs and abdomen expanding and filling with air.It relieves your inner self. Hold this breath for a few seconds. Ideally, you would hold it for a count of 5, but if you can’t do that immediately, hold it for at least 1-2 seconds. Slowly release your breath through your mouth for a count of 5.

With PMR you tense and then release your muscles in groups from your head to your toes, signaling your body to relax. It takes a little practice, but once you get the hang of it, it’s a fast way to calm down. [9] X Research source If you can, find a quiet place free of distractions. You can even do PMR at your desk if you need to, though. Loosen tight clothing. Take a few deep breaths. Start with the muscles in your forehead. Raise your eyebrows as high as they’ll go and hold this position for 5 seconds. Release the tension. Then, furrow your brow as hard as you can for 5 seconds. Release the tension. After you release the first muscle group, notice the difference in that area for 15 seconds before moving on. You want to learn how to tell what “relaxed” and “tense” feel like so that you can consciously release tension when you need to. Move to your lips. Purse them tightly for 5 seconds, then release the tension. Then, smile as widely as you can for 5 seconds, then release the tension. Enjoy the sensation for 15 seconds. Continue this pattern of holding tension for 5 seconds, releasing, and relaxing for 15 seconds with the remaining muscle groups: neck, shoulders, arms, chest, stomach, buttocks, thighs, lower legs, feet, and toes. You can find free guided PMR routines online, too. MIT has a free MP3 PMR routine. [10] X Research source"

If you must drink caffeine, try to avoid drinking more than 200mg a day (about two cups of brewed coffee). Don’t drink caffeine after 5 PM to avoid interfering with your sleep cycle. [30] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Stimulants also disturb your sleep cycles. [31] X Research source Alcohol is a depressant which means that it reduces tension or stress in the body and slows reactions. However, using alcohol as a way to rid of stress is a bad idea because your anxiety will return once the alcohol is out of your system (and alcohol won’t address your root problems). Additionally, intoxication may make stress worse for you or others. [32] X Research source It may make it easier to fall asleep, but it also seriously disturbs your REM sleep, leaving you feeling tired, hungover, and worn-out the next day. [33] X Research source If you do drink alcohol, make sure you do it in moderation. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism recommends that if you are male, you should not drink more than 4 drinks in one day and no more than 14 drinks per week. If you are female, do not drink more than 3 drinks in one day and no more than 7 drinks per week. [34] X Research source A “standard drink” may be less than you think. The NIAAA defines one drink as 12 ounces of regular beer, 8-9 ounces of malt liquor, 5 ounces of wine, or a 1.5-ounce shot of 80-proof spirits. [35] X Research source Nicotine is also a powerful stimulant that exaggerates your body’s stress responses. Smoking is very bad for your health, and the longer you smoke, the worse the damage is. Be aware, though, that quitting smoking can be very stressful itself, so quitting during a period of high stress may not be the best idea."

Humans can “catch” emotions from other people just like we catch colds. If you hang out with people who are focused on their stress and negativity, it’ll affect you.

Ask yourself some questions to help guide your meditation. Begin by asking “What are my senses telling me?” Notice what you hear, smell, and feel. For example, is the room cold or warm? Do you hear birds, the whir of a dishwasher? Ask yourself “What is my body doing?” Notice any tension (or relaxation) you feel in your body without judging it.

      "content": "Be kind to yourself . Being calm begins with being self-loving (which is completely different from being self-absorbed ). It's all too commonplace for us to take a negative tone with ourselves and to be our own unkindest critic. This can happen because we hold ourselves to unrealistic expectations, or because we forget to show ourselves the same compassion we show others. Calm cannot settle when you feel nothing but self-criticism, self-loathing and a lack of self-trust. Take time to quiet your inner critic and remind yourself that you are worthy of love, dignity, and compassion -- from yourself as well as others. Talk gently to yourself. When negative self-talk wells up, practice challenging it with positive counter-thoughts or mantras. For example, if you catch yourself worrying and telling yourself that you can’t handle a situation, ask yourself these things: Is this thought kind to myself? If not, change the thought to a kinder one: “I am worried right now, but I can handle this.” Does this thought make me feel capable and self-assured? If not, focus on your strengths and capabilities: “I’m worried that I don’t know enough to do this, but I am smart and can learn fast.” Would I say this thought to a friend who was worried? If not, why would you say it to yourself? Remember that everyone makes mistakes. It can be easy to hold yourself to a standard of perfection that you would never expect from your loved ones. Remind yourself of your common humanity. Acknowledge your mistake, then focus on how to correct it and do things differently in the future. This keeps you focused on positive growth, rather than beating yourself up for the past. Know how valuable you are. Remind yourself daily of the virtues, strengths, and beauty that you bring into the world. If you’re having trouble thinking of positive things, ask friends for help."
