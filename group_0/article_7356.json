      "content": "Be aware of potential health hazards. Some microwavable containers, especially those made of plastic, can be potentially harmful to your health. Others, like glass or plastic dishes, are better for your health. Informing yourself about the potential dangers of certain types of microwave-safe containers may help you make a safer choice. Some of the potential health hazards are: ”Endocrine disruption,” which mimics human hormones.

      "content": "Learn what substances to avoid. “Plastic” is a generic term for different materials, or plasticizers, that can form microwave containers. In particular, it's plastic containers with BPA, phthalates, polyvinyl chloride, and polycarbonate that may harm your health. Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) closely regulates plastic containers and materials that come in contact with foods, you may still want to learn and avoid potentially hazardous chemicals. The following containers may be harmful if microwaved with food: [4] X Research source Plastic dishes Some Styrofoam containers Plastic storage or shopping bags Plastic wrap Takeout food containers, water bottles, and plastic tubs or jars that hold foods like margarine, yogurt, mayonnaise, or mustard.

      "content": "Look for safety designations. In many cases, containers are manufactured to be microwave-safe and may have labels on their packing and the products indicating this. In addition, you may want to make sure that the containers also bear other markers that can indicate they're safe for microwave use and your health. Check packaging and the product for the following symbols or statements: A label ”microwave-safe” A symbol of a dish with wave-like lines above it. A symbol of lines of waves. A symbol of a triangle, or Mobius loop, with a number in it. The number designates the type of plasticizer used in the product, which you may want to avoid."

Read containers for labels including “microwave-safe.” Be aware that there is no consensus on plastic wrap and microwaves. If you use plastic wrap in the microwave, make sure the packaging says “microwave-safe.” [6] X Research source Check for containers that are old, scratched, cracked, or have been used frequently. These may leech out more harmful materials. Consider throwing these away and investing in new containers.

[13] X Trustworthy Source Michigan State University Extension Extension program of Michigan State University focused on community outreach, education, and engagement Go to source Empty the container you want to test and place it inside the microwave. Put a second container containing one cup of tap water inside the microwave. Heat the microwave on high for one minute. If the empty container is cool, it's safe to use in the microwave. If it is warm, use it only to reheat food and if it is hot, don't use it in the microwave at all."
