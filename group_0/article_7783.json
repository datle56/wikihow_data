      "title": "Wipe down your galvanized steel with a damp rag.",
      "content": "Wipe down your galvanized steel with a damp rag. An initial cleaning with a rag dipped in fresh water will remove any dirt or streaks on your galvanized steel. Regular maintenance will reduce the amount of dirt and chemical buildup that forms on your steel over time and will make cleaning easier in the future."

      "title": "Scrub your steel with a brush and a detergent solution.",
      "content": "Scrub your steel with a brush and a detergent solution. Use a tablespoon (14.79 milliliters) of laundry detergent and mix it into a bucket of water. Make sure to do a thorough scrubbing over the surface of your steel and pay particular attention to problem areas where dirt or mud has built up. Use a nylon or plastic brush because other brushes can interact with the steel and alter its color. Do not use harsh cleaners. A cleaner with a pH of more than 12 to 13 can begin to dissolve the zinc in your galvanized steel. Washing steel in this way may make areas that you clean look uneven compared to the areas that you don't. Abrasive overwashing of your galvanized steel will reduce the steel's lifecycle and wear out the zinc coating. Scrub your galvanized steel sparingly."

      "title": "Use a car wash or truck wash to clean your steel.",
      "content": "Use a car wash or truck wash to clean your steel. Truck and car washes are made to reduce the potential for corrosion, and will typically also be well-suited to clean your galvanized steel. Remember to rinse your steel thoroughly with cold water after using the cleaner. Make sure to read the back of the car wash for directions and warnings. You can pick up car wash at an automotive store, department store, or online. Most contemporary cars use galvanized steel to prevent rusting. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Spray your steel with a low-pressure washer for larger areas.",
      "content": "Spray your steel with a low-pressure washer for larger areas. If you have a large area of galvanized steel to clean, like a roof or the siding on a building, using a pressure washer will save you time and effort. This is also a way to quickly rinse off any chemicals or cleaners you may have used to clean your steel. Make sure that your pressure washer is lower than 1450 psi, or it may remove the coating on your steel. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Mix one part ammonia to ten parts fresh water in a bucket.",
      "content": "Mix one part ammonia to ten parts fresh water in a bucket. You can purchase ammonia cleaning products at most major department stores. Mix the ammonia cleaner and the water into a bucket and use the solution to clean your galvanized steel. Wear gloves or the ammonia can cause irritation and chemical burns on exposed skin. [4] X Research source You can also use CLR, lime juice, Rust Dissolver, 10G or white vinegar as an alternative to ammonia to remove wet storage stains from your galvanized steel.

      "content": "Dip a durable nylon brush into the solution and wipe down your steel. Dip a nylon brush into the solution and scrub down your steel using a circular motion. Make sure to pay attention to problem areas. The white substance should start to come off as you clean."

      "title": "Request the use of chemical passivating treatments.",
      "content": "Request the use of chemical passivating treatments. The steel manufacturer may be able to provide these treatments to you at a cost. Chemical passivating reduces the likelihood of wet storage spots or \"white rust\" from appearing on your steel. The process covers the steel with a thin layer of water-based chromate coating, which can further protect it from being affected by the environment. [6] X Research source Spending the extra money passivating your steel may save you money in the long run because you won't have to pay for replacement steel."

      "content": "Rinse your steel with water and allow it to dry thoroughly. Use fresh water when rinsing your galvanized steel. Any chemicals that remain on its surface may corrode or destroy steel's coating over time."

      "title": "Avoid storing your steel in damp or poorly ventilated areas.",
      "content": "Avoid storing your steel in damp or poorly ventilated areas. Improperly storing your steel can create wet storage stains on them. Instead of stacking your steel, make sure that you put it on an angle so it can properly drain if it gets wet. Accumulation of water over time can create zinc deposits that form on the top of your steel. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Scrape the initial paint off with a wooden or plastic scraper.",
      "content": "Scrape the initial paint off with a wooden or plastic scraper. Do not use a metal scraping device to get paint off galvanized steel because it can easily scratch it and ruin its surface. Work your way around and remove the paint in large chunks, then concentrate on the smaller pieces next. Don't worry about getting it all, because you will be using a chemical process to eliminate the rest of the paint. If the paint is fresh and wet, skip this step and go to step two in this method. You can also use sandpaper or a wire brush to remove stuck on paint or rust from your galvanized steel. Be warned that this may cause discoloration, so if you need to maintain your steel aesthetically, these would not be good tools to use. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Scrub new paint with a standard paint thinner. If the paint is fresh, you can use a nylon brush and paint thinner to remove it from your galvanized steel. Add paint thinner to your galvanized metal with a rag and proceed to work it in with your nylon brush."

      "title": "Wipe your steel with a non-alkaline stripper for hard paint.",
      "content": "Wipe your steel with a non-alkaline stripper for hard paint. Paint that has dried and has become hard is harder to remove. Luckily, many paints react poorly with the zinc found in galvanized steel and will peel and chip once dry, making it easier for you to clean. Apply your stripper with a rag and scrub it in with a nylon or plastic bristled brush."
