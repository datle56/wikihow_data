The prophets, kings, and disciples who wrote the books of the Bible never imagined we'd be plumbing the good book's depths for rizz opportunities centuries later.

For example, you may be reminded of your crush's faith in God when reading of Daniel's faithfulness going into the lion's den. [2] X Research source You may also associate them with Queen Esther, a heroine whose courage never failed her and who saved hundreds of thousands of people. [3] X Research source You can also be inspired by a single verse instead of a complete story. For example, you can send your crush the rizz verse, \"Don’t go and glean in another field and don’t go away from here\" from Ruth 2:8 without knowing the story behind it."

For example, let's say you're inspired by the story of Deborah and how she led the Israelites into battle against the evil Sisera. Deborah was a judge who sat underneath a tree to counsel her people.

Spinning off that idea, you could say, \"Are you Deborah? Because I'd love to sit around and judge other people with you.\" If you're comparing yourself to the tree, you can amp up your rizz game even more by saying, \"I'm the tree to your Deborah.\""

      "title": "Practice delivering your Bible rizz line before trying it on your crush.",
      "content": "Practice delivering your Bible rizz line before trying it on your crush. A rizz line's success, Christian or not, hangs on your posture, facial expression, and the tone of your delivery. Put yourself in front of a mirror or film yourself trying different ways of saying the rizz line and assess how it sounds and looks. Change the way you smile or wiggle your eyebrows, test different hand gestures, and adjust the way your voice goes up and down on each word. Keep testing until you find a delivery you think your crush will enjoy. Try to see yourself saying your Bible rizz line through your crush's eyes. Will they think you're funny and charming or weird and awkward? If you're leaning more toward weird and awkward, work on toning it down. The last thing you want is for your crush to find you off-putting!"

      "content": "Read your crush's body language and know when to pull back on the rizz. When you deliver your Bible rizz line, pay attention to how your crush reacts, then pull back or push forward accordingly. For example, if they look uncomfortable, drop the rizz and direct the conversation to a topic you know they enjoy. If they laugh or look amused, though, laugh along with them and see if you can engage them in some witty Christian banter. Then pat yourself on the back for a Bible rizz pickup line well delivered!"

      "content": "The Holy Book is ripe with rizz potential waiting to be picked. With that in mind, remember not to use explicit innuendos or disrespect the Word of God or His Son. Most Christian singles choose to date other Christians exclusively because they want a romantic relationship based on values like faith, integrity, and modesty. Flirting is certainly okay in Christianity, but keep your Bible rizz lines and verses PG-rated and well-intentioned. And be prepared to do a complete 180 if your crush isn't amused by your rizz!"
