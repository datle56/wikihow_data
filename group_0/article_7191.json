      "content": "Wet your hair. Lice move quickly, so it can be hard to detect them. However, wet hair can often slow them down so they’re easier to spot. Dampen your hair, preferably with detangler or conditioner. This can be especially helpful if your hair is thick or tangled, as it makes it easier to move the comb through your hair.

      "content": "Set up two mirrors and a bright light. Arrange two mirrors so you can see the back of your neck and ears, as well as the front of your head. Sit under a bright light to make it easier to spot movement or eggs. It may also be helpful to have a magnifying glass on hand.

      "content": "Part and comb your hair. Put on some disposable gloves and grab a lice comb (or any fine comb). Use the comb to part your hair, then slowly run the comb through a small portion from root to tip. After each pull, check the teeth of the comb to see if any lice or eggs have come dislodged. Keep combing until you determine whether or not you have lice. [3] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics.

      "content": "Look for lice crawling on the scalp. As you comb, check for lice on your scalp and along the hair shaft. Adult lice are typically tan, brown, or dark in color and resemble sesame seeds. They move quickly and like warm places, so be sure to check around the nape of the neck and behind the ears.

      "title": "Check for nits (eggs) near the hair follicle.",
      "content": "Check for nits (eggs) near the hair follicle. Lice usually lay their eggs (called nits) within 2 mm from the scalp. Nits are often white or yellowish-brown in color and resemble tiny seeds. Hatched eggs look clear. It’s often easier to spot nits than adult lice because nits don’t move around. [5] X Trustworthy Source Seattle Children's Hospital Health information provided by Seattle Children's hospital. Go to source Sometimes, people confuse nits for dandruff, lint, or dirt. To determine if a speck is a nit, try to flick or pull it off. Dandruff is easily removed, but nits are not. Having a magnifying glass can also help you determine if you’ve found nits."

      "content": "Pick off any lice you see. If you do find lice or nits, place them in a small plastic bag or flush them down the toilet to dispose of them. At this point, you do not need to continue looking for lice. It’s best to proceed with a medicated lice shampoo to remove the rest of them. [6] X Research source After checking yourself, dispose of any gloves you used and wash your hands."

      "content": "Apply lice shampoo according to its instructions. Take off any clothes you don’t want to get stained, then apply the lice shampoo (or pediculicide) according to its instructions. After 8-12 hours, use a lice comb or other fine-toothed comb to comb out any dead or remaining lice. Continue to check for lice every 2-3 days for 2-3 weeks after treatment. [7] X Research source Avoid rewashing your hair for 2 days after removing the medication. Washing too soon may also wash out the medication, rendering it ineffective. Don’t apply conditioner or combination shampoo and conditioner before applying the medication. People with long hair (past shoulder-length) may need more than one bottle of lice shampoo. If the lice are still active after 12 hours, the medication might not have worked. In this case, it may be better to consult with a healthcare professional."

You want to vacuum everything really, really thoroughly—all of your upholstery, all of your carpet, all of your mattress.
