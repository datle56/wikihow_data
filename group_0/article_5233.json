      "title": "Use a VPN",
      "content": "Use a VPN . The easiest and safest way to bypass OpenDNS's security is by using a VPN. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) route your internet traffic through different servers around the world, which hides your network activity from security suites such as OpenDNS and the like. However, most VPN subscriptions are paid, and your restricted computer may not allow you to add your VPN to your settings. One free VPN option is Hotspot Shield. If you're able to install Hotspot Shield on the restricted computer, it will allow you to access most blocked sites. You can always put the Hotspot Shield setup file on a flash drive and then install it onto the computer from there."

      "title": "Use a cellular",
      "content": "Use a cellular data connection. If you have a supported iPhone or Android, you can use your phone's cellular data connection as a Wi-Fi network. This process is called \"tethering\", and not all cellular providers include it. The linked article references using tethering on a laptop, but the same instructions will work for a desktop computer. If the computer on which you're trying to bypass OpenDNS doesn't allow you to choose your own network, you won't be able to use tethering."

      "title": "Connect directly to the modem.",
      "content": "Connect directly to the modem. If you can attach your computer to the modem via Ethernet , you can bypass the network restrictions imposed by OpenDNS. Keep in mind that doing this in a work or school environment most likely constitutes trespassing, which is a serious offense. The modem is usually separate from the router. If your internet connection uses a router/modem combo, this method most likely won't work for you. This method is most effective for home connections with OpenDNS parental controls installed."

    {
      "title": "Open a proxy service.",
      "content": "Open a proxy service . If you don't have a VPN, a proxy server will often work. Just be careful, as proxies are not very safe—don't enter passwords or sensitive data when using a free proxy site. Go to any one of the following proxy sites: Hide.Me - https://hide.me/en/proxy ProxySite - https://www.proxysite.com/ ProxFree - https://www.proxfree.com/ Whoer - https://whoer.net/webproxy Hidester - https://hidester.com/proxy/ You may have to try several proxy sites before you find one which isn't blocked by OpenDNS. If none of the above proxies work, try searching for a proxy by typing best online proxy 2018 (or similar) into a search engine."

Your portable browser must be installed on the flash drive, not just stored on the flash drive."
