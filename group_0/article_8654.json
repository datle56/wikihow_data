      "content": "Wipe or spray the dumbbells with soap and water. For neoprene or rubber dumbbells, fill a bowl or basin with warm water and a squirt of dish soap, then dip a soft cloth or sponge into the mixture and gently scrub the dumbbell. For vinyl dumbbells, fill a spray bottle with warm water and a drop or two of dish soap, then lightly spray the dumbbell and wipe it with a microfiber cloth. [1] X Research source Neoprene is a synthetic rubber that protects dumbbells from scratches and general damage. It has a smooth texture, and most dumbbells have the word “neoprene” molded into the rubber if they’re made of the material. Pay special attention to crevices and knurling when wiping the dumbbells. Avoid using harsh chemicals as they could damage the material of the dumbbells. Don’t soak or oversaturate vinyl dumbbells, as too much soap will damage the vinyl. A light mist will suffice."

[2] X Research source Do not allow neoprene or vinyl dumbbells to air dry. However, you can air dry rubber dumbbells if you prefer. Repeat this cleaning process weekly to remove grime build-up and keep the material supple. Weekly cleaning with soap and water should do a good job of removing bacteria, but you can also wipe the dumbbells down with alcohol-free disinfectant wipes after each workout to keep them extra clean."
