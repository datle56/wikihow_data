      "content": "Learn what being a fashion icon means. Of course, being a fashion icon means setting future trends. It also means being timeless in your style. Being a fashion icon, however, extends beyond style. Icons want to shape and influence culture.

Be interested in things like philosophy, trends outside of fashion, and current events."
