      "content": "These two signs are highly competitive, which may cause conflict. While a little healthy competition can add excitement to a relationship, too much can introduce unhealthy rivalry.

[6] X Research source But if they both work on communicating openly, they can minimize conflict and avoid misunderstanding. If your friend hurts your feelings, write down what happened to see what made you upset. Was it a specific comment they made? Their behavior? Once you process your emotions, ask them to talk to you in person, and explain how they made you feel. Remember to use “I” statements to describe your perspective, instead of blaming the other person."
