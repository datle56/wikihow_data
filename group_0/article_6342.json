      "content": "Get a plastic cup and spoon to catch the isopods. Cut a few holes in the lid of a clean, plastic drinking cup to create ventilation. A plastic spoon is good for quickly scooping up any isopods you find and transferring them to the cup. [1] X Research source Alternatively, use a plastic container with a lid."

      "content": "Look for isopods in dark, sheltered, and damp places. Isopods like pillbugs and sowbugs are often found under logs, rocks, compost heaps, and leaf litter. Flip logs and rocks carefully, and use the spoon to disturb leaf litter and compost heaps. The isopods will scatter when they are disturbed and exposed to light. [2] X Research source Try looking for isopods in your backyard, parks, forests, and around ponds. A flashlight can be useful for spotting isopods."

      "content": "See if the isopod rolls into a ball to spot a pillbug. It's easy to tell pillbugs and sowbugs apart. Pillbugs curl into a ball when they feel threatened whereas sowbugs just scatter. [3] X Research source Pillbugs and sowbugs are very common garden isopods. They both make great pets!"

      "content": "Scoop the isopods into the plastic cup with the spoon. Take the lid off the cup before you upturn any logs or rustle any leaves. Carefully move the logs, rocks, compost, or leaf litter and begin searching. Place the plastic spoon in front of an isopod as it moves and then transfer it into the cup. Try a different spot once you can’t see any more isopods, as they will all be hiding. [4] X Research source Lightly tap the spoon on the side of the container to drop the isopod in.

      "content": "Cut a potato in half lengthwise and scoop out each center with a spoon. Place the potato on a chopping board and use a sharp knife to slice it. Isopods love to eat rotting vegetables, so potatoes make great bait. [6] X Research source Get an adult to help if you have trouble with the knife. You don't need to wash or peel the potato."

Position each potato half like a bowl and cover it well with leaves. [7] X Research source Make sure that each potato half is covered fully by leaves so that it isn't exposed to the light."

      "content": "Collect isopods from the potato halves after 24-48 hours. Gently move the log or leaf litter to uncover the trap. Lift the trap and use a plastic spoon to scoop out any isopods into a plastic container. Otherwise, tap the potato gently over the opening on the container so the isopods fall in. [8] X Research source Make sure the plastic container lid has holes for ventilation."

Use scissors or a drill to punch a few holes in the lid so that air can circulate. [9] X Research source This container size is great for 20-30 isopods. Ask an adult for help using scissors or a drill if you need."

Spread it out evenly across the bottom of the container. [10] X Research source Replace the soil twice each year and remove any dead isopods at the same time."
