      "content": "Many cultures believe owls are bad luck because of their dark associations. Since ancient times, these mostly nocturnal creatures have been associated with evil things that lurk in the dark. Owls are often associated with death as well. In cultures where owls have these associations, it's typically considered a bad omen to see or hear them. [1] X Research source Arabian cultures consider the call of an owl to be a bad omen and in Iran the birds themselves are considered bad luck. Sometimes an owl has to be in a specific place to be considered bad luck, such as on the roof of a house. This superstition, too, is based in reality—owls tend to avoid humans, so it would be rare for one to be comfortable enough that it decided to roost on a human habitation. There's one superstition that if you have a dream about an owl while you're traveling, it means you could be robbed or possibly shipwrecked—which would definitely be bad luck for a traveler. [2] X Research source In Ireland, it was once believed that if an owl ever entered your house, you should kill it immediately. If you don't, it will take all of the luck in your house with it when it flies away. That may or may not be bad luck for you, but it's definitely bad luck for the owl. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Other cultures honor and revere owls as good luck charms. These cultures tend to associate owls with wisdom and knowledge. Seeing or hearing a live owl might be seen as an omen of good times or prosperity to come. People in some of these cultures have used an image of an owl or part of an owl (such as a feather or a bone) as a good luck charm. [4] X Research source For example, in Germany, it was once believed that you could escape the symptoms of rabies if bitten by a rabid dog as long as you carried the heart and right foot of an owl under your left armpit. In India, if an owl hoots 9 times in a row it symbolizes good fortune to all who hear it. Owls are more commonly considered good luck in Asian cultures, including China and Japan. [5] X Research source In China, placing owl effigies in each corner of your home will protect it from lightning strikes."

      "content": "Owls are associated with death. Many cultures associate darkness and night with death. As nocturnal creatures, then, it stands to reason that owls would get lumped in along with the time when they're most active. Some superstitions have an owl foretelling death, while in others, the owl is meant to guide a departing spirit through the spirit world or underworld. [6] X Research source Romans believed that the hooting of an owl predicted death, even really famous deaths, such as Julius Caesar's. [7] X Research source This association depends on the location of the owl in some superstitions. For example, some superstitions have it that a hooting owl near your house could mean a newborn baby was going to die. Some South African tribes put spikes on their roofs to keep owls away because of this very superstition. [8] X Research source Being associated with death isn't always a bad thing. For example, in Romania, souls of repentant sinners fly to heaven as snowy owls. Historically, Russian hunters carried owl claws with them for their souls to use to climb to heaven if they died.

      "content": "Owls are associated with evil. Death and evil walk hand-in-hand in some cultures, but even in those where that's not true, there's still something ominous and spooky about nighttime, when owls are often at their most active. For this reason, many superstitions revolve around owls being evil themselves or working in league with evil people or entities. [10] X Research source The call of an owl at night can be spine-tingling, which might be another reason for the owl's association with evil. Many superstitions would have it that an owl's call should be a signal to anyone in hearing distance that evil is about to befall them in some way."

      "content": "Owls are familiars for people with supernatural powers. Owls are associated with magic and the supernatural in most cultures. Because they are night creatures and night is associated with the spirit world, owls are often believed to be used as messengers by witches, sorcerers, and shamans. [11] X Research source For example, in Madagascar, it's believed that owls dance on graves along with witches. [12] X Research source Some superstitions give supernatural powers to owls themselves. For example, in some superstitions you can improve your eyesight if you eat the eggs or eyes of an owl. [13] X Research source An owl might also be used as a spy. As one legend has it, if you hear an owl hooting continuously, it means there's a witch nearby. This can relate to a place where an owl lives as well. Since owls were believed to be the only creatures that could live with ghosts, one superstition assumes an abandoned home to be haunted if an owl takes up residence there. [14] X Research source"

In many cultures, seeing or hearing an owl is meant to predict something happening in your life or in the lives of those around you. It might also signal future outcomes in weather, travel, or even military battle. Part of this likely trickles down from the belief that an owl was a familiar of the ancient Greek goddess Athena, goddess of wisdom. The wise old owl knows what's going to happen. [15] X Research source In Brittany, there's a superstition that if you see an owl on the way to the harvest, you'll have a good yield. [16] X Research source People in Indonesia have used the different calls of the owl to predict the weather and determine whether it's safe to travel. [17] X Research source Ancient Greeks believed that the sight of an owl meant military victory, while for ancient Romans the same sight meant sure defeat. [18] X Research source"

As much as people have tried to ascribe spiritual or supernatural powers to these creatures, the fact of the matter is, they're just birds that make up an essential part of the ecosystem where you live. Do everything you can not to disturb it. [19] X Research source It's pretty unlikely that an owl would choose to take up residence near your home because owls usually don't like to be around humans. But if you do have an owl hanging out near you, it's likely a benefit to you. If an owl has taken up shelter near your home and doesn't want to leave, that probably means that they've found a good food source nearby—which means they're also providing you with free pest control. [20] X Research source Many owls are also protected by local, national, and international laws. If an owl has made its home in a spot that you believe is dangerous, contact your local wildlife authority to find out what you can do. [21] X Research source"

It is simply called \"the bird that makes you afraid.\" [23] X Research source Morocco: According to ancient custom, you can wear the eye of an owl on a string around your neck to ward off the \"evil eye.\" [24] X Research source Nigeria: The Yoruba people believe that you can become possessed by an owl and get sick.

[37] X Trustworthy Source National Audubon Society Nonprofit environmental organization focused on conservation, citizen science, and public science education Go to source It's also a myth that owls can turn their heads all the way around, although they can turn a good 270 degrees in one direction or another—a lot further than humans can! The ability of owls to rotate their necks that far compensates for their immobile eyes so they can see in all directions around them. They also have a blood-pooling system that collects blood so they don't pass out from rotating their necks like this."

But unlike the other birds with feet configured this way, owls have the ability to pivot one of those back toes forward. That makes it easier for them to walk than other birds. It also means they can grip their prey more tightly. [38] X Trustworthy Source National Audubon Society Nonprofit environmental organization focused on conservation, citizen science, and public science education Go to source Though you rarely see them, owls also have pretty long legs that make it a cinch for them to race across the ground—although maybe not as quickly as they could fly."

Although owls might look cute and seem sweet, they are powerful predators that can be quite dangerous in the wrong hands. [42] X Research source Most owls also live pretty long lives in captivity (as long as 30 years or more), which is a longer commitment than most people envision when they adopt a pet. Owls still maintain their natural instincts even in captivity, which makes them a pretty high-maintenance creature that likely doesn't respond well to pets and cuddles."
