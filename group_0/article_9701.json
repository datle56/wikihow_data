Be aware that many sites contain ads and malware, but you can expertly avoid them by not clicking on elements that are not part of the page. You can tell if an icon that you want to click will redirect you by hovering your mouse over it and looking in the bottom left corner to the link pop-up; if it says a site other than the site you're on, it's most likely a malicious link that you shouldn't click. Take your time and look around and you'll find the legit button elsewhere on the page. Examples include download and upload icons, or Go buttons."
