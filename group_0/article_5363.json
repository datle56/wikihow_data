      "content": "Take your blood pressure. To be able to calculate your mean arterial pressure, you'll need to know both your diastolic and systolic blood pressures. If you don't already know these, take your blood pressure to find them. Though there are a variety of fancy methods for taking your own blood pressure, all you'll need for reasonably accurate results is a blood pressure cuff and a stethoscope. As a reminder, your blood pressure when you hear the first beat in the stethoscope is your systolic pressure and your blood pressure when you stop hearing beats is your diastolic.

      "content": "Use the formula MAP = (2(DBP) + SBP)/3. Once you know your diastolic and systolic blood pressures, finding your MAP is easy. Simply multiply your diastolic by two, add it to your systolic, and divide the total by three. This is essentially the same as the basic equation for finding the average (mean) of a range of numbers. MAP is measured in mm Hg (or \"millimeters of mercury\"), a standard pressure measurement. Note that the diastolic pressure is multiplied by two because the cardiac system spends about two-thirds of its time in the \"resting\" diastole phase. For example, let's say that we take our blood pressure and find that we have a diastolic pressure of about 87 and a systolic pressure of about 120. In this case, we'd plug our values into our equation and solve as follows: MAP = (2(87) + 120)/3 = (294)/3 = 98 mm Hg ."

Subtract your diastolic from your systolic, divide by three, and add your diastolic. The result you get should be exactly the same as you'd get from the equation above. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Using the same blood pressure values as above, we can solve this equation as follows: MAP = 1/3(120 – 87) + 87 = 1/3(33) + 87 = 11 + 87 = 98 mm Hg ."

In medical situations, this alternate equation, which uses the variables of cardiac output (CO; measured in L/min) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR; measured in mm HG × min/L) is sometimes used to find a quick estimate for a person's MAP. Though the results from this equation sometimes aren't 100% accurate, they are usually suitable as approximate estimates. Note that CO and SVR are usually measured in medical settings with special equipment (though it is possible to find them with simpler methods). For the average female, normal cardiac output is about 5 L/min. If we assume an SVR of 20 mm HG × min/L (on the high end of normal levels), the female's MAP will be about 5 × 20 = 100 mm Hg ."

If you have a resting MAP that is outside of the \"normal\" range above, you may not necessarily be in any danger, but you should still consult a doctor for a thorough examination and analysis. The same is true if you have abnormal values for your resting systolic or diastolic blood pressures (which should be below 120 and 80 mm Hg respectively). Don't put off talking your doctor — many cardiovascular conditions are easily treated if they're addressed before they develop into a serious problem.

Watch the pressure gauge — you want to inflate the cuff to a pressure that's about 30 mm Hg higher than you expect your systolic pressure to be. [9] X Research source As you do this, hold the head of your stethoscope to the spot where you found your pulse (or, if you couldn't find it, in the crook of your elbow). Listen — if you've inflated your cuff to a high enough pressure, you shouldn't be able to hear your pulse at this point."
