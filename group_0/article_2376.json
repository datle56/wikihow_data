      "content": "Ignore the negatives, and focus on the positives. While backhanded compliments can sting, they can have a positive connotation. Rather than focusing on the negative feelings the comment invokes, focus on what was positively said. Thank the person for the compliment, and avoid addressing the dig.

You should dress up more often,” focus on the fact that they think you look incredible rather than that your usual attire isn’t up to their standards."

Know that not everyone who gives backhanded compliments intends for their comments to be offensive. They may genuinely mean to compliment you; it just sounds more insulting than they thought."
