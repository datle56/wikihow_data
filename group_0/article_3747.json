[1] X Trustworthy Source National Institutes of Health U.S. government agency for biomedical and public health research Go to source Being an alpha isn't about having a muscular physique or being able to benchpress a certain amount of weight—it's about being strong and healthy . For example, if you're physically fit, you can help a friend pack up and move without having to take multiple extensive breaks to recover. Physical wellness extends to substance use as well. A true alpha doesn't go out binge drinking every weekend and come into work late on Monday morning nursing a hangover. If you take care of yourself, others will be more likely to believe you're capable of taking care of others—and taking care of others is one of the main things a real leader does."

Because you respect yourself and your romantic interest, you're not going to play games or keep them guessing. [2] X Research source Instead, you're going to tell them how you feel and let them choose what to do with that information. If they say \"no\" or otherwise indicate that they're not interested, a true alpha knows to leave them alone rather than push. You know that rejection is a part of life and you take it in stride. If they say \"yes,\" on the other hand, you've set the stage for a potentially healthy and respectful relationship to develop."

If you haven't figured yours out yet, do some soul searching and make a list of the things that are most important to you. Focus on active values to guide your behavior, such as honesty and responsibility (which are also core alpha traits). [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Choose 2 or 3 values that you're going to hold as the most important. With every action you take and every decision you make, ask yourself first if it advances your core values. For example, if you choose \"honesty\" as one of your core values, you would strive to always behave honestly. You would avoid cutting corners and acting dishonestly, even if it made things harder for you in the short run. Always stand up and defend your core values. For example, if one of your core values is \"equality,\" you might speak out when someone makes a sexist or misogynist remark. Wondering how to be a non-toxic alpha male?

It simply means that you believe that no matter what happens, everything will ultimately be okay. People know they can count on an alpha to confront challenges straight-on and look for solutions rather than getting caught up in negative thinking.

Some might panic, but an alpha would see an opportunity to transition to something else until the shipment arrived. Being optimistic also means encouraging others to find a way over the various hurdles and stumbling blocks that appear in their paths."

[5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source If you unapologetically own the space where you're sitting or standing, you give off the impression that you're confident and comfortable in your own skin—even if you're not.

It's easy to sit back and be content with what you have rather than striving for more—but alphas don't take the easy way out. Challenging yourself to do things that don't come easily helps you grow as a person and build your confidence and self-esteem. [11] X Research source This also means facing your own fears. For example, if you have a fear of public speaking, you might sign up to present projects in front of smaller groups so that you become more comfortable speaking in front of others. At the same time, this doesn't mean that you never do things that are relaxing or enjoyable. It just means that you know when to push yourself."

Part of being an alpha means not allowing compulsions, fixations, or substances to control your thoughts and actions. As an alpha, you try to be in control of yourself as much as you can, which means avoiding vices except rarely and in moderation. You're also able to resist the call of a temptation that will only provide short-term happiness (at best) because you know you'll get more satisfaction from achieving your long-term goals.

On the contrary, understanding and adapting to your partner's needs is a very alpha thing to do! For example, one of your partner's boundaries might be \"no yelling.\" If your emotions get too heated and you raise your voice, stop. Immediately apologize and take a few minutes to calm down."
