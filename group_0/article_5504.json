Identical values should still be counted, meaning if you have values that repeat in your set, each one still counts in determining your total. Do not include the sum (answer) of all the numbers added up when counting the quantity of the values. [6] X Research source Example: 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 make for a total of five values."

      "content": "Divide the sum of the set by the number of values. The result is the mean (a type of average) of your set. This implies that if each number in your set was the mean, they would add up to the same total. [7] X Research source Example: 20 / 5 = 4 {\\displaystyle 20/5=4} . Therefore, 4 is the mean of the numbers. You can check your calculations by multiplying the mean by the number of values in the set. In this case, multiply 4 {\\displaystyle 4} (the mean) by the 5 {\\displaystyle 5} (the number of values in the set) and your result will be 20 {\\displaystyle 20} ( 4 âˆ— 5 = 20 {\\displaystyle 4*5=20} )."
