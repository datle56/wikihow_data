Here are some materials used to build this particular brake. 1/4 cold rolled steel plate, one piece 7\"X42\", one 14\"X48\" 1/4\"X2\" angle iron, two pieces 14\", one piece 42\", one piece 48\" 5/16\"X2 1/2\" angle iron 42\" long 1 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.6 cm) steel tubing, about 18\" long 1/2\"X1 1/2\" steel bolts with nuts and washers, 4 each. 1/2\"X1 1/2\" smooth steel rods, 2 required"

    {
      "title": "Lay the 42\" piece of 2\" angle iron on top of the 7\" wide (top) plate, centering it between the two end angles in the center of the sheet with the angle up, and weld it in place, with at least one inch welds on each edge 8 inches (20.3 cm) apart.",

This will stiffen the plate when a piece of metal is clamped in the brake."

The location of these bolts isn't critical, but it will look better if they are in line with each other and on each end. Install one of your 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) bolts into each hole, bolting the angle to the plate loosely."
