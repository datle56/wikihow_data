      "content": "You disconnected the call quickly before it connected. If you called somebody and hung up before they answered (or before their voicemail engaged), the call will appear as \"Cancelled\" in your call logs. If you cancel the call by hanging up quickly, the person you called will see \"Missed Call\" in their call logs if the call went through and rang at least once. If you hang up before the other party's network registered the call, they may not see your call in their logs at all. Similarly, if you hear a busy signal and hang up, you'll see \"Cancelled Call\" in your call log. It's easy to accidentally call someone when you're looking at their Contact info. A misplaced tap can start a call you didn't mean to make. If you immediately hang up, you'll see \"Cancelled Call\" in your call log, but the other person will see \"Missed Call.\""
