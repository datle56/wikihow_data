      "content": "Keep your BMW key battery charged with regular driving. Each time your key is inserted into the ignition and turned to position 1 or position 2, the battery will automatically charge. If you don’t drive your car regularly, try to at least take it on 1 or 2 long drives per year to make sure the battery stays charged. Position 1 or “KL R” turns on the accessories. Position 2 is when the car is running."

      "title": "Drive 30 hours total to fully recharge a dead key battery.",
      "content": "Drive 30 hours total to fully recharge a dead key battery. The discharge time on the key battery is about 18 months. Since the key battery charges while you drive, it’s not likely that your key will ever fully die until it reaches the end of its life. At this point, the battery (or the entire key, depending on the model) will just need to be replaced. [2] X Research source A completely dead key most likely occurs with a spare key that has gone unused for at least 18 months."

      "content": "Invest in a wireless cell phone charger to double as a key charger. Wireless phone chargers charge cell phones by inductive charging, which uses electromagnetic fields to transfer energy between 2 objects. This will work to charge your BMW key as well. Simply set your key on top of the charging pad and keep it there for a few hours or overnight. You can find a wireless charger online or in your local department store for as little as $10.00."
