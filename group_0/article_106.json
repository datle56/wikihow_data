      "content": "Simple and thoughtful gifts You don’t need a flashy or super expensive gift to celebrate a 40th birthday! Think about something your guy already likes to use or that he could add to his daily life to pamper himself a bit, like some self-care items or hobby supplies. This shows you know him well and put thought into something he’d enjoy! And don’t stress about spending too much. Congdon says, “To make your husband feel special and without spending money, get personal. Think of something that he would really enjoy and love that shows you took time to think about him. You can try using a coupon book, a special outing, or try making him a special meal.” Here are some more ideas for inspiration: Fancy dinner and drinks. Feel free to go out to his favorite restaurant or prepare a meal yourself for a more intimate celebration. Beard care items. If your guy rocks facial hair, consider a goody basket with a new beard care kit or even a new luxury trimmer . He’ll feel his best and think of you whenever he grooms! [1] X Research source Skin care items. Help him treat himself to a spa day with face masks , moisturizers, a shower steamer , and other luxurious items. Clothing. Replenish his wardrobe with new seasonal clothes like cozy sweaters and flannels or sharp-looking shorts and sunglasses. You could even get him a subscription to a men’s clothing box so he’s never out of style! Engraved jewelry. Pick out a new watch, ring, or bracelet he’ll love and have it engraved with a special message that’ll make him think of you. Custom portrait or artwork. Is he an art lover? Send a photo of him to a portrait artist for a one-of-a-kind gift, or look for other artwork he’d love to display and admire. New tech gadget. Any neat item could make a great gift, from noise-canceling headphones to cordless power banks to a nice camera to a new game console (if he’s a gamer). Customized leather goods. Think fine leather belts, wallets, travel bags, jackets, or boots. For a personal touch, engrave his name, initials, or a unique message to make him smile. Personalized whiskey, wine, or beer glasses. If he appreciates a good drink, think about an engraved whiskey set, wine glass set, or beer mugs. Pair it with a bottle of his favorite drink to make his day! Hobby items. Art supplies, new running shoes, a new tool box, adjustable dumbbells , camping equipment, grilling accessories, a massage gun , new luggage or travel supplies—whatever he’s into, there’s a gift to blow him away!"

      "title": "Fun and unexpected gifts and activities",
      "content": "Fun and unexpected gifts and activities Does your new 40-year-old appreciate something surprising or out of the ordinary? Think about his most niche, nerdy interests or something that he’s always wanted to do and surprise him with a gift, gathering, or outing to knock his socks off. (Just make sure his schedule is cleared if you plan on throwing a surprise party or taking him somewhere!) Take a look at this list to brainstorm some ideas: Surprise party . Many grown men won’t think to organize a birthday party for themselves, so coordinate with his friends and family for a sweet surprise. Themed party. What’s his favorite movie, sports team, video game, hobby, or decade? A birthday party dedicated to one of his personal interests shows how well you know him. Personalized vinyl. Hunt down the most popular record from the year he was born, or get one if his more modern favorite on vinyl for a unique gift. No record player? This is the perfect excuse to buy one ! Surprise delivery at work. Does your man have to work on his 40th birthday? Brighten his work day with flowers, cupcakes, lunch, or coffee brought right to his office. Milestone map. Purchase a large wall map and put “drop pins” on special locations for him (where he was born, where he got married, his favorite travel destinations, etc.). It’s a great way to look back on his 40 years of life! A piece of nature. Does he love animals or the great outdoors? Plant a tree or adopt an endangered wild animal in his name. You could even name a star after him! Personalized puzzle or board game. Is he a puzzle or game lover? Choose a special photo to be made into a puzzle or game board to make game nights extra special. Shadow box for keepsakes. Does he have any old, sentimental items laying around in storage? Display them in a sleek shadow box to turn jerseys, medals, collectibles, or anything he likes into home decor. Memory slideshow or book. Hit him in the feels with a look back on his life in photos and videos. Screen your montage with friends and family to make it an event, or have your own private viewing for a more intimate gift. Cover band. Book a local band to cover his favorite songs and artists to really blow him away. Invite friends and set up in your backyard, or look into local venues. Either way, it’ll be a party he’ll never forget!"

      "title": "Experiences and adventures he’ll love",
      "content": "Experiences and adventures he’ll love Get out of the house and show your special guy the time of his life with an unforgettable night or weekend of fun. Experience gifts are great for a man turning 40 because he probably has a lot of the things he likes or needs already (plus, an invigorating or new activity can help him feel young and lively if he’s self-conscious about starting a new decade). Experience gifts are just as thoughtful as physical gifts and the memories they create will last a lifetime! [2] X Research source Winery, brewery, or distillery tour. Research local options and spend an afternoon sampling his favorite beverages and learning all about how they’re made. Cooking class. You get to learn a new skill, spend time together, and eat a delicious meal all in one outing. Happy birthday indeed! [3] X Research source Concert tickets. Grab tickets to his favorite band or artist when they’re in town, or make a weekend trip to a new city if they aren’t touring near you. Sports tickets. If he’s a sports fanatic, grab tickets to a game on or near his birthday. Bonus points if his favorite team is playing! Boat day. Get on the water any way you can. You might rent some paddle boats or canoes to explore local ponds and rivers, book a festive afternoon on a rental yacht near large lakes or the seaside, or even look into dinner cruises near you. Escape room. Get a small group together and work together to find clues that’ll lead you out of the escape room. This is perfect for a guy who loves puzzles, mystery, and being a hero. Skydiving, bungee jumping, or zip-lining. If he loves a good thrill, book an outing for an extreme adrenaline rush he’ll never forget. There’s no better way to feel alive! Live theater. If he loves comedy clubs, musicals, plays, or performance art, feed his artistic side and spend a night on the town with dinner and a show. Camping. Looking for something quiet and simple? Spend a night or 2 in the great outdoors with your favorite camping snacks, a cozy tent, and some hiking gear to take in all the nature. Competitive sports. If he’s got an athletic (and competitive) streak, recruit some friends and sign up for a golf day, volleyball match, recreational kickball or softball, or any game that’ll get him off his feet and in the birthday zone. Bucket list item. What’s something your man wants to do or see in his life? Use his 40th birthday as an opportunity to make one of those items happen, whether it’s a trip to a far off destination or a new experience you can try near home."

      "title": "40-themed gifts and activities",
      "content": "40-themed gifts and activities Turning 40 is special, so feel free to incorporate his new age into his gift or activity. There are a ton of ways to get playful with the number 40—here are just a few ideas! Book of 40 memories. If he’s a sentimental guy, create a photo album of 40 precious or important memories. They can be 40 moments since you’ve known him, or from his whole life (whichever you prefer). 40 custom coupons. Get creative and make 40 “coupons” your guy can use for small favors or gifts from you. You could include a home cooked dinner, backrubs, an evening where he gets to choose what’s on TV, or anything else you can think of! (And if you’re feeling spicy, dedicate a few coupons to the bedroom. Congdon says, “If your husband has been craving intimacy, that’s always a nice gift too.”) 40-hour adventure. For 40 hours, let him call the shots about what, when, and where you all celebrate. Basically, anything he says goes for 40 hours! 40 notes and messages. Leave 40 short sticky notes for the birthday man to find all over the house or apartment. Include some sweet and touching messages, jokes, hints about where other notes are, or even little doodles to make him chuckle. 40th birthday scavenger hunt. Make a scavenger hunt that includes items with the number 40 (for example, “Collect 40 pennies”) or that have to do with memories and moments from his 40 years of life (“Find a house with the same address numbers as your childhood home”). Rubies. The 40th year is the ruby year, so consider a piece of ruby jewelry or a decor piece featuring rubies (this is extra great if ruby is also his birthstone or if his favorite color is red). These kinds of gifts are usually reserved for anniversaries, but 40 years of anything is reason enough to celebrate!"

      "title": "Romantic experiences for you two",
      "content": "Romantic experiences for you two If the birthday boy is your partner, consider an intimate evening or getaway for just the two of you. When it comes to romance, Congdon says the key elements are “surprise and thoughtfulness. Romance isn’t the same for each person, so consider what your partner likes and what they would enjoy. While one person might love flowers, a different individual may not find that to be romantic. Taking time to observe and ask your partner at different moments what they like will help you design that romantic outing that is sure to wow them.” Here are some simple but heartwarming ideas: Staycation. Book a night or 2 at a nice hotel in town to recharge, relax, and spend some quality time together. Or, turn off your phones and computers to turn your home into an out-of-reach cabin for a night. Breakfast in bed. Surprise him in the morning with his favorite breakfast foods, coffee, and a cupcake or pancake stack with a birthday candle to mark the occasion. Just don’t surprise him too early in the morning. Spa day. Clear an afternoon (or a whole day) for pampering, relaxing, and self-care. Look for places that have his favorite spa elements (a sauna, ice bath, yoga, etc.) to really make his day. Couples massage. Book an appointment for restorative massages that leave you both refreshed and ready to celebrate with friends and family later. Professional photo shoot. Take some romantic new photos together as a couple or bring the kids along for a touching family portrait. You could even dress him up to the 9’s for a solo shoot if that’s something he’d enjoy. Romantic bedroom. Turn your bedroom into a 5-star couple’s suite with dimmed lighting, candles, balloons, soft music, chocolates, and champagne. You’ll hardly have to leave the bedroom all night. Indoor picnic. If the weather’s not cooperating, lay out some blankets and a spread of his favorite snacks and drinks inside. Take it to the next level with couch cushion seating, nature sounds or videos on your TV, or star projections on the ceiling. Mini vacation. Spend a long weekend in a quaint town nearby for a local getaway, or fly to a new destination to celebrate the big 4-0. Leave plenty of room in your itinerary for lounging, exploring new attractions, and enjoying each other’s company. Private movie theater rental. This one may cost a bit, but the experience is worth it. Contact a local cinema and rent a theater just for you and your man (or a bigger group if you prefer). Screen his favorite film or a home movie celebrating his birthday to make him feel truly special. Road trip for two. If you’ve both got a case of wanderlust, throw your overnight bags together and hit the road to celebrate. You can go to an actual destination, camp along the way, or just drive a big loop and come home—whatever fits his schedule and interests!"

      "content": "Pick a fun theme based on his interests. While adult birthday parties don’t have to have a theme, picking a theme near and dear to him will make him appreciate your efforts even more! Think about his favorite movies or games, sports teams, interests and hobbies, or places he’s visited. Your theme will help you make decisions later about food, decor, music, party favors, and more. [4] X Research source If you’re looking for ideas, some popular adult birthday themes include: A masquerade ball A decade-themed party (all-80’s, all-90’s, etc.) A speakeasy Hollywood red carpet A tropical luau Murder mystery dinner Wine and cheese night"

      "content": "Choose a date that works for him and invite his friends and loved ones. If his actual birthday is on a tough date or weekday, find an evening or weekend where he and the people that are important to him are available. Check with his close friends and family ahead of time to make sure a good percentage of them can make it (this can be especially daunting around the holidays or in summer when people are traveling more). [5] X Research source For a casual get together, a group text or e-invite is totally fine. For fancier parties, you may want to mail formal invitations . Include important details like the time, date, venue, the food and drink situation, and whether guests should bring a gift in the invitation."

      "content": "Decorate your space to match the theme. First, decide whether you’ll use your home or a different venue to host the party. Then, choose themed decor and party supplies to decorate the space . Check your own party supplies first to see what you already have and then go shopping for the rest. Consider items like tablecloths, plates and cutlery, cups, centerpieces, balloons, streamers, posters, garlands, or novelty items like cardboard cutouts of famous people or characters to complete the scene. Where should you shop for party supplies? Creative indie shops like Etsy are great for custom gag items (like drink stirrers with your man’s face on them or a pin-the-tail-on-your-husband game set) or decor in a specific theme, like Ghost Busters centerpieces. For affordable general party supplies, try sites like Amazon or big box stores like Target or Walmart. Personal touches like photos or memory books also make for great decor that your guests will love to look through. Hosting at your home makes for a relaxed vibe, while a place like a gallery or even an event space at a bar feels a bit more sophisticated. Parks or beaches make great outdoor locations, too!

      "content": "Plan to order or make food he’ll love. Ask the birthday boy what he’d like to eat on his big day or surprise him with something you know he’ll love, like catering from his favorite takeout restaurant. For big parties, it’s best to keep it fairly simple. Things like sandwiches, crudités, sliders, pizza, grilled bites, and charcuterie boards are always popular and easy to coordinate. [7] X Research source If you can, try to match the food to the party theme (if there is one). Bruschetta and an olive bar would be fantastic for an Italian festa di compleanno , for example. Consider creating a cocktail that matches the theme, too, like serving martinis (shaken, not stirred) for a James Bond theme. Don’t forget about the birthday cake! Choose a visual design that fits your theme for the top, or get a different dessert that he prefers: donuts, cupcakes, s’mores, brownies, cookies, or ice cream sundaes are always a hit!"

      "content": "Get him a meaningful gift. Sometimes, the party is the gift. But, if you also got him a present, wrap it up nicely and give it to him at a special time. If it’s a romantic or personal gift, that might mean waiting until your guests have cleared out to give it to him. Or, if your party traditions put people on the spot to open their gifts, have it ready for opening during the party. If your guests are bringing gifts, set up a table or receiving area to hold them so they don’t clutter your venue (and so guests don’t have to carry them around)."

Choose small gifts and goodies that match the theme (for example, mini wine glasses with “[Name]’s 40th birthday party” etched on them for a wine and cheese party, or personalized flip-flops and beach balls for a beach party). Aim for something fun, clever, or unique to commemorate the spirit of the day. [8] X Research source Just make sure your party favors don’t put you over budget!

If your guy is suffering from the birthday blues , show him that 40 isn’t the end—it’s the start of a new, fun, and rewarding chapter of life! Our emotional intelligence and relationships become deeper and more fulfilling as we age, so a lively birthday party full of his closest friends and family is sure to show him that life has plenty left to offer as he gets older. [9] X Research source If he’s really anti-40 and isn’t feeling up for a party, don’t press the issue. Instead, scale down the celebration to something he’s comfortable with and plan an activity he’ll find fun or rewarding to feel better."

On the other hand, you still have decades of life left to spend with loved ones, learn new things, and enjoy the results of the hard work you’ve done up until this point. [10] X Research source This makes 40 a special and exciting time to celebrate your life’s achievements (so far) and to reflect on what you hope to do in your next chapters of life. Some people feel self-conscious about turning 40 because of the incorrect (yet popular) stereotype that aging means a lower quality of life. While your body may age and decline eventually (it happens to the best of us!), studies show that your mental health, stress levels, and desire to help the next generation continuously improve as you get older. A lot of this improvement happens around 40! [11] X Research source"
