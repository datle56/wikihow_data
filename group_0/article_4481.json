They do not name-call, put each other down, yell, or exhibit other signs of abusive behaviors. They support each other privately and in public. They also honor their partner’s boundaries. Healthy couples have personal boundaries (expressing their preferences and needs), and they use assertiveness to express these boundaries in a kind and loving way. When communicating assertively, people in healthy relationships communicate openly and honestly. This means also that healthy couples can share their feelings with the other person, not have a need to be right all the time, and listen to each other in a loving, open, and nonjudgmental way."

Healthy couples don’t play the “blame game.” Each person takes responsibility for his or her behavior, thinking, and emotions. Each takes control of his or her own happiness and destiny. Both partners also take responsibility for when they make mistakes and do what’s necessary to make it up to the other partner. For example, apologizing is a good start."
