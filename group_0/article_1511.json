      "content": "Decide what you want out of your mascara. There is a mascara for just about any kind of lash enhancement--volumizing, lengthening, defining, faster growth, waterproof--plus many products that combine these effects. Take a look at your lashes and decide what sort of enhancement they need. For sparse lashes, look for a thickening or volumizing mascara with a large, round brush with lots of bristles. You can also find a combination primer and mascara formula, which is perfect for bulking up lashes and keeping them healthy. If you have short lashes, look for a lengthening mascara with a smaller brush with thick bristles. A small wand will allow you to get very close to your eye and make sure you coat each lash. [1] X Expert Source Alicia D'Angelo Makeup Artist & Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 10 April 2020. If your lashes are full but you want length and definition, choose a lengthening mascara, but one with a long brush with evenly-spaced bristles to separate your lashes. If your lashes are uneven in length or damaged, check the ingredients on the mascara. Phyto-keratin and panthenol can help your lashes grow. Use a fatter brush on your lashes. [2] X Research source You should only use mascara for three months before replacing it, so go ahead and experiment with different brands and formulas until you find your perfect mascara. Use waterproof mascara only for special events, like if you’re going to a pool party or a movie that might make you cry. It’s difficult to remove and can dry out your lashes, making them brittle."

      "content": "Pick your shade. For the most part, black is the way to go. It gives the illusion of thickness and length and can really make your eyes pop. If your lashes are red or blonde, however, make brown your go-to shade, wearing light brown for everyday and a dark brown to amp up the drama. Experiment with colored mascaras. Green can bring out violet in blue eyes, purple can enhance green eyes, and blue and purple can brighten your complexion. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Invest in an eyelash curler , while you're at it. If you're serious about getting knock-out lashes, an eyelash curler is key. This will lift your lashes and allow more light to hit your eyes so they look bigger and brighter. [4] X Research source It may not seem like it, but an eyelash curler can make a huge difference. Look for a curler with a rounded rubber pad, which will help curl your lash instead of bend it at a sharp angle. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply any other eye makeup first. If you’re planning to wear eyeshadow, eyeliner, or any other eye makeup, brush it on before you do your mascara. This will ensure that you don’t smudge any of your mascara by trying to put other products on around it. Other non-eye makeup, such as foundation or blush, can be applied at any time. Most people choose to apply full-face makeup first, then finish with eye makeup."

Then, release the curler. [6] X Research source If you don't have a curler or you're too afraid to use one, use your fingertips to push up and curl wet lashes.

Twisting will allow the brush to pick up the mascara, which is what most people think they are doing when they pump the brush in the tube.

      "content": "Go over your lashes with a second coat. Try to leave it at that--do a third coat at the most. The more you layer on the mascara, the more likely it is the mascara will dry on your lashes and cause the new coat to clump. [12] X Research source Mix mascaras to combine their specialties. For example, you could use lengthening mascara for one layer, then add a layer of thickening mascara on top. Try this at home before you wear it out, as some mascaras might not blend well and cause clump."

      "content": "Don't neglect the lashes on the inner and outer part of your eyelid. A lot of times, people apply mascara only to the very center of their eyelid, which can actually make your eyes look narrower. [13] X Research source Make sure you apply to the inner, middle, and outer lashes. If you are having trouble reaching your inner lashes with your brush, you can very carefully bend the brush to a 45 degree angle (don't worry, you can bend it back). This will make it easy to brush those inner lashes without getting mascara all over your face. You can also apply the mascara to the back side of the lashes for an easier application."

Instead, apply your mascara at the roots of the lashes and lift up and away as you get closer to the tips. If you apply too much, simply brush or pull it off of the tips with your fingers."
