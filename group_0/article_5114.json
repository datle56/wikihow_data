You may need more than one tie, depending on how long your train is. When using multiple ties, use different color ribbons to color code which ties go together. This will make the job much easier and will also make the ties easier to see under all the layers of tulle and skirting. If you are afraid that the different colors could show through your fabric, just number the ends so that they correspond with the tie you will attach in the next step. [4] X Research source"

It is created by simply attaching the mid point of your train to a button on the upper part of the back of the skirt of your dress, all on the outside of the dress. This can be done with one point of connection, especially on dresses that are light and do not have a long train, or through multiple points, for a heavier fabric or longer train. This is the best bustle if your train has a lot of details or embroidery, because it will all still be visible once bustled. This is also known as an American bustle.
