      "content": "Aromantic refers to a lack of romantic attraction for others. Aromanticism exists on a spectrum—some aromantic (or “aro”) individuals might experience romantic attraction in specific circumstances, while other people never experience romantic attraction at all. There’s no right or wrong way to be aro, and every identity on the aromantic spectrum is valid! [2] X Research source Aromanticism is considered a romantic orientation (as opposed to a sexual orientation) since it relates to a person’s romantic attraction. Demiromantic is a pretty common aromantic identity—it refers to an individual who only experiences romantic attraction after an emotional bond has formed.

The LGBTQ+ is a diverse and welcoming place for people who are judged and even persecuted for who they are, who they love, and how they love. Although aro individuals may not experience the same struggles and challenges as other members of the LGBTQ+ family, they very much belong in the community. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Aromanticism is a romantic orientation, while asexuality is a sexual orientation. Asexuality refers to a lack of sexual attraction for others. Like aromanticism, asexuality exists on a spectrum—some asexual (“ace”) people might never experience sexual attraction, while others might feel sexual attraction in specific circumstances. [5] X Research source Asexuality is considered a sexual orientation since relates to sexual attraction (or a lack thereof). The asexual flag is made up of horizontal black, gray, white, and purple stripes. The colors symbolize asexuality, gray-sexuality and demisexuality, sexuality (as a whole), and community, respectively. [6] X Research source Demisexual individuals only experience sexual attraction when an emotional bond is previously established, while gray-ace individuals identify somewhere between asexual and allosexual (experiencing sexual attraction).

      "content": "You can be aromantic and asexual. Aromanticism and asexuality are completely separate identities that relate to different types of attraction. [8] X Research source It’s completely valid to identify with both labels (and some people definitely do)—after all, there isn’t a right or wrong way to be ace or aro! [9] X Research source There isn’t an official aromantic and asexual flag currently. [10] X Research source Some people choose to represent their AroAce identity with an orange-, gold-, white-, blue-, and black-striped flag, while other people prefer designs that are a hybrid of the original aro and ace pride flags.
