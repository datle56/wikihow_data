      "content": "Understand women . While it can be quite tough to understand women (even for women themselves), gaining an understanding of women and how they think is vital to approaching them in any way. Everyone's heard the stories of trying - and failing - to impress a stranger that you want to get to know, and effectively ruin your chances. If you want to be able to effectively cold approach a girl and have the approach go smoothly, it's crucial to understand her beforehand. While there's no way of generalizing women and how they think, there are a few things you can recall to improve your chance of the cold approach going well. [1] X Research source Many women prefer long-term relationships over hookups, and can tell which one a guy wants. Chances are, if you approach a girl solely to have sex with her, she'll know what you're up to. Arrogance and playing yourself up to be \"manlier\" than you really are will backfire, as many women are interested in people who care about the feelings of others. She'll also discover it eventually if you were faking masculinity. Women are often emotion-based, so it's important to be sensitive and put yourself in her shoes. If you say something rude, she won't appreciate it. While many women want to find a partner, they often prefer friendships first. It's best to approach a girl with the intent of making a friend, not getting a date."

      "content": "Tune up your social skills. While it's important to have some social skills before approaching anyone, women in particular have some finer social nuances than others may pick up on. There are exceptions, of course, but many women prefer to be treated respectfully and as though they're being approached for more than just how they look. While it takes a lot more than just knowing how to have a good conversation to tune up your social skills, here are a few things to keep in mind when approaching girls for a conversation. [2] X Research source Avoid calling women terms like \"b*tches\", \"sl*ts\", \"wh*res\", or any other terms considered derogatory towards women. Avoid swearing, as well. This will turn many girls away from you. Don't comment on her body. Unless you're out at a club, you're not going to get a girl to want to go anywhere with you if the first thing you comment on is her breasts or butt - or any other part of her, for that matter, as you may creep her out. Try to avoid commenting on her body, especially with your opening lines. There's a fine line between flirting and sexual harassment. However, nobody likes to be sexually harassed. A woman who looks uncomfortable towards your sexual advances or asks you to stop does not want you to keep making those comments, and you may be sexually harassing her. Show respect , above all. Treating anyone - male or female - like they're lesser than you will not only make you seem callous and dismissive, but it will also drive most people away from you (girls included) when they see how you treat others."

Confidence is not only attractive, but also gives you courage to approach and carry out a conversation with a girl you just met. Thinking negatively and bashing yourself for mistakes you've made in previous cold approaches doesn't help; just use those experiences to prepare yourself for now . Show that you're sure of what you're doing, and that you don't doubt yourself. Many people love others who are confident.

A big part of confidence is living the way you want to, despite whether or not it's the way others want you to live. If you stop focusing so much on what other people think of you (including the girls you're approaching!), it'll make you much happier and more confident. [4] X Research source Be aware that some people may have very valid concerns, so at least take the time to listen to them and consider them. In particular, if female friends or family members are giving you warnings, take note and heed them. Girls often know what other girls like and don't like."

If you're nervous about cold approaching a girl, you may ruminate about \"what-ifs\", such as \"What if I catch her at a bad moment?\" or \"What if she's rude and calls me a name?\". Remember, though: you can't read her mind. You don't know how she might react when you approach her, so you have to be willing to take risks. Being afraid to approach girls just because of the \"what-ifs\" may prevent you from approaching girls and seeing if any of those \"what-ifs\" are actually true!"

      "content": "Be comfortable in your own skin. Yes, you have negative traits - but so does everybody else, and it doesn't do you any good to pick yourself apart or mull over your flaws. So what if you have a stutter, your clothes don't match the trends of what most girls seem to like, or you don't have a fantastic job that makes it possible for you to go out to fancy five-star restaurants with others? A girl who's worth befriending or dating will accept you for who you are. Even if you can't necessarily know what kind of person she is when you cold approach her, know that if she's the right person for you, she'll accept you despite your flaws. This doesn't necessarily mean that you shouldn't work on things that are in your control. Your grooming habits, for example, are within your control, and are important to control; a girl won't be very inclined to talk to you if you haven't showered or worn deodorant in three days and your shirt is covered in old pizza grease stains."

While not everyone will reject you, and rejection doesn't define your worth, it's very possible that at some point, a girl will reject you. When this happens, take it in stride. Apologize if she seems offended or creeped out, and take some time away to let the awkwardness cease. Rejection happens; what's important is how you handle it, and that you don't let it discourage you from ever asking a girl out again. [5] X Research source There are many reasons a girl may reject you. She may not be comfortable with talking to someone she doesn't know, she might already have plans, she may already have a partner, she may not be attracted to you, she may be worried you're only interested in her for her body, and many more reasons. Just as you wouldn't want to date every single girl you'd come across, she doesn't want to date every single person she comes across, either. You do not have the right to force anyone to do anything they do not want to do. Regardless of what the girl doesn't want to do, if she says no, she means no . You do not want to be \"one of those people\" who takes the phrase \"bad with rejection\" to serious extremes. Respect a \"no\", apologize , and drop the subject."

Plenty of women go to gyms for their workouts. Concerts. This is a great place to meet girls with common interests, if you really like the band or artist. Meetup groups. You can find plenty of local meetup groups online. These groups organize social events on a regular basis, and you can find something that you're interested in.

Don't make excuses. Delaying it will only make it worse, and there is a good possibility that you may end up getting mad at yourself, and most likely giving up. Getting mad at yourself is just more negativity on top of negativity, so it's important that you reduce lag-time between approaches. Just go! [8] X Research source Of course, if there's a genuine reason for you not to approach her (for example, she's clearly focused on something else, or she's working a job), listen to your gut instinct. Most people don't like being broken out of their focus, and you don't want to distract her from her work. Keep the distance in mind. Make sure that you are respecting her space and not getting too close. If you would not be able to touch her by reaching your arm straight out, that is a good distance to start.

When coming up with a conversation starter, try to come up with something that will hook you both into the conversation and keep it going. A great conversation-starter can be key to making a new friend, or getting a girlfriend. [10] X Research source You can always go with a question that anyone would ask, such as, \"Hi, do you know if there's a coffee shop around here?\", but the downside to this is that you may not have much to talk about with that kind of opening. Common ground is a good starting point. For example, if you're at a concert, a quiet moment would be a good time to ask, \"How'd you discover this band?\" Avoid starting off a conversation by commenting on her appearance - whether it's about certain parts of her, or just telling her that she looks pretty. This can cause awkwardness and make the whole thing fall flat. However, if she's wearing something that's a reference to something you know about, you can say something about that, such as, \"Nice shirt! You watch that TV show, too?\". Steer clear of questions that can be answered with a \"yes\" or \"no\" response, since it's hard to continue a conversation with most of those. Try not change the subject randomly. Instead, come up with some follow-up questions that are related to what she's talking about. [11] X Expert Source Candice Mostisser Dating Coach Expert Interview. 24 January 2020."

[12] X Research source Try to do the following to show the girl you're interested: Maintain eye contact. [13] X Expert Source Eddy Baller Dating Coach Expert Interview. 7 February 2020.

If you zone out, you only prove to her that you don't think whatever she's talking about is something you're going to listen to.

Her body language is a prime indicator of interest, but that's not all you can use to judge how interested she is. Things like openness about herself, whether she focuses all her attention on the conversation, and how much she's talking can be indicators of how interested she is. A conversation isn't a solo act - she has to be contributing, too! Open body language, a genuine smile, laughter, and carrying on the conversation without having to be prompted are signs that she's fairly comfortable. [17] X Research source If she's smiling uncomfortably, not making eye contact, facing her body away from you, or giving monotone one-word answers, she's most likely not interested.

Getting her to talk about herself is key to finding out more about her - and thus, finding new avenues of conversation. Learn about her interests. Asking her what she likes to do for fun is a good start. If you saw her doing something that could be seen as a hobby (e.g. you met her at the gym, or saw her painting something), it's also great to ask her if she likes to perform that activity (e.g. \"Do you like painting?\" or \"Do you come to the gym often?\"). She may ask you about yourself. Be prepared for this; have an interesting anecdote about yourself. Don't lie; she'll find out eventually, and no good relationship is built on a lie. Obviously, use common sense; avoid using profanity before she does. And never make sexual comments about her or other girls!"

Noncommittal answers or not making concrete plans to meet you, as well as constantly sidestepping making plans (e.g. she always has \"something to do\" on every suggested date and time) is a sign that she's not interested in seeing you again, and that you shouldn't press the matter any further."

This is very important, as the more you delay contacting her, the more likely she's going to forget who you are and lessen your chances of seeing her again.
