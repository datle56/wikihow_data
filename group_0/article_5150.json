      "title": "Talk to your instructor in person.",
      "content": "Talk to your instructor in person. Instead of dashing off a quick email, take the time to talk to your teacher face-to-face. This will demonstrate that your request is sincere and necessary. If you're in college or graduate school, drop by your professor’s office hours. If you're in high school or middle school, ask to speak to your teacher after class or set up a time to meet with them. If you're making up an excuse, your professor might be able to see right through your lie. It might better to skip the face-to-face meeting and email them instead. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Explain the situation.",
      "content": "Explain the situation. When you talk to your teacher, your reasons for needing an extension should be as specific as possible. Vague explanations sound fake; detailed reasons have more legitimacy. For example: If you are struggling with depression and/or anxiety, don’t just say “I am overwhelmed.” Instead, explain how your mental health is affecting your ability to complete the assignment. “I’ve been struggling with depression all since midterms. I’ve learned that when I feel depressed, I have a very hard time focusing on my assignments. It has been very difficult for me to sit down a complete the paper.” If you took on too many responsibilities this semester, don’t just say “I have so much on my plate.” Instead, explain how these additional responsibilities are preventing you from finishing the assignment on time. “Due to my financial situation, I had to start working this semester. My work schedule and class schedule are very demanding. I am struggling to manage both.” \"My parents are both working overtime right now. I have been watching my little siblings for them. I am having a hard time balancing school and my responsibilities at home\" \"I am training for a big competition. My practices are going way longer than expected and by the time I get home I am too exhausted to do my work.\" [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Ask for an extension.",
      "content": "Ask for an extension. Once you’ve explained your situation to the teacher, request a brief extension for the assignment. Requesting too long of an extension may indicate that you’ve neglected the assignment all semester. “May I have the weekend to complete the assignment?” “Can I have three days to finish my paper?” [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Accept the instructor's response.",
      "content": "Accept the instructor's response. Ideally, your teacher will grant you the extension without a penalty. But remember, your teacher has the right to say “no” to your request or penalize the late assignment. If they say “yes,” thank them profusely and work hard to meet your new deadline. If they say “no,” thank them for their time and start working on the assignment as soon as you can. If your teacher says “yes” but attaches a grade penalty, accept the grade penalty, thank them for the extension, and work diligently to meet your new deadline. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Blame technology.",
      "content": "Blame technology. While technical difficulties are frustrating, experiencing problems with computers, USB drives, and printers can provide very valid reasons for extensions. Explain the situation to your teacher (real or fake) and hope that he or she grants you an extension. If you have to print out your paper, experiencing “printer problems” may grant you a few extra hours to work on the assignment. If you typically store all of your work on a USB Drive, tell your teacher the thumb drive was stolen or misplaced. They may give you a few days to search for the missing drive. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Cite a lack of sources.",
      "content": "Cite a lack of sources. Often times, high school teachers and college professors require students to analyze a variety of primary and secondary sources in their research papers and projects. If you attend a small school, you may have to request the books, articles, and documents you need from other institutions. In an attempt to get an extension, you can explain to your instructor that these sources did not arrive or arrived very late. Asking for a few additional days to wait for and/or analyze the material is a very reasonable request."

      "content": "Explain that you have “too much on your plate.” Students are very busy. In addition to taking several classes, you may also have a job, play on a sports team, and/or be studying for standardized tests, like the ACT, SAT, or GRE. If you explain your situation thoroughly, your professor may accept this excuse and grant you an extension. “I am taking the MCAT next month and have been studying for the test non-stop. As a result, the assignment for your class fell off my radar. May I have a few days to complete it?” I am taking the SAT on Saturday and I really need to study for my Latin subject test. Can I have a few more days on my project?\" “I have three papers due at the same time. I am struggling to devote attention to each assignment. May I please have an extension so I can produce a paper I am proud of?” [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Create a new word document. Instead of asking for a hard copy, your professor may require you to submit the assignment online, allowing you to create your own “technical difficulty.” Instead of sending a functioning word document, you can send your professor a corrupted file. To start this process, open a new word document. Professors and teachers are aware of this common trick. If you get caught, you may get a zero on the assignment and/or sent to the school's administrators. Before you consider this method, explore all of your other options and check your school's policies on the matter."
