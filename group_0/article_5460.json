      "title": "Divide your weight in pounds by 14.",
      "content": "Divide your weight in pounds by 14. One stone is equal to 14 pounds. So dividing pounds by 14 will give you your weight in stones. [3] X Research source For example, 165 14 = 11.79 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {165}{14}}=11.79} . So, 165 pounds is about 12 stone. Specifically, it is 11 stone, 11 pounds, since 165 divided by 14 is 11, with a remainder of 11."

      "title": "Convert stones to pounds.",
      "content": "Convert stones to pounds. To do this, you need to do the opposite of what you would do to convert pounds to stones. That means you need to multiply the number of stones by 14. If the weight is given in the number of stones and pounds, multiply the number of stones by 14, and add the pounds to the product. Otherwise, just multiply the whole number or decimal by 14. [4] X Research source For example, to convert 10 stone, 8 pounds, you would calculate: 10 × 14 + 8 {\\displaystyle 10\\times 14+8} = 140 + 8 {\\displaystyle =140+8} = 148 {\\displaystyle =148} So, 10 stone, 8 pounds is equal to 148 pounds."

So multiplying the number of kilograms by .15747 will give you your weight in stones. [5] X Research source For example, 70 × .15747 = 11.0229 {\\displaystyle 70\\times .15747=11.0229} . So, 70 kilograms is about 11 stone."
