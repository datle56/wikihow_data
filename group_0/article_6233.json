      "content": "Set a Pokémon under Level 50 but with a high speed as the first Pokémon. The Pokémon will need to have a speed higher than 80 in order to ensure that you are able to go first. This will give you the opportunity to inflict status ailments and damage before it escapes. It will also need to be Level 50 or under so that your Repels work when hunting for Mesprit. Make sure the Pokémon knows a move that causes Sleep, Freeze, or Paralyze. This will help speed up the catching process. Ideally you'll want a Pokémon that also knows a Bug, Ghost, or Dark attack, as these will be the most effective against Mesprit. False Swipe is also an good move for lowering its health safely, but can take a lot longer. Use a Pokémon that knows the move Mean Look to prevent the Mesprit from escaping."

Dusk balls have the highest catch rate, but only work at night or in caves.. Stock up on these; you may need 40 or more if you're unlucky. You'll also need a lot of repels to ensure that you only encounter Mesprit"

Professor Rowan will inform you that Mesprit is now roaming throughout Sinnoh, and that you can track it on the map. Roaming Pokémon like Mesprit will change locations every time you move between locations. This can make tracking them down difficult, but there's a trick you can use to speed it up."
