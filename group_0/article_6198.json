Each time you run into the bird, it will flee to a different section of the map, at which point you can track the bird and then bike (but not fly) to that section and repeat the process. You'll need to do this at least 10 times after your initial encounter in the Kalos region, though this number may vary by an encounter or two. There's no discernible pattern for the legendary bird's travel routes. If you pass through too many areas in succession, the bird will move again. This makes it impossible to catch up with the bird if it moves to a cross-map area, so you'll need to fly to a different city and wait for the bird to move again."

You'll predominately want to use Dusk Balls to catch your bird, but there are a few other options you might want to try as well: [2] X Research source Quick Ball - Use one of these at the beginning of the fight. Quick Balls have a 5x chance of catching a Pokémon when used as the first move in a fight, after which point they drop to a 1x chance. Dusk Ball - Best used for most of the catch phase. Dusk Balls have a 3.5x chance of catching a Pokémon that's in a cave, which applies to Sea Spirit's Den. Timer Ball - Best used after your 31st turn, as the Timer Ball has a 4x chance of catching Pokémon after this point. Master Ball - While the Master Ball should be used for Mewtwo, you can use the Master Ball on Articuno/Zapdos/Moltres to guarantee a capture."

The way in which you do this will depend on the type of Pokémon that you use and the types of attacks that your legendary bird uses, but you'll generally want to err on the side of lower-damage attacks once the bird is under 50 percent health. Once you've knocked the bird's health down into a small sliver of red, you can proceed. [3] X Research source Your chances of catching the bird increase as the bird's health decreases.
