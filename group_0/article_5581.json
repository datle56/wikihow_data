      "content": "If you are calling Scotland from any country other than Scotland, then you will need to enter a nation-specific \"exit code\" before you dial the Scottish number. The two most common exit codes are 00 and 011. Run a web search for \"[your country] exit code\" to find the proper digits. [1] X Research source The exit code is also known as the international access code or IDD (International Direct Dialing) code. You will need it to dial out of your country, regardless of which other country you are calling. 011 is the exit code for the United States, Canada, and some Caribbean island countries: e.g. the Bahamas, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. 00 is the exit code for most nations in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America. 0011 is the exit code for Australia. Some countries have unique exit codes. The Russian Federation, for instance, is 8 (pause) 10. The exit code for calling from Brazil depends upon which telecom company you are using."

      "content": "Account for time difference. Scotland observes GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) between the last weekend in October and the last weekend in March, and changes to British Summer Time (one hour ahead of GMT) from March to October. Look up the current time in GMT or BST. [3] X Research source Then, compare this time to the time in your location to figure out the time difference. Do not call someone in Scotland in the middle of the night unless they have explicitly asked you to do so. Shops in Scotland are usually open from 9am-5pm Monday through Saturday. Businesses in villages and rural areas usually keep more limited, traditional hours than businesses in major towns and cities. If the time is 8pm in Los Angeles, 11pm in New York, 5am in Paris, and noon in Shanghai: it is 4am in Scotland. Check the time difference before you call!"
