Focus on exercises that will improve cardiovascular and strength. Practise walking up flights of stairs with weights. Try climbing other mountains first. As you improve your fitness, increase your workout length and intensity. Six months prior: Begin to get into a workout routine four times a week. Your workouts should be enjoyable such as jogging or cycling . Introduce yourself to medium intensity muscular exercises such as push-ups , chin-ups and sit-ups . Five months prior: Increase your workout length and intensity. You may want to increase your workouts to 6 days a week. Increase reps of muscular exercises. Introduce the climbing element to your workouts such as walking up steep hills while carrying a heavy backpack. Four months prior: Build up your aerobic endurance. You should now practise high intensity 45 minute aerobic workouts six days a week. Continue climbing exercises and only increase your backpack weight, if you are sure you are ready, otherwise you can damage your knees. Three months prior: At this point, you must be physically and mentally conditioned . Regularly take multivitamin tablets and small amounts of iron supplements . Iron helps your blood cells carry oxygen, [2] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source but too much is unhealthy. Maintain a healthy diet and increase your aerobic workouts to an hour. Continuing practising climbing, but make it harder such as sprinting up steep hills. Try to get an opportunity to go camping so you can improve your skills. Two months prior: Maintain your routines. Increase the length of aerobic workouts. Improve your endurance. Rather than focusing on how heavy you can lift, tone down the weight and see how many reps you can do in a minute. Get out in the wilderness and test out your gear. Remember to maintain a healthy diet and drink lots of water."

      "content": "Learn technical climbing skills. To climb Mount Everest you will need to understand mountaineering, climbing and navigational skills. Taking outdoor and navigational classes will help you. Your Everest expedition guide will also help you prepare for the mountain. Have a good understanding of bushwhacking, rope handling, river crossings, belaying and tying knots, rappelling, navigation, crevasse, and rock rescue skills. Merely taking care of urinating and bowel movements requires special techniques and extreme care in the low temperatures."

      "content": "Prepare for the risks and dangers of climbing Everest. The most common ways of dying on the mountain are fatigue, ice falls, lack of oxygen, high altitudes, harsh weather conditions, and frostbite. Learn from the mistakes made by other climbers and understand the symptoms of altitude sickness, and its prevention techniques and emergency treatments. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Understand the death zone.",
      "content": "Understand the death zone. Above 8,000 metres (26,000 ft) you will face significant challenges to survival. Any body part exposed will suffer frostbite. The temperature is so low that the ice is an extreme slipping hazard. The oxygen level is only 337 mbar, a third of the requirement normally needed to breathe. [4] X Research source The conditions are so harsh it takes most climbers up to 12 hours to walk the distance of 1.72 kilometres (1 mile) from South Col to the summit. To live in the death zone you will need about 50 days of altitude acclimatization for a typical expedition, otherwise you will lose consciousness in minutes. Since helicopters can't easily reach the summit, if you become unable to walk you will be left to die. It is not uncommon to come across dead bodies in the mountain."

      "content": "Book an expedition company. Most expedition companies take groups of around 10 people with numerous Sherpas and several travel guides. The tour company will take care of your climbing permits and oxygen supplies. Sherpas are native to the Himalayan mountains of Nepal who will carry your food, load and equipment. They can also offer you support and help climbing the mountain. Expect to pay at least $60,000 for the expedition. Paying for a budget tour or not using a company at all puts your life more at risk. Generally the more you pay, the safer your climb will be. Hundreds of climbers who paid minimal prices have died."

The time consuming walk is beneficial as it will help you get used to the high altitudes. This camp is 5,380 m (17,700 ft). It is typical to spend a few days at the base camp to get used to the low oxygen levels so you will avoid altitude sickness . During your stay Sherpas will prepare ropes and ladders for the next part of your journey."

They interlink so that you are constantly connected to a rope. The steep slopes of up to 50 degrees and hard ice make it easy for your crampons to slip. Camp III is at an altitude of 7,470 m (24,500 ft)."

Most climbers will need to sleep with supplemental oxygen. The route to the camp is extremely windy which means it can take you up to 6 hours to complete, however once you reach the camp you are protected by the North Face of the mountain. The camp is built on small rock ledges since there is not many open spaces on this part of the mountain."

The first step requires hard pulling on fixed ropes to get over the Mushroom shaped rock. It is full of loose rock which is hard to walk over. The second step, the Chinese ladder is most intense. You will need to climb over a thick ice slab to climb on a vertical ladder with a 3,000 m (10,000 ft) drop.
