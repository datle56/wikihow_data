      "title": "Look approachable",
      "content": "Look approachable . If people are avoiding you or not coming up to talk to you, assess your body language. Notice if you’re crossing your body and try to uncross your arms and legs. If you’re looking down (or on your phone), look up and try to make eye contact with other people. Smile and look friendly. If you appear open and friendly, people are more likely to approach you. Stand near the action of the room. If you're standing far from the crowd, it may be harder for people to approach you."

      "title": "Introduce yourself to people you don’t know.",
      "content": "Introduce yourself to people you don’t know. Find someone you don’t know and introduce yourself. Keep it simple and don’t overthink it. Once you know each other’s names, you can start a conversation or find things you have in common. For example, go up to someone and say, “Hi, I’m Liv. What’s your name?”"

    {
      "title": "Ask questions to get to know people better.",
      "content": "Ask questions to get to know people better. Asking questions shows that you’re interested and engaged in conversation.

Ask questions such as, “How did you end up in Los Angeles?” and, “What kinds of things do you do for fun?”"

      "content": "Talk to new people as they arrive. Meeting new people is easy if you’re the first person they interact with once they get to the party. If you notice somebody new show up, go up to them and introduce yourself. If there’s food at the party, offer to get them a drink or show them the food table. [1] X Research source If you and the person are of age to drink alcohol, offer them a drink."

      "title": "Find ways to connect with people.",
      "content": "Find ways to connect with people. Search for things about someone else you can connect with. You might find someone who attends the same school or university as you, is from your hometown, or is wearing a similar shirt. You have more things in common with most people than you might think. Comment on what you have in common. For example, say, “I like your shirt! I have the same one.”"

    {
      "title": "Move around the room.",
      "content": "Move around the room. Avoid staying in the same place all night. Get in the habit of moving around and seeing the room from different vantage points. This will help you observe what other people are doing and if you want to meet other interesting people present at the party.

      "title": "Join groups slowly.",
      "content": "Join groups slowly. If a bunch of people are together talking and you want to join the group, hang back for a moment and listen in to the conversation. You don’t need to walk up and contribute right away. Wait until you’re caught up on what’s being discussed, then chime in with a question or a statement. [3] X Research source For example, if people are talking about sports, say, “I couldn’t believe the game last night!” If people are talking about school, say, “Who else has an exam tomorrow?”"

      "content": "Start an activity to get people engaged. Especially if it’s a big party, it’s likely that people will break off into smaller groups. Suggest a card game or board game and invite people to play with you. It may be easy to talk to people while you play the game and being in a smaller circle can make you feel more comfortable. [4] X Research source Put on some music and get people to dance. Ask people you don’t know, “Do you want to play cards? We’re getting some teams together.”"

Even if you feel uncomfortable, this doesn’t mean you will feel this way the rest of the night. Work through your discomfort. [7] X Research source For example, set a challenge for yourself. Go talk to someone you haven’t met, even if it’s a brief conversation. Having a challenge can help you be motivated and push you slightly outside of your comfort zone. If you couldn't break the ice with the first person you met, remember that you might do better with the next person. The more people you meet, the easier it might become.
