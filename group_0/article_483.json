      "content": "Run your fingers over your lips to instantly feel calmer. Your lips are connected to parasympathetic fibers, which are stimulated when you touch your lips. Gently slide 1 or 2 fingers over your lips to activate these nerve fibers. You should instantly feel more calm. [2] X Research source Make sure your hands are clean so you don’t get germs in your mouth. Apply lip balm first to help your fingers slide over your lips more easily, if you prefer.
