      "title": "What do “karats” mean with gold jewelry?",
      "content": "What do “karats” mean with gold jewelry? Gold is a pretty soft and malleable metal, so it’s not very durable on its own. As a result, gold jewelry is often made of a mixture of gold and other stronger metals (called alloys). The purity of a piece of gold jewelry is then measured in karats. For example, if your gold jewelry is made out of 18 parts pure gold and 6 parts other metal alloys, it’s 18-karat gold. If your jewelry is made out of 100% pure gold and no metal alloys, it is 24-karat gold. [22] X Research source Although they sound similar, a “karat” is not the same thing as a “carat.” A carat (spelled with a “C”) is a unit of weight used to measure gemstones like diamonds.

So that’s actually what’s tarnishing the gold. If for some reason your [pure] gold piece does tarnish, you’d have to take it to a real professional jewelry store and have it cleaned and polished.” [24] X Expert Source Edward Lewand Graduate Gemologist & Accredited Appraiser Expert Interview. 6 August 2019."
