      "content": "Practice reading things out loud for 30 minutes a day. Reading aloud effectively is essential for voice acting, especially if you’re reading cold from a teleprompter or script. Read books, magazines, or news articles out loud on a regular basis to get more comfortable with it. [1] X Research source Practice enunciating words clearly and work on your intonation. Try changing the sound of your voice as you read for an added challenge. Read a variety of material to improve your voice; try anything from Dr. Seuss to The Hobbit . Make it sound like a performance—it’s your job to bring these words to life! [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Record your voice to learn your tendencies and evaluate yourself. Try reciting monologues or reading from a script and recording it. Play it back to hear what you sound like and make personal notes for improvement. You might be surprised—the way you sound in a recording isn’t always how you sound to yourself each day. Take note of these changes and get used to your recorded voice so that you can effectively express yourself over a microphone. For example, you may realize you speak more quickly than you thought you did, or that you tend to inflect the ends of sentences a certain way."

      "content": "Practice speaking from your diaphragm for a rich sounding voice. To develop the diaphragm voice, practice breathing deeply and watching your stomach rise and fall. Make sounds that come from the diaphragm, such as laughing or yawning. A voice teacher can help you project from the diaphragm when you speak or sing. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Imitate the voices of famous actors or fictional characters.",
      "content": "Imitate the voices of famous actors or fictional characters. Imitation helps you build flexibility, recognize pitch and tone, and gives you good material to include on your demo reel. You don’t have to be an impressionist to be a voice artist, but it’s helpful to be able to change the sound of your voice. This makes you more versatile and helps with your acting. [4] X Research source Try to match not only the person’s voice, but also their personality so that you bring them to life rather than just imitating their sound. Start with characters or actors you know well, then explore voices you’re less familiar with for a challenge. Listen closely to learn what makes each person sound unique."

      "title": "Improvise in character.",
      "content": "Improvise in character. Doing improv is an important skill in voice acting because directors will expect this of you in professional sessions. This skill allows you to truly embody a character and think like they do. After you’ve gotten into character, try coming up with a funny story on the spot or answering questions from a friend as that character. [5] X Research source For example, if you are doing an impression of Kermit the Frog, you could make up a story about asking Miss Piggy out on a date."

Though voice actors never appear on screen, their acting talent helps them effectively deliver their lines. You only have your voice—you don't have other actors to work off of. The audience can’t see your facial expressions, hand gestures, or movements and you don’t have props or other tools to aid in your delivery. [7] X Research source Remember, voice actors are actors first. Your full emotional depth and personality must be expressed solely through your voice. If you’re still in school, take classes through the theater program and audition for plays or one-acts. Or, find community theater productions to participate in. Depending on your area or school, you may be able to specifically find a voice acting coach to focus on your voice work. If there are none in your area, many coaches offer online sessions."

[8] X Expert Source Keri Safran Performer & Accent Coach Expert Interview. 26 February 2025. Many voice teachers can help you develop both your speaking and singing voices (you never know when you may want a voice acting role that has some singing parts!). A voice teacher will help you create a vocal warmup routine to protect your voice. These warmups might include: [9] X Research source Flapping your lips while blowing air and making a “brrr” sound. Yawning widely and sighing while smiling to stretch your jaw. Stretching your neck and massaging your jaw to relieve tension. Holding out sighing sounds as long as you can to practice breath control."

Hang blankets on the walls and place a rug on the floor to dampen noise and help soundproof your “booth.” [10] X Research source It’s not glamorous, but many voice actors that record from home work from their closet as well!"

      "content": "Invest in a high-quality mic, headphones, and recording equipment. You don’t need a lot of equipment for voice work, but a few items are crucial for producing clear, professional-sounding recordings. To get started, make sure you have: [11] X Research source A somewhat new, functioning laptop. Old computers can overheat and create fan noise, which can ruin a good take. A high-quality microphone. Choose a simple USB mic if you’re just getting started and don’t have much money to invest. Or, try an analog mic for improved sound quality. These tend to be more expensive and require an audio interface that can connect to the mic’s XLR cable. Quality closed-back, over-the-ear headphones that are not noise-canceling. Reputable brands include Sony, AKG, or Sennheiser. A pop filter and adjustable microphone stand for your mic. XLR or USB cables as needed to connect your mic, interface (if using an analog mic), and computer."

It can include professional or original work, or imitations of characters and scripts that already exist. [13] X Research source A professionally produced reel will have smooth transitions, normalized volume, and high audio quality. [14] X Research source If you’re recording your own, use your home studio equipment. Eliminate background noises and use the highest quality equipment you have. A professional demo reel can cost hundreds of dollars and doesn’t guarantee a good demo—just a good quality recording. The content of your demo is most important."

Follow that with something you love and that highlights your talent—anything that gives the listener a real feel for what you can do. Use the rest of your time to show off your range. [15] X Research source A potential employer may only watch about 30 seconds of your reel, which is why your strongest material must go first. Try not to repeat similar material. If your first segment features a product description, your next segment shouldn’t also feature a description. Make the content of your demo reel relevant to a specific job.

A polished, clean reel makes a good impression on any client or director. [16] X Research source If you’re saving your audio only, save your work as both a WAV file and as an MP3. WAV files are easier to edit later, while MP3s are best for sharing files. [17] X Research source Don’t stress too much about the tech aspect of your reel.

[18] X Research source You could even make a YouTube channel featuring your original voiceover content (like narrating an ebook) and include a link. Headshots are a nice touch, but they’re expensive and don’t help casting directors because your appearance isn’t relevant to voice acting (unlike stage or screen acting)."

[26] X Research source Have other dialogue prepared besides the script in case casting directors want to see what else you can do. Get inside the character’s head and go beyond the words on the page.

If you’re serious about voice acting, consider the following benefits of the industry: [29] X Research source Working from home (or anywhere you can use your home studio setup). Flexible hours. You can choose when to record or take auditions, and professional in-studio sessions often only last a few hours. Being your own boss. You decide which roles or jobs you take and what you want to specialize in. Competitive pay. Many voice actors make $200–300 per hour, although you may only have sporadic gigs at first amounting to $10k-20k per year.

Plus, AI voices are being used for small projects more and more frequently. [31] X Research source Expensive equipment. Investing in a high-quality home studio can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars, depending on the equipment you choose. Unpredictable vocal health. If you lose, strain, or damage your voice, you’re out of work until you’re recovered. Isolation. Voice actors spend many hours alone in a small booth or closet recording (although for in-person sessions, you’ll have a director giving you instructions)."
