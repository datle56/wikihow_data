      "content": "A short and sweet comment is sure to make the photographer smile. If you want to make a photographer feel good about their work, quickly mention what you love about it. Be honest about how the picture makes you feel so your compliment sounds really genuine. A photographer will love to hear your instant reaction to how their pic made you feel.

      "title": "A photographer will appreciate that you recognized the effort they put in.",
      "content": "A photographer will appreciate that you recognized the effort they put in. A picture may look effortless, but the person behind the camera has spent a lot of time practicing and honing their skills. Don’t let all the energy they put in go unnoticed. Rather than complimenting the photo directly, mention how much they’ve grown as a photographer and compliment the work it took to get there. [2] X Research source “It really shows how long you planned to get the perfect shot.” “You’ve only gotten better with each new pic. Great work!” “This is why you’re a professional, wow!” “This shot really shows off all your skills! Love it!”"

      "title": "Show appreciation for the unique view they captured in the shot.",
      "content": "Show appreciation for the unique view they captured in the shot. Does the picture make you think a little differently about the subject? Maybe it’s a closeup pic of something small, or a bird’s-eye view of a larger scene. Either way, take a moment to really appreciate the unique perspective the picture gives you and mention it in their comments. “I never would have thought to look at that in this way!” “I love the angle you got on this pic!” “It’s so inspiring seeing a different view of this subject!” “This is such an intriguing viewpoint! How did you think to capture it like this?”"

      "title": "Photographers want recognition for how well they composed a shot.",
      "content": "Photographers want recognition for how well they composed a shot. Composition is how the elements in the foreground and background interact with each other. Since photographers take a bit of time to figure out the perfect way to balance the picture, they’ll love hearing that you took the time to notice their hard work lining up the shot. “I love how you arranged this pic so your eyes are drawn to their faces.” “This really draws my focus to the flowers in the foreground! Love it!” “The background in this shot is so interesting, but it doesn’t distract from the subject!” “It really shows how much you considered how this shot was laid out.”"

      "title": "Photographers will love that you noticed the time it took to like their pic.",
      "content": "Photographers will love that you noticed the time it took to like their pic. It takes a keen eye to pick a light source for a photo, and the photographer probably experimented with a few different options before deciding. Look at how the lights and shadows balance each other out and how they affect the overall composition of the picture so you can give a more thoughtful compliment. Mention a specific detail about the lighting that you noticed to make your compliment sound more thoughtful. “The way the sunset makes those tree branches stand out is so gorgeous.” “I love the highlights on her face! It really adds to the drama.” “The deep shadows really set this pic apart from the rest.” “Amazing job lighting this! I can tell you took your time getting it just right!”"

      "title": "Photographers love to know how their pics made you feel.",
      "content": "Photographers love to know how their pics made you feel. As you’re looking at the picture the photographer posted, try to gauge how it makes you feel. Does it make you sad? Happy? Angry? Consider the emotion that the photographer was trying to capture and praise them for being able to create a moody, dramatic image. Be creative with how you describe the mood and try to compare it to other things. [3] X Research source “I love how warm and inviting you made this feel!” “You caught such an ominous look with this shot. It’s like it’s straight out of a horror movie!” “You really captured a lot of emotion with this one!” “I can’t help but smile every time I see this pic.”"

      "title": "A portrait photographer will love to hear that their subject stands out.",
      "content": "A portrait photographer will love to hear that their subject stands out. If people are the main subject of the pic, spend a little time focusing on their pose, facial expression, and mood they’re conveying so you can make your compliment specific and unique. If you can get a sense that you know the person just by looking at the post, then tell the photographer that they did a great job shooting their pics. “I can feel how happy everyone is feeling in this pic!” “You captured the intensity in their eyes. It makes them stand out!” “I love how it looks like everyone is having a great time posing for this!” “I can get a real sense of who this person is in real life just by how you shot them!”"

Compliment their picture with how much you love their work, and don’t forget to mention that you keep coming back to their page to see the new things they share. [4] X Research source “I’m so excited to see the other things you’ve shot!” “Amazing as always! I’m looking forward to seeing what you post next!” “I hope I get to see more pics from this shoot soon!” “WOW! Your pics just keep getting better!”"

      "content": "Wanting to buy their pictures shows that you value their work. If you’re so drawn to the picture that you want a copy of your own, let the photographer know! Find out if they have a shop where you can purchase prints of the pictures, and offer to buy a copy. The photographer will be so excited that you’re interested in their work and be driven to take more pics. [5] X Research source “This would look amazing on my wall.

Let the photographer know that you’re interested in doing a shoot with them and see if there’s an easy way that you can reach out. The photographer will appreciate your interest and can help you find a time when they can shoot some pics for you. “Your headshots are amazing!

      "content": "Talking about your experience helps the photographer find new clients. If the photographer posted pics from a shoot you did with them, be sure to mention how it went. You could talk about how easy the photo session went, how professional the photographer was, or how much you love the images they took.

Thanks so much for making me look so stunning!” “These turned out so incredible!! I’m definitely reaching out again the next time I need pics!” “Thank you for making me feel so comfortable in front of a camera!
