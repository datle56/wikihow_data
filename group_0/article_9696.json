Microsoft has created an easier way to convert Word to PowerPoint, but it's only available (and only for some users) in the web-based version of Word. [1] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source To open your document, log in to https://www.office.com and click the Word icon on the left. Click your Word doc in the \"Recently opened\" list, or click Upload to upload it from your computer. The \"Export to PowerPoint presentation\" feature appears to be in testing, as many users report it no longer appears in Word for the web. [2] X Research source As of December 2024, we don't see the option in our testing. Because Microsoft still recommends using this feature, we assume it will return soon. This export feature is unavailable in Safari, so if you're using a Mac, you'll need to use Chrome or Edge. You'll also need to use a document without images—you can always add pictures later. Headings in your document will be used as slide headings in the converted PowerPoint presentation."

      "content": "Separate the Word document into sections with titles. Before converting a Word document to a PowerPoint presentation, you'll need to break the document into separate sections that will become individual slides. Each section needs a title at the top, and the title should be on its own line. The title will then become the title of that section's PowerPoint slide. For example, let's say the first page of your Word document contains sales information that you'd like to appear on a PowerPoint slide called \"Sales.\" At the top of that section, you'd type \"Sales\" as the title, since you want that to be the name of your slide. Below that would be the content of the slide. Press Enter or Return after each section so there's at least one empty line between the end of a section and the title of the next slide."
