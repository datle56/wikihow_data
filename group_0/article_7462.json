      "content": "Identify your complexion undertones to find your most flattering lip color. The most important part of finding a flattering lipstick shade is determining your undertones— matching your lip color to your undertones is what will really make your face light up and stand out (more so than your skin tone or eye color). [1] X Research source There are three main categories of undertones: cool, neutral, and warm. To figure out what your complexion undertones are, consider these factors: [2] X Research source Overall skin hue: If your skin has a pink, red, or bluish hue, you likely have cool undertones. If your skin has a yellow, golden, or olive hue, you likely have warm undertones. If your skin has a mix of pink and yellow in its base, you likely have neutral undertones. Vein coloring: If the veins in your wrist look blue or purple, you likely have cool undertones. If the veins in your wrist look more green, you likely have warm undertones. If the veins in your wrist look like a mix of blue and green, you likely have neutral undertones. Jewelry: If your skin is best complemented by silver jewelry, you likely have cool undertones. If your skin is best complemented by gold jewelry, you likely have warm undertones. If your skin looks equally good in both silver and gold jewelry, you likely have neutral undertones. Sun exposure: If your skin tends to burn before tanning, you likely have cool undertones. If you tan easily, you likely have warm undertones. Celeb lookalikes: If your coloring is similar to Lili Reinhart or Rosario Dawson, you likely have cool undertones. If your coloring is similar to Beyoncé or Julianne Moore, you likely have warm undertones. If your coloring is similar to Zendaya or Selena Gomez, you likely have neutral undertones.

[4] X Research source If you want a more natural look, try a soft mauve color or a toffee shade . For a more dramatic look, opt for hot pink or bubblegum . For your perfect red shade , veer more toward deep bluish-reds (think cherry red ) versus ones that lean more orange. [5] X Research source For your perfect nude shade , you can enhance the natural flush of your lips with a rosy nude or a taupe-y beige"

Other warmer-toned lipsticks like burgundies, berries, corals, chocolate browns, and oranges will also look gorgeous on you! If you want something more subtle, try a bronzy rose or terracotta brown shade. For a more adventurous look, go bold with a vibrant coral or electric orange to really bring out the warm tones in your skin. [6] X Research source For your perfect red shade , find an orangey or coral-toned red or a fiery brick shade that brings some added warmth to your face. [7] X Research source For your perfect nude shade , go for a shimmery, golden color that’s slightly darker than your skin tone."

However, you may be unsure of where to start—in this case, you may want to work from your skin tone first. [8] X Research source Fair skin tones might favor pink shades, medium may flatter mauve hues, and deep berries might work best for dark skin. Keep experimenting with different shades to find what you like best on your lips! For your perfect red shade , you can wear both warm and cool shades, but you may look best in a “true” red shade with slightly bluer undertones. [9] X Research source For your perfect nude shade , look for a caramel color like coffee or taupe. However, your natural lip color is likely pretty-near-perfect, so a light pink lip gloss may be all you need!"

      "content": "Consider your overall skin tone when choosing your perfect lip color. While undertones may be the most important part of flattering your face with lipstick, skin tones (aka, whether your skin is fairer or darker) also play an important part. Start by identifying your skin tone , if you aren’t sure already, then determine what lip colors generally look best on that skin tone . However, make sure to also consult your undertone —two people with the same skin color can have totally different undertones, making their perfect lip shades completely distinct from one another! [10] X Research source Fair skin: Your skin may be very pale or translucent and you probably burn very easily. You may have freckles and some redness. People may describe your skin as “light,” “pale,” or “porcelain.” Olive skin: Your skin may appear subtly tan or olive with a greenish or yellow tone. You probably rarely burn in the sun and look tanned year-round. Medium skin: You probably fall right between fairer and darker skin tones. You likely tan easily and generally don’t burn or have sensitive skin. Deep skin: Your skin is dark and you never get a visible sunburn.

Eye color isn’t as important of a factor as undertone when choosing a flattering lip color, but it definitely helps! If you’re particularly looking to bring out your eyes with your lipstick shade, then consult a color wheel . Find your eye shade on the wheel, then look on the opposite side of the wheel to find the perfect color to complement it. [15] X Research source Here are some of the most common eye colors and the lipstick shades that best complement them: Blue Eyes: Coral, peach, bronze, and copper lipsticks. Green Eyes: Berry, plum, mauve, brown, and terracotta lipsticks. Brown Eyes: Deep red, burgundy, and rosy pink lipsticks. Hazel Eyes: Warm brown, neutral mauve, golden red, and copper lipsticks."

However, you still want to make sure that your lip and hair colors don’t clash in order to get a super cohesive look. Examine the tone of your hair just like you’d examine the tone of your skin—if your hair is more cool-toned (e.g., ash blonde, mushroom brown), it may look best with a cooler-toned lipstick. If your hair is more warm-toned (e.g., butter blonde, chestnut brown), it may look best with warmer shades of lipstick. Also consider the intensity of your hair color. If your hair color is super pale, an ultra-saturated lip color may look overwhelming. If your hair color is darker or more saturated, then a very pale lip may wash you out. Ultimately, however, you can wear whatever lip color you feel looks best on you!"

This step isn’t as crucial and doesn’t have as much to do with whether a lip color is particularly “flattering” on you. Ultimately, you should experiment with whatever lip and outfit combos make you feel beautiful, confident, and stylish. However, if you want some guidelines on pairing your lips to your look, here are some common tips: Give an all-black outfit a bit of color with a bold red, pink, or purple lip. Zhuzh up a minimalistic outfit with a red lip for some added drama. Match berry shades with mixed neutrals to add a touch of maturity and glamor. Choose a soft beigey-nude for a formal and romantic event like a wedding. When in doubt, go for a nude lip. It goes with just about anything!"

      "content": "Choose a lip color that fits with the rest of your makeup look. Since lipstick is just one part of a snatched makeup look, it’s nice to match your lipstick to your other products in order to create a cohesive look. Most importantly, make sure your lipstick is matched to any lip liner you choose to use. While a lip liner isn’t always required, it can make your lips look much more polished, and it is definitely helpful when applying bolder shades like red or purple. Otherwise, you can choose any lip liner that’s in the same color family but just a shade darker than your lip color. [16] X Research source When it comes to the rest of your face, choose blush and eyeshadow colors that match or balance out your lip color. How you choose to go about this is pretty much up to your preferences and what sort of makeup looks you like on your face. For instance, if you like to balance out your eye look with your lip look, you might choose a bolder eye with a subtler lip, and vice versa. You could pair a smokey eye with a pinky nude or a bold red lip with a neutral eye shimmer. [17] X Research source Or, maybe you love the no-makeup-makeup look . Use the same shade across your lips, cheeks, and lids to give your face that natural sunkissed glow. You may also love a bold look all across your face! Pair a vibrant lip with a dramatic eye look for a full-on glam that really steals the show."

      "content": "Try on different lipstick shades in a makeup store. Once you have an idea of which lipstick colors you might like, head to a cosmetics shop to try them on before buying. Start by picking out a few of your favorite lipsticks, then swatch each one onto your arm—you may be able to rule out a few shades this way before (or instead of) applying them to your lips. Then, find a lipstick tester and use a test brush or cotton swab to apply the color to your lips. [18] X Research source Examine each shade while standing in a well-lit area. If possible, make sure you have little to no other makeup on your face. Look for a shade that, worn with no other makeup, brightens your face and makes other makeup feel less necessary. If you don't want to apply the tester lipstick to your mouth, test it on the pads of your fingertips. [19] X Research source Your fingertips are closer to your lip color than your wrist or the side of your hand. Never apply the lipstick directly to your lips at the store, as it could contain many harmful bacteria. If you’re trying multiple shades in a row, completely wipe off each lipstick before trying the next. Otherwise, you will be mixing multiple colors together. Ask a sales rep for makeup remover or lotion. When in doubt, ask for help at the makeup counter. Sometimes, it's hard to objectively judge what looks best on ourselves. A professional at the makeup counter can match you with the right color."

      "content": "Once you find a color you like, make sure it comes in your preferred formula. Lipsticks come in a variety of forms and formulas outside of the traditional lipstick tube, like lip stains, lip tints, liquid lipsticks, and cream lipsticks. [20] X Research source Even if you’ve found your perfect color, look for a brand that offers it in a formulation that looks and feels good on your lips. Here’s a quick guide to each of the most popular lipstick types so you can make your best choice: Cream lipstick: Higher wax content and pigmentation with greater staying power and added moisturization for lips. However, application may be more involved than with a bullet lipstick. [21] X Research source Liquid lipstick: Easy to apply, doesn’t require frequent touch-ups, and provides a long-lasting, bold shade. Can also be repurposed as a blush, making it a super versatile product. Lip stains: Great for people who want a long-lasting, natural lip color that’s low maintenance, since lip stains can easily be swiped on and absorbed by your lips. Also gives a more natural look that subtly enhances natural lip color. Lip tints: Give off a natural and more lightweight look that’s just as long-lasting, but can easily be wiped away as needed. Lip tints are also great for dry lips since the color won’t fade or crease."

      "content": "Choose between a matte or glossy finish before purchasing. While we often focus on lip color as the most important part of choosing a lipstick, you should also consider the finish of each product before deciding it’s the perfect one for you. Matte finishes can look more mature and saturated, while shiny lipsticks have a more subtle color but reflective finish. [22] X Research source Lipstick with a matte finish can also cause lips to look thinner, while glosses and shimmery shades can make them look fuller. [23] X Research source Matte lipsticks can also be slightly drying. So, if your lips tend to be dry or chapped, then a shiny lipstick with more of a moisturizing effect may be a better choice for you. On the other hand, if your lips are oily, matte lipstick may adhere better and reduce the need for frequent touch-ups. Keep these factors in mind before settling on your perfect lipstick—make sure the shade you’ve picked out also comes in a texture and finish that feels good on your lips!"

While you can definitely stick to basics and simply swipe your lipstick on, prepping your lips and properly applying your shade can improve the look and help it last longer. For starters, prep your lips by exfoliating them with a lip scrub to remove dead skin and create a smooth base for the pigment. Then, apply a lip balm or conditioner to lock in moisture. [24] X Research source If you want to further prep the base for your lipstick, you can use your finger or a brush to apply a small amount of concealer to your lips and set the concealer with setting powder . This step is useful if you want your lipstick to have a neutral base (rather than your natural lip color) and really show off the vivid shade you’ve chosen."

Starting from the center of your lips and moving to the corners of your mouth, carefully outline your natural lip line. Then, fill in your lips with the pencil to give a fuller look and prevent the lipstick from feathering.

If you want to apply another layer, go ahead and swipe it on before blotting again. If you prefer, you can also apply your lipstick with a lip brush to give you more control over where the color goes. If you want your lipstick to have more staying power, add a layer of pressed powder between each layer and before applying the final coat of color.
