      "content": "Determine why you find the religion of Jehovah's Witnesses appealing. Do you like the high moral standards that Jehovah's Witnesses adhere to? Do you like the fact that they teach only things that are from the Bible? Do you like the Bibles message of living forever in a world free of pain, suffering and death? Would you like help to cope with your problems and find a purpose to life? Would you like to help others understand what the Bible really teaches? Are you dissatisfied with teachings of other Christian groups such as the trinity, hell fire and the immortality of the soul? Jehovah's Witnesses have answers from the Bible to such questions that many find appealing."

      "content": "Request a free home Bible study: [1] X Research source Ask for one the next time one of Jehovah's Witnesses come to your door. They believe in the command by Jesus Christ to \"make disciples\" (literally in Greek 'make learners') as found at Matthew 28:19,20. So there is a very real possibility that they will be knocking on your door someday, if they have not done so already. Call or go to the local Kingdom Hall in your area, and request one.

      "content": "Study the Bible on a regular basis, usually weekly, with the help of an appropriate study aid publication. Every one of Jehovah's Witnesses is a volunteer so there is no elite clergy class set aside for the teaching and preaching work. Ask as many honest and heartfelt questions as it takes to determine if what you are learning is true. Persist until you have found satisfying, Bible-based answers."

      "title": "Apply what you are learning.",
      "content": "Apply what you are learning. Pray to Jehovah for help and also seek the assistance of your study conductor, and wholesome Christian associates to do this. Associate with Jehovah's Witnesses at their regularly held meetings. This will encourage you and strengthen your faith. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Cope with opposition.",
      "content": "Cope with opposition. It is not unusual for non-Witness family and friends to become alarmed when they learn of your interest in becoming on of Jehovah's Witnesses. One of the things you will learn is that your study is leading you to friendship with the Creator of the universe and you should not let anyone stop you from forming the best friendship you could ever have. Consider the case of Steve and Selma highlighted in The Watchtower of February 15, 2012. When Selma tried to prove a point to Steve he became violent and hit her. Rather than feel sorry for herself Selma was encouraged to make adjustments and be more Christian towards Steve. Years later Steve himself became a Witness."

      "content": "Recognize the authority of the \"faithful and discreet slave\". At Matthew 24:45 Jesus asked: \"Who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom his master appointed over his domestics, to give them their food at the proper time?\" This \"slave\" is known as the Governing Body. To become one of Jehovah's Witnesses means accepting the authority of this \"faithful slave\", who it is believed are providing spiritual food at the proper time. For example, The Watchtower of July 15, 2013 said \"It is vital that we recognize the faithful slave. Our spiritual health and our relationship with God depend on this channel.\" (page 20). More recently, The Watchtower of February 2022 emphasized \"During the great tribulation, we may receive instructions that seem strange, impractical, or illogical. Of course, Jehovah will not speak to us personally. He will likely provide direction through his appointed representatives.\""

Speak to your Bible study conductor and the congregation elders to find out how you can qualify to preach about Jehovah along with Jehovah's Witnesses. [4] X Research source"

[5] X Research source If you qualify, then arrangements will be made for your public declaration of dedication to Jehovah through water-immersed baptism at a public meeting (usually assembles and conventions). Baptism is only the beginning. You must be determined to continue serving Jehovah forever. By doing so you will ensure for yourself a happy future."
