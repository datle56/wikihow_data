      "content": "Be ready to be surprised. [1] X Research source [v161267_b02]. 11 February 2020. Gemini is represented by twins, equal parts yin and yang. This at any time, you never know which twin you're going to get! One minute she'll be laughing and childlike, and the next minute she'll be serious and reserved. If you can handle both sides, you have a chance with this dynamic female. You never know what you're going to get with a Gemini, so if you're looking for a girl to be consistent and always caring for you, you'd be better off courting a different sign, Virgo. She can be submissive and feminine but also dominant and masculine. If she's a true Gemini, she'll have a balance ."

      "content": "Understand how creative and witty she is. Gemini women are unstoppable when it comes to their quick wit and creativity. [2] X Research source [v161267_b02]. 11 February 2020. They'll banter with you, do plays-on-words, and whip out their novel or painting that's in the works when you least expect it. She likely spends her free time doing something related to music, art, or literature. A gemini girl is the type who can \"dish it out\" and also take it. She can take a joke if you poke fun at her flirtatiously, but you better expect her to have a cutting, witty remark to make back at you!"

      "title": "Know that she can be a bit immature.",
      "content": "Know that she can be a bit immature. There is a side to Gemini that is very young, childish, flighty, and immature. There almost has to be to balance her almost overly mature, serious side. However, she can't always control when it comes out. The \"younger twin\" may come out when she's meeting your parents or in the middle of a conference – who knows! A Gemini benefits well from a person who can reign in the more radical sides of her disposition. A person who brings out their immaturity could lead to dangerous situations, while a person who brings out their darker, serious side could lead to no fun. It's best if you are well-balanced yourself."

      "title": "Expect to never know what'll happen next.",
      "content": "Expect to never know what'll happen next. If you have this girl around, one minute you could be reading poetry on the couch together and the next she's left you a note saying she's on vacation in Italy. This girl is curious and always looking for the next adventure, so when this side comes out, it's unstoppable. This unpredictability gets to certain people. It's easy to mistake it for her not being loving or caring enough, when really she does care, she just needs to do her own thing. What's more, she's seeing if you'll be around when she gets back."

[4] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 December 2021. A Gemini girl wants someone who can sweep her off her feet physically and mentally. She needs to know you can match her when it comes to anything. The last thing she wants is a partner that she feel superior over – she wants someone she can share the glory with. When you're with her, talk to her about the book you're reading. Ask her if she'd like to go to a museum. Mention an article you read the other day about a little known current event. She'll find you intriguing and wonder what it is she can learn from you. Reader Poll: We asked 698 wikiHow readers if they think Geminis are generally attracted to people who are curious, and 50% of them said yes. [Take Poll] So, don't be afraid to ask her questions about herself and her interests."

      "title": "Show her you can match her sexually.",
      "content": "Show her you can match her sexually. Gemini has two sexual sides – submissive and dominant. You'll see her be coy and subtly flirtatious, batting an eyelash here and there, and then you'll see her being dominant, asking you out and making the moves. When this happens, roll with the punches! Let her take charge when she needs to take charge and take over the reigns when she's done. She doesn't need someone who's just dominating enough or just submissive enough – she needs someone who can handle and complement whichever side she's currently showing."

    {
      "title": "Let her chat.",
      "content": "Let her chat. Geminis are notoriously very social creatures. When their childlike side comes out especially, they can be quite the chatterbox. When she's off on her tangent or telling you every little detail of the book she's reading, sit back and relax, allowing her the spotlight. Watch her go. Let her entertain you. Since Gemini needs someone who can stimulate her mind, ask her questions. Pose thoughts or theories. Talk to her about what you're thinking or wondering about. You may open her up and get onto an exciting ride!"

As you begin your relationship, she'll want to do things that aren't exactly traditional. Keep her amused. [6] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 December 2021. Ask her to go make pottery or to go to a cheese tasting. She'll be very impressed with your originality and ingenuity. Don't feel pressured to keep this up all the time. She has two sides – once you've shown her that you can handle her more difficult side (the curious, adventurous one), show her that you can relax, too, in pajamas and with a movie and take-out."

      "title": "Be ready to put in some work.",
      "content": "Be ready to put in some work. A Gemini can be emotionally unavailable and difficult to pin down one minute, and loving and nurturing the next. This sounds a little mentally unstable, but it's just the nature of this sign. However, for their partner, this can be a little unnerving. You'll have to work at the relationship, surviving the times when she's distant and being available when she's ready to return. Remember: this isn't all about you. While she is very hesitant to get into a relationship, she is by no means unfaithful or unloving. Half of why she is hard to pin down is because she wants to make sure that when she is, it's totally and completely worth it."

      "title": "Keep her guessing.",
      "content": "Keep her guessing. A Gemini girl needs to be kept on her toes. Since she's so full of surprises, she wants a partner that can be surprising, too. Tell her you're going out for dinner when really you planned a night at the planetarium. Bring home a song you wrote for her that you've been keeping from her. It's little things like that a Gemini will truly appreciate. Keep her guessing with your personality, too. If you're not outdoorsy, ask her to go on a hike. If you're not huge into music, offer to go to the opera. If she thinks she can't pin you, you'll have her pinned."

      "title": "Give her her space.",
      "content": "Give her her space. [7] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 December 2021. There's a very independent side to Gemini. She needs to be left alone at times and given space to find her own adventure. Don't be unnerved when this happens – she's not slipping away from you, she's just doing her own thing. And there's nothing wrong with that! She'll come back, raving about all her experiences that she wants to share with you. If her independent streak bothers you, open up a forum for communication about it. She'll love talking to you, knowing how you feel, and explaining how she feels. She'll likely appreciate your concern and try to please you as much as she can."

      "title": "Be able to handle jealousy.",
      "content": "Be able to handle jealousy. The thing about a Gemini is that once she's finally decided that she'll commit to you openly, she can get pretty jealous. She's spent a ton of time deciding if you're worth a serious commitment, which is a little scary for her. If she feels you slipping away, she may not be able to handle it well. Think of this as a declaration of love and not something that's aggravating. All it means is that she cares about you and wants to be sure you're hers. Do keep in mind though, that if you purposefully make her jealous, she'll be onto you and she likely won't put up with it."

    {
      "title": "Know when she needs nurturing and when she needs adventure.",
      "content": "Know when she needs nurturing and when she needs adventure. As you get to know her, you'll probably be able to tell which side of her you're dealing with. Knowing what to expect and handling her swings properly can keep the relationship flowing healthily for a very long time. She'll feel safe in your arms this way, too. Simply accepting that these two dynamics of her personality are here to stay is the biggest challenge for any partner of a Gemini. Once you reach that point, the rest of the relationship will be smooth sailing."
