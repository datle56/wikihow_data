      "content": "Choose monsters to create a pairing that makes up equal parts of the Air, Plant, Water, and Cold elements. You can either breed two two-element monsters with one another, or breed a one-element monster with a three-element monster. Examples of monster pairings that can successfully breed the Deedge are Dandidoo + Maw, Quibble + Furcorn, Pango + Oaktopus, Spunge + Mammott, Thumpies + Toe Jammer, Congle + Potbelly, and Bowgart + Tweedle. Pair the Bowgart with the Tweedle for the best chance of breeding the Deedge. This monster pairing has been shown to have a 39 percent success rate of creating the Deedge. [2] X Research source"

After the breeding period ends, the Deedge egg will automatically be placed at the Nursery and ready to hatch.
