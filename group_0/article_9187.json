      "content": "Determine which Roku model you have. There are two main types of Roku, both of which require your TV to have at least one HDMI port to use: Roku Player (1, 2, 3, 4, Ultra or Ultra LT, Express or Express+, Premiere or Premiere+, XS, SE, LT, etc.) — Resembles a streaming box. It comes with several cables like an HDMI cable and an AC power cord. Roku Stick — Resembles a flash drive (memory stick). It comes with a USB power cable, remote control and two AA alkaline batteries. If your Roku player belonged to another person (or if you're trying to set up your old Roku for a new TV), you can factory reset it by attaching it to a power source and using a paperclip to press the recessed \"Reset\" button."

      "content": "Plug the Roku player into your TV's HDMI port. All HDTVs have at least one HDMI port; the HDMI port resembles a trapezoid shape and can often be found on the TV's back or side. [1] X Research source Depending on your Roku type, this process will vary slightly: [2] X Research source Roku Player — Plug one end of the HDMI cable into the back of the Roku Player's box, then plug the other end into the HDMI port on the back or side of your TV. Roku Stick — Plug the HDMI connector on the end of your Roku Stick into the HDMI port on the back or side of your TV. If the streaming stick has trouble fitting among other cables due to space restrictions, order a free HDMI extender from Roku's site: my.roku.com/hdmi . If your TV doesn't have an HDMI port, try using an HDMI to Component and/or Composite adapter, if your TV has a component (i.e., red, green and blue) or composite (i.e., red (R), white (L), and yellow (VIDEO)) ports."

Both the Roku Player and the Roku Stick require connection to a power source (e.g., a wall outlet): Roku Player — Plug the small end of the power adapter into the back of the player box, and the other end into an electrical power outlet. Roku Stick (model 3600 and down) — Plug the small end of the micro-USB power cable into the back or bottom of the stick, and the other end into an electrical outlet. Some TVs have USB ports to provide power in the place of a wall outlet. Roku Stick+ (model 3810 and up) — Plug the small end of the USB power cable with an advanced wireless receiver into the side or bottom of the stick like this, then plug the other end of the USB power extender cable and AC power adapter into an electrical outlet. Some TVs have USB ports to provide power in the place of a wall outlet. Insufficient power from a USB port can lead to instability, crashing, and/or other unpredictable behavior."
