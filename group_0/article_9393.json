      "content": "Find his agent’s information using IMDb Pro if you want to book him. Search for Eminem on IMDb Pro and look for the tab that lists his agent or manager. Locate the agent’s email address or phone number and reach out to them with your inquiry. Let them know about the event you’re booking, the date, the budget, and what you would like Eminem to do while attending. If the agent thinks it’s something Eminem would be interested in, they will relay the information to him and follow up with you later.

IMDb Pro requires a paid subscription, but you can get a free 30-day trial to find the information. Only contact Eminem’s agent for serious inquiries.

      "content": "Tweet to @Eminem to publicly send him messages. Go to @Eminem to access his profile and click the Follow button to see his posts in your main news feed. Click the Tweet button and start it with “@Eminem” so he gets tagged in the post. Then write the rest of your tweet talking about his music or asking when he’s going to tour in your area. Proofread your tweet before sending it out to publicly post it. [2] X Research source You can follow Eminem’s Twitter here: https://twitter.com/Eminem . Eminem has over 20 million followers and he doesn’t normally reply to personal tweets so there’s a very small chance you’ll hear back from him. Eminem does not allow private direct messages on his account. Try using hashtags with the names of his albums in your tweet to show that you support his music."

Sometimes, he will spend a little time taking pictures or autographing pieces of merchandise, but other times he may leave right away. [5] X Research source Waiting outside the venue does not guarantee the meeting or talking to Eminem. Be respectful to any security guards or bodyguards nearby, or else you will be escorted away."
