      "title": "Acknowledge your own uniqueness.",
      "content": "Acknowledge your own uniqueness. You are, in a sense, already original. While there will be people who are similar to you, wear similar clothes, and have similar ideas, no one has had the experiences you have or see the world from exactly the same point of view. Recognize that being who you are is already unique and you don’t need to change. You might feel embarrassed by things that make you feel different. However, these differences don’t define you. They are part of who you are and add to your unique experience. Recognize how your experiences shape who you are. There will never be a person who can replicate your experiences, thoughts, experiences, and ideas in full."

      "title": "Have confidence in yourself",
      "content": "Have confidence in yourself . Being original means you might get some heat or backlash for your choices. People won't always react well to what they perceive as different, so building confidence in what you do will help show yourself and others that you are proud to be original. Think positively about yourself and keep your self-talk constructive. [1] X Research source For example, if you wear a bold and unique outfit to school, say to yourself, “I feel great and look great.” Don’t compare yourself to others, especially if you tend to put yourself in a negative light. You’ll likely find others who you think are smarter, better dressed, or more \"original\" than you. Just be you. Try to surround yourself with supportive people who don't drag you down. You'll have an easier time being confident in yourself if you have a good support system. [2] X Expert Source Rachel Clissold Certified Life Coach Expert Interview. 26 August 2020."

      "title": "Try a new experience.",
      "content": "Try a new experience. New experiences will introduce you to new perspectives and ideas. You may not always like them, but they are ways to uncover what you're passionate about and give you a new perspective. Try being spontaneous and purposefully participating in activities you normally wouldn’t do. If nothing else, you’ll have a unique experience and a fun story to tell others. [3] X Research source Sign up for a swing dance class or an art class. Learn a new language to gain a different perspective on seeing the world. Look for flyers in your community for free music shows, lectures, and classes. This way you can try something new at little at no expense."

      "title": "Find a fun creative outlet.",
      "content": "Find a fun creative outlet. Discover activities and hobbies that help you express yourself uniquely and creatively. Express yourself in a way that is significant to you. This might be painting, sculpting, sewing, creating jewelry, doing woodwork, singing, or composing music. The important part is that you have a way to express yourself in a unique way that you enjoy. Think back on what you enjoyed as a child and find ways to build on that. Engage your playful side and see where it takes you. [4] X Research source You might use your own body to express originality. This might include the way you dress, your hair, or modifications such as piercings or tattoos."

      "title": "Develop your style.",
      "content": "Develop your style. This goes for fashion, art, and everything in between. Take your interests and put your own twist on them. If you don’t know where to start in creating a style, do something that interests you until you find your ‘sweet spot.’ Be willing to take risks and fail as you define your style. For example, if you’re a photographer, take photos of people, places, animals, and nature, and utilize different lenses and techniques. Notice what resonates with you, and you can begin to develop within framework. With practice, you might find that your style is taking black-and-white landscape photos. Constantly assess your work and yourself. Think about what do you do well and what you can improve on."

      "title": "Take risks instead of being focused on perfection.",
      "content": "Take risks instead of being focused on perfection. If you feel constrained by being perfect or having a perfect idea, you likely won’t reach your potential in creating something truly original. Be willing to take risks and experience failure. While you’re creating, be willing to approach things unconventionally and make changes later. There’s no need to put your work in a box. [5] X Research source For example, if you usually draw clean lines in your sketching, experiment with imperfect lines and see how it affects your work."

    {
      "title": "Present yourself uniquely.",
      "content": "Present yourself uniquely. If you want to show your originality to others, your appearance is a great way to showcase your unique style. Figure out what you like to wear and what feels comfortable. Find a clothing style you enjoy (such as dramatic, classy, romantic) and make it your own. If you like a classic look (like a t-shirt and jeans), do something original with your accessories or choose shoes that pop. You can also wear a fun belt or make some DIY changes to your t-shirts. If you shop at unusual places you are more likely to find clothes that nobody else will have. Try secondhand clothing stores, vintage clothing shops, flea markets, and bazaars. Especially if you wear a uniform, you can stand out by putting your effort into the details of your look. For example, mismatch your socks or jewelry or wear a hairstyle that’s uniquely your own."

      "title": "Brainstorm your ideas.",
      "content": "Brainstorm your ideas. Set aside some time just to generate ideas. Think of a goal or a problem, then begin to think of solutions. Let your mind express any and all ideas, even if you initially think they are good or bad. Write down your ideas and allow them to evolve. [6] X Research source Give yourself a time limit so that you can come up with as many ideas as you can within that time. Afterward, go through and pick out your best ideas and work with them."

      "title": "Take action on your ideas.",
      "content": "Take action on your ideas. It’s not enough just to have great ideas, you must act on them. People might respect that you’re a creative thinker, but what matters is what you do with your ideas. The action on your ideas is how you will be known or remembered. [7] X Research source Write down all of your ideas and weed out the ones that aren’t realistic. Find ways to express the ones that you can create! For example, if you have an idea for an original dinner recipe, play around with some ingredients until the dish tastes like perfection."

      "title": "Take a break from your project if you feel stuck.",
      "content": "Take a break from your project if you feel stuck. Have you noticed that lots of creative people tend to procrastinate? Sometimes, procrastination can help you be more creative. Taking a break from your work (but keeping it in the back of your mind) can help you approach it differently and try new things. So, if you’re stuck on something, give yourself a break and come back to it later. Something new might hit you. [8] X Research source For example, if you’re writing a play and want to make it original, take a break from it (for days, weeks, or even months) and see what you come up with."

      "title": "Notice what you like in others' works.",
      "content": "Notice what you like in others' works. Original artistic works, fashion statements, or opinions don't arise out of nothing. They are built on a framework of ideas, writings, paintings and outfits from people who came before them. They look at the world in a different way. Notice what you like or appreciate, then brainstorm ways to build off of it. Taking something and putting your own twist on it is one way to make original art. For example, write a fairytale story, but make it about animals or make the setting in outer space."

    {
      "title": "Collaborate your ideas with others.",
      "content": "Collaborate your ideas with others. Working jointly with others can help unlock your creativity and help you create something truly unique together. Working with someone else can also help you think differently, both as an individual and as a team. Even if you just brainstorm with another person, their input can help you develop something new that you would not have developed on your own. For example, if you write science-fiction stories, collaborate with a historical fiction writer and write a short story together."

      "title": "Work with an experienced mentor.",
      "content": "Work with an experienced mentor. A mentor can help you identify your strengths and weaknesses and hone your skills. Having a different perspective can help you see things from a different point of view. When looking for a mentor, find someone who interests you and who has their own sense of individuality. This person should be experienced and offer you real-life advice and guidance. [9] X Research source For example, if you’re a painter, find a painter to mentor you who has sold some paintings or is known for their own unique style."
