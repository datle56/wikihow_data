Use a paintbrush to apply a thin layer of your paint or stain to the craft sticks. Wait until the paint or stain is completely dry before working with them. [1] X Research source To make a lighter-colored stable, paint the craft sticks white or tan. Add windows or details in the wood using black paint."

      "content": "Glue mini craft sticks between 2 regular craft sticks to make the side walls. Set 2 of your regular-sized craft sticks the same distance apart as the length of your mini craft sticks. Lay out enough mini craft sticks to fill in the gap between the regular sticks. Put a dot of hot glue on the end of each of the mini craft sticks. Press the regular craft stick so the edges are flush with the ends. Repeat the process to build the second wall. [2] X Research source Purchase craft sticks at your local hobby store. If you need to cut the craft sticks, use a strong pair of scissors. You can either completely fill in the wall with mini craft sticks or leave spaces in between them."

      "content": "Build a back wall that’s 2 craft sticks long. Lay 2 craft sticks so their tips are touching to create the length of your wall. Make the back wall with pairs of craft sticks until it’s the same height as your side walls. Run a line of glue on another craft stick and press it down where the tips meet. Glue another stick on the other side to give your wall extra support. [3] X Research source If you left gaps in between the sticks in your side walls, make sure to leave gaps in the back wall that are the same distance apart. If you want to add more supports to the wall, add a craft stick on the ends of your wall."

Hold the back edge of your side wall against the glue line at a 90-degree angle until it dries, which should only take a couple of minutes. Repeat the process for the other side wall. Slowly tilt your stable so it stands up on its own. [4] X Research source"

Press the glue down on the top edge of your side wall and hold it there until it dries. The roof piece should form about a 45-degree angle with your wall. Glue the other side of your roof the same way to finish your stable. [6] X Research source If you want to attach the roof pieces at their peak, hold them together with a line of hot glue. The glue should be enough to hold the roof, but if you want extra support, add 2 craft sticks in an X-shape to the back wall of the stable."

Lay the longer boards between the shorter boards to make a rectangle that’s 42 in × 78 in (110 cm × 200 cm). Don’t screw the boards together yet. [7] X Research source You may need to adjust the size of your stable depending on how large you want your Nativity scene.

Screw the anchor into one of the boards and the post to hold it secure. Screw a second anchor into the other side of the post and the second base board.

Leave enough at the other end of your board to create an overhang for your walls. Use angled anchor plates to screw in your boards. Place a rafter along each short wall so the top of your stable looks like a triangle. [11] X Research source You may add additional rafters along the length of the wall if you want added support."

Put at least 5-6 screws through the roof into each rafter to hold it tightly. Repeat the process for the other side of the roof. [12] X Research source Always size the piece of plywood on both sides. Even though it should be the same, the wood may be crooked or warped on the other side. Nail on wooden shingles if you want to add more detail to your stable."

[13] X Research source Keep your screws and anchor plates in resealable bags so they don’t get lost. Label the pieces of your stable so you know where to put them next time you build it."
