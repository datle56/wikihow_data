      "content": "Examine the jack on the microphone. Generally, most basic computer microphones will have one of two varieties of jack: an 1/8\" TRS jack, which is essentially the same kind of jack you would find on a pair of headphones, or a USB jack, which is flat. Both of these jacks have corresponding ports on most computers. [1] X Research source If you're using an XLR microphone, a quarter-inch jack, or some other variety of mic, skip to the next section."

      "content": "Locate the corresponding port on your computer. Almost all desktop computers will have visible microphone ports on either the front or the back of the tower. Usually, this port will be colored pink, and have a microphone image over it. If you have an 1/8 inch jack, all you have to do is plug it into this port and start testing sound. If you have a USB jack on the end of your microphone, most computers will have two or more USB ports on the side, or the back of the computer. Simply plug the USB jack into one of these ports. Laptops and some more contemporary computers don't have microphone ports, because they're generally outfitted with internal microphones. It's usually possible to plug into the headphone port on most computers, however, and adjust your sound settings later."

      "title": "Examine the jack on the end of the microphone.",
      "content": "Examine the jack on the end of the microphone. Higher grade music microphones, condenser mics, and other professional gear will generally require an adapter or a converter cable before you plug them in. These range in price, and will vary depending on the type of microphone you're trying to input into the computer. If you see a triangle of prongs on the end of the end of the microphone, that's an XLR mic, and you'll need to get either a cable which converts the XLR jack into the 1/8 inch port, a converter box which will convert it into USB, or a mixer. If you are using the mic for music recording, it likely requires Phantom Power and will therefore not work with a cable converter. We recommend using a mixer, or investing in an Audio Interface. Consult this wikiHow guide for more information. If the jack is a quarter-inch, the size of a guitar cable, you'll need to purchase an adapter cable that will convert into either USB or 1/8 inch size, and plug it into the mic port or headphone port. These cables are usually quite cheap."

      "title": "Get the appropriate converter.",
      "content": "Get the appropriate converter. Both of these types of mics will need to be connected to some kind of adapter before you plug them into the computer. Because these microphones are typically higher quality, it's best to invest in good adaption equipment to keep the signal as strong as possible. XLR mics can be adapted relatively cheaply with cables or a USB converter box, but some users find that this can be \"crackly,\" losing some of the presence of good microphones. For the best sound quality, invest in a mixing board with a USB output. Quarter-inch to eighth-inch converter cables are widely available and pretty cheap to buy. You can find them at any electronics store or online electronics retailer."
