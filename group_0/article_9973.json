      "content": "Put 1 cup (235 ml) of water or milk and a dash of salt in a medium-size pot. Place the pot on the stovetop, and turn the stove on medium-high. Watch the pot for when the liquid reaches a boil. [1] X Research source Using 1 cup (235 ml) of liquid and 0.5 cup (45 g) of oats will make a serving of oats for 1 person. If you're cooking oats for multiple people, scale up the amount of liquid and oats as necessary. You can use any milk fat percentage you prefer. Using higher fat milk will yield a creamier oatmeal, while using water will create a plainer oatmeal. Omit the salt if you are following a low-sodium diet. It won't affect the cooking process."

[3] X Research source If the oatmeal still tastes too firm to you, continue cooking for another 2-3 minutes. Sample the oatmeal again.
