      "title": "Remember that your boyfriend is with you for a reason.",
      "content": "Remember that your boyfriend is with you for a reason. Take a long, deep breath. Then, remember that your boyfriend has chosen to be with you. Out of all the potential partners out there, he picked you and that means a lot. It’s totally normal to be bummed out about your boyfriend being busy—and you shouldn’t feel bad about feeling bad—but it should help to remember this when it comes to any anxiety you’re feeling. [1] X Research source This kind of anxiety is especially normal if it’s early in the relationship. These feelings will likely go away as you and your boyfriend find your rhythm."

      "title": "Tackle something important on your to-do list.",
      "content": "Tackle something important on your to-do list. Your boyfriend has priorities, and you probably have some too! Keep yourself busy doing things you need to do. It’s better to tackle any schoolwork, actual work, or house chores you’ve been putting off. If you feel like you don’t have much to do, set some new goals or work on something less pressing. [2] X Research source For example, you can put extra effort into your work or studying, spend more time with your family, or catch up on chores around the house."

    {
      "title": "Pick up some new hobbies.",
      "content": "Pick up some new hobbies. Your boyfriend shouldn’t be the only source of fun in your life. Fill your time with things you enjoy, and if you don’t have many hobbies, go get some . Besides being happier, you’ll also be more attractive and interesting when you have a life outside your relationship. [3] X Research source For instance, you could start working out, learn a new language, write a novel, or pick up a craft. Try visiting Meetup , a platform that connects you to others in your area who also want to try new activities."

      "title": "Spend some meaningful time with your friends or family.",
      "content": "Spend some meaningful time with your friends or family. Make time to see your friends regularly, and don’t just talk about your boyfriend with them. Do things related to your shared interests, like going to concerts, shopping, or watching movies. Spend less time with friends who are needy towards their own boyfriends, since their behavior may influence you. [4] X Research source You could also try joining Bumble BFF to find some new gal pals to hang out with!"

    {
      "title": "Tell him how you’re feeling without making accusations.",
      "content": "Tell him how you’re feeling without making accusations. There’s no need to make this a “fight” convo. Just tell him you’re feeling a little sad about how infrequently you've seen each other lately and that you wish it could change. Be really low key about it and aim for a tone that’s more hopeful than accusatory. [5] X Research source You might try: I feel like we haven’t had a ton of quality time together lately. It’s been kind of bumming me out. I could really use some more Seth in my life! You’ve been so busy lately. I am not even a little jealous of everything you’ve got on your plate. I do kinda wish we had more “us” time, though. Are you free next week at all? I’d really love to spend more time together. We haven’t had some chillaxing time in a hot minute and it’s weighing on me."

      "title": "Listen to your boyfriend’s explanation (if he has one).",
      "content": "Listen to your boyfriend’s explanation (if he has one). It’s possible your boyfriend doesn’t offer any explanations because he’s just genuinely very busy for reasons he has already explained, but if he does try to explain himself, hear him out! Maybe this is just temporary. Perhaps he’ll have an explanation for you regarding a project at work or something else. Maybe he didn’t even know you wanted to spend more time together and this is the wakeup call he needed! [6] X Research source Some people use “I’m busy” as a catchall excuse when they need time to themselves. Even if he isn’t necessarily using the time for things that strike you as worthy of the “busy” label, this might just be his go-to excuse when he needs alone time. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Ask your boyfriend about his schedule if you want more info.",
      "content": "Ask your boyfriend about his schedule if you want more info. Find out when your boyfriend is free and when he needs to be left alone to get things done. Learn what hours he works, when he’s at school, and what times he goes to sports practice or works on his hobbies. This could provide you the context you need to understand why he’s so busy, which may help alleviate your fears. [8] X Research source It’s easy to spin out of control and imagine he’s doing something nefarious if you don’t really understand how he spends his days. You don’t need to be super invasive, just casually ask how he spent his day whenever you two chat!"

    {
      "title": "Try to come up with a compromise.",
      "content": "Try to come up with a compromise . You both should get what you need from the relationship, so if you need more time to feel close, tell him. Then, try to offer him the same thing: if he says that he needs more time for his independence, try to respect that. Begin from a place of respect and care, and you'll have an easier time finding a compromise."

      "title": "Yes, this is just a sign that you’re really into him and you miss him!",
      "content": "Yes, this is just a sign that you’re really into him and you miss him! This is your boyfriend that we’re talking about. You two are in a special relationship that can’t be replicated elsewhere, and this is just a sign that you’re head over heels. Think about it this way: if you didn’t feel anything when your boyfriend was too busy to hang out, it’d kind of be a sign you weren’t that romantically invested, right? [9] X Research source It’s especially normal to be anxious or scared about your boyfriend being too busy when you’re early in the relationship. If you two haven’t been together for more than 6-12 months, don’t freak out if you’re…well, freaking out. If you two have been together for a longer period of time and you still get very anxious or you feel so overwhelmed with anxiety that it’s hard to go about your day, it’s worth reaching out to a counselor or therapist. You may have some underlying attachment issues to work through, which is super common (and nothing to be ashamed about)."

      "content": "Normal—He’s going through a transitional period. If your boyfriend has just been let go of his job, someone important to him has just died, or some other big event has thrown him for a loop, it’s normal for him to be busier than you’re used to. Life can be messy and if he’s got a lot going on in his non-relationship life and his relationship is going well, it makes sense he’d be spending a lot of time on that non-relationship stuff. [10] X Research source Other big transitional moments might include: big financial struggles, relocation, a spiritual awakening, a health crisis, and struggles with family or friends."

      "title": "Red flag—He’s inattentive to your needs.",
      "content": "Red flag—He’s inattentive to your needs. It’s one thing to be super busy, but if he’s busy and he’s neglecting the basic needs of your relationship, business is not an excuse. You deserve regular phone calls/texts, and it’s reasonable for him to put you in front of things like casual time with friends or video game tournaments. [11] X Research source If he’s not responding to your texts, calling you regularly, or reaching out on social media to chat periodically when he’s busy, that’s a worrying sign. He should at least be talking to you."

      "content": "Normal—He has a high-stress job or tough test coming up. If you’re dating the town’s top homicide detective or heart surgeon, it’d be reasonable for your experience of the relationship to be a bit different than what you’re used to—that man has a lot on his plate. It’s also worth giving him the benefit of the doubt if he’s got a big exam coming up at school, he needs to graduate, or he’s fighting to keep his grades up. [12] X Research source A job that involves a lot of travelling is also likely to keep your boyfriend busier than normal."

      "title": "Red flag—He has lied to you or refuses to explain.",
      "content": "Red flag—He has lied to you or refuses to explain. If you suspect that your boyfriend is using being busy as an excuse to push you away, he’s probably not the right person for you. He might be married to his job or goals, and unless you have a similar mindset, you’ll probably end up feeling unloved and neglected. [13] X Research source Sometimes people avoid their significant other because they don’t know how to break up. If you think this is what your boyfriend is doing, don’t drag things out. Be the more mature person and call it quits ."

Don’t just guess when you should hangout with your boyfriend—discuss it ahead of time so you’ll know for sure and actually schedule it.

[14] X Expert Source Anna Svetchnikov Licensed Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 25 October 2023. For instance, maybe he’s free to have lunch with you once a week, or maybe he can talk on the phone with you when he gets out of class at 4 PM. Plan ahead, even if that just means renting a movie and cooking a nice dinner. If you’re worried you’ll forget to tell him things, write them down so you’ll have plenty to talk about next time you see each other. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Join one another for more mundane tasks. If your boyfriend is too busy for long hangout sessions, look for other reasons to get together. For instance, you could help him with yard work or go to the gym together in the mornings. [16] X Research source Join one another for the stuff both of you have to do anyway. You could join one another for grocery shopping, for example. You can also join him for activities he’s already involved in. If he takes a cooking class on Monday nights, ask him if you can come, too."

Send one another memes, share silly little anecdotes about one another’s day, and just keep the conversation going. You won’t feel so far apart if there’s a little bit of a convo going on all day. [17] X Research source Maybe your boyfriend just isn’t used to being on his phone that often. If that’s the case, just take it slow and encourage him to check in more often. He’ll get used to it!"

If you interrupt him too often, you’ll seem clingy and he’ll get annoyed. [18] X Research source Stick to the times you agreed on for talking and hanging out together. [19] X Research source If you’re really tempted to call or text but you know it’s a bad time, turn off your phone, or go somewhere and leave your phone at home."

Maybe he forgot to take his phone off silent mode after class, or maybe he got held up by something at work.

He’ll get back to you when he can. Find a way to distract yourself in the meantime. However, if you don’t hear back from him within a week, it’s probably time to check on him to make sure everything’s ok."
