      "content": "You feel loss or grief. When we grieve, we often feel like a glass that’s been shattered, so it’s no surprise that broken glass is often a sign of loss. You may be grieving the death of a loved one, or someone who’s no longer in your life for whatever reason. While it may be painful, that pain is natural, and the broken glass represents the necessary release of those intense and overwhelming emotions. What to do: Work through your grief by letting yourself feel those feelings. Keep a journal or a diary to record and externalize them. Then, talk to a close friend, family member, or even a therapist to help you make sense of those feelings."

      "content": "Breaking glass is often seen as an omen of good luck. It’s true that some say broken mirrors are bad luck, but not all broken glass is a bad omen.

      "content": "Broken mirror Seeing a broken mirror in a dream may mean you’re having trouble letting go of the past. The mirror reveals what’s behind you, but the view is cracked and distorted, signifying that it no longer serves you.

Or, write them down in a journal to externalize them, which can help vent your frustration or sadness."
