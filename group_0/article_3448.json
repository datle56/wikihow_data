      "content": "Ensure that you have all the necessary permits. Most states require permits for indictment management, private property, and consent towing. Some states or cities may require additional permits and licenses, so contact your city or county clerk’s office to see what other permits may be required. Make sure your other permits are up to date and renew them if necessary. [1] X Research source An indictment management permit allows you to tow vehicles initiated by an officer of law enforcement. Private property permits allow you to tow vehicles without the owner’s consent as long as it’s authorized by a parking facility owner. Consent tow permits are used to tow vehicles with permission from the owner. Make copies of your permits and store the originals in a safe in your business office."

      "content": "Confirm you and your drivers all have the proper licensing. While driving a regular vehicle, like a car, only requires a Class A license, tow trucks require a Class B Commercial Driver’s License (CDL). Make sure your and your employees’ licenses are all current and have a Class B certification on them. If not, renew your licenses before applying for a AAA contracting job.

While the AAA club goes over your application, a representative may ask to visit your towing facility, take pictures of your vehicles, and request criminal background checks for your employees. Provide any and all of the requests the AAA provider asks for while they’re there. Providing the requests that AAA asks for does not guarantee that you’ll be accepted as a contractor until they can review the material. If the AAA representative asks for background checks on you or your employees, make sure to provide a copy of a driver's license (front and back), a birthday, a Social Security number, and a current home address."

[9] X Research source Most AAA contractors are required to offer these services at any time."
