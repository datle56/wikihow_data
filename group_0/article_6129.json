      "content": "Work with your relative to assess their needs. Before you can provide care for an elderly person, you need to figure out what kind of care would benefit them the most. Depending on their overall health and how well they can manage day-to-day tasks, they may need anything from occasional help to constant support. Talk to them, spend time observing them, and work with their healthcare providers to determine their needs. [1] X Research source Consider whether your loved one has difficulty managing basic activities, such as feeding themselves, moving around their home, getting dressed, or taking care of their hygiene. If so, they may need home support from you or a professional caregiver. If they are still able to do most of their basic daily activities without help, you may only need to provide occasional support. For example, you might offer to come over once a week to help with errands or household chores."

If your loved one feels that other people are making all their choices for them, they may be more resistant to receiving help. To help them feel more independent and in control of their situation, include them in all conversations and decisions about their care. Communicate openly and honestly with them and ask them for their input and opinions about any options you are considering. For example, you might say, “It seems like you’re having some trouble keeping up with the housework these days, Dad. Do you think it would help if I came over every couple of days to help out?” Listen actively to anything they have to say about their needs or their feelings about the care options you are considering. If they have any objections, hear them out completely without being dismissive or minimizing their concerns."
