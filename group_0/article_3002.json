      "content": "Watch the show. The best and most important thing you can do to prepare for the show is by watching it. Watch it every day, and record it if you can't watch it live. Know how the game is played. Know the format and what the lifelines are and how they work. Watching the show every day will also give you a feel for what kinds of questions are asked on the show. While the show covers a broad range of subjects, it's a good idea to keep up on current events and popular culture, since the show often asks questions on those subjects. You may also want to study movie trivia, since the show holds weeks dedicated to movies at least once a year."
