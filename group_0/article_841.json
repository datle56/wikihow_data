The information you'll need to add an IP address to your server varies by what you're trying to do: If you are adding a new public IP address to a Windows server that already has a static IP address, you'll just need the new IP address and subnet mask . This is common if your server is hosted by a cloud or web hosting company and you requested an IP address for a specific website or application you host. If your Windows server does not already have at least one static IP address , such as a home or office server, you'll need: The IP address (either IPv4 or IPv6) The default gateway address The subnet mask The addresses of your DNS servers. Alternatively, you can use Google's—we'll show you how later in this method. If you're not sure which numbers to use, contact your internet provider, hosting company, or the administrator responsible for providing you with a static IP address."
