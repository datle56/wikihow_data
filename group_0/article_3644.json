If it sounds like a lot, don't worry, you can work up to it! As a pro MMA fighter, when you’re not preparing for a fight, you’ll train once a day for 1.5-2 hours, 5-6 days a week. To stay in good physical shape MMA fighters will spend oftentimes even more time working on their conditioning than even their fighting skills, by doing cardio and lifting weights. You’ll take a maximum of 2-3 weeks off per year and usually only take time off if you’re injured."

In every post, feel free to be yourself rather than creating a character. For example, if you’re a working parent who loves your kids, post content about spending time with your kids. If you’re a funny person, post videos of you joking around with your friends. That way, you’ll attract a niche audience who will connect with who you are and want to support you by buying fight tickets. [3] X Research source On every profile page, show off a 2-3 minute video highlight reel of your best fights and moments. Engage with your fans in the comment section by starting conversations and liking their posts. [4] X Research source"

Offer to plug their company on social media or wear their clothing in the cage when you fight.

Be sure to turn your hips to help carry that momentum into your punches.
