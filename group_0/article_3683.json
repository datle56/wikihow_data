      "content": "Your notes are more helpful when the class is still fresh in your head. Schedule a 10- to 15-minute study session as soon as possible after your class (maybe in between classes, if you have enough time). Fill in any blanks in your notes so they'll be understandable later and highlight any unanswered questions you had or anything you don't understand. [1] X Research source For example, suppose you have an hour between classes. You might schedule a 30-minute study session and spend half of that time reviewing your notes from the first class. Then, devote the second half of that session to looking over your notes or assignments for the second class. In a regular study session later, you might type your notes up in narrative or outline form. That will make them more accessible when you're studying."

      "content": "Studying during the day is more effective than studying at night. It's best to leave your evenings free to relax and wind down from the day. Carve out time in the morning to study, as well as time between classes. Make it your goal to have all of your studying done before dinnertime each day. [2] X Research source Your intuition might tell you to study at the end of the day after your classes are over. But by the time the sun sets, your body and mind are starting to shut down and you just won't remember as much of what you study if you try to burn the midnight oil. Sometimes you just can't work studying into the daytime hours, and that's okay too! If your class schedule, work, and extra-curricular activities mean your only time to study is in the evening, take more frequent breaks (say a 5-minute break every 15 minutes). It'll help you retain the information better."

      "title": "Skim the material a week ahead so you know what to expect.",
      "content": "Skim the material a week ahead so you know what to expect. Reading ahead helps you get more out of each class because you'll know what the teacher is going to talk about. Prepare questions about anything you didn't understand so you can ask the teacher about it. [3] X Research source Reading ahead can also help you understand where the material you're covering now fits into the overall course."

      "title": "You gain a deeper understanding of the material after teaching it.",
      "content": "You gain a deeper understanding of the material after teaching it. If someone in your class is struggling with something that you think you've got a good handle on, teaching them will help you retain that knowledge even better. Perhaps more importantly, teaching requires you to retrieve the knowledge you've already learned, which makes it easier for you to retrieve it again (such as for a test). [4] X Research source Study groups are good for this, but you might also want to venture outside of your class. Does your mom or dad always ask you what you're studying in school? Tell them! Teaching a younger child is also beneficial because it forces you to explain technical terms and use more simplistic language, so you can't just regurgitate what your teacher said or what you read in a textbook."

      "content": "Schedule in 30-minute increments to make the best use of your time. Scheduling your time in blocks allows you to be more productive during your day. Put in your classes and other appointments first, then schedule in study time around that. [5] X Research source For example, you might study for a half-hour in the morning before classes, then another half-hour at lunchtime, then another half-hour in the afternoon. If you fit in another half-hour immediately before or after dinner, that means you've studied for a full 2 hours over the course of the day! By breaking your study time up into smaller increments, you'll barely notice it. Plus, you'll retain more of the stuff that you study. [6] X Expert Source Ashley Pritchard, MA School Counselor Expert Interview. 4 November 2019. Don't study more than an hour at a time before you take a break."

      "title": "Make sure you have everything you need for the class before it starts.",
      "content": "Make sure you have everything you need for the class before it starts. If there are required books or other resources, have them available before the first day of the course. It's typically a good idea to get them several days before class starts, if you can, so you have the opportunity to look through them and familiarize yourself with the topics the class will cover. [7] X Research source For example, you might have a binder for each class with sections for notes, assignments, and returned papers. If you have a syllabus for the class, put it at the very front. If you have tools for class, such as a calculator, get a 3-hole pouch so you can slide those things right into your binder. Another organizational trick is to create a homework binder with a section for each class. Put your assignments in the right section and always carry your homework binder with you—then you don't have to worry about forgetting your homework! Being organized makes everything easier. You won't have to worry about hunting for that book or not having the supplies you need when class starts. Keep your study area neat and organized as well. Having all of your study materials close at hand helps stave off procrastination."

      "content": "Set a goal to contribute at least once in every class period. This could mean asking a question, answering a question the teacher asked, or adding a comment to participate in a class discussion. [8] X Expert Source Ashley Pritchard, MA School Counselor Expert Interview. 4 November 2019. However you participate, making your voice heard lets your teacher know that you're paying attention and want to learn. [9] X Research source If part of the grade in your class is based on participation, consider this a way to get a few free points! Otherwise, it still gives you a good foundation and can help you understand the material better."

      "title": "Write down the main points and anything your teacher focuses on.",
      "content": "Write down the main points and anything your teacher focuses on. Generally, if your teacher spends a lot of time on something in class, you can guarantee that it's important to know for the course and will probably be on a test. Write down keywords or phrases that your teacher repeats or writes on the board. Under each keyword or phrase, jot down any examples or details. [10] X Research source It can be hard to figure out what's most important at first, but don't try to write down everything—your notes won't be very helpful if you do. Watch others in the class to see when they all go to write something down. That'll help you figure out what's important. If you have any questions or something you don't understand, either in your readings or in class, make a note of it! It'll help you remember if you don't have a chance to bring it up in class and want to ask your teacher about it later."

      "title": "Let your teacher know early on if you're having problems.",
      "content": "Let your teacher know early on if you're having problems. Never hesitate to recognize that you need help and ask for it. [11] X Expert Source Ashley Pritchard, MA School Counselor Expert Interview. 4 November 2019. Your teacher can help you with different resources or approaches to the material. They'll appreciate it if you come to them as soon as possible and they'll have more options to help you than if you want until the last minute. This might require swallowing your pride, but remember—that's what your teacher is there for. [12] X Research source For example, suppose you're having difficulty getting a formula in physics class to work. If you go to your teacher immediately, they might connect you with a former student who can tutor you. But if you waited until the day before the exam, they wouldn't be able to do that for you on such short notice. In most courses, everything you learn builds on what you learned before. That means if you don't get something this week, you might have a hard time understanding what you study next week and the week after next."

      "title": "Break large assignments into smaller chunks so they're easier to manage.",
      "content": "Break large assignments into smaller chunks so they're easier to manage. Basic homework assignments typically shouldn't take too long and will help you better understand the coursework. For larger papers and research projects, though, avoid trying to do them all at once. [13] X Research source For example, if you have a research paper due in 2 weeks, you might schedule four 30-minute blocks in the first week for researching and outlining, then another two 30-minute blocks in the next week to draft the paper. That leaves you another two 30-minute blocks to proofread and polish the final draft and get it ready by the due date. Keep in mind that most teachers will deduct from the grade for late assignments, if they even accept them at all. You can't afford this if you're trying to get an A+ in the class."

      "title": "Synthesize all of your notes into a single document.",
      "content": "Synthesize all of your notes into a single document. Start from the first week of class building a summary of what you've covered so far. Incorporate comments from your teacher, information from homework assignments, notes from class or assigned readings, and material covered on quizzes and tests. [14] X Research source Creating an outline helps you focus on the most important parts of the subject. As you get deeper into the course, you'll also start to see connections between different parts of the course that you can use to tie everything together. Outlines are a major study method in law school, but this skill comes in handy for any course. Not only does it provide a productive way to review, but it also results in a single, compact document you can use to study for the final exam."

      "content": "Read and watch documentaries about the subjects you're studying. Engaging with material outside the assigned reading for class adds a new dimension to what you're learning. It also makes it easier to internalize the material when you're seeing it in a different way. [15] X Research source Even novels related to the subject can help you understand more—just make sure you can separate fact from fiction!"

      "content": "Sleep at least 8 hours each night and exercise 30 minutes most days. You'll perform better in class and on tests and assignments if you're well-rested and healthy. Choose an activity you enjoy for exercise and schedule it just as you schedule classes, work, and study sessions. [16] X Research source Build a consistent routine so that you're going to bed and waking up at the same time every day. This will help you feel more rested and also ensure that you get better quality sleep each night. Remember to allow time for relaxing and self-reflection! These are important self-care activities that will greatly improve your mental health and keep you from getting burnt out. Focus on food as a source of brain fuel. Eat a variety of whole grains, vegetables, and protein that will give you plenty of energy throughout the day. Candy, sweets, and other \"comfort\" foods can certainly make you happy in the moment, but they're not the best for your body—use them as occasional treats in moderation. [17] X Research source"
