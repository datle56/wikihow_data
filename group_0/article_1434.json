      "title": "Sand the wood to create a flat, smooth surface.",
      "content": "Sand the wood to create a flat, smooth surface. If the piece of wood you plan on coating in epoxy is rough or uneven, use a sandpaper grit between 120 and 220 to sand the wood. Create an even, smooth surface so the epoxy will go on effortlessly. [1] X Research source Sand the wood going with the grain to create the smoothest surface."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the dust and dirt from the wood.",
      "content": "Remove the dust and dirt from the wood. Wipe off any dirt or dust from sanding the wood using a clean microfiber cloth. If you choose to dampen the cloth to remove the dust, let the wood dry out completely before coating it in epoxy. [2] X Research source Use a mini vacuum or brush to remove the excess dust, if you'd like."
    },
    {
      "title": "Attach painter’s tape to the back of the wood to catch epoxy drips.",
      "content": "Attach painter’s tape to the back of the wood to catch epoxy drips. Turn your piece of wood over and set it on a flat surface. Put painter’s tape along the perimeter of the back of the wood, pressing down firmly to make sure the epoxy won’t leak under it. This prevents drips from forming on the underside of the wood when you do your pour. [3] X Research source The tape only needs to go along the edges of the back of the wood."
    },
    {
      "title": "Protect your surfaces from the epoxy using cardboard or plastic.",
      "content": "Protect your surfaces from the epoxy using cardboard or plastic. Choose an even surface to do your project on, like a kitchen table or work table. Cover the surface with thick, even cardboard or a piece of plastic so the epoxy doesn’t ruin your table. [4] X Research source If you’re covering the table in plastic, consider using painter’s tape to secure the plastic to the table so it doesn’t move around. Use a couple of layers of cardboard or plastic, just in case."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the wood on pedestal objects so it’s not touching the surface.",
      "content": "Place the wood on pedestal objects so it’s not touching the surface. These could be things like cups turned upside down or wooden blocks–any 2 or 3 objects that are flat, even, and tall enough to raise the wood off of the table. Situate the wood on the objects so it’s hovering over the surface with the side that will be coated in epoxy facing upwards. [5] X Research source Metal cans or cups from the kitchen that are the same height are great options."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix the epoxy in a well-ventilated, dust-free environment.",
      "content": "Mix the epoxy in a well-ventilated, dust-free environment. Many types of epoxy have a strong smell, making it important to do the mixing and pouring in an area that gets plenty of fresh air. It’s also important to do this in a dust-free area so the dust doesn’t mix in with the epoxy and create a cloudy, dirty coating. Avoid mixing the epoxy in an area that’s chilly, or below 65 °F (18 °C), for the best results."

    {
      "title": "Measure the resin and hardener into separate disposable cups.",
      "content": "Measure the resin and hardener into separate disposable cups. Different types of epoxy have different ratios of resin to hardener, so follow the instructions carefully to be sure you pour the correct amount of each. Pour the resin into one disposable cup and the hardener into another. [6] X Research source Most companies will sell the resin and hardener together. Plastic cups are great to use because their indentations make the resin and hardener easier to measure. The ratios will be labeled on the package and are often either 1:1, 2:1, or 4:1. Wear gloves to make sure your skin doesn’t come in contact with the resin and hardener."
    },
    {
      "title": "Combine the resin and hardener into the same cup.",
      "content": "Combine the resin and hardener into the same cup. Once they’re properly measured, pour the resin and hardener into the same disposable cup to begin mixing them together. Use a plastic or wood rod to scrape the sides of the cup so that you get all of the resin and hardener out of each container. [7] X Research source Either pour the resin into the hardener or the hardener into the resin, whichever is easiest."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stir the two ingredients together slowly for 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Stir the two ingredients together slowly for 5 minutes. Use the plastic or wooden rod to slowly stir the resin and hardener together. Avoid stirring too vigorously or quickly so you don't create air bubbles. Set a timer and continue stirring for 5 minutes. [8] X Research source If you do see air bubbles forming while you're stirring, don't worry—these can be removed later on using heat."

    {
      "title": "Pour the epoxy over the wood starting in the center.",
      "content": "Pour the epoxy over the wood starting in the center. After the epoxy is all mixed, pour it over the wood carefully. As this is the first layer, don’t worry if it’s not perfectly even. Start in the middle and pour enough to cover the entire piece of wood in a thin layer. [9] X Research source Pour the epoxy onto the wood as soon as you mix it because it doesn’t have a lot of time before it starts to harden. It doesn't matter how you pour the epoxy on the wood during the first layer, just as long as it covers the whole piece of wood. Some people like to pour a large pile of epoxy in the middle of the wood and spread it out, while others pour thin streams of epoxy all around the entire piece of wood."

    {
      "title": "Use a foam brush to pull the epoxy towards the edges of the wood.",
      "content": "Use a foam brush to pull the epoxy towards the edges of the wood. Place the foam brush in the puddle of epoxy and begin using the brush to pull the epoxy over the edges using back and forth motions. Try to create as even of a layer of epoxy as possible, making sure the whole piece of wood is coated. [10] X Research source Wipe off any excess epoxy from the sides using the foam brush."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get rid of air bubbles by moving a heat source over the epoxy.",
      "content": "Get rid of air bubbles by moving a heat source over the epoxy. Air bubbles are an inevitable part of pouring epoxy, but you can get rid of them using a heat gun, torch, or hairdryer. Turn the heat source on and hold it roughly 6–10 inches (15–25 cm) from the epoxy’s surface to pop the bubbles. Move the heat source back and forth slowly over the surface until you see the bubbles pop. [11] X Research source Continue moving the heat source instead of holding it in one place or you could burn the epoxy."

    {
      "title": "Let the first coat sit for 4 hours.",
      "content": "Let the first coat sit for 4 hours. Set a timer for 4 hours and let the first coat of epoxy begin to harden. While it won’t be completely dry and hard, it should feel tacky as it cures, letting you know it’s time for a second coat. [12] X Research source If you see more air bubbles within the first 30 minutes, use your desired heat source to pop them if possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply an additional coat of epoxy for extra protection.",
      "content": "Apply an additional coat of epoxy for extra protection. Mix another batch of epoxy using the correct ratio of resin to hardener, just as you did with the first one. Pour this coat into the center of the piece of wood before taking a spatula or spreader and creating an even surface. Drag the spatula through the epoxy slowly, pulling it to the edges of the wood and creating an even layer. Pull the spatula or spreader back and forth over the entire piece of wood as many times as it takes to form a flat layer of epoxy. [13] X Research source If you don't have a spatula to use, any other straight, hard surface will work to drag the epoxy across the wood evenly. Pour enough epoxy to cover the edges of the wood as well, wiping up any excess or drips using the foam brush. Using a foam brush to drag the final coat of epoxy over the wood won't create as even of a surface as a plastic spreader or other hard, flat object."

      "title": "Wait 24 hours for the epoxy to harden before removing the painter’s tape.",
      "content": "Wait 24 hours for the epoxy to harden before removing the painter’s tape. Epoxy takes 24-36 hours to completely harden. Once it’s hardened to the touch, flip the piece of wood over carefully and pull off the painter’s tape to reveal your beautiful epoxy-coated wood. [14] X Research source Avoid touching or moving the wood as the epoxy is hardening to make sure it isn't messed up."
