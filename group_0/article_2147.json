If your car is not tuned up and breaks down, it can make you a sitting duck for carjackers. [4] X Research source Check your tires once a month and before you take a trip. Look for wear, damage, or low air. [5] X Research source"

If you must keep personal property such as a purse or shopping bags in the vehicle, put them in the trunk where they can’t be seen. Never leave money in view inside your car, even if it’s just spare change. [8] X Research source While driving, put valuable items on the floor rather than on the seats. They will be less visible in case you need to stop and for some reason can’t put them in the trunk."

Knowing your neighbors will help you recognize if there is a suspicious vehicle or individual around. [10] X Research source If you see an unfamiliar person loitering or a strange vehicle repeatedly cruising in the neighborhood, this is considered a “suspicious activity.” Don’t go home. Report the activity to local police and drive around the block; come back to your driveway when that person has left. Reporting suspicious activity and unusual events or incidents to the authorities can reduce crime and make your community safer."

Make sure that your driveway and garage have lighting. Don’t keep shrubs or other heavy foliage around your driveway. [12] X Research source Keep your driveway lit with traditional ground lighting, solar lighting, hanging lights, or LED lighting along the length of your driveway. [13] X Research source If you live in an area with foggy nights, choose lighting that can be seen without decreasing visibility in fog. Ground lights should be at least a foot apart and staggered somewhat."

If possible, keep your car parked in your garage and lock the garage door. [15] X Research source Having an automatic garage door closed does not necessarily make it thief-proof. Carjackers “fish” garage doors with wire hooks to activate the release mechanisms of automatic garage doors. [16] X Research source Block access to the release mechanism inside your garage by making a shield with a piece of plywood fastened to a wood cleat with two brad nails. You can also lock the release mechanism with a twist-tie. You can use a t-handle or slide lock on your garage door as an extra safety measure. A t-handle lock uses its own key and a slide lock can be used with a padlock."

Plan ahead of time which route you will take and any stops you may need to make along the way.

      "content": "Take extra care when parking in commercial areas. According to the National Crime Victimization survey, 25% of all carjackings happen in parking lots, parking garages or near commercial areas. Park in a spot close to the building’s main entrance and under a lot of light, [22] X Research source avoiding areas that are visually obstructed by walls or large plants. [23] X Research source Don’t sit in the car and go through receipts or have a conversation on the phone or with your child in the backseat. Get in, lock the doors and go. Don’t put your seatbelt on while pulling out of a space. If something happens, you may need to get out of your car quickly. Instead, belt yourself as soon as you are out of the space and ready to drive. In parking garages, park close to the exit and back into the space. It’s easier to drive forwards than backwards in an emergency. [24] X Research source"

[25] X Research source Always have a charged cell phone with you. Even if it is not under a service contract, you can still use it to call 911 if necessary. Just keep in mind that if you do not have a wireless provider and your call with an emergency operator gets disconnected, you will have to call back because they cannot call you."

Observe 360 degrees around you through your mirrors and windows. [27] X Research source Keep distance between your car and the one in front of you. This enables you to get around the car in front of you if it stalls or if someone suspicious approaches your car. [28] X Research source Keep about one-half of the length of your vehicle between you and the vehicle ahead of you, so that you can maneuver out if necessary. As a rule of thumb, you should be able to see the rear tires of the vehicle ahead of you."

Carjackers use a ruse called “The Bump.” They rear-end cars and steal them when the drivers get out to assess the damage and gather information. If your car gets hit from behind, only pull over and get out when you reach a safe, public place. [29] X Research source Stay inside your vehicle with the doors locked and windows shut. Signal to the other driver to follow you and drive to the nearest police or fire station. If you see that the other driver is not following you, take note of their license plate number.

If someone is flashing their lights and trying to wave you over to the side of the road, or is appearing to be injured from an accident and is soliciting your attention, don’t stop. [32] X Research source If someone was trying to signal that there is a problem with your vehicle, keep driving and pull over when you find a safe public place. If someone appeared to be injured and needed help, call the authorities or go to your nearest police or fire station to tell them what you saw."

[33] X Research source Carjackers may surveil cars returning to gating communities and trap you in before the gate opens. If you’re returning home to your own residence, wait on the street until the gate is opened if necessary, so that a car cannot pull up behind you and trap you in. [34] X Research source If you are visiting someone else’s gated community, call ahead to have the gate opened."

Don’t ignore your gut feeling if you sense that something is wrong. If you see someone standing around in the parking lot, or you merely sense something is not right, don’t proceed to your car. Return to a place where people are and ask for a security escort to walk you to your car. If that is not possible, wait for a group of people and walk with them. 92% of carjackings happen to victims who are alone. [35] X Research source Look under, around and inside your car. [36] X Research source Don’t allow children or packages to distract from your alertness. Make it a habit to look around before putting anything or anyone into the car."
