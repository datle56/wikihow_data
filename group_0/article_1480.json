      "content": "Squeeze 1-2 drops of K-Y Jelly directly onto your penis or toy. It’s best to apply the lubricant to the penis or toy because it will spread the lubricant into the vagina or anus when it’s inserted. [1] X Research source If it’s easier for you, put the K-Y Jelly onto your fingers and then apply it to your penis or toy. Just keep in mind that you’ll likely use more product this way. If you only apply the lubricant to the vagina or anus, you might experience pain from too much friction when the penis or toy slides inside where there is no lubricant. However, if pain or discomfort is a concern for the partner being penetrated, apply lube to both the penis and vagina or anus. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply the lubricant over the condom if you’re using one.",
      "content": "Apply the lubricant over the condom if you’re using one. You can use regular K-Y Jelly with condoms, and it’s best to put it on the outside of the condom itself. [3] X Research source Position the bottle over the condom and squeeze out 1-2 drops to start. You can use K-Y Jelly even if your condom is already lubricated. However, using too much lubricant may reduce your sensitivity during sex because it reduces the friction."

      "content": "Use your fingers to smooth the K-Y Jelly into a thin layer. Work the lubricant into a thin, even layer across the surface of the penis or toy. Your hand should glide over the penis or toy when the lube is applied correctly. However, it shouldn’t feel slippery or messy. If it feels slippery or messy, use a clean towel to pat away some of the excess lube. There’s no reason to be concerned about using too much because it’s fairly easy to clean up (and it’s better to accidentally use too much than to use too little). [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Add more K-Y Jelly as needed to cover the entire penis or toy. If your penis or toy still feels dry or isn’t sliding easily, put 1-2 more drops of lube onto it. Keep adding drops of lube until you feel like it slides comfortably. How much lube you need will depend on the size of the penis or toy, as well as how much natural lubrication the vagina has that day."

      "title": "Keep your lube nearby so you can add more as needed.",
      "content": "Keep your lube nearby so you can add more as needed. K-Y Jelly dries out quickly because it’s water-based. [7] X Research source This means you might need to add more lube during intercourse or masturbation. Place your lube on your bedside table or closeby. Then, apply more if you start to feel too much friction. You can also reactivate the lube by adding water or even saliva, if you prefer."

      "content": "Avoid using Yours + Mine with condoms, as it can damage them. While regular K-Y Jelly is okay to use with condoms, Yours + Mine may cause breakage or leakage. Don’t use Yours + Mine if you’re relying on rubber latex, polyisoprene, or polyurethane condoms to protect against pregnancy and STDs. [8] X Research source Since Yours + Mine doesn’t protect against pregnancy, you’ll need to use another form of protection if you don’t want to get pregnant. If you’re concerned about your STD risk, it’s best to stick with condoms and skip the Yours + Mine."

Add more lubricant if you feel like your penis isn’t evenly covered."

Then, use your fingers to coat the external part of your vagina with a thin, even layer of K-Y Jelly. It’s okay to apply more lube if you need it. To make penetration more comfortable, coat the outside of your vagina (any location you expect to be touched) as well as the inner and outer lips and clitoris."

However, it can react with topical medications that you’re applying near your genital area. If you’re using one of these medications, talk to your doctor before using K-Y Jelly.
