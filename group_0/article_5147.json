      "content": "Contact an estate agent if you know what kind of property you want to buy. Find an agent that specializes in selling whatever kind of land you're looking for, whether that's commercial land, residential land, green land (never developed), or brown land (previously developed). Typically, an agent who has an office in the area you're looking is your best option, but some agents also represent property all over the country. Look online for an agent or ask your friends and family for a recommendation. Typically, you'll get to see more properties with an agent, as they sometimes have access to unlisted properties."

Land loans tend to be riskier for banks than mortgage loans because they're less likely to recoup the money if you default. Therefore, your best option when applying for a loan is to use a local bank or credit union, as they're more likely to lend to you. Nonetheless, the process of applying for a loan is basically the same as a applying for a mortgage. [2] X Research source Make sure your credit is in order before applying. Good credit will help you get approved faster. To apply, you typically talk to your preferred bank to get pre-approved for a certain amount.

      "content": "Make an offer on the land. If seller hasn't had much interest in the land, you may be able to just make an offer and be accepted. Otherwise, you may need to compete with other buyers. One method that's used is the \"best and final offers\" method, where you and all the other buyers will essentially bid for the property, sending in higher offers as needed. With this method, you may want to start at slightly lower than your best offer, then move up as needed when other bids come in. In another method, you may be asked to send in a sealed bid. In this instance, no offers are opened until a certain date, so you can't up the offer if a better one comes in. In that case, send in your best offer the first time."
