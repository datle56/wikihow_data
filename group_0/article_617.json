      "content": "Look for gentle hydrating ingredients like aloe vera or argan oil. Use hydrating shampoos and moisturizing conditioners that are specifically designed to moisturize and nourish your hair type. Pick products containing avocado, almond, argan, olive, monoi, coconut, aloe vera, shea butter, or apricot kernel oils, and avoid anything with sulfates (which strip away moisture). When you look for shampoos, note that most products designed to hydrate dry hair will be creamy rather than clear. Layer your conditioners if you have thick, coarse hair. Use a rich conditioner in the shower, then apply a moisturizing leave-in spray. Deep moisturizing products are most helpful if you have curly, thick, or mature hair. If you have fine hair, use lighter products designed for thin hair and only moisturize the ends with conditioner."

      "content": "Hot water tends to strip your hair of natural oils when you shower. The next time you wash your hair, try turning on cold water before thoroughly rinsing it. It might take a little adjustment if you’re used to hot showers, but heat (even hot water) dehydrates hair. On the other hand, cold water seals in moisture and closes the pores on your scalp, preventing dirt from accumulating.

      "content": "Too much washing strips your hair of natural oils, resulting in dry hair. If you usually wash your hair daily, start waiting for a day or two between shampoos. On “off” days, apply a dry shampoo to refresh your hair and stop it from getting too oily too soon. Spray it close to your roots (and scalp), where hair tends to be greasiest. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Hair serum both moisturizes and protects your hair while reducing frizz. Put on the serum while your hair is still damp (but not dripping wet) after shampooing and conditioning in the shower. Warm up the hair serum in your hands for a few seconds, then work it into your hair, starting at the ends and going up to the middle of each strand. Your hair will feel shiny and smooth! Don’t apply serum too close to the roots of your hair or scalp; it might make your hair look too greasy. You can also add a dab of serum to dry, styled strands of hair to give it some extra luster."

      "content": "Leave-in conditioner keeps your hair moisturized between washes. For a quick moisturizing routine, dampen your hair with water and then work in the leave-in conditioner from the roots to the tips of your hair. Do this before you add other styling products to your hair for the day and before you heat-style your hair. Leave-in conditioner gives your hair the boost it needs to look hydrated daily.

      "content": "Oils can smooth out and rehydrate the dry ends of your hair. Squeeze a few drops of almond , argan , or olive oil for hair and rub it gently onto the ends of your hair. Then, run a brush through your hair in each spot where you applied the oil to work it thoroughly into each strand. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you have frizzy hair, you can rub the oil into the full length of your hair to smooth it out. Stay away from your scalp if possible—it already has naturally-made oils. If you have curly, dry hair, doing a weekly hot oil treatment can also really help."

Use your fingertips to massage the oil into your scalp and the hair closest to your scalp, and let it sit like that for 1 hour. This will immediately add moisture to your hair! [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source After an hour, rinse the coconut oil out of your hair with a mild shampoo, followed by a conditioner. You can give your hair this natural DIY moisturizing treatment 1 to 2 times each week. Coconut oil works best for anyone with fine to medium-texture hair.

Choose from your favorite hair mask ingredients (or use the ones you have available) and make a hair mask for yourself at home. Just like store-bought masks, you can do this once each week. Common moisturizing ingredients include banana, pumpkin seed oil, honey, shea butter, olive oil, and even raw egg! [7] X Research source Banana mask: Blend 1 ripe banana with 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of olive oil and apply the mask to your wet hair and scalp. Then, rinse it off after 15-20 minutes. Pumpkin and honey mask: Mix 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of pumpkin seed oil with 2 tablespoons (30 mL) each of honey and coconut oil. Apply it to wet hair and wait 15 to 20 minutes before rinsing. Shea butter mask: Warm up the shea butter in your hands before massaging it into your hair and scalp. Let it sit for 30 to 60 minutes, then rinse it with a mild shampoo. Raw egg mask: Blend 1 raw egg with 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of olive oil. Then, rub the mixture into your hair and scalp and cover your head with a towel. Let it sit for 30 to 60 minutes before rinsing it off."

Pour the solution into a spray bottle before spritzing it onto your hair and scalp daily (or as needed). Aloe also prevents hair damage caused by the sun’s harmful rays, so this spray is great protection outdoors. Lavender stimulates hair growth—and, of course, adding it to your homemade moisturizing spray will make your hair smell great all day!"

      "content": "Heat styling tools dry your hair out through repeated use. It’s best to avoid them altogether if you want to preserve the most moisture in your hair. If you can’t, ionic tools (including ionic hair dryers , ionic hair straighteners , and ionic hair curlers ) help water molecules penetrate deeper into your hair, rehydrating it once it’s dry. Always coat your hair with thermal protective spray before using heat tools! [9] X Research source Use low, gentle heat settings whenever possible on your heat styling tools, even if they’re ionic."

      "content": "Metal brushes can damage dry hair, causing it to lose moisture. Invest in a boar bristle brush and a wide-tooth comb if you can, and use them to detangle and style your hair. The comb makes it easier to detangle hair without tearing it (which saves moisture), while the brush distributes natural oils evenly throughout your hair. [10] X Research source Don’t brush your hair while it’s still wet, if possible. Wet hair is more delicate and tears easier than dry hair when you run a brush through it."

Experiment with different hairstyles and find ones you like. Try making braids , tying your hair up in a bun , or doing a chignon hair style .

      "content": "Ammonia and other chemicals are damaging to hair. Coloring your hair or getting perms, relaxers, and chemical smothers dries out your hair. Consider doing these rarely to avoid drying out your hair, and choose chemical-free or ammonia-free hair colors when you do—since they're less damaging to your hair. [12] X Research source Try a balayage if you like highlights but don’t want to dry out your hair with repeated coloring. This style focuses on highlighting the mid-lengths and ends of your hair and requires less-frequent retouches."
