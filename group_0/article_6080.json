      "title": "Look for symptoms of pregnancy.",
      "content": "Look for symptoms of pregnancy. Physical signs of pregnancy are hard to detect, and often only become apparent towards the end of pregnancy. Nevertheless, you may notice your guinea pig begin to eat and drink more, and their belly begin to grow — see Tell if Your Guinea Pig Is Pregnant . Do not apply pressure to the abdomen as you may cause a miscarriage. Be aware that young guinea pigs will begin to eat more as they grow anyway. Small litters do not cause the belly to enlarge significantly, and will not be as noticeable. All guinea pigs enjoy burrowing down in hay, but do not nest specifically because of pregnancy."

      "title": "Have the pregnancy diagnosed by a vet.",
      "content": "Have the pregnancy diagnosed by a vet. If you suspect your sow is pregnant, take her to the vet to make sure. The vet will feel her abdomen to check for the presence of fetuses and may use an ultrasound. The vet should be able to give an estimated due date. Feeling the abdomen needs to be done by a professional because it is easy to mistake the bladder, kidney, or even an enlarged ovary for a foetus. Rough handling may cause miscarriage. The ultrasound, is a non-invasive procedure and can confirm the pregnancy. The ultrasound will also be able to confirm how many pups there are, and how many of them are alive."

      "title": "If the pregnancy is unexpected, determine where the sow became pregnant from.",
      "content": "If the pregnancy is unexpected, determine where the sow became pregnant from. Either the sow was already pregnant when you purchased her or one of the other guinea pigs she has had contact with was a boar. Pet shops are notoriously bad for sexing guinea pigs and may have mis-sexed one of your guinea pigs. Get an experienced vet to check the sex of all your other guinea pigs. Pet stores also often house both sexes together, and some breeders do not separate the sexes early enough so it is possible the sow was already pregnant when you bought her."
    },
    {
      "title": "Determine if the sow’s age makes it a high risk pregnancy.",
      "content": "Determine if the sow’s age makes it a high risk pregnancy. Sows should be over four months old, and under seven months old for their first pregnancy. If they have been pregnant before, they should be under two years old. If your pregnant guinea pig does not meet the age requirements, talk to your vet about a pregnancy plan. For young guinea pigs, this may include supplementing her diet with Critical Care of a similar product. For older guinea pigs, this may include her carrying out her pregnancy and birth housed at the vets, as she is more likely to need intervention. This is because sows who are too young are at a greater risk of vitamin deficiencies during pregnancy. Sows who are too old are at a greater risk of the pelvis not being 'elastic' enough to expand during the birthing process"

      "title": "Determine if the sow’s body condition makes it a high risk pregnancy.",
      "content": "Determine if the sow’s body condition makes it a high risk pregnancy. Sows who are overweight are at higher risk of toxemia. If your sow was overweight before she became pregnant, discuss with your vet what her diet should be during pregnancy as this is obviously a bad time to restrict her diet."

    {
      "title": "Determine if the sow’s or boar’s breed makes the pups more vulnerable to hereditary disease.",
      "content": "Determine if the sow’s or boar’s breed makes the pups more vulnerable to hereditary disease. Dalmatian and Roan guinea pigs carry a lethal gene recessively. If one parent is of these breeds, for each pup there is a 25% chance it will be born lethal. There are other hereditary diseases that can affect guinea pigs, so where possible check the parentage of the pregnant sow and the boar who fathered the pups. If there is a likelihood any of the pups are born with this condition you must decide what action you will take. If you are not prepared to care for them yourself, a more experienced guinea pig owner may be willing to take them or you may make the decision to have them put down. Lethal guinea pigs are white in colour (not albino) are born blind, usually in both eyes, have crooked or deformed teeth, are often also deaf and often suffer from internal deformities particularly to the digestive organs. These pups may die within a few days of birth, or may live for several years. If they do survive the first week they have a shorter than normal life expectancy and will require large amounts of medical care throughout their lives."

      "title": "Pregnant guinea pigs are particularly vulnerable to illness as a result of stress during pregnancy.",
      "content": "Pregnant guinea pigs are particularly vulnerable to illness as a result of stress during pregnancy. It can be a trigger for diseases such as toxemia, or can scare the sow so she doesn’t want to eat or drink. For these reasons stress should be minimized as much as possible. Reduce exposure to loud noises or bright lights. Keep her away from direct sunlight. Establish a daily routine with set times and stick to it, to provide consistency Make any changes as early as possible in the pregnancy, when the stress will have less of an effect on the sow. Reduce handling to minimal levels. During the last two weeks of pregnancy, do not handle the sow. Instead, coax her onto a towel or into a box."

    {
      "title": "Monitor her eating and drinking habits.",
      "content": "Monitor her eating and drinking habits. It's very important to check on your guinea pig several times a day, ideally every three to four hours. Each time you check, make a mental note of how much water she has drunk and how much food she has eaten. This allows you to gauge what is normal, so that if she becomes unwell and stops eating, or becomes very thirsty, you will pick up clues early on. If the sow becomes uninterested in food contact your veterinarian immediately. The vet will assess the guinea pig’s condition. They may prescribe treatment that includes injections of dextrose solutions, steroids and calcium, which may or may not be effective. Loss of appetite can also be a symptom of pregnancy toxemia."

      "title": "Give the sow a thorough check over twice a week.",
      "content": "Give the sow a thorough check over twice a week. Check her for signs of illness (e.g. crusty eyes/nose/ears or a thinning/patchy coat) and weigh her. In the last two to three weeks of pregnancy, do not handle the sow. Instead, coax her onto a towel or into a box. The sow should gradually put on weight. How much depends on the size of the litter, but her weight should never begin fall. If you have any concerns, do not hesitate to get to a vet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Limit grooming during pregnancy.",
      "content": "Limit grooming during pregnancy. Grooming usually requires a lot of handling, so reduce to minimal levels during pregnancy. If the sow is long haired, cut all of her hair short (especially around her rear end) towards the end of the pregnancy as the sow will find it harder to clean herself and the hair may become knotted or dirty. Do not bath the sow during pregnancy. It will be too stressful for her."
    },
    {
      "title": "Continue to exercise the sow.",
      "content": "Continue to exercise the sow. Continue to allow her ‘floor time’ or to graze outside. Reduce handling by coaxing her into a box or onto a towel to move her. It is important to keep her active to prevent obesity and keep a healthy blood flow, but do not chase her or force her to exercise as pregnancy, particularly large litters, puts pressure on the circulation in guinea pigs and they are prone to heart attacks."

      "content": "Ensure you are providing adequate housing. See Properly Care for Your Guinea Pigs for what kind of housing is suitable. Ensure the temperature is consistent and do not use multi-level housing. The temperature outside or in a garage/shed usually becomes too cold at night for a pregnant guinea pig. Pregnant guinea pigs should be kept inside. Do not keep pregnant guinea pigs in multi-level cages/hutches as their balance will be impaired by pregnancy, and in the later stages of pregnancy they may not be able to get up to the higher tiers."

      "title": "Remove any boars.",
      "content": "Remove any boars. If you have multiple sows, remove the boar immediately to prevent others from becoming pregnant as well. If this is the only sow you own, the boar must be removed before the sow reaches 50 days in her pregnancy. The boar must be removed by 50 days as he may continue to mount her which can be stressful or painful in later pregnancy, and she could become pregnant again as early as two hours after the birth."

      "title": "Remove other sows if you need to.",
      "content": "Remove other sows if you need to. The pregnant sow can be kept with other companions of the same sex if she gets on with them. Guinea pigs are social animals and should be kept in groups even whilst pregnant. If there are any signs that the pregnant sow is not getting on with another guinea pig, do not hesitate to remove the other guinea pig, but leave the pregnant sow in the hutch/cage she is in. Remove any other pregnant sows. The placenta contains hormones which can trigger contractions. If the other sow eats it, their own pregnancy may be induced."

    {
      "title": "Clean the housing",
      "content": "Clean the housing regularly. Clean out soiled or damp patches every day, and the whole hutch twice a week or every three days. Only use an anti-bacterial spray if it has been specifically made for use on guinea pig housing. Keeping a clean hutch will prevent a build-up of ammonia from urine. Ammonia irritates the lungs of pigs and will predispose the pregnant mother to lung infections."

      "title": "Create a comfortable space.",
      "content": "Create a comfortable space. Spread at least 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) of bedding over the floor of your pet's hutch. The bedding should be soft fleece or grass hay. Alfalfa hay or straw will not be soft enough as bedding. You should also provide a box, like a small shoe box on its side. Place it in a sheltered part of the hutch, away from draughts. Note that she may chew the cardboard, so have extra boxes or use a wicker or thick-plastic box. Having somewhere to hide will reduce stress."

    {
      "title": "Provide extruded pelleted feed.",
      "content": "Provide extruded pelleted feed. In a pellet feed, each chunk of kibble is identical. Choosing pellets over muesli (where you can identify individual peas, corn, wheat etc.) prevents selective feeding. Do not over-feed pellets as too much can cause the guinea pig to become overweight. Read the packet for how much, but it should be no more than a few teaspoons or a dessert spoon a day. Selective feeding is where the guinea pig chooses the tastier bits of food over less tasty – but often more nutritious – foods. This causes mineral deficiency. If you are changing the feed, make a gradual change providing a bit of both to start with as otherwise she may not eat the feed at all."
    },
    {
      "title": "Provide clean water at all times.",
      "content": "Provide clean water at all times. All guinea pigs should always have access to clean water, but this is even more important when they are pregnant. Empty the water bottle and re-fill daily, to ensure the water is clean. If the water bottle is usually placed high-up, provide a second water bottle lower down so that the sow does not have to stretch if she does not want to. Clean the water bottle weekly to prevent the build-up of algae and bacteria. Wash out the water bottle with a gentle dish soap every few days."
    },
    {
      "title": "Provide quality hay.",
      "content": "Provide quality hay. Provide grass hay (timothy or orchard) with a green tinge. Supplement this with a daily dose of alfalfa hay which is higher in protein and calcium. Make sure hay is freely available at all times, and provide in a large ball the guinea pig can burrow in. Alfalfa hay is great for pregnant, nursing and young guinea pigs but the calcium content is too high for normal guinea pigs as a build-up of calcium can cause bladder stones."
    },
    {
      "title": "Offer fresh vegetables every day.",
      "content": "Offer fresh vegetables every day. All guinea pigs should be given at least one cup of fresh vegetables a day, but as the pregnant sow begins to eat more you can increase this to 1½ to 2 cups a day. Never offer the same vegetable two days running. This prevents an excess of one particular mineral that might be contained in that vegetable. For example, carrots contain lots of oxalate. If your pet has too much of this, it can build up in urine and cause bladder stones."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ensure you’re providing enough vitamins and minerals.",
      "content": "Ensure you’re providing enough vitamins and minerals. Pregnant guinea pigs are vulnerable to vitamin C deficiency and calcium deficiency. Ensure you are providing enough of these by using a supplement such as Oxbow Natural Science Vitamin C or a similar product. Never provide a multi-vitamin. Excess vitamin C is passed in the urine so can’t be over-dosed, but other vitamins can build up and create problems. Do not rely on foods that list added Vitamin C as an ingredient. Vitamin C is highly unstable and breaks down within 8 weeks of the manufacturing date. If the food has been stored for a while at the retail outlet, the chances are the vitamin C content is already negligible by the time you open the bag. Never use a water-soluble tablet. They become ineffective quickly and may put the sow off the water, leading to dehydration which could be fatal during pregnancy."

      "title": "Increase the amount of fruit you provide in the last 4weeks of pregnancy.",
      "content": "Increase the amount of fruit you provide in the last 4weeks of pregnancy. Give a small cube of fruit such as apple, strawberry or seedless grape every 3 days. Fruits should usually be given sparingly to guinea pigs because the acid can give them mouth ulcers. However, toxemia is in part a lack of sugar, so keeping sugar levels high is important."

Post the number on a piece of paper next to the guinea pig’s hutch/cage. If you need it, you don’t want to have to hunt around for it. Phone number for the out-of-hours vet. If there is not an out-of-hours vet in your area, discuss this with your vet to come up with a plan. They may be willing to attend themselves, or you may have to contact an experienced breeder .

Whilst most births occur during the day they can happen at night so check on the sow during the night as well. If you cannot check on the sow because of work etc. ask a friend or neighbour to check on her. A local breeder may also be willing to help."

Occasionally, with large litters, if the pups emerge too quickly, the mother will not have time to break the amniotic sac herself. In these cases, and only if you are sure the mother will not do it herself, carefully pick up the pup with a clean towel and remove the sac yourself, clearing any fluid from the face. Do not use your fingers or nails as you could accidentally scratch the pup’s eyes. Whilst a pup becoming stuck in the birth canal or born breech is common, never intervene yourself.
