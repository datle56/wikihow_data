This can be easily checked in the Story options and stats , so be sure to avoid tapping any Stories if you want to remain undetected. If it has been over 48 hours since the Highlight was posted, you can watch it freely without notifying the user. Reels can be watched without being detected; just be sure you don't like the video. There are ways to view Instagram stories and Highlights anonymously, such as using an alternate account."
