      "title": "Choose a brush or comb.",
      "content": "Choose a brush or comb. For very tangled hair, use a wide-toothed comb. For regular upkeep of wavy hair or soft curls, use a paddle brush. Paddle brushes are flat, usually square, and usually have more bristles. This provides a larger surface area to run your hair through as you try to untangle it. The bristle material also makes a difference: Boar bristles are a strong, natural material good for taming thick hair. Nylon bristles are softer and slide more easily, good for fine or fragile hair. More cushioning on the brush gives more flexibility but less pull. Some flexibility is good to avoid tugging, but keep the cushioning low if you have thick hair."

      "content": "Wet hair as a last resort. When your hair is wet, it is at its weakest. The cuticles (outer hair walls) are expanded, soft, and full of water. However, combing wet hair is less painful on the scalp, and may make it easier to untangle. Brush very gently, to avoid breaking the hair. [9] X Research source When combing wet hair, a wide-toothed comb is safer than a brush. Progress to more and more narrow combs to get rid of smaller tangles."
