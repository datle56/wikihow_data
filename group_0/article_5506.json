      "content": "Create a five column data table. Any statistical work is generally made easier by having your data in a concise format. A simple table serves this purpose very well. To calculate the standard error of estimate, you will be using five different measurements or calculations. Therefore, creating a five-column table is helpful. Label the five columns as follows: [1] X Research source x {\\displaystyle x} y {\\displaystyle y} y ′ {\\displaystyle y^{\\prime }} y − y ′ {\\displaystyle y-y^{\\prime }} ( y − y ′ ) 2 {\\displaystyle (y-y^{\\prime })^{2}} Note that the table shown in the image above performs the opposite subtractions, y ′ − y {\\displaystyle y^{\\prime }-y} . The more standard order, however, is y − y ′ {\\displaystyle y-y^{\\prime }} . Because the values in the final column are squared, the negative is not problematic and will not change the outcome. Nevertheless, you should recognize that the more standard calculation is y − y ′ {\\displaystyle y-y^{\\prime }} ."

Enter these values into the first two columns of your data table. [2] X Research source The order of the data and the pairing is important for these calculations. You need to be careful to keep your paired data points together in order. For the sample calculations shown above, the data pairs are as follows: (1,2) (2,4) (3,5) (4,4) (5,5)"

The calculation is tedious but can be done by hand. Alternatively, you can use a handheld graphing calculator or some online programs that will quickly calculate a best fit line using your data. [3] X Research source For this article, it is assumed that you will have the regression line equation available or that it has been predicted by some prior means. For the sample data set in the image above, the regression line is y ′ = 0.6 x + 2.2 {\\displaystyle y^{\\prime }=0.6x+2.2} ."

The statistical value known as the sum of squared errors (SSE) is a useful step in finding standard deviation, variance and other measurements. To find the SSE from your data table, add the values in the fifth column of your data table.

It is generally represented with the Greek letter σ {\\displaystyle \\sigma } . Therefore, the first calculation is to divide the SSE score by the number of measured data points. Then, find the square root of that result. [8] X Research source If the measured data represents an entire population, then you will find the average by dividing by N, the number of data points. However, if you are working with a smaller sample set of the population, then substitute N-2 in the denominator. For the sample data set in this article, we can assume that it is a sample set and not a population, just because there are only 5 data values. Therefore, calculate the Standard Error of the Estimate as follows: σ = 2.4 5 − 2 {\\displaystyle \\sigma ={\\sqrt {\\frac {2.4}{5-2}}}} σ = 2.4 3 {\\displaystyle \\sigma ={\\sqrt {\\frac {2.4}{3}}}} σ = 0.8 {\\displaystyle \\sigma ={\\sqrt {0.8}}} σ = 0.894 {\\displaystyle \\sigma =0.894}"

The Standard Error of the Estimate is a statistical figure that tells you how well your measured data relates to a theoretical straight line, the line of regression. A score of 0 would mean a perfect match, that every measured data point fell directly on the line. Widely scattered data will have a much higher score. [9] X Research source With this small sample set, the standard error score of 0.894 is quite low and represents well organized data results."
