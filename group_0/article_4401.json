      "title": "Consider your mental health.",
      "content": "Consider your mental health. Information about Autism Speaks' history is deeply disturbing. If you have disabilities such as anxiety, depression, PTSD, or other mental health conditions, reading about AS may trigger a downward spiral. If you are prone to this, proceed with caution. Autistic people with self-esteem issues should especially be mindful. Reading what Autism Speaks has to say may worsen your self-image. Have a self care plan in case your mental health issues are triggered. This could be a warm bath, a good book, time with a loved one, making art, or something else. Do not research right before bedtime."

When searching \"Autism Speaks,\" add keywords such as \"controversy,\" \"bad,\" \"eugenics,\" or \"ASAN\" (an organization that has written about Autism Speaks). It might also be worth noting that boycotters of Autism Speaks sometimes refer to it as 'Autism $peaks', with a dollar sign replacing the S."

Some discuss severe ableism, child abuse, torture, murder, murder sympathizers, eugenics, and other disturbing content. If you are a sensitive person, pause and consider whether you are able to handle it at the moment. Autism Speaks does not use trigger warnings on its own disturbing materials. Be cautious if you visit the site or read about what it says. The Judge Rotenberg Center, other abuses in ABA therapy , and restraint/seclusion may be especially upsetting.

Keep blue puzzle pieces out. Avoid showing or telling them the worst of what you've learned about AS. This can help keep them from absorbing attitudes from it. If they ask, give an age-appropriate explanation. For example, \"That's a group that bullies people, so I don't want to watch that ad, because it's not true.\" Teens or adults may wish to get involved. If they're autistic, consider whether their self-esteem is strong enough. Supervise their participation if you have concerns about them being exposed to something too disturbing.

Let someone with more patience or spoons handle it, or deal with it later once you feel ready. Be polite and firm with mean people.

Use scripts like \"I need some air,\" \"This conversation is bad for my mental health, so I'm ending it,\" \"Don't talk to me anymore,\" or \"You've violated this site's comment policy, and if you don't stop it, you will be banned.\" Remember, if someone is determined not to change their mind, you talking to them won't help anyone.

They might treat you, and others, like dirt. It's normal and okay to get upset about this. Treat your feelings as real and valid. Walk away if you get too upset.

If you see an autistic person feeling bad about themselves, say a few encouraging words or drop them a kind note. Boycotting Autism Speaks is a movement focused on supporting autistics. Reach out, accept them as they are, and show them that you care. Autistic advocates may have trouble reading their own emotions. If you noticed that they are becoming over-stressed with activism, gently suggest a break to stim or do something fun. Look out for the autistic people in your life, at all ages. Even if young children are kept away from Autism Speaks, they may still absorb negative attitudes about autism from the people around them. Remind them that you love and value them."
