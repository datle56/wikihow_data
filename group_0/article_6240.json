Tunnels will lead away from the molehill, so feel for grass areas extending away from the molehill that are softer to the touch or step. Moles like to dig their tunnels along structures like fences or other barriers, so look around any such structures in your yard to find their tunnels."

Before you place the trap in the exposed section, pack down the dirt at the bottom of the tunnel so the mole can't dig underneath the trap. You should also loosely cover the tunnel back up with dirt, so the mole will continue to dig through the loose dirt, and get captured by the trap.

      "title": "Set a trap.",
      "content": "Set a trap. There are many kinds of mole catching traps out there. Most of the traps vary in the way they capture the mole, but nearly all are lethal. There are scissor jaw traps, harpoon traps, and choker loop traps just to name a few. Read the trap instructions very carefully to figure out the best way to set the device. Change the settings on your chosen trap to make the trigger apparatus really sensitive. Once you know how to open and set the trap, place the trap into the cut out section of tunnel. [4] X Research source For a scissor trap , place the jaws around loosely packed dirt in the middle of the tunnel. Leave the area between the jaws open and clear. The jaws should span across the runway of the tunnel and be pushed into the ground about 1 inch (2.5 cm) down. Cock the trap according to the included instructions. For a harpoon trap , set and straddle the trap over the runway of the mole tunnel with both legs of the trap pushed down into the ground on each side of the tunnel. Gently push the legs of the trap into the ground, positioning the trigger pan (the square, flat piece of metal) just above the soil. Pull up the setting tee to set the trap. For a choker loop trap , use a garden tool to dig a hole into the tunnel from the top. Dig the hole a tad deeper than the actual depth of the tunnel, but the same width as the tunnel. Place the loop into the tunnel so it follows the exact direction and angle of the tunnel. Pack the open area of the trap (in front of the loop) firmly with soil, so the mole will continue to dig through the tunnel and get caught in the trap."

If you have not caught a mole after two days, try moving your trap to a new area. There are many reasons a trap can fail (changed burrowing habits, too much tunnel disturbance, improperly set trap), but you will have to find out through trial and error, and consider setting your trap in a new location."

      "title": "Find a new tunnel or mound.",
      "content": "Find a new tunnel or mound. A new tunnel or mound will most likely have a mole digging through rather frequently. You can spot newer mounds by finding fresh, piles of dirt on your property. Consequently, tunnels will lead away from the mound, so feel for softer grass areas extending away from the mound. Check on the tunnel or mound frequently during the early morning or evening to see if you notice any movement just underneath the surface of the soil. [7] X Research source Moles tend to do most of their digging during the early morning and evening, so this is the best time to look out for them."

      "title": "Approach the tunnel or mound.",
      "content": "Approach the tunnel or mound. Wait and watch the tunnel or mound to see movement as the mole digs through. When you see movements, approach the tunnel or mound very slowly so as not to alert the mole. Be sure you are wearing protective gloves before attempting this method. You will have to handle the mole with your hands, and don't want the mole to bite you."

      "content": "Spade the mole out of the ground. Strike a spade or shovel deep into the ground (about 6 to 8 inches or 15 to 20 centimeters deep) behind the mole. Striking the spade or shovel behind the mole will prevent it from escaping as you try to remove them from the ground. When you have successfully spaded the mole out of the ground, quickly grab the mole with your hands and place it in a bucket for disposal later. Do not let the mole burrow it's way back into the ground after you have spaded it from the dirt. [8] X Research source This can be a humane way to remove moles from your yard, but it can leave large holes and divots in your grass. However, there's also the chance that you may accidentally miss the dirt surrounding the mole, and injure the animal."

You want to trick the mole into thinking that it is going to be flooded out of its tunnels, and have it escape some other way. [9] X Research source"

You will have to be ready at other nearby molehills to grab the moles as they try to escape, and place them in a bucket for later disposal. A bucket provides a safe area to contain the mole and ensure that it doesn't escape and dig back into your lawn. Be sure to wear protective gloves when handling moles; their sharp teeth can pierce through skin."
