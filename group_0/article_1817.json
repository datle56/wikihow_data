If your crush has a hobby that you're unfamiliar with, if you make an effort to learn about it and show interest in it, it could make your crush like you more. Be genuine about your interests. Your crush may be able to tell if you're pretending to like something and it could turn them away."

Texting or messaging your crush funny and flirtatious texts and memes demonstrate that you understand their interests and sense of humor. If your crush responds with texts or memes that show that they understand your humor and what you're into, it's a great sign that they may like you. [6] X Research source For example, if your crush is super into dinosaurs, you could send them a funny dinosaur meme. You could send heart emojis or other cute graphics and see if they respond with similar emojis that would hint that they may like you.

If you're going to tell your crush about the feelings you have for them, it will definitely be easier to do if you guys have some time alone away from both of your groups of friends. By their locker after school is a great place if most people have gone for the day, or maybe in the parking lot before they go home after school. During or after a school dance is also a good location to ask them. The dark lighting and loud music can help provide you with a little bit of privacy, even if other people are around. Don't ask them before a test or early in the day because they may be stressed out and you don't want to distract them and ruin your chances."
