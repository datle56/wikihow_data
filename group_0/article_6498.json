If you're traveling and want to watch movies or shows available through your Amazon Prime subscription, you may find that some titles available in your home country may not be watchable in foreign countries. To fix this, you'll need to make Amazon think you're watching from an IP address in your home country. There are many VPN services to choose from, and many even have free trials. Some of the most popular and reputable options with servers in many countries are Mullvad, ProtonVPN, SurfShark, and Windscribe. Once you've selected a VPN, create your account and follow the service's instructions for installation and setup. You can then connect to the VPN in the selected country and stream your favorite shows and movies from home. Using a VPN to watch Prime Video in a different country may violate Amazon's terms of service and copyright laws. While you are connected to a VPN using a server in another country, you're effectively changing your location in your web browser and for other apps. This means every website you visit or app you use will think you're in your home country while the VPN is on."
