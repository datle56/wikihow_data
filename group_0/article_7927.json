      "content": "Wipe with a slightly damp cloth as a last resort. This is only recommended on glossy paperback covers and waterproof dust jackets. Do not use this method for valuable antique books. You can also try this on especially stubborn dirt if you accept the risk of further damage. Here's how to minimize this risk: Take a cloth made from microfiber or another lint-free material. Rinse the cloth with hot water, then wring it out thoroughly. Wrap a dry towel around the cloth and wring it out again. Remove the cloth, which is now only slightly damp. Carefully wipe away dirt from the cover and very lightly from the page edges. Buff with a dry cloth immediately afterward."

      "content": "Dry water-damaged books slowly and carefully. Use an airing cupboard or place the damaged book next to a radiator or a sunny window. Open the book to allow the air to circulate and gently turn over a few pages regularly to prevent sticking. Once dry, press beneath several heavy books or use a warm iron to flatten pages and restore the appearance. Don't be tempted to use a hair dryer, oven, or fan. This can easily damage pages and loosen them from the spine. Try drying out a book by standing it on its end and fanning the pages or soaking up moisture by placing paper towels between them. When flattening pages with an iron, place the page on a firm, flat surface and make sure the steam setting is off and the temperature is low to prevent additional damage."
