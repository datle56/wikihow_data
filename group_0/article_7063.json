      "title": "Check the fender and bumper for cracks.",
      "content": "Check the fender and bumper for cracks. Examine both ends of the vehicle and look for any cracks or patched areas. Fenders and bumpers break easily in a collision because they are often made of lightweight or plastic composite material. Run your hands along the vehicle to check for dents, cracks, or other damage. [1] X Research source Breakage or repairs to the fender or bumper is a good indicator of further car accident damage."

      "title": "Assess the car's body lines to check for replacement parts.",
      "content": "Assess the car's body lines to check for replacement parts. Crouch down so you're eye level with the body of the car. Look along the main line down the side of the car's body. This line should be straight and even and the car's paint should reflect normally. An uneven line or distorted reflection indicates that body panels of the car have been replaced or hammered out due to body damage. [2] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source While different panels don't necessarily mean that the car is in bad shape, it does let you know that the car has been worked on before. The more a car has been worked on, the lower its price should be."

      "title": "Examine panel and door gaps to see if they fit together.",
      "content": "Examine panel and door gaps to see if they fit together. Look at the gaps between each door and the adjoining body panel. The gaps should be straight and have an even width from top to bottom. A car that has had auto accident damage will have uneven gaps due to misalignment or replaced panels or doors. [3] X Research source The hood, doors, and trunk should all be flush with the other panels when closed. If they are not, that means there was some body repair to the car."

      "title": "See if the car has been repainted.",
      "content": "See if the car has been repainted. Look closely along the edges of the car's doors and body panels for any nicks, scratches or uneven paint areas. Signs of a different color paint underneath could mean that the car has been repainted after an accident or that a door or panel was replaced and repainted to match the rest of the car. [4] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Fresh paint might have a different texture than an older paint job. Signs of sanding during repair might also be visible through paint, so look for sanded areas when you inspect the paint."

      "title": "Inspect the underbody of the car to check for damage.",
      "content": "Inspect the underbody of the car to check for damage. Take a flashlight and slide yourself underneath the car to inspect the undercarriage for damage. Shine the light on every part of the underside of the car, checking for rust, excessive salt buildup, or a bent chassis. [5] X Research source Run your hands along the underside of the car to feel for rust and dents."

      "title": "Have a mechanic check the car before you buy it.",
      "content": "Have a mechanic check the car before you buy it. It's possible that a VIN report comes back clean but the car itself has been repaired at some point. If this is the case, it's most likely because the repair was self-paid instead of paid in part through an insurance company. Go to your local mechanic and ask for a full body inspection. The mechanic will inspect the exhaust systems, brakes, steering and suspension, and other important systems in the car. [6] X Research source This might cost between $150 and $250. While a vehicle history report is incredibly useful, it should not be the only thing you use to make your decision on buying a used car. A combination of a report, a self-inspection, and a professional inspection is your best bet for making an intelligent purchase."

      "title": "Obtain the car's Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).",
      "content": "Obtain the car's Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). Use the car's vehicle identification number to see if it was ever wrecked, stolen, flood-damaged, or recalled. A VIN has 17 characters and is made up of both numbers and capital letters. The VIN is located on the dashboard of the driver's side of the car. You can view it by standing outside the vehicle and looking at the driver's side corner of the dashboard where it meets the windshield. You will use that number to search the car's history on various websites. [7] X Research source If you can't find the VIN on the dashboard, open the door on the driver's side and look where the door latches when it's closed. The VIN number should be displayed here. If the VIN is fewer than 17 characters, the used car was made before 1981 and the information on the car will be limited."

[10] X Research source While iSeeCars gives you a vehicle history report for free, it doesn't have nearly the information that AutoCheck and CarFax reports do.
