      "title": "Pat the eel dry using paper towels.",
      "content": "Pat the eel dry using paper towels. In case there is any residual blood or water within the eel’s body cavity, use 1 or 2 paper towels to dry out the inside of the eel. Throw these paper towels away immediately."

      "title": "Rub 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of salt over the eel.",
      "content": "Rub 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of salt over the eel. Use your hands to massage the salt over the eel’s flesh. Fully coat both the outside and the inside of the eel with salt. Modify this measurement for the number of eels you’re roasting. So, if you’re preparing 3 eels, you’ll need 3 teaspoons (15 ml) of salt total."

      "title": "Place the eel into a cast iron skillet.",
      "content": "Place the eel into a cast iron skillet. Drizzle with 3 teaspoons (15 mL) of vegetable oil. If you don’t have vegetable oil, olive oil makes a suitable replacement. Alternatively, if you have a roasting pan, you can place the eel in this to roast."

      "title": "Put the skillet in the oven and roast the eel for 25-30 minutes.",
      "content": "Put the skillet in the oven and roast the eel for 25-30 minutes. When the eel is cooked, the skin will be browned and ready to eat. Once 25 minutes have passed, keep a close watch on the eel to ensure that it doesn’t begin to blacken and burn."

      "title": "Serve the roast eel immediately.",
      "content": "Serve the roast eel immediately. Top the eel with lemon, salt and pepper, and any other sauce or garnish that you enjoy. Place leftovers into an airtight container and store in the refrigerator. The eel should keep for 3 or 4 days."

      "title": "Prepare a brine",
      "content": "Prepare a brine to soak the eel. Combine 1 quart (0.95 L) of water with 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of salt. Make the brine in a large bowl or Tupperware container. Once you’ve made the basic brine, add whatever herbs you’d like to flavor the eel. Appropriate herbs include oregano, rosemary, or parsley. For additional flavor, add a squeeze of lemon juice to the brine. Add this to taste."

      "content": "Soak the eel in brine overnight in your fridge. Fully submerge the eel in the container of brine and place it in the refrigerator. Let it soak undisturbed for a night. If you soak the eel during the day instead, make sure that it soaks in brine for a full 8-10 hours."

      "title": "Lay the eel filets belly-up on the smoking rack if you can’t hang the filets.",
      "content": "Lay the eel filets belly-up on the smoking rack if you can’t hang the filets. If your smoker doesn’t have the capability to hang meat for smoking, lay your eel filets flat instead. Positioning them with the belly side up will allow the tender interior of the filet to cook through. To make sure that the back and sides of the filets cook as well, try placing the eel on a baking sheet."

      "title": "Serve the filets immediately.",
      "content": "Serve the filets immediately. Since the filets will have been smoking at a relatively low temperature, they won’t need to cool before you can begin to eat them. Store leftover smoked eel in an airtight bag or plastic container in your refrigerator. It will keep for 3-4 days."

      "title": "Fry the eels over low heat for 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Fry the eels over low heat for 10 minutes. Since eel is a delicate meat, high heat will cause the filet pieces to burn. To keep the heat low, set the burner to 3 or 4. Place the floured eel pieces into the oil, and use a fork or tongs to turn them over every 2 or 3 minutes. Remember to replace the lid on the skillet after every time you flip the eel pieces. The eel will be cooked through inside after 10 minutes."

    {
      "title": "Place the fried eels on paper towels to cool.",
      "content": "Place the fried eels on paper towels to cool. Paper towels will absorb extra peanut oil that may still be on the eel pieces. Let them cool for about 5 minutes. Once the eels have cooled, sprinkle them to taste with salt and serve immediately. Store leftover fried eel in an airtight plastic container. Keep it chilled in your refrigerator. You can also make eel sauce. Use eel carcass or bones to make the broth. Add soy sauce, mirin, and sugar. Then cook it to make a concentrated sauce."
