      "content": "Learn to breastfeed before your baby arrives. While you and your baby will learn a lot about breastfeeding together, it's helpful to learn as much as you can in advance. Talk to other people in your family who may have breastfed and the wider community to get support. If you don't know many other people who have breastfed, don't let that stop you. There are many resources-both online and locally-that can help you.

You can find classes online or ask your medical provider or hospital for more information. Talk to other people in your life about breastfeeding, so they understand the health benefits, know what to expect, and can learn how to support you."

      "content": "Set up a nursing area. Create a space in your home where you can quietly and comfortably breastfeed your baby. Consider whether you'd prefer to nurse in a large chair, recliner, or sofa. If you can, set up the breastfeeding space near your baby's crib or bassinet, so you can feed and return the baby to the crib or bassinet, especially in the middle of the night. Stock your breastfeeding station with: [4] X Research source Breast pads and lanolin-based nipple cream Changes of clothes for the baby and a clean shirt for you Blankets and pillows Burp cloths Unscented baby wipes Healthy drinks such as water and unsweetened fruit juice.

      "content": "Talk to your employer about your rights as a breastfeeding parent. If you work away from your home and choose to pump breast milk, you will want to make arrangements to pump milk while at work. US Federal Law mandates that all employers provide both a time and space for breastfeeding parents to pump milk while at work. Many other countries have similar laws. Research your rights before approaching your employer. Try to discuss the issue as far in advance as possible, so your employer will have time to make the necessary accommodations."

      "content": "Get comfortable clothes for nursing. Since you'll be breastfeeding often in the first weeks and months of your baby's life, you'll need to wear clothes that allow you to comfortably access your breasts. Purchase nursing bras, tanks, or comfortable button-down shirts. Keep in mind that skin to skin contact can encourage your baby to breastfeed. You can also look for wrap-around dresses or cross-over tops. It's also possible to tailor regular bras to create nursing bras. The retailer, Nordstrom, offers this service for a small fee to people who buy a bra at their location."

      "content": "Eat a healthy diet. Your baby is relying on you for nutrition, and your body has to sustain another person, so it's important for you to eat a balanced diet . You'll need about 500 extra calories a day while your body is making milk. Eat a diet rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, protein, and healthy fats to maximize your intake of vitamins and minerals. [6] X Research source Remember to keep taking your prenatal vitamins as long as you're breastfeeding.

Breastfeeding provides infants with the best nutrition possible, but recent studies have shown that breastfeeding babies would benefit from vitamin D supplement. It's recommended that infants receive a daily intake of 400 IU of vitamin D. Talk to your doctor about administering vitamin D drops to your infant. Most vitamin D supplements can be purchased over the counter at grocery stores. Make sure you are selecting the appropriate dose and only give infants the liquid-based form. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Stay hydrated. Plan on drinking water at regular intervals throughout the day and don't wait until you feel thirsty. Since staying hydrated can be difficult when you're busy caring for the baby, keep drinks nearby and drink throughout the day. A good way to ensure that you drink enough is to connect your water drinking to a task-such as drinking half a glass every time you nurse or change a diaper. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Drink primarily water, milk, decaffeinated teas, or juices-preferably juices with no added sugar. While you can have a little caffeine every day (about 300 mg or 1 to 2 cups of coffee, or 2 to 4 ounces of espresso), you should limit your intake while breastfeeding because caffeine can be passed to your baby through your breast milk. [9] X Research source If you notice that your baby is irritated after you drink caffeine and breastfeed, try having your coffee after breastfeeding and then waiting 4 hours to breastfeed again.

While you can have a drink or 2 a week while you're breastfeeding, you should plan on having the drink 2 to 3 hours before you breastfeed. A single (25 mL) shot of spirits (25 mL), an 8-ounce glass of beer, or a small (125 mL) glass of wine each count as one drink.

In some cases, your doctor may be able to recommend different medications that are safe to take while breastfeeding. [13] X Research source Remember to ask your doctor about herbal supplements too.

Although your milk won't come in for several days, your body will produce a small amount of nutritious milk called colostrum. [19] X Research source Let your newborn breastfeed as long as they want to on one breast before you encourage the baby to breastfeed from the other breast. Try to alternate which breast you begin feeding from when you start a new breastfeeding session. This will establish a good milk supply and prevent engorgement in the early weeks of breastfeeding."

Try to burp your baby in one of these ways: Lift your baby toward your shoulder, with your hand on their head and neck for support. The baby should be facing the area behind you. Rub your baby's back with a firm and open hand to release the trapped air. Sit your baby on your lap and lean them forward. Support their chest with the base of your hand, and their chin and neck with your fingers. Massage their stomach with your front hand and gently pat their back with your other hand. Lay your baby on your lap with their head raised higher than their stomach. Gently pat the baby's back until they burp."

      "content": "Pay attention to how often your newborn breastfeeds. A newborn baby will mostly alternate breastfeeding with sleeping. If your baby goes a long time without breastfeeding very much, you might need to wake them up every 2 or 3 hours to nurse. If your newborn baby is making 5 to 6 wet disposable diapers or 6 to 8 wet cloth diapers a day, they're getting enough breast milk. If you need to wake your baby to breastfeed, change their diaper first. This will wake the baby so they're alert and ready to breastfeed."

If you're worried that your baby will bite you, keep in mind that if your baby is actively nursing, they can't bite you. To prevent biting in a teething baby, take your baby off of the breast if they lose interest in nursing, begin to fall asleep, start to fidget, or tense their jaw. [21] X Research source Babies cut teeth at different ages, but generally you can expect your baby to begin teething around 6 months old."

Your baby may suddenly seem squirmy or wiggly while they're eating. To help your baby focus on breastfeeding, breastfeed in a quiet space that's free from distractions. Consider wearing a breastfeeding necklace that has large, textured beads for your baby to focus on while they nurse. [22] X Research source If your baby continues to wiggle to the point that you can't successfully breastfeed, stop the breastfeeding session.

      "title": "Prepare for nursing strikes.",
      "content": "Prepare for nursing strikes. Occasionally, older babies will refuse to breastfeed for a few days. This break, or nursing strike, can be caused by teething, illness, low milk supply, or separation anxiety. During a nursing strike, you should pump to maintain your milk supply, try to breastfeed frequently, try different breastfeeding positions, and breastfeed when your baby is drowsy and relaxed. If your baby doesn't breastfeed for more than 2 days, contact the baby's doctor. The doctor can check for an underlying medical condition that might be making nursing uncomfortable."
