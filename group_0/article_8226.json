Use 2/3 cups (185 g) for a long-term supply or a teaspoon (4.93 g) for a one-time test. Add water drop by drop and mix thoroughly until the baking soda becomes a paste. It's best to avoid toothpaste for this method. Even toothpastes formulated for sensitive teeth can cause abrasions on flexible plastic. Abrasions provide hiding places for bacteria that can lead to oral infections. [7] X Research source"
