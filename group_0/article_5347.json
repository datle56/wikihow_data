A company has two ways to raise money to run the business. They can issue stock or bonds. Companies issue common stock by selling ownership in the business. When you buy stock, you are an owner (investor) in the business. Your shares of stock represent a small percentage of ownership in the company. [1] X Research source A bond represents a company debt. Investors who buy bonds are considered business creditors. The bond owner receives interest income on the bond investment, usually twice a year. The original amount invested is returned to the bond investor on the maturity date. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider how a business becomes profitable. Intrinsic value is based on the ability of a business to generate cash flow into the company and earn a profit. When a company’s revenue (or sales) are higher than their expenses, the firm generates earnings. [3] X Research source For this discussion, you can think of earnings and profit as the same thing. Companies must use cash to buy inventory, make payroll and advertise. That type of spending is considered a cash outflow. When customers pay for a product or service, the business has a cash inflow. The ability to generate more cash inflows than outflows over time indicates a valuable company."

A stock investor is interested in seeing the value of stock increase over time or in receiving a share of the earnings in the form of dividends. The intrinsic value formulas make assumptions about an investor’s required rate of return You can think of this return as the investor’s minimum expectation. If the investment cannot meet the expectation, it’s assumed that an investor would not invest. [4] X Research source"

This model also factors in a projected growth rate of the dividend. Dividends are discounted to their present value using a discount rate. If the dividend discount model values the stock at a higher price than the current market value, the stock’s price is considered to be undervalued. The DDM formula is (Dividend per share)/ (Discount rate – Dividend growth rate). [5] X Research source"

If a company’s earnings are expected to grow, an analyst may also assume that the dividends paid to shareholders may grow. You should assume a growth rate for the DDM formula. [6] X Research source Say, for example, that your company has earnings for the year of $1,000,000. You decide to pay $500,000 to shareholders in the form of a dividend. If your firm had 500,000 shares of common stock outstanding, you would pay a $1 dividend on each share of stock. Assume that the company earns $2,000,000 in the following year. The firm may decide to pay a larger dollar amount as a dividend- say $1,000,000. If the number of common stock shares is still 500,000, each share of stock would receive a $2 dividend."

Discounting payments to the current day allows the analyst to make a “apples to apples” comparison of cash flows from different periods of time. [7] X Research source Remember that, for this formula, the discount rate is the rate of return required by the investor. It should take into account the stability of the dividend payment. For example, if the dividend payment is erratic, the discount rate should be higher. Assume that you expect to receive a $100 payment in five years. Assume also that the discount rate each year will be 3%. [8] X Research source You can use a present value table to determine the present value factor for $100 received in 5 years, at a discount rate of 3%. The factor is .86261 (Other tables or calculators may be slightly different, due to rounding). [9] X Research source The present value of the payment is ($100 multiplied by .86261 = $86.26)."

Assume a 12% discount rate. Assume a 4% percentage rate of dividend growth each year. The DDM formula is ($4 / (12% - 4%) = $50). If the current market price of the stock is less than $50 per share, the formula indicates that the stock price is undervalued. In other words, the intrinsic value of the stock is higher than the stock’s current price."

[13] X Research source For example, suppose a company will earn $1.00 per share forever, and the company also pays out all of this as dividends, $1.00 per share. The equity capital invested (book value) is $6.00 per share. Because the earnings and dividends will offset each other, the future book value of the stock will always stay at $6.00. The required rate of return on equity (or the percent cost of equity) is 10 percent. Calculate the annual residual income with the formula R I t = E t − r B t − 1 {\\displaystyle RI_{t}=E_{t}-rB_{t-1}} , where R I t {\\displaystyle RI_{t}} = residual income in future periods; r {\\displaystyle r} = required rate of return on equity, E t {\\displaystyle E_{t}} = net income during period t {\\displaystyle t} . If the net income is $1.00 per year, the book value is always $6.00 and the required return is 10 percent, the annual residual income is $ 1.00 − .10 ( $ 6.00 ) = $ 1.00 − $ .60 = $ .40 {\\displaystyle \\$1.00-.10(\\$6.00)=\\$1.00-\\$.60=\\$.40} The present value of future residual income is R I t / r = $ .40 / .10 = $ 4.00 {\\displaystyle RI_{t}/r=\\$.40/.10=\\$4.00} The intrinsic value is the current book value plus the present value of future residual income. The equation is $ 6.00 + $ 4.00 = $ 10.00 {\\displaystyle \\$6.00+\\$4.00=\\$10.00} . The intrinsic value is $10.00"

Operating cash flow is the cash inflows and outflows from your day-to-day business. That includes buying inventory, making payroll and collecting cash from customers. [15] X Research source A capital expenditure represents your spending on fixed assets, such as machinery and equipment. Think about the assets you will use in your business over a period of years. Successful companies are able to generate most of their cash from operations. If you manufacture and sell denim jeans, for example, selling jeans should be your primary sources of cash. If you have free cash flow, you have the flexibility to spend cash on areas that can grow your sales and earnings. If a competitor’s business was up for sale, for example, a firm could use their free cash flow to buy the operation and expand the company."

If you issue stock to investors, they will expect some rate of return on their equity investment. Bond investors want an interest rate paid on their bond investment. [16] X Research source Issuing bonds (debt) and stock (equity) comes with a cost. We refer to that cost as the cost of capital. If the profit you expect to generate on a project is more than the cost of capital, it makes financial sense to raise capital for a project. The discounted cash flow method uses WACC in the formula."
