Both numerators then go on top."

What are the denominators? 3 and 4. To find the lowest common denominator of the two, you can do this one of three ways: Write out the multiples . The multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18...and so on. The multiples of 4? 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, etc. What's the lowest number seen in both of the sets? 12! That's your lowest common denominator, or LCD. Prime factorization . If you know what factors are, you can do prime factorization. That's finding out what numbers can make your denominators. For 3, the factors are 3 and 1. For 4, the factors are 2 and 2. Then, you multiply them together. 3 x 2 x 2 = 12. Your LCD! Multiply the numbers together for small numbers. In some cases, like this one, you could just multiply the numbers together – 3 x 4 = 12. However, if your denominators are big, don't do this! You don't want to multiply 56 x 44 and have to work with 2,464 as your answer!"

      "content": "Multiply the denominator by the number needed to get the LCD. [6] X Research source In other words, you want each of your denominators to be the same number – the LCD. In our example, we want our denominator to be 12. To turn 3 into 12, you need 3 x 4. To turn 4 into twelve, you need 4 x 3. The resulting like denominator will be the denominator for your final answer. So our 2/3 turns into 2/3 x 4 and 3/4 turns into 3/4 x 3. That means we now have 2/12 and 3/12. But we're not done yet! You'll notice that the denominators, in this instance, are multiplied by each other. This works in this situation, but not all situations. Sometimes, instead of multiplying the two denominators together, you can multiply both denominators by different numbers to get one small number. And then in other cases, sometimes you only have to multiply one denominator to make it equal to the denominator of the other fraction in the equation."

What we did in the last step was just half of the multiplication necessary. [7] X Research source We had 2/3x4 and 3/4x3 as our first step – to add the second step, it's really 2 x 4/3 x 4 and 3 x 3/4 x 3. That means our new numbers are 8/12 and 9/12. Perfect!"

To turn this into a mixed fraction, simply subtract the denominator from the numerator and see what's left over. In this case, 17/12 = 1 5/12"
