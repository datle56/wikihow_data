      "title": "Set a date for the election and a deadline for nominations.",
      "content": "Set a date for the election and a deadline for nominations. Whenever your organization meets, specify when the election will be, as well as when the due date for officer nominations. If you’re preparing and distributing a typed ballet, set the nomination deadline to be 2-3 weeks before the actual election takes place. At this point, decide if the election should happen in person or if voters will be given mail-in ballots to cast their votes. [1] X Research source If you’re part of a formal organization, like a city council, consider creating a nominating committee for the election. Members of this committee can work to find suitable officer candidates. For instance, if the election is February 15, make it clear that the deadline for nominations is on January 31. If you aren’t preparing ballots ahead of time, you can close nominations on the same day as the election."

      "content": "Nominate candidates during a formal meeting. If you haven’t formed a nominating committee, choose a neutral third-party to manage and compile the different nominations for an officer position. During your group meeting, set aside time to accept verbal nominations from any member of your organization. [2] X Research source When nominating someone in person, try saying something like this: “My name is Sarah Jackson. I would like to nominate Clarissa Montgomery for President.” If your organization has an official nominating ballot, fill out the form and mail it to the proper committee or individual. If multiple people support a single candidate, they can sign a petition and send this document to the nominating committee, instead."

      "title": "Conduct a vote to see if the organization supports the nomination.",
      "content": "Conduct a vote to see if the organization supports the nomination. Wait for the leader of the meeting to present the nomination to the rest of the group. When the nominee is mentioned, state “aye” or “nay” at the specified time to declare your support or disapproval for the candidate. If the majority vote passes, then the nominee will be included on the ballot. [3] X Research source For instance, a meeting could go like this: “If you support the nomination of Terry Williams for Vice President, please say ‘aye.’”"

      "title": "Provide options on the ballot for the available candidates.",
      "content": "Provide options on the ballot for the available candidates. Create an official form that contains all of the collected nominations, as well as the positions that each individual is running for. Design the ballots with clear check marks, or some other system where voters can fill out their ballot. To make the voting process more consistent and uniform, print clear instructions on the ballot that explain how to cast a vote correctly. [4] X Research source For instance, a checkmark or “x” symbol could be the designated symbol used for voting. If you’d like to give your voters more freedom, add a write-in spot to the ballot."

      "content": "Distribute ballots to all participants in the election. Hand out the printed ballots to everyone in your organization so the election can run more efficiently. If you don’t have a formal ballot created, hand out blank slips of paper to the voters. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Give voters a set amount of time to complete and submit their ballots.",
      "content": "Give voters a set amount of time to complete and submit their ballots. Tell the members when their votes need to be filled out. If your organization is smaller, you could set a time limit of 5 minutes before collecting the ballots. If your group is large and extensive, establish a mailing system for people to submit their votes. Stress that the voting deadline is absolute, and that late ballots won’t be accepted or counted. [6] X Research source If you allow members to mail in their ballots, specify an exact address where they can send their postage."

      "content": "Sort the ballots to get rid of any illegal votes. Collect all of the votes in 1 area, then search the pile for any joke, “troll,” or otherwise illegal ballots that were cast. Specifically, throw out any unintelligible ballots, votes cast for fictional characters or inanimate objects, or 2 completed ballots combined together. Additionally, check that each ballot selects only 1 candidate per position. It’s okay if ballots aren’t filled out completely—just count the votes that are included. If a completed ballot is submitted with a blank ballot, then only the completed form can be counted. For instance, a ballot that includes “Mickey Mouse” as a candidate for President would be considered an illegal vote."

      "content": "Count the ballots to determine the winner of the election. Use a blank sheet of paper or computer to tally and combine the total votes. Once you’ve done an initial counting, double-check your math and tally the votes again. If you want to be extra safe, ask a neutral third party to count the votes and confirm your results. [7] X Research source If you’re holding a large election, it might be easier to use a digital spreadsheet to count the votes."

If a clear winner is found after the recount, announce the new officer. If no winner is found, reset the election by opening the floor to new nominations. After this, hold a follow-up election at a later date. [8] X Research source Check your organization’s rulebook to see if there are any procedures or policies regarding recounts."

State which position is open for election or re-election, and invite members of the organization to come forward with their nominations for the position. If you have a nominating committee in place, ask this group to declare their nominee for a specific officer role. Try to conduct all of the nominations during the meeting so the whole organization can be involved. For instance, a nomination could go like this: “Fred Summers, could you share your name and officer nomination?” “My name is Fred Summers, and I’m nominating Jason Morgan for Treasurer.” There may be multiple nominations for each position. To keep the process running smoothly, say something like this: “Jason Morgan has been nominated to be our new Treasurer. Would anyone else like to submit a nomination?” Use this period of time to collect nominations for all available officer positions."

If there’s only 1 candidate for an officer position, invite the members of the organization to support or dissent the nominee.

For instance, you could organize the vote like this: “Denise Lewis is the sole nominee for the position of Vice President. If you’re in favor of her holding this position, please say ‘aye.’ If you aren’t in favor, say ‘nay.’” At the end of the voting period, you could say: “Denise has received most of the votes for the position of Vice President.
