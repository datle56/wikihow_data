      "title": "Acknowledge your wrongdoing.",
      "content": "Acknowledge your wrongdoing. To take responsibility for your mistakes, you must reflect on your words or actions and understand what you did poorly or wrongly. Gain some clarity about the event and why you may have done what you did. [1] X Research source Admitting you were wrong doesn't mean you're weak or inept. In fact, owning up to your mistakes takes a lot of courage and self-awareness. It is a sign of maturity. For example, if you said you would pick up the dry cleaning but didn't, don't make an excuse. Just own that you said you would do something, and you didn't pull through. Start by saying, “I was wrong,” or “I made a mistake,” even if only to yourself."

      "title": "Keep the focus on you.",
      "content": "Keep the focus on you. You might share responsibility with another person, and they may have said or done wrong things as well, but stay focused on your part of the mistake, Boswell advises. Just because you take accountability for your mistake, it doesn't mean you're free to point the finger at other people for their parts. [2] X Research source Even if you own up to your part, the other person may not own up to theirs. If they don't, know that you did the right thing by admitting your wrongs . Remember that you can only control your own actions, not anyone else's. For example, if a project didn't get finished and you were part of the problem, own up to your part. Don't start blaming others, even if they were part of the problem. Say something like, “It was my responsibility to double-check that the numbers were correct.”"

      "title": "Say something sooner rather than later.",
      "content": "Say something sooner rather than later. As soon as a situation becomes unpleasant, be mature about owning up to your responsibility in creating it. The sooner the problem is identified, the sooner a resolution is possible, and that minimizes negative consequences. [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For example, if you let someone down, talk to them as soon as possible and let them know how you feel. Say, “I was going to go to your event but didn't make it, and it's my fault.”"

      "title": "Admitting your mistake shows that you're willing to take responsibility.",
      "content": "Admitting your mistake shows that you're willing to take responsibility. It can be difficult to admit you’re imperfect and did something wrong. But proactively taking that step shows others you're willing to be responsible for what you do even if you aren’t caught, which makes you seem more honorable and trustworthy. [4] X Research source For example, say, “I was wrong to yell at you yesterday. Even if I'm upset, I don't want to yell.”"

    {
      "title": "The most important thing you can do is say you're sorry to the people affected.",
      "content": "The most important thing you can do is say you're sorry to the people affected. Accept what you did wrong and make it clear that you are sorry for whatever hurt or problem it caused. Be gracious when you apologize and be willing to admit your fault. [5] X Research source Anderson advises, “If you regret your actions, apologize for those actions…apologize that your actions made other people feel that way, for that was not your intent.” For example, say, “I'm sorry I messed up the project. It's my fault, and I take responsibility for things going wrong.”"

    {
      "title": "Be understanding if the other person is upset.",
      "content": "Be understanding if the other person is upset. Validate how they feel and what they might be experiencing. Start by reflecting on their words or feelings, and then let them know that you understand why they feel the way they do. [6] X Research source Anderson recommends, “Acknowledge their feelings and any actions on your part that may have led to those feelings.” For example, say, “I can tell you're disappointed. I would be, too.”"

      "title": "Part of taking responsibility includes making up for your mistake.",
      "content": "Part of taking responsibility includes making up for your mistake. Come up with some solutions to right your wrong. This might mean doing extra work or promising to do better next time. Boswells advises showing that you're willing to change to make things better. Making amends can help to restore justice and put people back on equal grounds. [7] X Research source For example, if you're to blame for something at work, offer to stay later and fix your mistake. If you mess something up with your family or friends, say it will be different next time and mean it. “Tell the person what you are going to do to rectify the situation, how you will provide restitution, and how your actions will change should the situation arise in the future,” says Anderson. Say something like, “It was my job to make sure the pot didn’t boil over. I’ll stay late to clean it up and make a new batch.”"

      "title": "Face the consequences with grace and avoid repeating the mistake.",
      "content": "Face the consequences with grace and avoid repeating the mistake. Accepting responsibility for your behavior may be scary, especially if you know there will be consequences. Take your consequences as courageously as possible, and when it's done, it's really over. You'll have learned a valuable lesson and maintained personal integrity in the process. Try to grow from the experience and avoid repeating your mistakes. [8] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source For example, coming clean might mean you face consequences at work or school. Or, you may have to fess up to something to your family or partner that you know will make them upset. You might know some backlash will happen but do the right thing. Say something like, “I understand what I did has damaged our relationship, and I accept that you may not want to see me for a while.”"

      "title": "Recognize your mistake and reflect on what may have contributed to it.",
      "content": "Recognize your mistake and reflect on what may have contributed to it. Perhaps you had a stressful day and lashed out at someone. It is easy to displace your anger onto people who really had nothing to do with your bad mood. Maybe you jumped to conclusions about something and were wrong. Whatever it is you did, think about it and try to make any necessary changes as a result, recommends Boswell. For example, if you forgot something because you were rushed, try to slow down or allow more time for activities. Ask yourself, “What can I do to avoid this mistake in the future?”"

      "title": "Ask a friend to help keep you accountable for your words and actions.",
      "content": "Ask a friend to help keep you accountable for your words and actions. This might mean you ask someone to call you out, or you meet with them regularly to talk about accountability. Having a friend or counselor to talk to about taking responsibility can help you deal with it better and faster. [9] X Research source For example, meet with someone each week and discuss what you're doing well and struggling with. Let each other know when the other needs to accept responsibility for wrongs. Say something like, “I’m trying to be more sensitive about what I say to others. Can you say something if you hear me say something overly harsh?”"

      "content": "Remember that nobody's perfect, and everyone makes mistakes. Don't linger on a mistake or continuously try to make it up to the person you hurt. Once you've admitted your mistake and made amends , do your best to move on from the event. Even if you made a big mistake, don't guilt yourself forever. Accept what happened, learn from it, then move on. [10] X Research source Once you've taken all the steps to make things right, don't live in guilt or shame. Let go of what happened. If your guilt over what happened is causing you a lot of distress, or you just can't seem to move on, consider seeing a counselor to help you work through it. Say to yourself, “I’ve owned up to what I did, apologized, and accepted the consequences. It’s time to move on.”"
