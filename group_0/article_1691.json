In order to forge a strong relationship, Aries and Libra need to acknowledge that they each provide an outlook that enhances the other sign’s growth. Libra learns to advocate for themselves, while Aries strengthens their empathy and emotional intelligence."

      "title": "Libra and Aries encourage each other to be emotionally honest.",
      "content": "Libra and Aries encourage each other to be emotionally honest. Aries has positive polarity, which means that they’re extremely self-expressive and let everyone know what’s on their mind. Libra, who usually keeps their thoughts pent up, takes notes and learns how to be outspoken. To repay Aries for the favor, Libra teaches Aries how to dig deeper to find the real root of their frustration. Even though Libra also has positive polarity, since they’re a “cardinal” sign—meaning they lead others—they feel a huge responsibility toward people and usually only talk about what matters to their community."

Aries loves Libra’s clarity, while Libra adores supporting Aries. Aries’ personal goal is in the Tenth House, the House of Social Status.

Luckily, Saturn is exalted in Libra, so the air sign knows exactly what to do when Aries brings up a goal that Saturn presented to Aries. Libra’s so inspired by Saturn that Libra sees every action Aries needs to take to be successful."
