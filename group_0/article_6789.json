      "content": "Make sure the power is turned off. [1] X Expert Source Daniel Stoescu Master Electrician Expert Interview. 21 June 2021. This is a good idea any time you are messing around with electrical fixtures. Why not be safe? Just switch the red power button to “off” in your fuse box . Be aware this will shut off all of your power, not just for one fixture. You should also unplug the lighting fixture before you change the light bulb (if it's a fixture with a plug, that is). If you don't, you could risk getting shocked. Always be careful around electricity."

      "content": "Take other safety measures. There are a few things you should keep in mind, especially if the bulb is high up in the ceiling. Let the bulb cool off before you unscrew it. If the light was on recently, the bulb will be hot to the touch, and you could burn your fingers. [2] X Research source If the bulb is in a ceiling fixture, don't try to balance on an unsteady chair or something similar. Use a sturdy stepladder. That way you can reach the light bulb without falling. Instead of a step ladder, you can buy a special extension tool to switch a light bulb that is very high up. This is often safer than trying to climb a ladder. And remember: You could always hire a handyman! You shouldn't need any other tools to change a light bulb in a lamp fixture."

      "content": "Take the bulb out of the socket. If the fixture is easy to reach, such as a lamp, the process is pretty straightforward. Sockets do differ depending on your lighting fixture. If you have a bayonet mount, which is common in the UK and places like New Zealand, hold the bulb gently but firmly, and then push down and turn the bulb counter-clockwise. This should release it from the socket. This type of socket has two prongs. If the socket has a screw fitting, which is common in America and throughout Europe, you should gently twist the bulb counter clockwise. It should then come loose from the socket, and you can remove it. If the bulb detaches from the screw, then you will need to use a pair of pliers to remove the screw. Make sure that the power is off then unscrew the screw."

      "title": "Put a new bulb in the socket.",
      "content": "Put a new bulb in the socket. In order to put a new bulb into a lighting fixture's socket, you will want to turn the bulb in a clockwise direction. Just remember: Counter-clockwise to remove; clockwise to insert. The bulb might lock into place or you might have to twist it a bit until you can't twist it anymore. This will depend on the socket. Don't screw the bulb too tight or it could break. If you have a bayonet bulb, you will need to align the bulb's base with the two pins. Push down and then twist upwards, using a clockwise motion. In the case of a screw cap bulb, simply place it into the hole and then twist it. You will usually want to choose a bulb that has the same wattage as the old bulb, unless you want softer or brighter light than what you already had. Check the label on the bulb socket or fixture for the max watt/amp rating. Make sure the bulb's power rating doesn't exceed that allowed by your lighting fixture (check with the manufacturer or packaging). Turn the switch on so you can know when to stop turning. When the light turns on, stop turning."

      "content": "Change a light bulb in a home dome light. You've seen these lights. They're set into the ceiling. To change the light bulb, you usually have to remove the screws that hold the glass or plastic dome over the light bulb. Usually there are about 2-3 screws holding the dome to the frame. Remove them with a screwdriver. Now, lift the dome head carefully off the frame. Some dome lights have notch mechanisms instead. In those cases you will push up on the dome lightly, twist it, and then pull it down. This could release it. If there is a notch, you may need to push up into the notch, and then pull it down. If the dome light is not screwed in, you could twist the dome off with your hands. Try wearing rubber gloves to remove it in order to increase the friction. [3] X Research source Some dome fixtures are fastened to the frame with metal clips. Try pulling out one of the clips, and the dome should usually fall off. Some glass dome lights have a single center nut that you need to unscrew to get the dome off. If you have one of those dome lights with a metal rim, you should be able to unscrew the metal trim with your hands. It's possible you will have to break the seal on it first. For example, sometimes people paint too close to the trim, so paint could have dried between the metal rim and the dome cover. Try pushing it slightly upwards and then twisting it counter clockwise after breaking the seal (you could use a flat head screwdriver or knife to do this. Be careful)."

      "content": "Change a light bulb in a high ceiling. What if the light bulb is way up on a vaulted ceiling? And is recessed lighting? For example, some people have ceilings that are 16 feet high. Go to a home improvement store or online, and purchase an extended light bulb changing pole. These are long poles that you can use to change light bulbs. These extenders can give you a very long reach. [4] X Research source Attach the suction cup to the hole. Attach the string to the side of the suction cup so that you can release the suction cup from the bulb. [5] X Research source This process works for recessed lights. The pole works by fastening the suction cup onto the bulb. Extend the pole up to the lighting fixture. Place the suction cup on the bulb. Untwist it, and slowly remove the old bulb. Pull the string to take the bulb off. Put a new bulb on the end of the suction cup, which should still be fastened to the pole. Put it up into the recessed lighting fixture. Twist it in. Pull the string to loosen the suction."

      "content": "Remove a car dome light bulb. It shouldn't take you very long to replace the light bulb that illuminates the inside of your car. You probably can do this yourself. Take off the bulb lens cover. It's possible you will need a screwdriver to do this because some lens covers are held in place with two screws. In other cases, you can just pry it off with a flat head screwdriver. Put the screwdriver opposite the light switch. Press in.The lens cover should pop off. Now unscrew the light bulb from the socket. Screw a new bulb in (ask at an auto store to make sure you get the right bulb). Replace the lens cover by snapping it in place or replacing the screws."

      "title": "Get rid of the bulb safely.",
      "content": "Get rid of the bulb safely. Be aware that light bulbs are very fragile. Thus, you don't want to just toss them haphazardly in your garbage can. If the bulb breaks, the shards can cut someone. Wrap the old bulb in the new bulb's package before throwing it away. You could also wrap the old bulb in a newspaper or old magazine. Throw the bulb away in places that children can't reach. Make sure to recycle the bulb if possible or required in your area."
