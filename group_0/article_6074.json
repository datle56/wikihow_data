[2] X Research source Purchase a large wire fence to use as a fox enclosure. Try to choose a sheltered area protected from wind and direct sun. Choose a spot with sturdy ground rather than wet or marshy areas."

      "content": "Dig down about 3 feet (0.9 m) and place the fence into the ground. Foxes will dig down to try to get out of the fence so it must extend below the surface. A concrete floor will work even better to keep the fox from digging under the fence, but it can be tough on the fox's paws. Make sure to cover a concrete floor in dirt or mulch. [3] X Research source Another option is burying chain-link fencing under soil or mulch. This will keep the fox enclosed even if they dig down."

      "content": "Include toys. Foxes are very active and love to have toys to play with. Try out different toys and see which your fox likes best. Your fox might like: Tunnels made for dogs Balls Dog or cat chew toys Fabric toys Even sticks make great toys!"

      "title": "Add bowls for water and food.",
      "content": "Add bowls for water and food. Make sure to use very heavy bowls. Because just like dogs, a fox can flip light bowls over for fun."

      "title": "Pet proof your house.",
      "content": "Pet proof your house. Foxes can make a mess of your house so make sure to prepare as you would for a new puppy/dog or kitten/cat. You may wish to cover electrical cords, clean up the area, and try to minimize the number of places your fox could hide, such as behind sofas. Some foxes can learn to live inside but a fox is still a wild animal so expect that it will be difficult to have a fox indoors. Even foxes that live indoors most of the time will need an outdoor enclosure. Foxes love to run and play so they need outdoor space. It is generally not recommended to leave your fox at home unsupervised so you'll need an outdoor enclosure for when you go out."

    {
      "title": "Get a litter box.",
      "content": "Get a litter box. Foxes can sometimes be trained to use a litter box just like cats. A covered litter box may work best, foxes love to dig. Any size litter box intended for cats can work. Sometimes foxes cannot be trained to use a litter box because they are wild animals. Consider this before choosing a fox for a pet."

The fox will need vaccines, fixing, regular check-ups and period medical treatments just like your other pets. Not all vets are willing to care for exotic animals. Make sure to find one who is. Find a veterinarian before you obtain the fox. It can be very difficult to find a vet who is able and willing to work with animals that are not normally used for pets. Annual appoints are best to keep track of health. Keep track of all your fox's medical records, in case a problem occurs."

[5] X Research source Fox diets can include meats and vegetables to supplement basic dog food. Check with your vet. Leave out some dry dog food for the fox during the day. Try adding a can of wet cat food mixed with vegetables to the fox's diet once a day."
