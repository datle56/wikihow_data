[3] X Expert Source Francisco Gomez Fitness Coach Expert Interview. 24 October 2019. Create a basic gym routine, and try to increase your reps every week. This strength training is important because start speed is largely based on your muscle mass and overall strength in both your upper and lower body. As a sprinter, extra training is the only way to significantly increase upper body mass. [4] X Research source Train on the track. You can often use a school track whenever it’s not in use. Practice your sprints in intervals with a few minutes of rest in between. Set weekly time goals for yourself.

Your exact routine will depend on your sprint distance. You should plan a sprint workout on the days that you aren’t doing strength training, at least three days a week. An example of a sprint training workout for running 200m races is as follows: 5 sets of 20 meter sprints, 4 sets of 30, 3 sets of 40, 3 sets of 30, 3 sets of 40, 3 sets of 50, 1 set of 60, and then 5 sets of 30. After each set, you should walk back to the start for a breath. After completing this routine, you should take a two-minute walking break, and then repeat the entire routine one more time.
