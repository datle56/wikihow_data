Alternatively, you can blot the stain with a clean rag, then pour flour or polenta over the stain and allow the flour to absorb the stain for 1 hour. Be sure to brush away any excess flour prior to moving on to the next step. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Pre-treat the stain. Spray a pre-treater on the stain, and let sit for 3-4 minutes. If you do not have a pre-treater, you can coat the stain with a heavy-duty detergent. Combining powder detergent and water to create a paste is a quick and easy way to create a pre-treater if you don’t have one on hand."

Blotting gently lifts the stain away without damaging the fabric. Follow the grain of the fabric and repeat the process with a clean section of cloth until the stain is gone. Then, proceed to washing. [6] X Research source"
