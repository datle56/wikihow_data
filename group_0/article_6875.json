      "content": "Clean out your work area. Remove everything from under the sink, including soaps, garbage cans, cleaners, and anything else you might be storing under there. When the area has been cleared, lay down an old towel to protect the shelf from water damage in case any of the pipes, hoses, fittings, or other components happen to leak. [1] X Research source Clearing out the area will give you an easier area to work in, and protect items from water."

      "title": "Shut off the water.",
      "content": "Shut off the water. This should always be the first thing you do before starting any plumbing work, and you won’t be able to replace the hoses unless the water is off. [2] X Research source Turn the water shutoff valve to the right (clockwise) to turn off the water. To find the shutoff valve, simply follow the pipes attaching the faucets to the supply line. Near where they connect, there should be a shutoff valve for the hot and cold water."

      "title": "Drain excess water from the pipes.",
      "content": "Drain excess water from the pipes. This will prevent water from leaking everywhere when you remove the hoses. To drain out the excess water, simply turn on the taps for the hot, cold, and pull-out faucets until the water runs dry. This will get standing water out of the hoses and pipes and relieve pressure from the line. [3] X Research source If water still comes out of the faucet after turning off the valve, you’ll need to replace the shutoff valve before disconnecting the supply line(s). Test the temperature of the water to determine which valve isn’t working if you have 2 faucet handles. Be sure to turn off the main water supply before replacing the shutoff valve."

      "title": "Detach the supply hose from the water supply.",
      "content": "Detach the supply hose from the water supply. The supply line hose is the hose that connects the faucet to the main water supply. This could be a plastic hose, a coiled metal hose, or it could even be a solid metal tube. There will be separate hoses for the hot and cold, so make sure you disconnect the one that you need to replace. It’s common for some water to drip when the hoses are disconnected. Place a pan under the sink to catch drips. To disconnect the hose, start by loosening the lock nut attaching the hose to the water supply. You'll probably need to loosen it with the adjustable wrench first. [4] X Research source To loosen the nut, turn it to the left (counterclockwise). Once you’ve loosened the nut with the wrench, you can twist it off the rest of the way by hand. If you're not sure which hose is for which supply, the hot water is typically on the left, and cold on the right."

      "title": "Detach the hose from the faucet.",
      "content": "Detach the hose from the faucet. Follow the supply hose from the water supply up to where it’s attached to the faucet. When you find the lock nut, use the basin wrench to access the nut and loosen it off. If the supply line connects to copper tubing, hold the tubing in 1 hand while loosening the nut with the other to prevent the copper from twisting or breaking. [5] X Research source Loosen the nut by turning it to the left (counterclockwise). When you’ve loosened the nut, you can twist it off the rest of the way by hand. Once the second nut is disconnected, you'll be able to remove the old hose. The basin wrench is necessary here because it allows you to access the hard-to-reach nut under the sink. Because the handle of the wrench can pivot, it lets you turn the wrench and loosen the nut from a more comfortable position."

      "content": "Purchase a new hose with the same measurements. It’s actually best to purchase a replacement hose after you’ve removed the original one. Take the original hose to the hardware store and buy a replacement that will be a perfect match. [6] X Research source If you’re replacing more than 1 line, be sure to mark which one goes where on the valve and faucet connector. You don’t have to buy the same style of hose, but it does have to be the same length as the original, and the diameter of the hose and fittings must also be the same."

      "title": "Dry and tape the threads.",
      "content": "Dry and tape the threads. Use the rag to dry off the threaded pipe ends where the supply line hose attaches to the water supply and faucet. When the threads are clean and dry, wrap them with thread sealing tape. Make sure the tape doesn’t extend beyond the end of the pipe. [7] X Research source Thread sealing tape lubricates threads and helps to form a stronger seal between joints. This will make your new hose easier to attach, and help prevent leaks."

      "content": "Attach the hose to the faucet. Reach up with the hose and attach the faucet end of the hose to the same connection you removed the original from. [8] X Research source With your hand, tighten the nut by turning it to the right (clockwise) just until it’s snug. Be careful not to kink the hose! When you’ve tightened it by hand as much as you can, finish screwing on the nut with the basin wrench by turning it a quarter turn. Do not overtighten, as this can damage the threads. Make sure you attach the right end, because the diameter of the hose is probably different where it connects to the faucet versus the water supply."

If there's a gray button where the hose and water supply connect, press the button to release the hose. [10] X Research source Otherwise, you may have a collet-style hose. In that case, hold the ring in place, gently push the hose deeper into the connection to release it, and then pull the hose out."

Make a mark on the hose where the weight is located so you can replace it later. Before you can remove the hose, you'll have to remove the weight. Some weights will slide off the end of the hose. Others will snap in and out of place. For the rest, unscrew the screws holding the two sides together and pull the sides apart to remove them from the hose."
