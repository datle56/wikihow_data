      "content": "Obtain any necessary construction permits. Building a wall this size is a potentially significant construction project, and some localities will require a permit. Investigate local laws and see if you need a permit for this project. If so, go through all the steps of obtaining the permit before starting construction to avoid fines or other legal trouble. [2] X Research source Checking with your local building department is a good place to start. If you know a local contractor or engineer, they are likely aware of regulations in your area. You can also ask them if there are certain regulations you have to meet."

      "title": "Measure and mark the perimeter of your structure.",
      "content": "Measure and mark the perimeter of your structure. The stem wall should form part of the foundation on your structure, so build it along the planned structure perimeter. Start by measuring out that perimeter. Then mark that border on the ground. [3] X Research source If you’re planning a 10 feet (3.0 m) x 10 feet (3.0 m) shed, measure out these dimensions and mark them in the ground. Plan on starting your stem wall on this perimeter."

      "title": "Calculate how many bricks you need.",
      "content": "Calculate how many bricks you need. After you've planned the perimeter for your wall, you can calculate the amount of materials you need. First, calculate the cubic feet of the wall you’re planning. The formula for cubic feet is length x width x height. Use this formula for each section of your stem wall. Then, find out the volume of the brick type you plan on using. Divide the volume of each pack of bricks into the volume of your wall to find out how many packs you need. [4] X Research source For example, if you’re building a rectangle structure and your wall will be 6 feet (1.8 m) long, 1 foot (0.30 m) thick, and 4 feet (1.2 m) high, you need 96 cubic feet (2.7 m 3 ) of material for that section. Then multiply that by 4 to get 384 cubic feet (10.9 m 3 ) for the whole wall. Use a different formula if you are calculating the volume of a circular structure . If a pack of bricks has a volume of 20 cubic feet (0.57 m 3 ) and the total volume for your wall is 384 cubic feet (10.9 m 3 ), then you need 20 packs of bricks. If you’re having the stones delivered, ask the drivers to place the stones as close to your building site as possible so you don’t have to carry them long distances."

Cover the bottom of the trench with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of gravel. Push the gravel down with your foot or a shovel to make sure it’s tightly packed. [7] X Research source Then, lay out landscaping fabric so it covers the gravel and both sides of the trench. Leave some fabric remaining at the top so you can wrap the fabric around the top of the drainage system. Finally, pour gravel into the trench until it fills 1/3 of the way to the top. You can buy bags of drain-grade gravel at a local hardware or garden supply store."

      "content": "Install a drainage pipe in the trench. To prevent water from settling in your foundation, you can build a simple drainage system. First, dig a path extending from the wall's trench to a drainage area. Lay a perforated pipe in the trench and extend it into the drainage path. Then wrap the remaining landscaping fabric over the pipe. Fill the trench with gravel until it is 6 inches (15 cm) from the top. [8] X Research source If you plan on connecting your drainage pipe to a local storm drain or sewer, make sure you receive permission from the local government. If you have water on your property, you can extend the drainage ditch so it empties here."

Act as if each section represents one stone."

The 4 stones you laid from each direction forms the first layer of cornerstones. For the second layer, overlap the first stone by laying another on top of it. Continue interlocking the stones as you build upward, alternating which side lays over the other. [10] X Research source The interlocking stone structure should look like a zipper going up. Stack 3 to 5 layers of stones at the corner before filling in the rest of the wall. Then if you need to go higher, stack more layers at the corners."

Place the bricks in the trench all along the perimeter to form the first layer. [11] X Research source Make sure each rock you place is secure. Push it down to lock it in place snugly. Pound them down gently with a rubber mallet if you have to. Always stack a complete layer around the whole perimeter before starting another layer."

[12] X Research source If your bricks are smaller and you need to use more than one to cover the width of the trench, make sure the stones nearby touch each other. Otherwise, the wall won’t be able to support much weight. [13] X Research source"

Stacking the wall at least 1.5 feet (0.46 m) above ground level helps keep your structure dry and avoids water damage. [14] X Research source Do not build the stem wall higher than 8 feet (2.4 m). A wall higher than this requires extra reinforcement. Many localities even ban stem walls higher than 4 feet (1.2 m) for safety reasons."
