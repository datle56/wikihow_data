Ensure that the car is parked somewhere clean and away from the exhaust of other cars that are running. Take your air freshener out of the car first. It might contaminate the cookies, and you won't need one afterwards when your car smells like fresh baked cookies. [2] X Research source"

Place the rounds onto the cookie sheet, leaving about 1½\" (4cm) of space around each cookie. If you haven't purchased pre-made cookie dough, make the dough from this recipe (as was done for this article) or use your own cookie recipe (preferably egg-free, to avoid any potential for problems of not baking the egg sufficiently). Arrange each cookie on the baking sheet, adding blobs about tablespoon wide and leaving some space around the cookies to allow for spread."

They may be fine without this. Cover the cookies with plastic-wrap if not baking immediately and keep in the refrigerator until needed. Don't make the dough too far ahead of use though, use within a few hours."

The edges should be firm, and the centers should be set but not gooey. Try to slide a cookie from the parchment paper. If the cookie is done, it will come off of the paper easily. If the cookie is not done, it will stick to the paper. Close the car door if not done yet. Continue to check on the cookies every 15 to 30 minutes until they are done."
