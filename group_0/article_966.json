Don’t drive with your hips lower than your knees. [3] X Research source If your car doesn’t have a control to adjust the seat height, sit on a cushion to help keep your hips level with your knees. Make sure you’re not elevated too much or you’ll have to bend down to look out the windshield or windows."

      "content": "Adjust the backrest so it’s reclined at about a 100 degree angle. Sitting reclined at this angle will decrease pressure on your lower back so you’re more comfortable. [4] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source If your shoulders lift from the backrest when you turn the steering wheel, your seat is reclined too much. Move the backrest up more if you are hunched forward when driving. When the backrest is in the proper position, you should easily be able to reach the wheel, and your elbows should be slightly bent.

      "content": "Adjust the lumbar support so it fits in the curve of your lower back. The lumbar support is the raised portion of the lower backrest. First, adjust the height of the lumbar support so the bottom edge is level with your waistline. Then adjust the depth of the support so it completely fills in the curve of your lower back. [7] X Research source If your seat doesn’t have lumbar support, roll up a towel and put it in the curve of your back while you’re driving. You can also buy an attachable foam support to use in place of lumbar support if your seat doesn’t have it."

      "content": "Sit with your body all the way back in your seat. Your back should be pressed against the backrest, and your bottom should be as far back in your seat as possible. Avoid driving with your body scorched forward; if you can’t reach the pedals or steering wheel, adjust your seat, not your body. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Hold the steering wheel at a “9 and 3” position. Imagine the steering wheel is the face of a clock. Place your left hand where 9 o’clock would be on the clock. Place your right hand where 3 o’clock would be on the clock. Maintaining this grip will give you the most control over the wheel. Always drive with both hands on the wheel. Driving with one hand twists your spine, which can lead to back pain. [9] X Research source"
