      "content": "Find the area of a right triangle. Since two sides of a right triangle are perpendicular, one of the perpendicular sides will be the height of the triangle. The other side will be the base. So, even if the height and/or base is unstated, you are given them if you know the side lengths. Thus you can use the Area = 1 2 ( b h ) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Area}}={\\frac {1}{2}}(bh)} formula to find the area. [4] X Research source You can also use this formula if you know one side length, plus the length of the hypotenuse . The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right triangle and is opposite the right angle. Remember that you can find a missing side length of a right triangle using the Pythagorean Theorem ( a 2 + b 2 = c 2 {\\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}} ). For example, if the hypotenuse of a triangle is side c, the height and base would be the other two sides (a and b). If you know that the hypotenuse is 5 cm, and the base is 4 cm, use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height: a 2 + b 2 = c 2 {\\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}} a 2 + 4 2 = 5 2 {\\displaystyle a^{2}+4^{2}=5^{2}} a 2 + 16 = 25 {\\displaystyle a^{2}+16=25} a 2 + 16 − 16 = 25 − 16 {\\displaystyle a^{2}+16-16=25-16} a 2 = 9 {\\displaystyle a^{2}=9} a = 3 {\\displaystyle a=3} Now, you can plug the two perpendicular sides (a and b) into the area formula, substituting for the base and height: Area = 1 2 ( b h ) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Area}}={\\frac {1}{2}}(bh)} Area = 1 2 ( 4 ) ( 3 ) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Area}}={\\frac {1}{2}}(4)(3)} Area = 1 2 ( 12 ) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Area}}={\\frac {1}{2}}(12)} Area = 6 {\\displaystyle {\\text{Area}}=6}"
