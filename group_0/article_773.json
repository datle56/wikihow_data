[4] X Research source Other options include shingle roofing, rolled roofing , metal flashing to waterproof the join between the new roof and the existing one, metal studs for framing, and cementitious board or composite sidings. Choose the materials that are suitable for your location and climate as well as materials that will match your existing building. Be sure to plan to use a sheath of CDX plywood on the wall that abuts against the structure. CDX plywood resists indirect moisture."

      "content": "Calculate the amount of each material you will need, price them, and purchase them. Some basic items that a lean-to addition for a tin shed would use include: [5] X Research source Poles for supporting the eave framing. 4\" x 4\" pressure treated southern yellow pine will support a lightweight roof framed with 2\" x 4\" boards, spanning less than 15 feet (4.6 m) or so. For a longer, heavier roof span, 6\" x 6\" timbers or even steel columns may be more suitable. Rafters for framing the actual supporting structure of the roof will need to be strong enough to support the weight of the lathing, the decking and the workmen who will walk on the roof while installing it. A somewhat typical span of less than 10 feet (3.0 m) may be framed with southern yellow pine if the rafters are free of large or loose knots and are otherwise structurally sound. You may use Douglas fir, hemlock, or cedar instead. Lodgepole pine, spruce and other softer pine species are too knotty and not strong enough for roofing unless the rafters are from large diameter trees. For roof spans 10 feet (3.0 m) or greater, 2\" x 6\" nominal framing or larger, should be used. The rafter nailers spanning between the posts on the eave side of your lean-to must be strong enough to support the load of multiple rafters. Use a minimum size of 2\" x 6\" nominal southern yellow pine or other strong wood. Nailers attached directly to the wall of the building onto which the lean-to is being added can be the same size lumber as the rafters themselves as long as the nailer is attached securely to the wall of your building. Local building code and the existing wall material will determine which anchors to use. These may include lag bolts (to attach to large diameter wooden beams), threaded bolt nuts and large diameter washers (drilled into hollow concrete blocks), or hurricane anchors. Lathing strips, or the framing members that lay across the rafters that the metal roofing is attached to should be sound southern yellow pine or a similar lumber. 1\" x 4\" lathing lumber is sufficient to support a normal load on spans where the rafters are located at 24 inch center spacing or less. 2\" x 4\" lumber is easier to fasten to (it bounces less when nails are driven into it), and may not be significantly more expensive than the 1\" x 4\"s. If you are laying a plywood \"roof decking\" directly onto the rafters, then you only need lathing to brace between the rafters or to prevent side-to-side movement by cross-tying them to the bottoms of the rafters. Nails or screws to act as fasteners. Nails should be large enough to penetrate the attached member and the supporting member deeply enough to secure the two pieces. Screws may be used to attach dissimilar materials, such as metal framing, roofing, or siding to wood framing, or even for joining two separate wood members."

Use the 3-4-5 rule to confirm the outer corners are square before you dig the holes. If the outer wall is not parallel to the shed, the rafters will be difficult to place."

Set the circular saw to maximum depth. Measure out 1-1/2\" (about 4 cm) on the top side of your post and cut into the top of the post on the same side as you made the first cut. When your saw blade meets the first cut, the wood block should fall off, leaving the notch for your nailers. If necessary, finish the cut with a hand saw or a reciprocating blade saw. Repeat the process with each post. If you choose to, you may simply nail directly into the side of the post, but doing so places all the weight on your fasteners.

Place the nail about 1/2\" from the connection point and nail it in straight into the rafter. The key to toenailing is to drive the nail in straight and then at an angle. Tap the nail into the wood about 1/4\" (6 mm). Pull the nail up at about a 50-degree angle. Drive the nail in until it protrudes slightly from the rafter. Reposition the board to ensure that the angle is exact. Finish driving your nail through the rafter and into the nailer. Avoid starting the nails too close to the end of the board, as this may split it, and make a strong connection impossible. If this is unavoidable, pre-drill the hole at the correct angle first."
