      "content": "Collect your beeswax if you haven’t already. If you haven’t already received or collected your beeswax, you’ll have to get it yourself. Put on your beekeeping suit and go to your bee hive. Look for sections of honeycomb with no bees on them and remove them from the hive. Use a knife or uncapping tool to shave the wax off of honeycombs and put them in a large bucket. [1] X Research source Caps, which are freshly laid wax on the outer layers of a honeycomb, tend to be the easiest to melt and clean. Take the beeswax between 9:00 am and 4:00 pm to avoid running into any angry bees. If there are bees there, you can use a smoker to safely get rid of the bees temporarily."

      "content": "Drain the honey out of your beeswax overnight in a large container. To clean your wax, you have to remove any remaining honey. To do this, take your wax indoors and put a colander over a pot or large glass. Place your beeswax in the colander and let it sit overnight. Gravity will gradually remove the honey from the wax and it will pool at the bottom of your container. Let your honey sit for more than 1 night if you have particularly thick chunks of beeswax."

      "title": "Rinse your beeswax outside in clean, cool water.",
      "content": "Rinse your beeswax outside in clean, cool water. After you’ve extracted your honey, take your beeswax into an open area outside. Fill a bucket or use a hose on the lowest power setting to rinse your beeswax in clean, cold water. This will wipe any residual honey or dirt off of your beeswax and make the cleaning process easier. [2] X Research source Do not rinse your honeycomb in a sink. Pieces of wax can get into the drain and clog it, causing severe plumbing issues. Don’t take too long to rinse your beeswax. If bees have time to find your wax, it can confuse your bees and cause destructive robbing behaviors at your nearby hive. If you’re worried about bees finding your wax outside, you can hand wash the wax in a large bucket indoors."

      "content": "Place your wax in a large pot with 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of water. Any large pot that fits your beeswax will work. Put your wax in the pot and pour 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of clean water into the pot. Grab a slotted spoon and set it aside. [3] X Research source If you own your own hives, you may want to consider buying a solar melter. This is a specialized tool that beekeepers use for melting beeswax by using the sun to heat a large box and melt the wax without water."

Beeswax will ignite and burn at 490 °F (254 °C). To prevent any fires from starting, keep the heat low. It will take between 15-30 minutes for your beeswax to melt. [5] X Research source Overheating will also dilute the quality of your beeswax, so turn the heat down if the wax starts boiling or smoking."

A slotted spoon will make it easy to remove dirt, pebbles, dead bees, or old cocoons without taking the wax with it. As your wax melts, scoop the spoon under any foreign objects in your pot and raise it 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) above the pot. Wait 5-15 seconds to let the wax drain back into the pot and place the object that you want to remove in a ceramic bowl or metal pan.

Wait 30-60 minutes to give your wax time to fully cool off. The water and beeswax will naturally separate in the pot, and the beeswax will float to the top as it dries. [7] X Research source If you aren’t sure whether the wax has cooled or not, poke it with the teeth of a fork or a toothpick. if the wax resists being punctured, it’s cool. If it immediately gives, wait another 30 minutes before checking again."

Put 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of water in the bottom pot and put your second pot, bowl, or tin on top of the first one. [10] X Research source A second melting with a double boiler is typically performed to remove smaller pieces of dirt, grime, and debris from wax after the bigger objects have been removed.

Place a metal sieve over the mouth of your container. Use several strips of toilet paper to line the inside of the metal sieve so that there are no open spaces remaining. [15] X Research source You can use a large coffee filter if you have one that will fit over your sieve.
