      "content": "Calculate how much money you'll have after the exchange. Multiply the money you've budgeted by the exchange rate. The answer is how much money you'll have after the exchange. If \"a\" is the money you have in one currency and \"b\" is the exchange rate, then \"c\" is how much money you'll have after the exchange. So a * b = c , and a = c/b . For instance, say you want to convert Euros to US dollars. At the time of this revision, 1 Euro is worth 1.09 US dollar. Your exchange rate is 1.09. If you're planning on taking $1500 Euros with you, you would multiply 1500 by 1.09. The answer, 1632.61, is how much money you'll have in dollars after the exchange. Here's an example of the \"work backwards\" method. Say that you know you'll need 20,000 Hungarian forints for your trip. You discover that 1 US dollar is equivalent to 226.43 forints. To figure out how many US dollars you would need to save at the current exchange rate, divide 20,000 by 226.43. The answer, 88.33, is how many US dollars you need to exchange."

However, because Google's finance converter does not constantly track and update current currency exchange rates, this information is more of an estimate and should not be relied on as accurate up-to-the-minute data."
