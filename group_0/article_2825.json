      "content": "Spend more time learning from kids. Spending more time with children is the easiest way to become more playful. You should play with them not with the goal of teaching them more about life, but to learn more from them by watching how they approach and look at life. Children look at everything with curiosity, excitement, and joy, and you should learn to approach life in this more playful manner. [1] X Research source If you don't have kids of your own, try volunteering with children, or spending more time with children of your friends or relatives. Obviously, you shouldn't just go out and approach a stranger's kid."

      "content": "Play with a pet. If you have a dog or a cat or know a friend who does, then spend more time playing with animals. Whether you're walking a dog or tossing a ball to it, or playing around with your cat and a feather toy, playing with animals alters your perspective and makes you approach life in a more playful and less structured way. You can even work as a dog walker or spend time cat-sitting for a friend to be around animals more. If you really like the animals idea, volunteer at an animal shelter. [2] X Research source Being around non-humans can help you take some of the structure out of your life and to approach things in a less regimented way."

      "content": "Dance . Go take salsa or Zumba lessons, or just hit up the clubs with your friends. Toss your hair around and dance to some completely silly or ridiculous music. It's not about looking good -- it's about feeling good, and the more you dance, the more you're able to let loose, feel relaxed, and generally let go of your inhibitions, the more playful you'll become. [3] X Research source Doing a dance with specific moves, such as \"The Dougie,\" \"The Cupid Shuffle,\" or even \"The Harlem Shake,\" can make you let go even more as you get caught up in the moment of the dance moves. You absolutely do not have to be a good dancer to be playful in this way!"

If you're always so serious about yourself and can't step back and admit when you've made a fool of yourself, made a silly comment, or just did something unintentionally hilarious, then you'll never be able to be playful. Being able to laugh at yourself will make people see that you're fun to hang around with, and that you're not a stick-in-the-mud who is determined to act in a serious way 100% of the time.

      "content": "Softly hit people. If you're hanging out with good friends and are in the middle of a mock-argument, try softly hitting or pushing each other. This works best if you're walking around, on a beach, or sitting in a park somewhere -- probably not at a restaurant or a formal event. Just softly hitting your friends if the mood is right can help you relax and be more playful in your approach to life and friendships. Make sure you know the other person well enough and that the hitting is reciprocated, though."

      "content": "Tease your friends lightly. Being able to tease people is an important part of being playful. This means knowing people well enough to be able to make fun of their little foibles, from their obsession with chocolate to their clumsy nature. As long as the teasing isn't mean-spirited or over the top, being able to tease people and to be teased in return will make you a more playful person. [7] X Research source The more you tease people, the more you'll know where their boundaries are. Teasing people will remind you that you should be more playful and not take life too seriously."

Your significant other is a great target, too. A good friend can be a great target as long as you find the right time and the other person is into it. Sitting back, having fun, and trying to tickle the person you're with is another great way to be playful. Again, make sure you're comfortable with the person you're tickling before you begin."

Getting people together for a game night, or spontaneously introducing a game to your friends when you're hanging out, is a great way to do something different and to make your social life a bit different and more playful. Have you tried big booty ? What about musical chairs ? Or drown the penny? Other games you could try include Risk, charades, Simon Says, Twister, board games, and magic tricks . You can also try making games out of everyday activities. For example, if you and your partner regularly cook dinner at home, challenge them to a cook-off to see who can make the best version of your favorite food."

If you have a good relationship with your colleagues or just want to have one, try to organize a weekly or monthly bowling night, or get your co-workers to join a softball league with you. Join a sports team outside of school or just get a good friend to play tennis or basketball with you. Playing more sports makes you less concerned about work and will make you a more playful person overall."

As long as you're not too serious when you tell them and make it clear that you know you're being silly, the jokes will be taken the right way; if people don't laugh, they'll at least groan at your attempt to make a joke, whether it involves a pun or a silly reference. You can try knock knock jokes, ice-breakers, short anecdotes, or really whatever floats your boat. [10] X Research source Try this one. Loudly say, \"Polar bear!\" When your friends stare at you, just shrug and say, \"What? I'm just trying to break the ice!\" How about the reverse-knock knock joke? Tell your friend that you have a great knock-knock joke, and then say, \"Okay, you start.\" Your friend will say, \"Knock-knock,\" and you can say, \"Who's there?\" Then, you can laugh as you see how confused your friend gets when he realizes he doesn't have an answer."

It's also a great stress-reliever if you're in the middle of an intense situation and need to take a breather for a few minutes. Just stare at yourself in the mirror, and make at least four funny faces at yourself, whether you're sticking out your tongues, snarling, bugging out your eyes, or gritting your teeth, until you make yourself crack up.

Only good will come of it. [16] X Research source Make a goal of saying yes at least 30% more in your every day life. Stop with the excuses.

You may think that scheduling time to be fun and carefree defeats the purpose of it, but in reality, making the time to be playful is half the battle. Set up a schedule that others can join in on, too. Host a weekly game night, for example, or schedule a weekly night out with your friends.
