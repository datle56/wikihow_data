      "content": "Attend cosmetology school if you want to offer services as a stylist. Trichologists help people with hair loss, alopecia, and other scalp disorders.

      "title": "Get a clinical certification if you want to focus on medicine.",
      "content": "Get a clinical certification if you want to focus on medicine. Clinical certifications take longer to complete and are more expensive. They’re more thorough and emphasize the medical components of trichology. This makes clinical certifications the best option if you plan on working with patients in a clinical context. To pass a clinical program, you typically have to complete an observation or residency with a practicing hair loss clinician."

      "title": "Select an associate certification if you want to style hair or assist.",
      "content": "Select an associate certification if you want to style hair or assist. Associate programs focus on the basics of scalp health and hair restoration. Associate certifications are the most efficient if you plan on working in a salon or at a hair restoration clinic as a clerk, consultant, or lab assistant. These certifications are cheaper and generally shorter than clinical certificates. [4] X Research source Some associate programs also focus on the business component of trichology. If you are hoping to work at a hair restoration clinic as a salesperson or marketing specialist, this is the best program for you."

      "content": "Look for an in-depth program with an academic component. If a program requires essays, coursework, and takes at least 6 months to complete, it’s probably a reputable program. You need to understand a lot about alopecia, hormonal therapy, skin oils, and infectious diseases, which requires a lot of research and reading. A rigorous program will prepare you to adequately help your future clients and patients. [5] X Research source In-depth clinical programs typically take 2–3 years to complete. Associate programs take roughly 6–18 months to complete. Trichology is a relatively new field. It can be difficult to figure out what is legitimate and not, so look into potential programs thoroughly to ensure that they’re academically rigorous."

      "content": "Avoid programs that advertise quick certifications. A high-quality trichology certification takes at least 6 months to complete. Stay away from programs that advertise certifications that you can earn in a few days or weeks. These programs won’t be very in-depth and you won’t be adequately prepared for a career in trichology. Look at a program’s syllabus to see how thorough the program actually is. [6] X Research source While trichologists are not doctors, they are expected to be certified. However, there are no regulations surrounding the certification process. This means that there are a lot of poor programs out there."
