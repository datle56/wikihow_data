      "content": "Grab their attention by starting with the most powerful message. Dunn says you only have 8 seconds to captivate your audience, so make sure your first sentence is the most powerful. If it’s not catchy, they might lose interest and keep scrolling. Gasper suggests connecting your post to what’s trending in pop culture. For example, if Taylor Swift is in the headlines, let one of her lyrics inspire your post. Dunn also recommends using 3 related hashtags to help get more likes. Try #movingon, #lettinggo, #newbeginnings, #freshstart, #release, #healing, and #growth. Instagram hides any part of a caption that’s longer than a few lines, so try to keep your captions on the shorter side."
