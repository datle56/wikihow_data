      "title": "Hologram tag",
      "content": "Hologram tag Every Canada Goose jacket produced since 2011 has a hologram tag sewn underneath the content label. The hologram shows an image of a polar bear. This tag is supposed to be proof of authenticity that your Canada Goose jacket is genuine. So if it's missing, then it's definitely not real! [1] X Research source If you do see a hologram, though, it could still be counterfeit. The fastest way to tell if it's real is to check if you have to lift the product label to see it. If the product label is not sewn above the hologram tag, then the jacket is fake. [2] X Research source Another way to tell if the hologram tag is fake is if it's sewn upside down relative to all the other tags. Keep in mind that Canada Goose has 2 different hologram designs: one produced before fall 2017 and one after that period. Find out the differences below. Pre-Fall 2017 hologram design : An adult polar bear standing on an iceberg. Post-Fall 2017 hologram design : An adult polar bear followed by 2 cubs. Authentic : Hologram tag with an image of a polar bear sewn right side up under the content label. Fake : No hologram tag; alternatively, a hologram tag sewn on upside down with no content label above it."

      "title": "Arctic Disc logo",
      "content": "Arctic Disc logo Every authentic Canada Goose jacket features an embroidered badge called the Arctic Disc, usually on the upper left arm. This badge shows the Canada Goose name and logo. A fake Arctic Circle might have thicker letters spelling out \"Canada Goose\" on the top and \"Arctic Program\" on the bottom; thicker and less detailed maple leaves on either side; a light blue instead of dark blue background; and clumsy blobs on the continent instead of the carefully stitched shapes that the real brand designed to resemble polar ice caps. [3] X Research source Authentic : Thin, legible letters with detailed maple leaves and distinctive polar ice caps Fake : Thick, hard-to-read letters, thicker maple leaves, and blobs for polar ice caps"

      "title": "Fur ruff",
      "content": "Fur ruff The fur ruffs on the edge of some Canada Goose jacket hoods are supposed to be made of real, thick coyote fur. The stitching that attaches the ruff to the hood is also perfect, with no loose seams. A counterfeit Canada Goose jacket often has a ruff made of raccoon fur or a synthetic material. It's also not as soft and full. Finally, it's usually poorly stitched, leading the ruff to detach from the hood after a couple of wears (or just straight out of the packaging). [4] X Research source Authentic : Very fluffy, high-density, genuine coyote fur. Fake : Thinner, less dense, less soft fur made from a different animal (or synthetic)"

      "title": "Neck tag",
      "content": "Neck tag When looking at the tag sewn at the back of the jacket collar, check for letters that are thick and hard to read or connected by threads. Those are indications that the tag was made quickly and sloppily by a counterfeit manufacturer. Another thing you can check is the size tag attached to the bottom of the neck tag. An authentic Canada Goose size tag is closer to the size of an adult's thumbnail. If the jacket is a Large, it should read \"L/G.\" If it's counterfeit, the size might be printed as \"L\" on a small tag almost half the surface area of the legitimate one. [5] X Research source Another easy way to tell if the neck tag is authentic is if it features a yellow outline of a goose instead of the Arctic Disc. This is called the Expedition tag and comes in jackets made prior to 2001. [6] X Research source Since it's older, you probably won't see many (if any) counterfeit versions of it. Authentic : Thin, separated letters and a large size tag. Fake : Thick letters connected by 1 or more threads and a smaller size tag."

      "title": "Content label",
      "content": "Content label The content label is a plain white tag with information about the Canada Goose jacket's style, size, and color at the top and manufacturer codes at the bottom. Counterfeiters sometimes leave the Style, Size, and Colour descriptions blank, whereas a real Canada Goose jacket always includes those details. If the descriptions are present, check that they match the product. For example, a fake Canada Goose jacket might describe the color as graphite, which is dark gray, when the actual color is solid black. [7] X Research source Authentic : Descriptions filled out and matched to the product. Fake : Descriptions missing or mismatched to the actual product."

A serial code is something the manufacturer uses to track the products they're making. If you can scan the code with your phone and go directly to the Canada Goose website, you've got a fake Canada Goose jacket on your hands!

      "content": "Pull tab Real Canada Goose jackets have at least one zipper with a fabric pull tab on it. The pull tab is black with the words \"Canada Goose\" printed in white across it. You may be able to tell if the jacket is authentic by ensuring the \"®\" symbol is present at the end of \"Goose\" and has white ink inside to suggest the presence of an \"R.\" If there is no \"®\" or the circle is empty, the jacket is counterfeit. Authentic : Completed \"®\" symbol at the end of \"Canada Goose.\" Fake : Missing or incomplete \"®\" symbol with no \"R\" inside the circle."

Pay attention to this tag for small errors like tiny threads connecting the letters. It may seem insignificant, but this error indicates that the stitching was done poorly and not up to Canada Goose's quality standards. Authentic : High-quality letter stitching with letters completely separated. Fake : Poor stitching with threads connecting some of the letters."

[9] X Research source If any of these designations are missing, then the jacket is most likely fake. Checking the zippers and buttons isn't always the most reliable way to spot a fake Canada Goose jacket, since some counterfeiters can now replicate Canada Goose's hardware. Authentic : The zippers have \"Vislon VKK USA\" stamped on the backs, and the snap buttons have \"Universal 61\" stamped on their backs. Fake : The zippers and snap buttons are missing the specific words above or aren't stamped at all."

In general, fake Canada Goose jackets tend to use product labels that feel thin and papery to the touch. The print quality may also be poor; the Arctic Disc on the front of the tag, for example, may have a thin white line around it. The barcode on the back may also be thick and slightly blurry instead of clear and crisp. [10] X Research source Authentic : Made of thick material with a clearly visible Arctic Disc, barcode, and other details. Fake : Made of thin, papery material with a white outline around the Arctic Disc, a blurry barcode, and other printing errors."

If it comes in a smaller bag made of plastic material that looks and feels cheap and thin, it's most likely coming from a counterfeiter. [11] X Research source To be sure the packaging is fake Canada Goose, check the \"®\" symbol at the end of the brand name. The circle is most likely empty.

Finally, beware of reviews that all sound the same (i.e., use the same language when describing the product). Some counterfeiters populate their websites with fake reviews to make it seem like they have a high customer satisfaction rate.

This scenario can happen if you bought the item secondhand from someone on social media. Regardless of who the seller is, though, if they won't accept a return, the next step is to report them.

A counterfeit is an item that imitates another brand's product and uses their trademarked name (without permission) to market it to consumers. This scheme is designed to trick people who like the original brand into buying a fake product instead, so the counterfeiters reap the profits. Counterfeiting is a serious crime in the United States, and the people who do it and get caught can go to prison and be forced to pay up to $30,000,000 in fines. [16] X Research source According to Canada Goose, many counterfeiters use feather mulch or other inferior fillers in their imitation jackets. These materials can have bacteria, fungus, or mold growing on them and potentially make the person wearing the jacket get sick. [17] X Research source There's also a serious possibility that the counterfeiters are using unethical business practices, such as making their products in factories that employ children as laborers."

The main reason so many people are worried about buying authentic Canada Goose jackets is that the real products are so well-made. Not only is the stitching strong and precise, but the materials are of premium quality. The jackets, for example, are filled with real goose or duck down, and the hoods are edged with genuine coyote fur. Many people prefer them over fake or imitation Canada Goose jackets that use cheaper materials, like faux fur or a higher percentage of feathers than down. Down is the soft fiber that insulates a goose's underside. Feathers are broader and denser, with a hard quill shaft in the center. They're located on top of the goose's body and their wings. [18] X Research source Canada Goose jackets typically have a 90/10 ratio of down to feathers."

Everest to the sets of popular movies like The Day After Tomorrow and National Treasure .
