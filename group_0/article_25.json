      "content": "There are 12 men on an island. 11 of them weigh exactly the same amount, but the other is slightly heavier or lighter. You have a seesaw to measure their weights, but you can only use it 3 times. Find the odd man out and determine if they’re heavier or lighter than the others. In some variations of the riddle, it’s 12 balls or coins instead of men."

If the seesaw drops on the ABCD side , a person in the ABCD group is heavier or a person in the EFGH group is lighter.

For the third weighing, compare L and any other person on the seesaw. If L’s side of the seesaw drops, they’re heavier. If it rises, then they’re lighter. If the IJK side drops , then one of them is heavier. For your third weighing, weigh I on one side and J on the other. If the seesaw drops on one side, then that person is heavier. If the seesaw balances, then K is heavier. If the IJK side rises , then one of them is lighter. On the third weighing, weigh I on one side and J on the other. If the seesaw rises one side, that person is lighter. If the seesaw stays level, then K is lighter."

      "content": "If the seesaw dropped on the ABCD side… Someone on the ABCD side is heavier or someone on the EFGH side is lighter. Place ABE on one side of the seesaw and use CDI on the other. This puts 2 potentially heavier and 1 potentially lighter person on one side, and 2 potentially heavier and 1 normal person on the other. [3] X Research source If the seesaw balances , then all the people on it weigh the same, and the odd person out is in the FGH group. For the third weighing, compare the weights of F and G. If one side rises up, that person is lighter. If the seesaw balances, F and G are the normal weight, and H is lighter. If the seesaw drops on the ABE side , then either A or B is heavier, and everyone else is the same weight. For the third weighing, put A on one side and B on the other. Whichever side drops has the heavier person. If the seesaw drops on the CDI side , then C or D is heavier, or E is lighter. For the third weighing, compare C and D on the seesaw. If it stays balanced, then E is lighter. If the seesaw drops on one side, then that person is heavier."

If the seesaw drops on the EFA side , then E or F is heavier, and everyone else is the same weight. On the third weighing, put E and F on opposite ends of the seesaw.

      "title": "Use the tilt of the seesaw to determine who's heavier or lighter.",
      "content": "Use the tilt of the seesaw to determine who's heavier or lighter. By arranging the men on the seesaw in particular patterns for each weighing, you can simply look at which way the seesaw tilts to determine which person is the odd one out and if they’re heavier or lighter. Use the following arrangements, and then compare your results to the table to determine which man weighs differently. [5] X Research source First weighing: ABFH and CDEG (IJKL unweighed) Second weighing: ABGI and FHJK (CDEL unweighed) Third weighing: EFIK and BCHL (ADGJ unweighed) How does it work? Each weighing has 3 potential outcomes: tilting left (L), tilting right (R), or staying balanced (=). If you’re doing 3 separate weighings, then there are 3 3 , or 27, unique combinations of results. For example, one set of results from the 3 weighings could be tilting left, left again, and then right, or LLR. It’s impossible to solve the riddle with the combinations LLL, RRR, or ===, so you can remove them. This leaves 24 possible combinations. There are 12 men, and each gets assigned 2 combinations: one if they’re heavier and its inverse if they’re lighter. For example, you can assign one man the LLR results as the heavier combo, and then use RRL as the lighter inverse. After assigning the possible results to each person, arrange the men so that anyone who has L listed for the first weighing is on the left side. Place anyone with an R on the right side. Do the same for the second and third weighings using the second and third outcomes in the set. For example, a man with the RLL combination will go on the right for the first weighing, and the left for the second and third weighings. This ensures that each person gets weighed and compared to the other men. Logic Pattern Solutions to the 12 Men Riddle First Weighing Second Weighing Third Weighing Odd Person Out Lighter or heavier?
