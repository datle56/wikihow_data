      "title": "Know your substrate type.",
      "content": "Know your substrate type. Not all sands are the same. If you are using standard play sand then you can rake and siphon it without too many worries regarding tank pollution. If, however, you have a specialty planting sand you’ll need to be very careful when raking as it can release ammonia and nitrates when disturbed. Read the instructions and warnings carefully on the package to find out if any special handling is necessary. [1] X Research source You can also visit your local aquarium store and talk with an expert who will advise you regarding your sand options. Some options, such as coral sand, are quite beautiful but can be dangerous to particular species of fish."

      "title": "Turn off the heater, filter, and all pumps.",
      "content": "Turn off the heater, filter, and all pumps. If they come with a switch, turn it to the off position or simply unplug all of these devices. Your fish will be fine in the short period it will take you to complete a water change and for safety reasons it is important to not have electricity running into the tank as you handle the water. [2] X Research source You can also take this as an opportunity to rinse out your filter pad or cartridge with cold water. You will want to do this once every two to four weeks. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Remove the plants and decorations.",
      "content": "Remove the plants and decorations. Dip your hand into the tank water and gently remove all decorations that you would like to clean. Wash these items in warm water scrubbing gently with your hands or a soft brush to remove all algae and debris. Place the clean decorations on a lint-free rag or into a clean bucket. [4] X Research source There is no need to remove live plants for cleaning. It can possibly damage their roots. Cleaning decorations is a bit controversial and some argue that it is better to leave everything in the tank to preserve healthy bacteria."

    {
      "title": "Siphon out a portion of the water.",
      "content": "Siphon out a portion of the water. Place your siphon into the water and begin to drain the water directly into your sink or a bucket. You need to remove between 10-25% of the water depending on the dirtiness of the tank. You will want to complete this partial water change and cleaning process every one to two weeks. This dirty water does not need to be preserved and you can dispose of it immediately."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prepare replacement water.",
      "content": "Prepare replacement water. Fill a clean bucket with tap water. Add drops of a water conditioner and wait a few minutes for it take full effect. The water conditioner will remove impurities and neutralize the chlorine in tap water making it safe for fish. Carefully read the instructions on your water conditioner bottle. The number of drops used varies as does the amount of time the water needs to sit."

      "title": "Scrape off algae.",
      "content": "Scrape off algae. Use a specialty algae scrubber or a lint-free cloth to gently rub the inside of your tank. Apply consistent and light pressure while making small circles on the surface. It is okay if pieces of algae fall to the sand as they will be siphoned up shortly. [5] X Research source Resist pushing too hard on your tank as it can cause damage or make the tank possibly tip over."

      "title": "Rake your fingers through the sand.",
      "content": "Rake your fingers through the sand. Place your fingers into the sand at the bottom of your tank. Gently push the sand from the bottom to the top. Repeat throughout the tank floor until all sand has been upturned. You will see that debris and deposits have settled on the surface of the sand. [6] X Research source It is sometimes helpful to go over the sand surface one time with the siphon prior to raking."

      "title": "Remove surface debris with a gravel siphon.",
      "content": "Remove surface debris with a gravel siphon. Lower your siphon until it is about ½ inch above the sand’s surface. Move the siphon in a back-and-forth pattern, holding the depth level, as you pick up debris and dirt. Target any particularly large particles. You can expect for the siphon to pick up some sand particles with this method. You can then re-rinse those particles and re-introduce them to the tank or you can throw them out. It is often a good idea to add in new sand every few weeks anyway. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Replace all decor.",
      "content": "Replace all decor. Take your time picking up the clean decorations and putting them back into the tank. You can follow the same pattern as before or you can mix it up with a new design. Make sure each piece is anchored and move around the freshly cleaned sand as needed."

    {
      "title": "Pour fresh water into the tank.",
      "content": "Pour fresh water into the tank. Replace the water that you removed by adding in the treated water to your tank. You can pour directly from the bucket, although that may disturb your tank and fish. A better option might be to use a jug to add the new water in slowly. [8] X Research source You can also deflect the water with a plate as it is added in which will lower the chance of damage even more."

    {
      "title": "Re-activate your heater, filter, and lighting.",
      "content": "Re-activate your heater, filter, and lighting. As soon as you’ve completed the water change you can plug all of your tank appliance back in. Watch to make sure that they are operating properly before leaving the tank alone. You may want to leave your tank light off for a few hours following a water change. This can help your fish to relax following what may have been a stressful event. Check the temperature of the replacement water with a thermometer before adding it to your tank. Both water temps should be roughly the same or you risk shocking your fish."

      "title": "Always rinse substrate before adding it.",
      "content": "Always rinse substrate before adding it. Get a large bucket (5 gallons) and place your new sand in the bottom. Use a sink sprayer attachment or a garden hose to spray into the sand. Keeping stirring and churning until dirt particles rise to the top. Pour this dirty water out and repeat the process. Keep going until the water is clear and your sand is ready for the tank. [9] X Research source Use cold water to rinse your sand, but allow it to reach room temperature before adding it to your tank. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a fine net for floating waste. Keep a small net near to your tank. Whenever you see any debris or dirt particles floating in the tank simply catch them in the net and dispose of them. This is especially important to do in the hour or so after feeding time.

As you make alterations to your tank décor keep in mind that items can get trapped under the sand and release toxins into the water as they decay. When you remove live plants make sure to take the roots out as well. Gently dig them out of the sand. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove sections of the substrate on a schedule. It is possible to replace entire sections of your sand substrate over the course of a few months. To do this you would use a gravel cleaner to pick up the dirty sand, replacing it with new, freshly-cleaned sand. [13] X Research source Be aware that this method may keep your tank clean but it can also stress out your fish and diminish the production of good bacteria."

      "content": "Get snails. Snails can help to minimize the growth of algae in your tank, leading to cleaner sand as well. They also dig into the sand and prevent stagnation. Go to your local aquarium store and learn about the different types of snails that could suit your particular tank. [14] X Research source"
