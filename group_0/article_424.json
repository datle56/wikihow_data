      "content": "Say “thank you.” Accept the compliment, but don't go on to brag about how beautiful you are. This shows that you are confident with yourself, but not full of yourself. [1] X Research source Being comfortable in your own skin is attractive, so embrace the compliment and try to be genuinely grateful for it. That isn't always easy, but it will come more naturally if you work on loving yourself and overcoming self-doubt. [2] X Expert Source Erika Kaplan Matchmaker Expert Interview. 1 October 2020."

      "content": "Show you care. If the compliment means a lot to you, follow up by saying something like “I really appreciate it” or “that was really encouraging to hear.” Show your boyfriend how the compliment makes you feel and how much value it holds to you. You could even follow it up with a hug and a kiss to be sweet. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Ask him a casual question.",
      "content": "Ask him a casual question. Say, \"aww, do you think so?\" or “really?” This is not denying the compliment, but not being smug. As long as you follow this with something like \"you're not so bad yourself,\" \"I love you\" or \"you are so sweet,\" he won't feel pressured to answer. You are thanking him, plus returning a compliment."

    {
      "title": "Make eye contact.",
      "content": "Make eye contact. Look up at your boyfriend as he's giving you the compliment, and try to form an inviting facial expression. Doing this will let him know you are listening and you appreciate his compliment. Looking down will make you appear disinterested. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Keep a positive tone of voice.",
      "content": "Keep a positive tone of voice. Try to sound like the compliment has made you happy rather than uncomfortable. Respond to your boyfriend with a lighthearted tone in your voice and delivery. Try not to seem uncomfortable or awkward—that will make you seem less confident.

      "title": "Be flirtatious",
      "content": "Be flirtatious . You don't have to flatter him, but it might be nice to pay him a compliment if the moment calls for it. Return the favor and tell your boyfriend what you love about him. You could simply say, “thanks, handsome” or “I was just thinking about how handsome you are.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid contradicting the compliment.",
      "content": "Avoid contradicting the compliment. Saying \"I'm not\" will show people you lack confidence or are seeking attention. This person obviously thinks you're beautiful, so accept the compliment. Don't protest or he might not say it again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try not to protest.",
      "content": "Try not to protest. \"You are sweet, but...\" Saying \"you are sweet\" is good, but then going on to protest or even carrying on as though the compliment never was said is bad. It makes him feel unappreciated, and he might not compliment you again."

    {
      "title": "Try not to sound smug or conceited.",
      "content": "Try not to sound smug or conceited. Saying \"I know!\" is another poor answer. You don't thank him at all, and it makes it seem like you're full of yourself. Confidence is good, but nobody likes smugness."

      "title": "Avoid fishing for more compliments.",
      "content": "Avoid fishing for more compliments. Saying \"how am I?\" is just fishing for compliments. He's given you one, so try not to sound greedy or big-headed. He'll feel pressure to answer you or feel he needs to give you more compliments, and if he fails to answer, you'll be hurt."

      "title": "Avoid showering him with compliments.",
      "content": "Avoid showering him with compliments. Just because he paid you a compliment doesn't mean you have to one-up him. If you must compliment him back, you can say something like, “you're not so bad yourself.” Just avoid overdoing it, and don't try to divert the attention from yourself.
