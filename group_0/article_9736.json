[2] X Research source We call the first three digits 1s place, the 10s place, the 100s place — but we could also write this as the 10 0 place, the 10 1 place, and the 10 2 place. Octal, or the base 8 number system, uses powers of 8 instead of powers of 10. Write a few of these powers of 8 in a horizontal line, from largest to smallest. Note that these numbers are all written in decimal (base 10): 8 2 8 1 8 0 Rewrite these as single numbers: 64 8 1 You don't need any powers of 8 larger than your original number (in this case, 98). Since 8 3 = 512, and 512 is larger than 98, we can leave it off the chart."

Divide 98 by 64 to find out. The easiest way to do this is to make a chart, reading top to bottom: [3] X Research source 98 ÷ 64 8 1 = 1 ← This is the first digit of your octal number."

The first division problem divides these into groups, with 8 units in each group. Anything left over, the remainder, doesn't fit into the octal 8s place. It must be in the 1s place instead. Now you take your pile of groups, and divide them into sections with 8 groups each. Each section now has 8 groups with 8 units each, or 64 units total. The remainder doesn't fit into these, so it can't fit into the octal 64s place. It must be in the 8s place. This continues until you discover the entire number."
