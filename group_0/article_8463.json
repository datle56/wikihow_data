      "content": "Check the refrigerator’s manual to find where the drip pan is located. Drip pans are usually located in the front or rear of your fridge, but it may vary depending on the model you have. Look at the diagrams for your fridge inside the manual to find the drip pan. The manual may also list if you can remove the drip pan or if you need to clean it while it’s still in your fridge. [1] X Research source If you can’t find the owner’s manual for your fridge at home, look online since the manufacturer may have it available to download from their website."

      "content": "Disconnect the water and power supply if you need to access the back panel. If your fridge’s drip pan is in the rear, then pull your fridge out from the wall so you can access it. Find the water supply control if your fridge has one and turn it to the off position so it doesn’t leak. Then unplug your fridge so you don’t accidentally shock yourself while working on the interior components. [2] X Research source The food in your fridge will stay cold for a short time if you’re only cleaning the drip pan. If you’re deep-cleaning your fridge, then move your food into an insulated storage container or another refrigerator."

      "content": "Unscrew the back panel if the drip pan is in the rear. Locate the screws or hex bolts that hold the back panel on the bottom of your fridge in place. Use a screwdriver or a hex wrench to rotate the screws counterclockwise to loosen them. Once you remove all of the screws, carefully pull the back panel off the fridge and set it aside. [3] X Research source Keep the screws in a small bowl or container so you don’t lose them. Many drip pans located in the rear of the fridge cannot be removed easily, so you need to clean it without taking it out."

Open the doors on your fridges so you can access the top of the kick panel, which is the slotted grate on the bottom of the fridge. Slide a putty knife between your fridge and the kick panel to pop it off. Once you pop one side of the kick panel out, pull it completely off of the fridge and set it aside. [4] X Research source You do not need to remove the water filter on the bottom of your fridge if it has one."

Grab the drip pan with both hands and try pulling it out without tipping it over. If your drip pan can be removed, then it will come out of the fridge easily. Otherwise, it cannot be removed.

Pour the water down your sink drain to get rid of it. After emptying the drip pan, set it in your sink so you can start cleaning.

Spray the drip pan so it’s completely wet and let the bleach solution sit on the surface for 2-3 minutes. Spray extra cleaner on any mold or mildew you see building up on the drip pan to help loosen it and disinfect the area.

Hold the button on the end of a flexible claw grabber to open it and place a wet wipe inside the claw. Let go of the button so the claw holds tightly onto the cloth. [12] X Research source You can buy a flexible claw grabber from your local hardware store or online. If you don’t have a flexible claw grabber, then you can unbend a wire hanger and wrap the wet wipe around one end of it."

When you’re finished, you can reattach any panels you needed to remove to access the pan. [15] X Research source Use white vinegar if you want to use a natural cleaner."
