Fill up your sink with hot, soapy water and put any removable burner caps or grates in it to soak while you work on the stove top. This will help remove any crusted food or grease from the burner elements, and also make it easier to clean the stove around your burners. [1] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source When you’re done cleaning your stove, scrub the burner elements with a scouring pad and rinse them off before putting them back on the stove. If your burners aren’t removable or have electric components, don’t soak them. Instead, lay a warm, wet cloth over the coils, being careful not to get the electric parts wet, and wipe them down with a paper towel instead of rinsing them."
