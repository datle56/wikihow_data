      "title": "Look at a color wheel.",
      "content": "Look at a color wheel. Ask your orthodontist, or whoever is handling your braces, if they have a color wheel. A color wheel is a list of colors that you can use for braces. Do this before you get the braces so that you won't have to choose the colors on the spot. Study the shades on the color wheel. Keep in mind that the colors will look a bit lighter on your braces. Look at a color wheel online if you get a chance. Type in \"braces color wheel\" in a search engine and look for an interactive color wheel that lets you put the colors onto a picture of a mouth with braces. Experiment with different colors you might want to wear. Keep in mind that the colors you find online might not be offered by your orthodontist."

      "content": "Pick meaningful colors. You can pair colors together, so you could consider using your braces to make a statement of some sort. Consider different combinations of colors, such as: Your national colors. Red, white, and blue for America; red, white, and green for Mexico, etc. Your school colors. Your favorite sports team's colors. Holiday colors. Red and green for Christmas; black and orange for Halloween, etc. Colors of the rainbow (not always available). Your favorite color(s)."

      "content": "Pick colors that work well with your skin. Consider colors that work well with your natural skin type and/or hair. Your skin type and hair color will have a big impact on the way your braces look. Choose colors that will work well with you, not colors that will clash with your hair or your skin type. [1] X Research source Darker skin tones and hair colors might look good in gold, dark blue, turquoise, orange, anise green, pastel blue, fuchsia, pink, or violet, although colors may depend on the person. Lighter skin tones and hair colors might look good in petrol blue, vermilion, bronze, caramel, salmon, green khaki, raspberry, bluish-red, plum, blue-green, and royal blue, although colors may depend on the person."

If your wardrobe features a lot of primary colors, getting braces in another primary color might be a good idea. If your clothes feature a lot of neon colors, getting braces in a neutral color (clear braces, for example) might be a good idea. Don't be afraid to think ahead!"

      "content": "Eliminate the “ugly” colors. Rule out unsatisfying colors, strange colors, or your least favorite colors. Braces in bands that are black can look like little pieces of food stuck in your teeth. White seems like it would be a great choice, but, in fact, makes teeth look more yellow."

If you're at school, consider bringing a small portable toothbrush with you to brush after snack and lunch. Try to hit all the teeth in your mouth; consider using a timer to time yourself so that you end up brushing for long enough.

Flossing gets between the teeth where the toothbrush won't reach, promoting healthier gums. Flossing with braces, however, can be a real pain. Use a floss threader to get the floss in between the gums, and then work in between each pair of teeth.

You can change the color of your braces every time you have an appointment to get them tightened. Most orthodontists schedule appointments like this every 6 to 8 weeks."
