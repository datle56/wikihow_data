      "content": "Use cornstarch on oil or grease stains. If the stain is fresh, try to soak up as much of it as you can with a paper towel, but try hard not to press the stain into the material. Once you have soaked up the oil, sprinkle a generous amount of cornstarch onto the stain, and pat it in. Leave it there overnight so that the cornstarch can soak up the oil. Gently brush the cornstarch off the following morning using a soft-bristled brush. If you can't find cornstarch where you live, use corn flour instead. Some people find that placing their purse under a light bulb helps the cornstarch absorb the oil better. If you are working with suede, you may need to dampen the area with steam afterward, then brush the rest of the cornstarch off. [6] X Research source"
