These USB connections only fit into ports one way, so if it doesn't go in the first time, flip it 180 degrees and try again. Once your Kindle Paperwhite starts charging, the LED light next to your cable will light amber, to indicate that the battery is charging. On the screen, you'll see a lightning bolt icon in the battery icon that's in the top right corner. The light turns green when it's full. From a dead or drained battery, a full charge might take around 3 hours using a computer."
