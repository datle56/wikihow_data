Taking time for your passions will help you find love within yourself, and that self-love will only make you more attractive and interesting to potential friends and lovers.

      "content": "To be loved, you have to be vulnerable. When you meet new people, be yourself and resist the urge to pretend to be someone you're not. Though it can be tough, try your best to be comfortable with yourself, your interests, and even your quirks. People admire and love those who own who they are and aren't afraid to flaunt what makes them unique. [4] X Research source Being yourself can be hard at first. If you're still figuring out who you are, that's totally okay! Keep pursuing what makes you happy, avoid the urge to compare yourself to other people, and embrace what makes you unique."

      "content": "This is a way to show people that you really care about their perspective. When someone is speaking to you, put your phone away, make eye contact, and focus your attention on their words. After they're done speaking, rephrase what they said to make sure you understood them correctly. Being an attentive listener will strengthen your relationships and make people love talking to you. [5] X Research source Avoid listening to people just to think of your response. Instead, take a moment after the person is done speaking to think of what you'll say next."

      "content": "Tell people how you really feel, good and bad. Open up to people about how much you care about them. When you run into conflict with someone, be open about that, too. Broach the subject in a calm, respectful manner and use \"I\" statements that communicate your feelings without making the person feel defensive. Your genuine, thoughtful words will help you cultivate loving friendships and relationships. [6] X Research source It can feel pretty vulnerable to tell someone how much you appreciate them. Try something simple like, \"You're the funniest person I've ever met\" or \"You always make me smile.\" An example of an \"I\" statement would be, \"I feel a little hurt when you text while I'm talking. I know you don't mean anything by it, but it'd make me feel better if we didn't text while we talked to each other.\" Part of cultivating loving, healthy relationships is getting through conflict together. When in doubt, try to empathize with the other person's perspective and come up with a solution that you both feel good about."

Do nice things for your friends and family, like giving them rides to work or listening when they need someone to talk to. Practice patience if you find yourself getting frustrated with someone and try to see their perspective if you don't get along. Your kindness will make people drawn to and appreciate you. If a friend of yours mentions that they had a bad day, see if there's anything you can do to help. You might say, \"I'm sorry you're upset. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?\" Other things you can do to be nice to new people include saying hello, complimenting them, and asking them how their day is going."
