      "title": "Remove the stem by cutting it off at the base.",
      "content": "Remove the stem by cutting it off at the base. If you’re harvesting your own aloe vera, choose large stems to extract the most raw aloe. Cut the stem at its base with a knife, right where it connects to the main part of the plant. Rinse any dirt off of the stem so it’s nice and clean. [1] X Research source If you’re harvesting from your own aloe plant, don’t cut away all of the stems or you could damage or potentially kill the plant. 2 large aloe vera stems can yield up to 1 pound (0.45 kg) of raw aloe."

      "title": "Cut off the first 1–2 centimetres (0.39–0.79 in) from the base of the stem.",
      "content": "Cut off the first 1–2 centimetres (0.39–0.79 in) from the base of the stem. Use your knife and find a spot just above the base of the stem. Make a clean cut straight across to remove a small section. Cut away similarly sized sections from all of the aloe vera stems you’re using. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Soak the raw aloe in water for 5 minutes to remove the alonin.",
      "content": "Soak the raw aloe in water for 5 minutes to remove the alonin. Alonin is the yellow sap on the raw aloe gel. The alonin is a laxative that can upset your stomach, so fill a bucket or container with clean water and soak the stems in the water for 5 minutes to remove it. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Peel off the outer skin with a knife.",
      "content": "Peel off the outer skin with a knife. Slide the sharp edge of your knife just under the outer peel of the aloe vera stem. Run the knife up the length of stem to peel away the outer layer of skin. Remove all of the green skin from each of the stems so you’re left with the raw aloe gel. [4] X Research source Your knife will glide easily through the aloe gel, so take your time and try to remove just the peel so you can keep as much raw aloe as possible."

      "title": "Pick off any bits of peel left on the aloe.",
      "content": "Pick off any bits of peel left on the aloe. The outer peel is bitter and tough, so remove all of it. Inspect the raw aloe gel after you peel the skin away and use your fingers to pick off any stubborn green bits left behind. [5] X Research source"

Pour in the lime juice and swirl the pan around to mix them together. [7] X Research source Raw aloe can be super slippery and difficult to grip, so you may want to use a spoon to scoop it up."

Stir the mixture well so it’s fully combined and will cook evenly. [8] X Research source If you don’t have cane sugar, you can use refined sugar."

      "content": "Cook the aloe over medium-low heat until it’s no longer slimy. Put the saucepan on a burner on your stovetop and set the temperature to medium-low so it doesn’t burn the aloe. Stir the aloe occasionally so it doesn’t stick to the saucepan. When the raw aloe slightly solidifies and isn’t slimy, remove the saucepan from the heat. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Mix poached aloe vera into a soup for a savory option. Because aloe doesn’t have a strong flavor, you can use it to add substance to your soups and stews. Season the aloe with savory spices instead of sugar before you poach it. Then, spoon the aloe into a soup or stew as it cooks and enjoy it when it’s finished. [11] X Research source"
