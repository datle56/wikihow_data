These cables are also called USB networking cables, as they can \"network\" two computers through USB ports. Bridging cables look similar to male-to-male USB cables, but with chips in the middle of the cable (encased in hard plastic) that enable file transfers. [1] X Research source USB bridging cables come in many forms, including USB-A to USB-A (standard USB on both ends) and USB-A to USB-C. Check both the desktop and the laptop to see what types of USB ports they have, and make sure to get the right cable."

To see if each Mac has an Intel processor, perform these steps on both computers: Click the Apple menu and select About This Mac .
