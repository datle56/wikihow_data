      "title": "Remove your lobster tails from the freezer 24 hours in advance.",
      "content": "Remove your lobster tails from the freezer 24 hours in advance. Take out as many tails as you plan on cooking, and start thawing the night before, at least. Keep in mind that by defrosting them in the fridge, you can always refreeze them again if you change your mind and need to hold off on cooking them. [1] X Research source Cooking lobster tails straight from frozen results in tough or overly chewy meat, so it’s best to thaw the tails before cooking. Browse the seafood section of your grocery store's freezer aisles for lobster tails. They may also be available at the deli or meat counter."

      "title": "Arrange the tails on a plate and cover them with plastic wrap.",
      "content": "Arrange the tails on a plate and cover them with plastic wrap. Place the tails on a plate or in a bowl so they're not stacked, which will allow them to thaw evenly. Then, wrap them with plastic wrap so they don't absorb flavors mingling in the fridge’s air as they defrost. [2] X Research source If the tails are already in a single layer and in a package, you can leave them in the package. The wrapper will prevent juices from leaking in your fridge as the tails thaw. Alternatively, place the lobster tails in a single layer inside a large food storage bag. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Refrigerate the tails for 24 hours or until they're completely thawed.",
      "content": "Refrigerate the tails for 24 hours or until they're completely thawed. Check on the lobster tails after you've defrosted them for 1 day. [4] X Research source Remove the wrapping and try to bend a tail. If it's defrosted completely, it will be flexible and will bend easily. If the tail is still stiff or icy, refrigerate it for another 2 hours and check it again."

      "title": "Use kitchen shears to cut through the top shell of each tail.",
      "content": "Use kitchen shears to cut through the top shell of each tail. Place the defrosted tails on your work surface and get out a clean pair of kitchen shears. Hold the tail firmly while you cut lengthwise through the shell. Avoid cutting the meat, so that the tail remains in a single piece, and stop cutting before you get to the tail fin. [6] X Research source If you don't have kitchen shears, use a sharp knife, and practice caution as you slice."

      "title": "Pull open each shell to expose the meat.",
      "content": "Pull open each shell to expose the meat. Use your fingers to gently pull apart the sides of the shells you just cut. Expose the meat of the lobster, but don't pull so hard that you tear the shell off completely. [7] X Research source Ideally, pull away the shell so that the meat looks like it's sitting on top of the shell, which will protect the meat as it cooks."

Heat the water until it begins to boil and you see steam escaping from under the lid. Then, wear oven mitts to carefully remove the lid and add salt to season the water. [8] X Research source Use about 1 tbsp (17 g) of salt for every 4 cups (0.95 L) of water you add to the pot."

Keep the lid off of the pot and boil the tails until they turn bright red. Test them for doneness by sticking a skewer into a tail—the meat will be tender once it's finished cooking, and the skewer will be easy to insert. Boil the tails for 5 minutes per 1 lb (16 oz).
