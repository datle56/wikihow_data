      "title": "Rinse the rice.",
      "content": "Rinse the rice. Measure 2 cups (470 ml) brown basmati rice, and pour it into a medium-sized bowl of cold tap water. Use your hand to swish the rice around until the water becomes cloudy-looking and foam appears on the edges. Pour out the water through a mesh strainer or by tilting the bowl to the side. Add more cool tap water and repeat this process until the water is clear. This could require up to 10 rounds of washing the rice. [1] X Research source While rinsing can wash away some of the rice's nutrients, brown basmati rice is typically imported and may be processed with talc, powdered glucose, and rice powder. Rice connoisseurs, therefore, recommend rinsing it. Doing so will also get rid of some of the starch, which will help make your rice less gluey."

      "title": "Combine the rinsed rice and cold water to soak.",
      "content": "Combine the rinsed rice and cold water to soak. Add 2.5 cups (590 ml) cold water to the drained and rinsed rice and let it soak between 30 minutes to 24 hours depending upon the method of cooking and how long you want to cook it. The longer you allow it to soak, the less time it will take to cook. After the rice is done soaking, drain the water from it using a strainer. Additionally, basmati rice is known for its rich flavor, which can be lost during the heating process. Soaking it reduces cooking time, thus preserving more of its flavor. Soaking rice also improves its texture, making it softer and lighter."

      "title": "Prepare the water and add salt.",
      "content": "Prepare the water and add salt. Add 2.5 cups (590 ml) water to a medium-sized cooking pot with a lid on the stovetop. In order for the rice to cook properly, make sure the lid has a tight seal so heat and steam aren't released. Next add about 1 teaspoon (5 ml) salt to the water. As with pasta, salt is used to bring out the natural flavor in rice so it won't taste bland. It's not used to make it taste salty. [2] X Research source Always make sure your pot isn't too small because the rice will triple in volume once cooked. Season the brown rice with other flavors if you want to go beyond just salt."

      "title": "Mix the rice and water.",
      "content": "Mix the rice and water. Pour 2 cups (470 ml) rinsed and pre-soaked brown basmati rice to the pot and use a spoon to mix the rice with the water. [3] X Research source This is the only time you'll stir the rice until it's done. Stirring it while it's cooking activates the starch and makes it either sticky or creamy. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Bring it to a boil and then simmer.",
      "content": "Bring it to a boil and then simmer. Turn the burner to high. Once the water comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-40 minutes until all the water is absorbed. [5] X Research source [6] X Research source The time difference is largely based on how long you soaked the rice. If you soaked it for 30 minutes, your cook time will be closer to 40 minutes. If you soaked it overnight, your cook time will be closer to 15 minutes. It's very important to turn down the heat and to simmer once the water boils. Rice that's cooked too fast on high heat will be hard because the water will evaporate. The kernels will also break. [7] X Research source"

If the rice is tender and the water has fully absorbed, it's ready. If not, continue cooking another 2-4 minutes. You may need to add more water if it's not tender but the water has been fully absorbed. Start slowly by adding just a 1 ⁄ 4 cup (60 ml) of water."

Place a folded kitchen towel over the pot, and promptly replace the lid. [8] X Research source The towel will help to steam the rice, making it fluffier. It also absorbs extra moisture that would otherwise fall back onto the rice. [9] X Research source"

Many rice cookers come with a dry measuring cup. However, they’re often only equivalent to 3/4 of a standard cup. Don’t use metal utensils when mixing or scooping because they can damage the non-stick coating of the inner pots."

      "title": "Put on the lid and turn it to cook.",
      "content": "Put on the lid and turn it to cook. Generally, rice cookers have two settings – cook and warm – so make sure you select cook. This will bring the water to a boil very quickly. Once the rice has absorbed all the water, the temperature will rise past the boiling point of water (100˚C/212˚F). At this point, most rice cookers will then automatically switch to the warm setting. This will typically take about 30 minutes. The warm setting will hold the rice at a safe serving temperature until you turn off the cooker."
