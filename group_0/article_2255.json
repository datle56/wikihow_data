      "title": "Try a lighter foundation shade.",
      "content": "Try a lighter foundation shade. If you notice your foundation turns an unpleasant shade of orange whenever you use it, you may want to try going one to two shades lighter than your normal shade. Sometimes, using a lighter shade can make your foundation appear less dark and make any oxidation less noticeable on your skin. The lighter shade will help to counteract the appearance of an orange tinge on your skin, even if oxidation does occur. [1] X Research source You may try using a foundation that is one shade lighter than your normal shade in the same brand or switch to a brand that has a wider variety of shades. Make sure you test the foundation properly on your face to ensure the shade is not too light and will still blend well into your skin."

      "title": "Avoid foundations that contain SPF.",
      "content": "Avoid foundations that contain SPF. Foundation with SPF is made of ingredients like zinc and titanium. These ingredients can then interact with the color products in the foundation, leading to a change in the shade color. You may opt for a foundation that does not contain SPF so you can avoid a reaction on your face that can lead to an orange tinge. Instead, you may invest in a setting powder that contains SPF so your skin is still protected from the sun but it is not at risk of turning orange."

      "title": "Test the foundation before you use it.",
      "content": "Test the foundation before you use it. You should always test makeup on your skin before you commit to using it full time. You may try wearing a small patch of the foundation on the side of your face for a few hours to make sure it does not react with your skin and create an orange tinge. Or you may apply a full face of foundation and test it out at home for a few hours to ensure the shade does not change color. [2] X Research source You should test out all of your makeup products, from foundation to primer to eyeshadow, before you commit to using them on a day to day basis. This will ensure your skin does not have a negative reaction to any of the products."

      "title": "Use a mattifying primer.",
      "content": "Use a mattifying primer. If you have oily skin, you may be more susceptible to ending up with orange looking foundation. This is because the oils in your skin can interact with the foundation and change the shade. You can counteract excess oil on your skin by using a mattifying primer on your face before you apply foundation. Use a clean makeup brush to apply the mattifying primer on clean, exfoliated skin. This will ensure your foundation goes on smooth and is less likely to change shades."

      "title": "Make sure your face is dry before you apply foundation.",
      "content": "Make sure your face is dry before you apply foundation. It is also important that you let each product you use dry well on your face before layering or adding more product to it. Having excess moisture on your face can cause your skin to react with your foundation and lead to a change in the foundation shade. Once you apply a makeup primer or a face moisturizer, let the product dry. Use your fingers to lightly touch your face to make sure the product has dried before you apply any foundation. You can also use blotting paper or a clean tissue to lightly dab away any excess moisture on your face, particularly on your T-zone area. This would be your forehead, your nose, and your chin."

    {
      "title": "Dab on the foundation.",
      "content": "Dab on the foundation. Always apply your foundation properly and evenly so it appears fresh and clean on your face. Dabbing the foundation on with clean fingertips or using a clean makeup brush to stipple on the foundation will ensure it dries properly. It can also help to reduce the likelihood of the foundation appearing cakey, thick, or orange. Try to apply one even layer of the foundation by dabbing or stippling it onto your skin. Blend the foundation in with clean fingers or a clean makeup sponge. Never sweep, rub, or smear on the foundation."

      "title": "Go for a setting powder that matches your foundation.",
      "content": "Go for a setting powder that matches your foundation. You can try using a setting powder to help keep your foundation looking fresh and to avoid an orange tinge later on. Look for a setting powder that is the same brand as your foundation, as this will ensure the two products will react well with each other. Using a setting powder made by a different brand can lead to a negative reaction on your skin and oxidization, which can lead to an orange look. [3] X Research source Check that your foundation is dry before you apply setting powder. Use a clean makeup brush to apply the setting powder and make sure the setting powder sits on your skin in one, even layer."

      "title": "Use blotting papers on any oily areas.",
      "content": "Use blotting papers on any oily areas. You can maintain your foundation throughout the day or night by keeping blotting papers with you. Check your foundation periodically and use the blotting papers to remove any oily areas on your skin. Removing excess oil can help to prevent oxidization and keep your foundation shade from changing color. Always dab at any oily areas with the blotting papers or a clean tissue. Avoid rubbing or scrubbing any oily areas, as this will only ruin your foundation and can lead to breakouts or irritation on your skin."

      "title": "Moisturize your skin.",
      "content": "Moisturize your skin. You should make sure your skin is hydrated so it does not become dry or flaky. Use a water-based moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated, especially if you have oily skin. Try to get into the habit of applying moisturizer in the morning and at night so your skin stays hydrated. Skin that is dehydrated can end up producing too much oil, leading to oily skin. Oily skin can then cause a reaction with foundation that can lead to a change in the shade."

      "title": "Switch foundations if it continues to turn orange.",
      "content": "Switch foundations if it continues to turn orange. If you notice that your foundation continues to appear orange despite adjusting your foundation shade or type, you may need to switch to a different brand. Try several different brands to find the one that is right for you. Finding the right foundation for your skin can be tricky, so do not be afraid to ask a salesperson for help. You may also want to ask for samples of different foundations and test them all out to find the right brand and shade for your skin type."
