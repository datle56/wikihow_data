      "title": "Rub a nail file gently against the Nubuck.",
      "content": "Rub a nail file gently against the Nubuck. Rub the nail file in the direction that smooths the Nubuck, instead of the direction that makes all the little fibers stand upright. This will remove dust particles stuck in the Nubuck pores. Using this method too often can damage your boots, so only use a nail file for occasional cleanings, not routine ones."

      "title": "Remove scuff marks with a cleaning gum, if you have one.",
      "content": "Remove scuff marks with a cleaning gum, if you have one. A cleaning gum is basically a huge eraser, made specifically for cleaning shoes. You can use it to erase scuff marks from your boots. Just rub the cleaning gum gently against the scuff mark until it disappears."

      "content": "Erase scuff marks with a pencil eraser, if you don’t have a cleaning gum. A pencil eraser is an affordable alternative to a cleaning gum, and does almost as good a job. Just rub the eraser gently against the scuff marks, and wipe away the eraser shavings with your hand."

      "title": "Wipe small stains with baby wipes.",
      "content": "Wipe small stains with baby wipes. The baby wipes should dissolve the stains without damaging the Nubuck. But you should only use them to target specific stains. Don’t rub the baby wipes over the whole boot, because that wouldn’t be good for the Nubuck."

    {
      "title": "Stuff your boots with newspaper and wipe them with a dry rag.",
      "content": "Stuff your boots with newspaper and wipe them with a dry rag. The newspaper will help the boots keep their shape and prevent you from dripping any water into the insides of the boots. With the rag, try to get off as much of the visible dirt and mud as possible. Rub the boots gently so that you don’t end up rubbing the dirt further into the Nubuck. You can also use a shoe tree designed for boots instead of newspaper.

      "title": "Scrub your boots with a soapy toothbrush.",
      "content": "Scrub your boots with a soapy toothbrush. Squirt a bit of dish soap into a bowl of water. Dip a clean toothbrush into the bowl and then rub the dirty spot on your boot with the toothbrush. Use this method sparingly because too much water can stain Nubuck. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Allow your boots to air-dry overnight before cleaning further.",
      "content": "Allow your boots to air-dry overnight before cleaning further. Don’t use heat to dry your boots, because heat can damage Nubuck. Just let them sit in a well-ventilated spot overnight. [3] X Research source Never put your boots in the dryer since the heat could damage them.

      "title": "Brush your dry boots with a suede brush.",
      "content": "Brush your dry boots with a suede brush. Gently glide the suede brush over your boots in the direction of the fiber. This will protect the nap of your boots, fluff up the suede, and remove dirt. An old toothbrush works as an affordable replacement for a suede brush.

      "title": "Apply a small bit of white vinegar to tough stains.",
      "content": "Apply a small bit of white vinegar to tough stains. Really tough stains will only dissolve with a stronger solvent. White vinegar is good because it is perfectly clear, and won’t leave any marks as it dissolves the stain. The downside is, it might make your boots smell like vinegar. But after a little while the scent will disappear."

      "title": "Spray your clean boots with a waterproofing agent.",
      "content": "Spray your clean boots with a waterproofing agent. Spray your boots all over with a waterproofing agent to protect them from future stains and scuffs. [6] X Expert Source Marc Sigal Shoe Care Specialist Expert Interview. 15 January 2020. Waterproofing is especially important if you live somewhere with a lot of rain. Hold the spray can at least 6 inches (15 cm) from the boots while you’re spraying. [7] X Research source Stuff your boots with crumpled newspaper to avoid spraying inside the boots. Ventilate your room by opening windows to prevent inhaling aerosolized particles. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Let the boots dry for 2 hours before applying another coat.",
      "content": "Let the boots dry for 2 hours before applying another coat. The boots may not be completely dry in only 2 hours, but they will be dry enough for a second coat. Let the boots air dry. Don’t try to speed up the drying process by exposing them to excess heat, because that can warp and damage Nubuck."

    {
      "title": "Spray your boots with a second coat of waterproofing agent.",
      "content": "Spray your boots with a second coat of waterproofing agent. Again, hold the spray can at least 6 inches (15 cm) from the boots. Applying 2 coats will make sure your boots can withstand water better."

      "title": "Let the boots dry overnight before wearing or handling them.",
      "content": "Let the boots dry overnight before wearing or handling them. Your boots will now be able to withstand light rain without getting stained. But they’re still not rain boots, so don’t go puddle-stomping in them."

      "title": "Avoid wearing the same pair of boots every single day.",
      "content": "Avoid wearing the same pair of boots every single day. Let your boots air out in between wearings, so that the sweat can evaporate. This will make your boots last longer and smell fresher. If Nubuck boots are your work boots, consider getting a second, identical, pair of boots, so you can switch them out every other day.
