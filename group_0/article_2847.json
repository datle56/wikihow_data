      "content": "Be well groomed and appropriately dressed. You should come into work every day clean and well groomed to ensure you have a professional appearance. You will also need to dress professionally based on the expected attire of your workplace. Avoid clothing that is too tight or too revealing and if you think something may not be appropriate for your workplace, don't wear it. Gauge the dress expectations of your workplace by noticing what other employers are wearing. If everyone is wearing conservative attire, with suits, collared shirts, and long skirts, adjust your attire accordingly. Many workplaces have a business casual dress code, which may allow slacks or jeans as long as you still appear professional. Be mindful of bright colors and busy patterns as well. If possible, cover any tattoos and remove any piercings, unless your superiors are fine with you exposing them."
