      "content": "Keep your eyes on the football. You want to be watching the football the entire time it's in the air. Pick a spot on the football - the white strip or the tip of the ball - and lock your eyes on that spot until the ball is in your hands. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use your fingers to catch the football, not your palms. Your fingers should be the first thing to come into contact with the ball. Make sure they're slightly bent and ready to grab onto the ball when it comes your way. [2] X Research source If you're hearing a loud thud noise every time you catch the ball, you might be catching with your palms and not your fingers. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Catch the football with soft hands.",
      "content": "Catch the football with soft hands. Soft hands are when your fingers and wrists are flexible and slightly relaxed. You want your hands to give a little bit when they come into contact with the ball. Catching with stiff, hard hands makes it more likely that the ball will bounce off you when you try to catch it.

      "title": "Keep your arms extended away from your body.",
      "content": "Keep your arms extended away from your body. Whether you're catching a regular pass (above the waist) or a low pass (below the waist), you want your arms to be slightly bent and extended outward. Extending your arms will give them room to respond to the impact when you catch the ball. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Raise your hands so they're in line with where the football is heading.",
      "content": "Raise your hands so they're in line with where the football is heading. You want to track which direction the football is heading in so you can get your hands in the right spot to catch it. For example, if you're running for the football and it's on your left, raise your arms up and extend them out to the left."

      "content": "Make a diamond shape with your hands. Spread your fingers apart on both hands so they're completely stretched out. With your palms facing outward, touch the tips of your two pointer fingers together and the tips of your thumbs together. This will create a diamond shape between your two hands.

[10] X Research source For example, if you see the football flying through the air at around the same level as your hips, move your hands down toward your hips so they're prepared to catch the ball."

      "content": "Cross your pinky fingers so they form an “x” shape. Make sure your pinky fingers are firmly pressed together so the football doesn't slide through your hands when you catch it. Practice positioning your hands like this when you're not playing football so it comes naturally when you're on the field."
