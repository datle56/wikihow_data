      "content": "Beer Pong Is it really a party if you don’t play Beer Pong ? You know how it goes: 2 teams stand at either end of a table with their own set of 10 plastic cups half-filled with beer arranged in a triangle. Teams take turns tossing ping pong balls into each other’s cups. If you land it, the other team drinks and discards the cup. The first team to land the ball in each of their opponent’s cups takes the gold medal. Practice tossing ping pong balls into cups of water to train for this main event. For a new twist, take Beer Pong to the yard and play Beer Bucket Pong, substituting buckets of water for target cups."

The players at one end chug their beers , then place their cups right side-up on the rim of the table. They attempt to flip their cup upside down onto the face of the table by flicking it from the bottom edge. Once a player is successful, the teammate next to them chugs their own beer and does the same. The first team to drink and flip all their cups wins.

Gather each team around the table (alternating players from each team), and give 2 random players an empty cup. Players then bounce ping pong balls into the empty cup in front of them, passing both the cup and the ping pong ball to their left when they land it. But watch out—if the player immediately to your right lands their ball before you, they slap your cup and you have to drink. [2] X Research source To adapt this game to the Beer Olympics, award a medal or points to the team with the player who slapped the most cups. Practice by bouncing a handful of ping pong balls into an empty cup as fast as you can."

If they land it, the opposing team drinks, and the next player on the batting team starts their “at-bat.” The “pitch” switches when the batting team misses 3 balls total. Play 9 innings (or however many you like)—the team who sank the most ping pong balls takes the medal. Players may also “steal bases” by running to 1 of 2 flip cup stations at either side of the table, attempting to flip the cup before the opposing team. The slower team has to drink!"

One player starts by throwing a die (at least high enough to clear everyone's head) into any other player’s cup. If they make it, every other player drinks. If they miss, the target player tries to catch the die before it hits the floor—if they can’t, they drink. [3] X Research source Players who spill cups while throwing dice or catching dice also drink. Move carefully! The game ends when a player sinks a certain number of dice into the cups, usually either 5 or 7. Their team takes the medal."

If they roll a 7, an 11, or doubles of any number, they choose a player from another team to drink a full can of beer. As the player drinks, the dice roller then repeatedly rolls the dice as fast as they can—if they roll another 7, 11, or doubles, the drinker must drink another can. If the dice roller doesn’t roll a 7, 11, or doubles, they must drink a can themselves, and the dice are passed to the team on their left.

Each player also has their own full cup. Players take turns drawing cards, and each card corresponds to a different action. For example, if someone draws an ace, all players waterfall their drink. Players who draw a 2 can pick any other player to drink, while players who draw a 3 have to drink themselves. [5] X Research source Card rules for King’s Cup tend to vary from party to party, so don’t hesitate to make up your own to suit your event, or consult a list of card variations .

The players who have done the deed, though, must drink, and play goes around the circle, with each player coming up with their own “never have I ever.” The last player with beer left in their can or bottle wins.

Also, figure out who your designated drivers are ahead of time. They’ll be your referees and judges. However you choose your teams, try to make them more or less equal in both number of players and how much beer they handle.

Ask each player and team to brainstorm ways to make your Beer Olympics special. The sky’s the limit, but here are a few more ideas: Award additional prizes for teams that get the most gold medals, or consolation prizes for teams who lack medals. Prizes can be anything from cases of beer to customized koozies. Encourage designated drivers to dress in striped referee shirts and carry whistles . Opt for a multi-day event, just like the real Olympics, if the drinking gets to be a bit much in a single gathering."

Nobody wants to see a prime athlete carried out of the Olympics on a stretcher! Also, watch out for your friends and competitors. Take care of a drunk pal by swapping their beer for water, offering them food, finding them a sober ride home, and getting them to bed to sleep it off. Be on the lookout for signs of dizziness, slurred words, vomiting, or loss of consciousness, which are all indicators that someone's had too much to drink [16] X Research source"
