      "content": "Make sure your dog knows humping and mounting are bad behaviors. Discourage your dog in the same way you would with other bad behaviors. Use a loud clap or give a simple, stern, “No!”—whatever your dog has learned to associate with unacceptable behavior. For this method to work well, you should have already established trust and dominance through dog training. This issue can be super frustrating. Still, you should never hit or get aggressive to discourage humping or mounting in your dog. In some cases, humping and mounting can be about dominance. In this case, gently pushing your dog off of you and turning away from them is a good option. [1] X Research source How to Calm a Sexually Excited Dog"

      "title": "Humping and mounting are often instinctual—so interrupt their behavior.",
      "content": "Humping and mounting are often instinctual—so interrupt their behavior. Typically, your dog will be happy to move on to a new distraction. In this case, the more positive and engaging the activity, the better. When you see your dog is about to hump, take them outside for a game. Or, pull out that toy that your dog can’t resist. [2] X Research source How to Calm a Sexually Excited Dog Try fetch, chasing, tug-of-war, or a nice walk. If you offer your dog a toy, go for an interactive, stimulating choice. Treat dispensing toys, ball launchers, or puzzle toys are perfect. This is a great way to give your dog another outlet for their extra energy."

      "content": "Divert your pup’s focus to a task that requires immediate attention. To quickly redirect your dog and interrupt their instinct to hump, ask them to sit, stay, lie down, or roll over. Not only will this disrupt their behavior in the moment, but over time, it will train them not to follow their instincts to hump and mount. When they perform their command well, follow up with a treat or reward. [4] X Research source How to Calm a Sexually Excited Dog"

      "title": "Withhold your attention so you don't positively reinforce the behavior.",
      "content": "Withhold your attention so you don't positively reinforce the behavior. Sometimes, dogs may register any interaction with you to be a positive outcome to their behavior. So to discourage them, don't engage. If you see your dog begin humping, try to leave the room silently. If you can, avoid eye contact with your dog and don't pet them on your way out. Subtly send the message that this behavior doesn’t earn your attention, and over time, your dog could learn to stop. Plus, if your dog follows you from the room, you’ll have interrupted their behavior in the moment."

      "title": "Leave your dog alone and unstimulated to discourage their behavior.",
      "content": "Leave your dog alone and unstimulated to discourage their behavior. When your dog starts humping or mounting, deliver a short command that you'll associate with time outs, like, “Done,” “Enough,” or “Alone Time.” Then, gently bring them to a space without toys or distractions to be by themself. Leave your dog alone for no more than 1-2 minutes. [4] X Research source Make sure when you release your dog, they’re not engaging in bad behavior, like whining. This may positively reinforce the behavior. Be consistent when you do time-outs. Spot the behavior, deliver the command, leave the dog without distractions, and release them after just a few minutes. This will interrupt their behavior in the moment, and over time, it will teach your dog that you don’t approve of humping or mounting. It also gives your dog a chance to calm down on their own."

      "content": "When you reward your dog, you teach them that you like their behavior. Give them a treat when they're calm and relaxed to say, “This is great behavior!” Over time, this will teach your pup that relaxed behavior pleases you—and that’s something your dog wants as much as you do! [5] X Research source If your dog is lying down, breathing evenly or deeply, and has a relaxed expression—offer them a quick treat."

      "content": "Burning energy lowers stress and sexual urges in dogs. All in all, the more exercise your dog gets, the less irritability, tension, and yes, humping you’ll see in your dog’s behavior. Take them out for a nice, long daily walk. Incorporate tons of games in their daily schedule and if you can, try to make sure your activities aren’t just physically stimulating, but mentally stimulating too.

Hide and seek, learning new tricks, and searching for treats will be extra engaging to them. It's hard to expect your dog to calm down if they have too much pent-up energy."

If your dog doesn't respond to training and reward techniques, get them checked by a vet. This way, you can get to the bottom of what's causing the behavior. Plus, if there's a serious issue, you'll know sooner rather than later.

Go to source Humping can be a sexual behavior or play behavior, and both of these causes are totally normal. Humping can be common when dogs are stressed, tense, excited, or overwhelmed. If they face anxiety, humping could become a compulsive, daily habit. Humping can also be a way to assert dominance. This could be a show of power and status over other dogs or people. Finally, humping can also be caused by sickness. UTIs or skin allergies, for example, can bring about humping behaviors."

It’s tough enough to train these urges out of your dog, so you don’t want to have to deal with the stress of an injured friend or family member on top of that.

      "content": "Your dog's humping may be a reaction to a female in heat. When a female dog is in heat, she releases hormones that tell other dogs she's ready to breed. This can really affect male dogs, causing an uptick in sexual behaviors and even aggression. If this is your situation, separate your dogs while your female is in heat. Find a loving, temporary home for one of your dogs. [12] X Research source Ask a friend, family member, or a professional dog sitter for help.
