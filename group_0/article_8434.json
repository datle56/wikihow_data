      "content": "Get a clean microfiber cloth that won’t scratch the disk. The cloth needs to be lint-free without dirt or debris that could scratch the disk. One way to find something good to use is by looking for a lens cloth. They are normally used to clean glasses and camera lenses, so you can expect them to be soft enough for PS4 discs. Microfiber cloths are available online or at most general stores. You can find a lens cloth at many electronics stores as well as any place that sells eyewear. Other types of cloth, including paper towels and clothing, are more likely to scratch the disc. Ignore the temptation to give it a quick buffing with your shirt!"

      "content": "Use the cloth to clean the disc from the center to the edges. Hold onto the edges of the disc, turning it so the reflective side is facing up. Starting in the center, move the cloth in a straight line toward the edges. Keep doing this until you have wiped the entire disc. Pay extra attention to noticeable dust or fingerprints to ensure you remove them. [1] X Research source Remember not to wipe in a circle. PS4 discs are pretty fragile, and wiping in a circle could actually damage them."

      "title": "Wipe the disc clean with water if it still looks dirty.",
      "content": "Wipe the disc clean with water if it still looks dirty. Try cleaning it with a little bit of lukewarm water before giving up on it. Lightly dampen a clean microfiber cloth in the water, then wipe the disc from the center to the edges. Make sure the cloth isn’t dripping. If it leaves streaks, wipe it a second time with a dry part of the cloth. [2] X Research source Plain water is relatively safe, but don’t soak the disc. Also, make sure it is dry before putting it into your PS4."

      "title": "Create an isopropyl alcohol cleaning solution if the disc is very dirty.",
      "content": "Create an isopropyl alcohol cleaning solution if the disc is very dirty. Isopropyl alcohol is meant to be used as a last resort. Some people dab a little bit of it directly onto a cloth and wipe the disc. For a less abrasive cleaner, mix equal parts of water and isopropyl alcohol. Dampen a microfiber cloth in it, then wipe the disc from the center to the edges until it looks clean. [3] X Research source Isopropyl alcohol, or rubbing alcohol, is available online or at pharmacies. Isopropyl alcohol cleaners can damage PS4 discs. Most discs only require a quick wipe with a clean cloth. Don’t use isopropyl alcohol unless nothing else works! Another option is to get lens or disc cleaning wipes. They are basically microfiber pads with a special cleaning solution made with isopropyl alcohol. They are available online and at many electronics shops."

      "content": "Test the game to see if it works after it dries. Wipe the disc off with a clean microfiber cloth as needed to dry it. Then, put it into the PS4. If it still doesn’t work, check it again for smudges and scratches. Bad scratches could prevent the PS4 from reading the disc. [4] X Research source If the disc looks like it’s in good shape, your PS4 could be to blame. You could try cleaning or resetting it."

      "title": "Mail the disc to a repair service for a safer way to fix it.",
      "content": "Mail the disc to a repair service for a safer way to fix it. Repair services have resurfacing machines that can remove light scratches preventing a PS4 disc from working. The repair is often inexpensive, such as about $5 USD, and you get the help of a professional. It’s worth trying if you have a valuable game disc you don’t want to risk damaging by treating it on your own. Look for game stores in your area. If you don’t have any in your area, you may be able to mail the disc somewhere for service, although this can be more expensive. Keep in mind that only shallow scratches on the reflective side of the disc can be fixed. If the disc has deep scratches or cuts on the label side, you may be better off buying a new one."

      "title": "Purchase a scratch remover if you plan on fixing the disc at home.",
      "content": "Purchase a scratch remover if you plan on fixing the disc at home. You can buy an inexpensive handheld device, usually $10 to $20. All you have to do is put the disc in the machine, then turn it on so it begins spinning the disc. It will grind off a layer of the reflective coating, removing shallow scratches that could prevent the disc from working. [5] X Research source Scratch removers are available online. Some gaming and electronic shops also stock them."

      "title": "Use toothpaste if you need a quicker way to clean the disc.",
      "content": "Use toothpaste if you need a quicker way to clean the disc. Abrasive, waxy substances like plain toothpaste can sometimes repair game discs. Get a white toothpaste, not a gel one, and make sure it doesn’t have bleach or any other whitening agents in it. If you can find one with baking soda, it will be more effective. [6] X Research source Some other materials that could repair the scratch include petroleum jelly, car wax, furniture polish, bananas, and even peanut butter. Note that repairing the disc on your own isn’t guaranteed to work and can actually damage it further. Don’t attempt to fix scratches unless the disc no longer works."

      "title": "Rub a dab of toothpaste across the disc if you are attempting to fix it.",
      "content": "Rub a dab of toothpaste across the disc if you are attempting to fix it. Cover the scratch with a small amount of toothpaste. Then, use your finger or a microfiber cloth to rub it in gently from the center to the side. You could also use a cotton swab and a little bit of water to help cover smaller scratches. Keep rubbing the disc for about 1 minute to ensure it is removed. [7] X Research source The disc is fragile, so treat it gently. Avoid rubbing the toothpaste in a circle, since that could lead to more scratches."

      "title": "Wash and dry the disc to see if the scratch is gone.",
      "content": "Wash and dry the disc to see if the scratch is gone. Rinse the disc off under lukewarm water. Make sure all of the toothpaste is gone. Then, dry it off with a clean microfiber cloth. Once it is completely dry and scratch-free, put it in the PS4 to see if it works again. [8] X Research source If you still see scratches on the disc, treating them again could help. Gently rub the disc with toothpaste or another cleaner until the scratches disappear."
