      "content": "Spray upholstery cleaner onto a soft-bristle brush. Use an auto-industry standard upholstery cleaner like Folex or P&S Carpet Bomber to ensure it’s safe for interior use. Alternatively, make your own cleaner and test it before use. Wet the end of a small detailing brush with your cleaning solution. This way, you have better control of where you’re applying the cleaner inside your vehicle. [1] X Research source Keep your vehicle doors open and work in a well-ventilated area while spraying the cleaner. Wear nitrile or latex gloves while working with your cleaner to avoid any skin irritation."

      "title": "Work the cleaner into the spot by scrubbing it with the brush.",
      "content": "Work the cleaner into the spot by scrubbing it with the brush. Move the brush in small circles so the cleaner starts to form bubbles. Apply light pressure to the brush so the lather works deeper into the spots and penetrates the stain. [2] X Research source Be careful with the amount of pressure you add to the brush. If you use too much, you could damage the adhesive underneath the fabric. [3] X Research source This method should easily remove stains from dirt or regular wear and tear from any material."

      "title": "Wipe or blot the spot with a clean, dry microfiber towel.",
      "content": "Wipe or blot the spot with a clean, dry microfiber towel. Hold the towel firmly against the area you cleaned to absorb the cleaner. Rub the towel in small circles around the stain to help lift it off of the surface. Check to see if the stain has lightened up, and if it’s still noticeable, repeat the cleaning method. [4] X Research source It’s important to use a clean microfiber towel so you can see the stains that lift and avoid adding extra dirt by mistake. Microfiber towels can be purchased at any home care or automotive care store."

      "content": "Lift as much of the stain as you can with upholstery cleaner and a stiff-bristled brush. Spray an upholstery cleaner like Folex or P&S Carpet Bomber on the bristles until they’re wet. Then, lather the cleaner into the stain by working the brush in small circles to loosen the stain. Wipe away the cleaner with a microfiber cloth and clean as much of the stain as you can. [5] X Research source Detailing brushes can be purchased from your local auto care store. Avoid skin irritation from the cleaner by wearing a pair of thin nitrile gloves."

      "title": "Buy or rent a steam cleaner.",
      "content": "Buy or rent a steam cleaner. Steam cleaners use pressurized vapors to loosen dirt and penetrate the stains. Look at your local big box or home improvement stores to see if they offer rentals on steamers. Otherwise, purchase a small steam spot cleaner . [6] X Research source Low-end steam cleaners cost around $40 USD to purchase."

      "title": "Spray the nozzle while holding it 2 in (5.1 cm) from the stain.",
      "content": "Spray the nozzle while holding it 2 in (5.1 cm) from the stain. Use the narrow nozzle or brush attachment on your steamer. Hold it away from the stain and pull the trigger to shoot a burst of steam. Spray the entire stain so the heat and water lift it off from your headliner. [7] X Research source Don’t oversaturate the stain with water or else you may damage the adhesive underneath the fabric. Damaging the adhesive can cause your headliner to sag. If the moisture penetrates enough, it may also damage the electrical wiring underneath."

      "title": "Blot the stain dry with your microfiber cloth.",
      "content": "Blot the stain dry with your microfiber cloth. While the stain is still wet from the steam, pat it dry with your microfiber cloth. If you notice that the stain is still there, spray it with another burst of steam and work your cloth in small circles. [8] X Research source This method works best for removing food stains or other resilient spots."

      "content": "Spray upholstery cleaner on a stiff-bristled brush. An upholstery cleaner like Folex or P&S Carpet Bomber or an all-purpose cleaner like Chemical Guys Interior Cleaner will work on your headliner. Wet the bristles of a large detailing brush with your cleaning solution. Avoid spraying the cleaner directly on the ceiling of your vehicle since it could cause the adhesive underneath the fabric to loosen up. [9] X Research source Work in a well-ventilated area while cleaning your vehicle. Wear a thin pair of latex gloves if your skin is easily irritated by chemical cleaners."

      "title": "Rub the ceiling with your brush to lather the cleaner.",
      "content": "Rub the ceiling with your brush to lather the cleaner. Work in long back-and-forth strokes so the cleaner starts to bubble. Apply gentle pressure to the brush while you scrub your vehicle’s ceiling. As you’re working, continue to spray cleaner onto your brush if you notice that it isn’t producing a lather anymore. [10] X Research source For noticeable spots or stains, work extra cleaner into the area by making small circles with your brush."

Hold the nozzle against your vehicle’s ceiling and turn it on. Start in the front of your vehicle and work towards the back. Work in 24 in (61 cm) strokes across your ceiling to suck up your cleaning solution. [11] X Research source This process works best to remove nicotine and smoke residue from your vehicle interior."

      "content": "Let the headliner dry completely. The vacuum or spot cleaner should absorb most of the moisture in your ceiling, but let it air dry for 24 hours. Run your hand over the fabric to make sure the fabric is dry and to remove any lines in the fabric left by the vacuum. Leave your windows open if your vehicle is in a safe, temperature-controlled space to let your vehicle air out."

      "content": "Repeat the process if stains are still visible. Once your vehicle has dried out, look for any stains or discoloration remaining on the headliner. Start by doing a spot treatment, but if that doesn’t work, try a heavier cleaning method. Some stains won't come out completely. Lighten the stain as much as you can."

If the headliner has been left to mold for a long time, say a month or longer, it may be best to replace it entirely, as the mold has likely worked its way past the foam and adhesive.

Spray it onto a clean microfiber towel and scrub the stain to loosen it. For the best results, suck the rest of the stain out using a hot water extractor, which is a specialized car cleaning machine. If a standard citrus-based cleaner doesn’t work, Zani says to use a bubbling citrus-based cleaner."

Zani recommends going over an area that’s about 5-10 times bigger than the stain so there isn’t a contrast between the sections that were cleaned and the ones that weren’t."
