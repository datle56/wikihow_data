      "title": "Look at the bright side.",
      "content": "Look at the bright side. Being bright and sunny means finding the good in almost any situation, a trait which is not so common. Optimists are more successful in nearly every area of life – work, school, relationships, sports, and creative endeavors. Positive thinkers get depressed less often, make more money, and have happier marriages. Try saying, “And the good news is...,” and then finishing the sentence. [1] X Research source You may have the flu, but the good news is...now you have time to binge-watch an entire season of your favorite show. Someone just backed into your car and broke your tail light. But the good news is...now you get to spend some quality time with your brother, who offered to fix it for you."

      "title": "Expect things to turn out well.",
      "content": "Expect things to turn out well. Although some researchers believe that your degree of optimism is hereditary, most psychologists believe you can learn to become a more positive person. When faced with a difficult situation, think of all the different possible outcomes and then focus on the most favorable one. [2] X Research source If you have to move because of family or work, imagine being presented with exciting new opportunities that you wouldn't have had if you'd stayed where you are. If you have a fight with someone you love, expect your relationship to recover and be even stronger in the future because you went through this now."

      "content": "Be grateful. Cheerful, optimistic people tend to be grateful for what they have. [3] X Expert Source Erin Conlon, PCC, JD Executive Life Coach Expert Interview. 31 August 2021. If you ever find yourself feeling envious of what others have, take a mental inventory of all the good things in your life. Remind yourself that there are people whose lives are much harder than yours. [4] X Research source Keep a journal, and try to think of three good things that happened that day, no matter how small, like having lunch with a friend or doing well on an assignment.

      "content": "Smile anyway. Sunny people smile a lot. If you aren't feeling sunny at the moment, try acting like you are. Research shows that the physical act of smiling actually makes you feel happier. This is called facial feedback – when you flex the muscles involved in smiling, your brain thinks something good must have just happened...and adjusts your mood accordingly. [7] X Research source People who held a pen in their mouth – forcing their face to smile – rated cartoons more amusing than those who held their faces still. [8] X Research source Botox patients who were unable to frown reported feeling happier overall. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Try to stay balanced. Sometimes life can be very difficult, and you can't help having some negative thoughts and blue moods. The trick is to try to find the balance between being optimistic and being realistic. Staying realistic will help boost productivity and keep anxiety in check. A potential side effect of too much positive thinking is denial, so try to be realistic and grounded as well."

      "title": "Go easy on yourself.",
      "content": "Go easy on yourself. Putting too much pressure on yourself to think positive thoughts may have negative results. Remember that no one can be bright and sunny 100 percent of the time, so allow yourself to experience your own emotions in a genuine way. [10] X Research source When people believe they are expected to feel nothing but positive emotions, they actually experience more negative emotions, and more frequently. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you feel pressured to “think positive” all the time, you may begin to blame yourself for not feeling happy enough."

      "title": "Fake it till you make it.",
      "content": "Fake it till you make it. It's a cliché for a reason: studies show that when we behave in ways a confident person would, it tricks our brain into believing that we feel confident. Bright and sunny people often radiate a quiet confidence, which draws other people to them. If you are feeling nervous in a particular situation, try to act as calm and assured as you can. [12] X Research source At the end of the day, confidence is all about learning and understanding that you can survive anything that comes your way.

      "content": "Work on your self-esteem. Confidence is rooted in self-esteem, so try not to judge yourself so harshly. When you look in the mirror, you're judging yourself on your looks alone. All you can see is your reflection – you aren't giving yourself credit for other factors that people find attractive, like being a good listener or having a bubbly personality. [14] X Research source It might help to know that there is a good chance that others see you as 20 per cent more attractive than you think you are. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid comparing yourself to other people.",
      "content": "Avoid comparing yourself to other people. To be bright and sunny, try to feel as confident as possible. Comparing yourself to others will almost always make you feel worse, because most people only compare themselves to people they consider smarter or more attractive than themselves. The truth is that you're probably somewhere closer to the middle."

      "title": "Try adopting a power pose.",
      "content": "Try adopting a power pose. Adopting this posture may boost levels of the hormone linked to power and self-confidence, and lower levels of the hormone that causes stress. After striking a power pose, some people experience increased feelings of power and tolerance for risk. [16] X Research source Stand tall, with shoulders back and arms extended from the body and your hands on your hips. Hold this position for a minute or two. You don't need to do this in public – you will get the same effects by practicing this pose in private before joining the group."

      "title": "Focus on your abilities.",
      "content": "Focus on your abilities. If you are good at something, learn to do it as well as you can. There are three main types of confidence: intrinsic belief in your self-worth, belief in your ability to do specific things, and belief in your ability to learn and to problem-solve. Gaining confidence in one area will help you feel more confident all around. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Explore your creative side. Bright and sunny people are often creative, which makes them seem colorful and interesting to others. If you don't have a creative hobby, think about the things you enjoyed as a kid – were you good at art, or music, or dance? Did you like to make up stories, or act them out onstage? Consider taking a class, or joining a group with like interests. [18] X Research source Keep track of creative ideas as they come to you – if an idea isn't written down within 24 hours, it is usually forgotten. Be open to the ideas of others. Collaboration is a wonderful way to get your creative juices flowing. Painting and drawing are a couple great ways to be creative.

      "content": "Express yourself emotionally. Sunny, charismatic people don't hide their feelings, they express them genuinely and spontaneously.

      "content": "Keep your negative emotions in check. Because emotions and moods are often contagious, be careful not to express your negative emotions every time you are feeling angry or irritable. It's okay to vent to a friend on occasion, but in general try to act cheerful and calm. People will feel more relaxed and comfortable around you, and will seek out your company.

      "content": "Keep your sense of humor. Bright, sunny people are nearly always judged to have a good sense of humor, which is a very attractive personality trait. A bias toward humorous people shows up in all areas of human interaction, including romantic attraction and success at work. [22] X Research source Both men and women value “a sense of humor” in a romantic partner, although they differ in the definition – women tend to be attracted to men who make jokes, whereas men are attracted to women who appreciate his sense of humor and laugh at his jokes."

Exercise and a well-rounded diet result in a “glow” of good health, which most people find very attractive.
