Dig 1 block on either side of the second block to create the shape of a cross—the longer side is where the entrance to the elevator will be. Remove the 3 blocks inside, and remove 1 more block from the center of the cross. [1] X Research source The block in the center of the cross should be 3 blocks deep, the 2 blocks that make up the long part of the cross should be 2 blocks deep, and the three other spaces around the center of the cross should only be 1 block deep."

Place a note block underneath the obsidian, then remove the temporary blocks. [7] X Research source Temporary blocks are any blocks that you don’t mind breaking. You can use dirt, cobblestone, wood, scaffolding, or any block that isn’t difficult to pick back up after you’re done building. You can build the elevator however high you’d like—just make sure to put obsidian above the observer so the elevator doesn’t keep going upwards forever."

You can cover the rest of the outside of the elevator with any blocks you’d like. [8] X Research source Here are a few other tips you can use to customize your elevator: Place sea lanterns or glowstone on top of the two slime blocks on either side of the elevator to add extra lighting. On the bottom level, build two pillars diagonal from the decorative blocks on either side of the elevator entrance all the way up to the upper platform to create a box around your elevator. Fill the area above the elevator entrance up to the upper platform with glass so you can see outside while you’re traveling up."

When you enter the corner between honey blocks or walls, your character’s hitbox will touch the water and the soul sand block or magma block inside, sending you up or down.
