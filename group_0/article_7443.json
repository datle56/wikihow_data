      "content": "Measure your waist or check the tag on a pair of pants that fit. To figure out your waist size , take measuring tape and wrap it around your hips where your pants sit. Wrap your measuring tape with the end under your belly button and pull the rest of the tape tight around your body. Keep it parallel to the floor and read the number where the two lengths overlap to get your waist size. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source You can also check a pair of pants that fit you well and simply read the tag. It doesn’t matter if you’re off by a little bit. Cups are sized to fit a range of waistlines. You can actually do this while wearing your shirt if you want. Jockstraps and compression shorts are typically worn over underwear, so the extra fabric won’t change anything."

      "content": "Select your cup based on your waist size. Go to an athletic or sporting goods store. Look for a cup that corresponds with your waist size. If they don’t list the waist sizes on the packaging, use the general sizing recommendations to get a size that will fit you. As an additional guideline, pee wee sizes are usually for boys aged 5-7, youth sizes typically fit boys aged 8-12, teen sizes are for boys aged 13-17, and adult sizes are for men 18 and older. If you’re an adult with a waistline smaller than 28 in (71 cm), start with a teen’s medium. Children older than 5 should wear a protective cup if they’re engaged in contact or physical sports.

      "content": "Choose a shape that you think will be comfortable for you. Cups have a few different shapes, but they aren’t radically different. One style is shaped more like a crescent moon, while the other is a little more form-fitting. Every style of cup will provide the same level of protection so long as it fits right and covers your entire genitalia. Choose a design that looks and feels comfortable to you. [3] X Research source You won’t be able to try a cup on over your underwear before buying it, but you can try it on over your shorts in the store. You can always go back and get another one if you don’t like the style you’ve picked. Cups aren’t particularly expensive."

      "title": "Pick a model with a thicker gel lining if you have sensitive skin.",
      "content": "Pick a model with a thicker gel lining if you have sensitive skin. The edge of a protective cup has a gel lining so that the edges don’t chafe your skin. If you have sensitive skin, get a cup with a thicker gel lining. This will ensure that the cup doesn’t cause you skin irritation while you’re wearing it. [4] X Research source There are foam cups that use a softer material than the traditional hard-shelled plastic. These cups are a great option for children, but don’t offer as much protection. Some cups are machine-washable. If you want an easier time cleaning your cup, read the label carefully to see if it can be cleaned in a washing machine."

      "title": "Get a jockstrap for a basic setup.",
      "content": "Get a jockstrap for a basic setup. The jockstrap is the most common supporter for a cup. You can usually buy them together. It has a pouch for the cup and 2 elastic bands that wrap around your legs. Jockstraps usually come in small, medium, and large, and are extremely elastic. Select a jockstrap that will fit firmly around your waist. The waist size ranges will be listed on the packaging. [5] X Research source Jockstraps tend to be cheaper than compression shorts. Don’t use a jockstrap that doesn’t hug your waist firmly. You don’t want it falling down as you’re running. If you’re getting a cup for hockey, get a hockey jock . It’s a special type of jockstrap designed to fit into hockey pants. Jockstraps are great for sports where you move a lot, as they don’t tend to fall down. It’s advised to wear a jockstrap in most sports, including baseball, football, rugby, and lacrosse."

      "title": "Wear compression shorts if you don’t like the feeling of elastic bands.",
      "content": "Wear compression shorts if you don’t like the feeling of elastic bands. Compression shorts are a good alternative if you don’t like jockstraps. Compression shorts are basically tight-fitting boxer briefs with a slot for a protective cup in the front. Get a pair of compression shorts that list your waistline’s measurement on the packaging. [6] X Research source They should hug your thighs and waist firmly, but shouldn’t be so tight that they cut off circulation. If you have sensitive skin in your inner thighs, opt for compression shorts—they feel like tight boxer shorts and are less likely to cause chafing. Compression shorts are great for sports that involve a lot of running, like basketball, baseball, or football. They’re also excellent for biking. They may fall down if you twist and turn a lot though depending on the shape of your body."

      "content": "Wear impact shorts for some additional protection. Impact shorts are like compression shorts, except they have foam padding around the thighs, tailbone, and sides to soften any blows or falls. They’re popular with snowboarders and skaters because they protect your hips and legs during bad falls. Wear impact shorts for additional support around your hips and thighs. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Impact shorts are often called padded shorts or snowboarder shorts. Impact shorts are great for snowboarding, rugby, skating, or boxing, but they’re not great for sports that already have padded uniforms, like football. They’re also a poor choice if you have to run a lot, like in baseball or basketball."

      "content": "With the narrow side down, slide the cup into the pouch. Locate the seam on the inside of your shorts or strap. It will be located on the front, near the top of the waist. Use 2 fingers on your nondominant hand to open the slot. Slide the cup down through the opening until it’s fitted in the bottom of the pocket. [8] X Research source The gel lining may make it kind of difficult to push it all the way down. Wiggle the cup back and forth until it slides all the way down if it sticks."

With your underwear on, spread the elastic band out and slide your right leg through the band and the hoop on the right. Repeat the process on the left side. Pull the waistband up and let the elastic bands slide up your legs. Once the waistband is on your waistline, reach behind your thighs and adjust the elastic bands until they’re comfortable.
