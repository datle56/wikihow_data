[3] X Research source Place a dot 12 inches (30.5 cm) from the center point (which is at 4 inches or 10.2 cm) of the bottom line to create a perfect triangle. You can use a craft knife instead of scissors if the cardboard is stiff and difficult to cut."

You can temporarily tape them together or have a friend or family member help you if it’s tricky to get all four pieces to stay together. Then, seal the edges together with a line of hot glue. [4] X Research source Be very careful when using hot glue, as it can burn you. Keep your hands away from the nozzle and the glue. Make sure you have a safe surface to rest your hot glue gun on when you’re not using it as well."
