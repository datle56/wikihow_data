Lie the bacon flat on the bacon sheet so it cooks completely. [1] X Research source To start, take out a baking sheet that will fit in your toaster oven. Line the baking sheet with aluminum foil. This will make clean up easier afterwards, as you can simply remove the foil and discard it. [2] X Research source If you don't have aluminum foil, you can use parchment paper instead. Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly after handling raw bacon."
