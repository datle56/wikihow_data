      "content": "Meet the basic requirements. Police Officers are expected to be good role models for their community, this means you shouldn't have any history of criminal activity or test positive for illegal drugs in your urine sample (this includes cannabis regardless if it is legal in your state). There was a myth that police departments rarely hire candidates without a military background. Fortunately, that myth is dead. If you do not want to enlist in the military, you should get a four-year college degree if you wish to be very competitive in the hiring process. The minimum age will vary but most police departments set it at 21. The maximum age in most police departments is 35, though an extension may be given to veterans who have served for at least two years and have been honorably discharged. Most police departments only require a high school diploma or GED, but you should get a four-year college degree (Bachelor's or equivalent) because police recruiters value candidates with higher education, and you are likely to get a raise or be promoted quickly. Having military service is also a bonus. If you were honorably discharged, it will be very compelling to police recruiters but if you were dishonorably discharged, you can try to not mention it but if they ask, be honest."

      "title": "Make sure your record is clean.",
      "content": "Make sure your record is clean. Police officers are expected to act as role models in their communities, and any crimes committed prior to becoming an officer can disqualify you. Avoid using illegal drugs, drinking alcohol to excess, and associating with criminals. All of these behaviors can make it tougher to get a job as a police officer when it comes time to apply. [1] X Research source Having a felony conviction, a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction, or a conviction for a crime related in any way to race (a hate crime) disqualifies you from being able to pursue a career as a police officer in most jurisdictions. If you were convicted of a crime as a juvenile, you should know police departments can still see your juvenile record regardless if it is sealed or expunged so be honest about any crime you committed before the age of 18. While staying out of trouble may be life compelling experience, any conviction, including a past juvenile record, will be used against you. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Start building good credit. When you apply to become a police officer, the department will run a credit check as part of your background check, and you will be penalized if your score is low. To build good credit, avoid accumulating debt, and pay your bills on time. Get a credit check now so you know exactly what financial state you are in. [3] X Research source If you don't have good credit, take steps toward building it back up. Even if your credit score is low, the efforts you make to attain better credit will show that you're a responsible person."

      "title": "Develop a strong work background.",
      "content": "Develop a strong work background. Having work experience helps prepare you for the long hours and strict requirements of a police officer job, and it also gives you an edge over applicants with no experience. Your job experience doesn't have to be related to law enforcement, although that can help; any work experience that shows you're responsible and capable of doing a job well will help. [4] X Research source Consider taking a job that requires you to interact with the public. Police officers need excellent communication skills. Other government jobs, such as a job at your local state park, can give you a sense of what it's like to work as part of a law enforcement team. Some choose to join the military service for a year or two before joining the police force, as this prepares them physically and mentally for the duties of a cop. However, military service doesn’t exempt you from police academy in most jurisdictions."

You'll have to pass a physical agility test to qualify for becoming a police officer, so start working out now to make sure you're in your best physical shape. Join a gym, work with a personal trainer, or just start running every day to get yourself in shape. [5] X Research source"

Police officers are a familiar sight around communities and in the media, but in order to really understand what its like to be a police officer, you have to spend time on the job with one.

Having a college degree is not a requirement for getting hired by most police departments, but it can help to have even a few years of education in a related field, especially if you plan to later become a detective or hold an administrative position. Law enforcement, criminal justice, or even pre-law are all good majors for prospective police. Some departments provide tuition assistance to offers pursuing a degree."

If you are open to moving around in the future, whichever police academy is closest or offers the most flexible hours will be fine. Not all departments have their own police academies. Be sure to check with yours first. Police academies are usually part-time but some may be full-time. Tuition depends on location, but be prepared to spend several thousand USD."

Some police academies require psychological screening tests."

      "content": "Pass background and drug tests. It’s common for departments to administer drug and background tests before the interview even takes place, so be prepared to provide the necessary information with little warning. You may need to provide a hair or urine sample, a copy of your credit report, and full biographical information. Be sure to tell the department beforehand if there is any reason you may not pass a test. For example, if you have recently purchased a house, your credit score might not be accurate."

Bring your resume along, dress professionally, and make it clear that you have the right values and skills to become a police officer. A police officer’s resume should contain their education, police academy training, work or military history, and any volunteer experience that might be relevant. Be assertive. This is an important quality for a police officer to have. If you're feeling nervous in the days leading up to the interview, do a practice interview with a friend or family member to help build up your confidence. Be honest. Don't lie about past crimes you have committed or mistakes you have made. Honesty and integrity are of utmost importance in police work.
