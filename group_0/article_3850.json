    {
      "title": "Arrive early to avoid entering the theater after the movie has started.",
      "content": "Arrive early to avoid entering the theater after the movie has started. Make sure to get to the movie theater with enough time to park your car, buy snacks, use the bathroom, find your screen, choose seats, and get settled. Adjust your arrival time if you are seeing a recently released movie or if you’re attending at peak hours. This means longer lines and a crowded theater."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the bathroom before entering the theater.",
      "content": "Use the bathroom before entering the theater. Getting up to use the bathroom in the middle of the movie is disruptive. Make sure to locate the bathroom closest to your movie theater before entering. Even if you use the bathroom beforehand, you may need to go again during the movie. Knowing the quickest route will get you in, out, and back in your seat quickly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let friends and family know where you are.",
      "content": "Let friends and family know where you are. Notifying your friends and family that your phone will be turned off for the next few hours shows respect and maturity. It also helps to avoid disruptions during the movie."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make calls and end text message conversations before entering the movie theater.",
      "content": "Make calls and end text message conversations before entering the movie theater. Place any last-minute calls and end unfinished text message conversations outside of the movie theater. Talking or texting on your mobile phone during the movie is irritating and rude. This is especially true in 3D movies that require the use of special glasses that react to certain bright lights. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Offer to stand in line for snacks and drinks.",
      "content": "Offer to stand in line for snacks and drinks. If you’re seeing a movie with a group of friends or family members, offer to stand in the concession line. This shows your generosity and helps keep the group organized. While you stand in line, your companions can use the bathroom, save seats in the theater, and get settled. It also makes their experience more enjoyable and they will be more likely to invite you for another movie. Make sure to take the group order and ask for money before getting in line. Trying to organize while in the concession line will slow down other movie goers who already know what they want."

    {
      "title": "Treat movie theater staff with respect.",
      "content": "Treat movie theater staff with respect. This applies to all interactions including purchasing tickets, buying snacks and drinks at the concession stand, and acknowledging cleaning staff as you exit the theater at the end of the movie. How you treat the staff is a reflection of your own maturity."

    {
      "title": "Enter the movie theater quietly and choose a seat quickly.",
      "content": "Enter the movie theater quietly and choose a seat quickly. You will enter the theater at the very bottom or very top of the seating area. Find your seat respectfully without pushing, running, jumping, or talking loudly. If you sit next to another patron, always ask if the open seat is actually available. They may be saving it for someone."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn off any electronic devices.",
      "content": "Turn off any electronic devices. This is one of the biggest behavior faux pas you can make during a movie. Make sure your mobile phone is turned completely off. The light from your screen can be incredibly irritating to the other movie goers. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Release saved seats when the lights dim.",
      "content": "Release saved seats when the lights dim. If you are saving a seat for a friend or family member, release the seat as the lights dim and before the trailers begin. Seats are generally available on a first come, first serve basis. It is rude to hold a seat for someone who is late over movie goers who have arrived on time. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't talk during the movie.",
      "content": "Don't talk during the movie. The sound of your voice may disturb other patrons who are trying to listen to the movie. If you absolutely have to make a comment, make sure to speak in a quiet whisper."
    },
    {
      "title": "Exit the movie theater silently and respectfully during the movie.",
      "content": "Exit the movie theater silently and respectfully during the movie. If you have to leave the theater while the movie is still showing, try your best to crouch to avoid blocking other people's view. Be as quick as you can, while also keeping safety in mind. Don’t talk while leaving the theater and try your best to time your departure with an appropriate part of the movie."
    },
    {
      "title": "Share your space respectfully with strangers.",
      "content": "Share your space respectfully with strangers. Be aware of shared armrests and don’t let your personal items stray into another seat. Be careful not to kick the chair in front of you. If you experience disruptions, such as a movie goer kicking the back of your seat, address the situation calmly and politely. You can also find a different seat. Keep in mind, everyone has a right to sit where they want, so try to make the best of the situation without disrupting the movie."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick up any trash.",
      "content": "Pick up any trash. Leaving empty candy boxes, greasy popcorn bags, and emptied soda containers is disrespectful and immature. By cleaning up your seating area, you are treating the movie theater staff with respect. Remember, they have to clean up the theater after every movie for their entire shift."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait for the lights to turn back on before exiting the movie theater.",
      "content": "Wait for the lights to turn back on before exiting the movie theater. Unless it’s an emergency, wait until the lights have turned on before standing up. This shows respect to other movie goers who are still watching the screen. It is also safer as you can easily see where you’re walking."
