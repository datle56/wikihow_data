      "content": "Enumerate all the ways that sum can be reached. This can be tedious for large numbers of dice, but is fairly straightforward. This is equivalent to the finding all partitions of k into exactly n parts with no part larger than r. An example for n=5, r=6, and k=12 is shown as an example. In order to ensure that the count is both exhaustive and that no partition is counted twice, the partitions are presented in lexicographic order and the dice in each partition in non-decreasing order."

In a smaller 3 die example, the partition 123 covers 6 possibilities (123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321) while the partition 114 covers only 3 (114, 141, 411) and 222 only includes itself. Use the multinomial formula to compute the number of ways to permute the digits in each partition. This information has been added to the table from the previous section. [2] X Research source"

For very high or low values of k, some or all or these terms might be zero, but the formula is valid for all k. First die shows k-1 and the second shows 1. First die shows k-2 and the second shows 2. First die shows k-3 and the second shows 3. First die shows k-4 and the second shows 4. First die shows k-5 and the second shows 5. First die shows k-6 and the second shows 6."

For example throwing two regular 6-sided dice has exactly the same distribution of sums as a die labeled (1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4) and another labeled (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8). This is because (x+x 2 +x 2 +x 3 +x 3 +x 4 )(x+x 3 +x 4 +x 5 +x 6 +x 8 ) = (x+x 2 +x 3 +x 4 +x 5 +x 6 )(x+x 2 +x 3 +x 4 +x 5 +x 6 )."
