Depending on the level of detail that you want to preserve, you'll have to use one of the following tools for this step: Select Subject —This feature allows Photoshop to try to automatically detect the subject of your photo. You may need to make slight adjustments to the selection. To automatically select the subject of your photo, click Select in the menu bar at the top. Then click Subject . Marquee Tool —Used to select a large area without worrying about fine edges. Click the dotted-line icon near the top of the \"Tool\" section, then click and drag your mouse around the area that you want to show or hide. This tool is useful for creating a rectangle or circle mask around the image. Lasso Tool —The Lasso tool is used to highlight specific shapes in a picture. It's the tool that has an icon that resembles a lasso. Use the lasso tool to drag around the shape you want to hide or reveal. You can also use the magnetic lasso tool, which tries to snap to the edges of an object, or the polygon lasso tool, which allows you to create points around the shape. Pen Tool —Used to select fine details. Click the fountain pen-shaped icon in the \"Tool\" section, then click and drag your mouse around the area that you want to show or hide. The Pen tool is used to create a vector mask that is not dependent on the resolution of the image. This will create finer edges than the other tools. Shape Tools —The Shape Tools are used to create basic polygonal shapes. These use vectors instead of resolution-based shapes. These will create finer edges than the other selection tools."
