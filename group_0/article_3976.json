      "title": "Clear your schedule.",
      "content": "Clear your schedule. If you plan on binge-watching a show, you need to make sure you don’t have any other pressing priorities for the rest of the day. You might tell yourself that you’ll still make it to dinner with your friends at 8, but when you’re 5 episodes deep into Game of Thrones and it’s time to get ready, you’ll wish you had cancelled. [1] X Research source The amount of time you’ll need depends on how long the show is. Some single-season shows can be finished in just a couple of hours, but longer-running shows could take multiple binge-watching sessions over several weeks."

      "title": "Find a comfy spot.",
      "content": "Find a comfy spot. You’re going to be hanging out here for a while, so pick somewhere that will allow you to shift your position to keep you comfortable. Try binge-watching on your couch or in a reclining chair. If possible, watch on an actual TV instead of on a computer or mobile device to reduce eye strain. [2] X Research source As tempting as it may be to binge every season of Orange is the New Black while you’re sitting in your bed, watching TV in bed can lead to insomnia. The blue light from screens mimics that of sunlight, tricking your brain into feeling more awake. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Stock up on snacks.",
      "content": "Stock up on snacks. You’ll need to stay hydrated and nourished through your binge-watching session, so make sure your fridge is stocked with some of your faves. To avoid racking up extra calories, keep healthy snacks like fruits, nuts, and low-fat popcorn on hand. [4] X Research source Portion out less healthy snacks like chips into plastic bags beforehand so you don’t eat too much at one time."

      "content": "Use a binge-watching session as an opportunity to drink more water . Fill a large thermos with ice water and keep it handy, then refill it when you take breaks. Toss in a couple of lemon slices or a few berries to give your water a natural flavor."

      "title": "Sign up for a free trial of a streaming service if you don't have one.",
      "content": "Sign up for a free trial of a streaming service if you don't have one. Services like Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Go often offer a free 30-day trial to let you try them before you sign up. This can be a great way to binge-watch a show without having to pay for it. You usually have to provide a credit card number to get a free trial. Just be sure to cancel when your trial is up to avoid having any charges put on your card."

    {
      "title": "Watch with a friend who has an account if you don't have one.",
      "content": "Watch with a friend who has an account if you don't have one. If you don't want to sign up for a free trial, ask a friend with a streaming service to binge-watch with you. Watching a show is usually more fun with someone else, anyway. Make sure your friend hasn't seen the show so that they don't spoil it for you, unless your friend can watch the show again without spoiling it. It is also fun to have a group binge-watch together to make sure you don't fall asleep or miss anything."

    {
      "title": "Check your local cable listings for marathons of shows.",
      "content": "Check your local cable listings for marathons of shows. Cable channels will often air several episodes of a show, especially right before a new season of that show airs. If you have a DVR, set it up to record so you can watch the show at your leisure. If you don't, just plan to binge-watch when it airs!"

      "title": "Purchase a show on DVD or buy a digital copy.",
      "content": "Purchase a show on DVD or buy a digital copy. If you buy a show, you can watch it as many times as you want! You can either buy the DVD or Blu-ray version, or you can purchase it digitally through a service like iTunes."

      "title": "Pick the show you’re going to watch.",
      "content": "Pick the show you’re going to watch. If you’re binge-watching a show on DVD, your choice is easy. However, if you’re using a streaming service, it can be hard to narrow down your choices. Ask your friends for recommendations, check out binge-watching guides online, or reach out to ask your social media contacts what they’re watching."

      "title": "Order food delivery so you don’t have to cook.",
      "content": "Order food delivery so you don’t have to cook. Part of the appeal of binge-watching is that it can give you a chance to completely relax — a luxury most of us don’t get to enjoy often. Make the most of it by having your food delivered during your binge-watching session. If you’ve been snacking on healthy treats, go ahead and splurge a little with Chinese take-out or a pizza. Other foods include ramen noodles, Totinos pizza rolls, and maybe some sushi. Check to see if there’s a meal delivery service like Waitr or Uber Eats in your area to have a dish from your favorite local spot delivered right to your door!"

      "content": "Find ways to stay active while you’re watching. Binge watching TV can slow your metabolism, which can lead to a whole host of health problems. Fight this by staying active while you watch your show. Get up and stretch between episodes, hit pause after a great scene, or do chores like folding laundry or washing dishes. [5] X Research source Even just a 1-minute workout can help combat some of the effects of a sedentary lifestyle. Jog in place, do a quick series of jumping jacks, or do as many pushups as you can in 1 minute between episodes. [6] X Research source"
