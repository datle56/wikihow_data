Disconnecting the bristles and-deep cleaning your brush will remove all of the junk that builds up in the brush. Do this every 1-2 weeks to keep your brush and skin clean and safe. [1] X Research source If the bristles on the head of the brush are discolored, the brush definitely need a good deep cleaning."

      "content": "Brace the back of the brush with your nondominant hand. Take the brush off of the charger and take it to your sink. Lift it up and wrap your nondominant hand around the back of the brush’s head. Hold it firmly to brace it. Face cleansing brushes are always waterproof, but the charger is not. Never clean the brush when it’s still on the charger."

      "content": "Twist the disc attached to the bristles counterclockwise to remove it. The bristles are connected to a small disc that twists into the head of the brush. Wrap your free hand around this disc and hold it firmly. Rotate the disc counterclockwise until the bristles and the disc pop off of the brush. [2] X Research source This process is the same on every brand of cleansing brush. You cannot thoroughly clean your face cleansing brush without removing the disc."

      "content": "Scrub the back of the disc with hand soap and a toothbrush. Set the body of the brush aside to clean it later. Take the bristles and flip them upside down. Squirt a small dollop of hand soap into the back of the disc and run it under water for 1-2 seconds. Scrub the back of the disc with a clean toothbrush. Use back-and-forth strokes to work the soap into the crevices of the disc. [3] X Research source You can use a cotton swab to get into the nooks and crannies if you’d like. The toothbrush usually does a good job on its own, though. The back of the disc often gets dirty because junk slips through the sides of the disc where it attaches to the brush."

      "content": "Brush around the sides of the disc with the same toothbrush. Take your toothbrush and run the bristles around the sides of the disc. Scrub each portion of the disc 1-2 times to remove any dirt or junk that’s sticking to the sides of the disc. [4] X Research source The sides of the disc get dirty for the same reason the underside does—dirt and dead skin get trapped in the seam where the bristles attach to the brush."

      "content": "Massage the bristles by hand using standard hand soap. Flip the disc over so the bristles are facing up and squirt a dollop of hand soap directly into the bristles. Hold the bristles under a steady stream of warm water and gently run your thumbs over them. Work your fingers through the bristles over and over to spread the soap out and clean your bristles. [5] X Expert Source Lydia Shedlofsky, DO Dermatologist Expert Interview. 3 May 2021. Do this for 1-2 minutes to remove any junk, dirt, or dead skin cells. Set the disc aside when you’re done. The bristles tend to be pretty strong, but you don’t want to massage them so hard that you bend them. Use a gentle motion to clean this part of the face cleansing brush."

Run the brush under water for 1-2 seconds to get it wet. Then, scrub the inside of the brush’s head with your toothbrush. Work the toothbrush’s bristles around the head 2-3 times to clean the inside of the brush. Again, you can use a cotton swab to really get into the corners if you’d like. The toothbrush on its own is probably fine, though. [6] X Research source"

Set the disc down with the bristles facing up and wait 2-4 hours for the disc and bristles to air dry. [8] X Research source You can wipe the handle of the brush with a dry or damp cloth to remove any oils from your skin. The handle doesn’t tend to get very dirty though, so you don’t really need to do this every time you clean the brush."

However, if your bristles are really dirty or they’re still discolored after you hand-washed them, soaking the bristles in rubbing alcohol is a great way to refresh and clean them. [9] X Research source If you use the brush every day, you may want to do this every 1-2 weeks just to sanitize the bristles."
