      "title": "Don't just download it without telling your parents.",
      "content": "Don't just download it without telling your parents. This will cause them to feel upset at you for hiding things, and that you cannot be trusted. You should always have a parent's consent before making a social media account, as they have a right to know about it. If you are honest to them about the fact that you have downloaded Tiktok, then they are less likely to be angry or confused at you about it. They will have more respect for you, because you had the ability to talk to them. If you do not tell your parents about the fact that you have got a TikTok account, and then they later find out, you could be in a lot of trouble. Depending on how strict your parents are, there can be consequences, such as taking your phone away from you. So make sure you talk to your parents about it, because chances are, they will grow to accept it."

      "title": "Tell them that your friends are on TikTok.",
      "content": "Tell them that your friends are on TikTok. Telling them that you have friends on the app might make them think that if they have an account, maybe you should too. Make sure to tell your parents that the main reason you want to join TikTok is to have another way of interacting with your friends. You can also play the ultimate card by stating that your friends are the same age as you, possibly younger, and they have an account. So why shouldn't you have one?"

      "title": "Make your parents aware of the fact that you can put your account on private settings.",
      "content": "Make your parents aware of the fact that you can put your account on private settings. Parents are often worried about online safety, so reassure them that only friends will be able to see your profile. Tell them that when you have an account on private, it means only people whom you are friends with can see your videos. It may so be important to say that the only way to become friends is if the two users follow each other. Tell them that you will not do anything to risk your safety on the site, such as accept friend requests from any random people."

    {
      "title": "Ask them if they would like to monitor your account every so often.",
      "content": "Ask them if they would like to monitor your account every so often. This way, they can be reassured that you are staying safe online. This may sound like a terrible idea, but if you are determined not to do this, then you should probably rethink the way you are acting online. This is because if you were behaving sensibly and in the way that you promised your parents you would, you should have no issues with them going through your account. They may also be suspicious that you are hiding something from them."

      "title": "Ask them if they have any questions, and answer them all sensibly and honestly.",
      "content": "Ask them if they have any questions, and answer them all sensibly and honestly. They may want to know more about the app, or they may just want to ask you if you think you are ready. Be open about giving your responses, as this will make them believe that you are mature enough."
    },
    {
      "title": "If they say no, then ask why.",
      "content": "If they say no, then ask why. Don't ask it as though you disagree with them; instead, you should simply say, \"Sorry, but I'm confused as to why you said no. Could you please explain your reasons a bit clearer?\" If it is about security reasons, then you can always reassure them that you will be as safe as you can be on there, and that you believe that you have the knowledge to keep yourself safe online."

      "title": "If the final answer is no, then do not download the app to spite them.",
      "content": "If the final answer is no, then do not download the app to spite them. In the future, they may allow you, but if you go behind their backs and disobey them by downloading the app, they will believe that you are immature."
