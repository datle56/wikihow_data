      "title": "Locate a licensed dealer in your area.",
      "content": "Locate a licensed dealer in your area. Typically, it's safest to buy a gun from a federally licensed dealer â€” also known as an FFL (federal firearms licensee) dealer. When you buy through a licensed dealer, you can be assured that the gun is in good working order and hasn't been stolen or used in the commission of a crime. [1] X Research source There are many online directories, that can help you find the nearest licensed gun dealer. Simply type \"FFL dealers Ohio\" into your favorite search engine."

      "title": "Visit the gun dealer in person with valid ID.",
      "content": "Visit the gun dealer in person with valid ID. When you go to the gun dealer to purchase your gun, you'll need a government-issued photo ID, such as a driver's license, state identification card, or military ID, that proves you are over the age of 18 (21 for handguns). Your ID also lists your state of residence. If you buy a gun from an FFL dealer and live out of state, you'll usually have to transfer it to an FFL dealer near your residence before you can take it home. [2] X Research source If you're buying a rifle and live in one of the \"unrestricted\" neighboring states, such as West Virginia, you may be able to walk out of the shop with the rifle, provided you pass the background check."

      "title": "Fill out the Firearm Transaction Record form.",
      "content": "Fill out the Firearm Transaction Record form. The Firearm Transaction Record form is the official record of your purchase required by US law. Fill out your information as the buyer of the gun and answer a few questions about your background and record. Then, sign and date the form. [3] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms U.S. federal law enforcement agency dealing with crimes related to firearms and alcohol and tobacco products Go to source Specifically, you'll need to provide your full legal name, address, date and place of birth, gender, height, and weight. While not required, you can also include your Social Security number to ensure you don't get mixed up with someone else during the background check. You'll also have to answer yes/no questions about your criminal and citizenship background, as well as about any domestic violence charges you may have on your record. The dealer will complete the section for the seller of the gun, then call the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and provide your information for the background check."

    {
      "title": "Wait for your background check report to come back.",
      "content": "Wait for your background check report to come back. The only background check required for firearms purchases from FFL dealers is the federal NICS check. This check may not include state records. Ohio does not require any additional state background checks to purchase a firearm, although you will need one if you want to get a concealed carry permit. If the NICS check indicates you've been convicted of a felony, the dealer will be instructed to deny the sale. The background check is good for a single transaction. Although you can buy multiple guns in one transaction, if you come back to buy another gun, or if you buy a gun from a different dealer later, you'll have to get another background check. After the dealer provides your information, they will get a response saying either \"proceed\" or \"denied.\" Occasionally, you may get a \"delayed\" response. In that case, you may not be able to complete your purchase that day. After 3 days, if NICS is still giving a \"delayed\" response, the dealer can use their own discretion in selling you the gun."

Ohio doesn't have any sort of waiting period. The dealer will tell you how to safely and legally store your gun for transport back to your home. Ohio doesn't restrict the number of guns you can buy at one time, so you can buy as many guns as you want in one transaction. If you decide not to buy a gun on that day, your NICS check remains valid for 30 days. However, if you purchase a gun after that time has elapsed, you'll have to get another check.

The FFL in Ohio will help you find an FFL near your residence if you don't already have one in mind. [5] X Research source If the state where you live requires additional background checks or information, the FFL in your state will take care of those before you'll be able to take your gun home.

[9] X Research source If you're an Ohio resident, once you buy the gun, you're free to take it home.
