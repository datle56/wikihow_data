      "title": "Disassemble the pitcher to clean every piece.",
      "content": "Disassemble the pitcher to clean every piece. No matter what kind of Brita you have, disassembling it is easy. Start by removing the lid, then take the reservoir, or the piece that holds the filter, out of the pitcher. Finally, remove the filter and set it aside, or throw it away if it’s time to replace it. [1] X Research source The filter doesn’t need to be washed, but you can rinse it off with warm water if you’d like to. Then, just set it aside. Soap can get stuck inside the filter, leading to soapy water."

      "content": "Use a mild dish soap to clean your Brita pitcher. Rinse the lid and the reservoir with warm water, then use a mild dish soap and a rag or a sponge to wipe them down. Be sure to get into every nook and cranny to tackle germs and bacteria. Avoid using anything abrasive, as that could damage your Brita pitcher. [2] X Research source For pitchers with electronics in the lid, be sure to not submerge them in water."

      "content": "Warm and soapy water will clean your Brita in no time. Rinse out the inside with warm water, then use mild dish soap and a sponge or a cloth to wipe it out. Wipe down the outside and the handle as well to clean your entire pitcher thoroughly. [3] X Research source Brita pitchers are not made to withstand the high temperatures in the dishwasher, so always wash them by hand. Putting a Brita in the dishwasher could cause it to warp."

      "title": "Use vinegar to naturally clean your Brita without damage.",
      "content": "Use vinegar to naturally clean your Brita without damage. If you’ve had your Brita pitcher for a while, you might notice some scummy mildew or white limescale as you clean. To remove either one, create a 1:1 ratio with warm water and white vinegar, then pour it into the pitcher. Scrub the inside well, then rinse the pitcher out. [4] X Research source White vinegar is a natural, non-abrasive cleaning agent that will kill mildew and remove limescale without damaging your Brita. If you don’t have white vinegar on-hand, use apple cider vinegar instead."

      "title": "Use warm water to rinse, then let your Brita dry before reassembly.",
      "content": "Use warm water to rinse, then let your Brita dry before reassembly. Make sure you get all of the soap out of each part before moving on. Set the pieces on a towel, and place the pitcher itself upside down so it dries faster. [5] X Research source While wiping down your pitcher with a towel might speed up drying time, it’s actually not recommended. Wiping out your Brita pitcher with a cloth or paper towel could leave minute fibers behind that get into your drinking water."

      "title": "Prepare your filter to replace it in the pitcher.",
      "content": "Prepare your filter to replace it in the pitcher. If you’re using the same filter, quickly rinse it with warm water and let it air dry. If you’re using a brand new filter, unwrap it from the packaging and set it aside before you reassemble your pitcher. [6] X Research source Old model Brita filters may require a pre-soak, but newer models don’t. Check the instructions on the filter package to see if you need to soak your filter before installing it. How often you replace your filter depends on the type of filter you have. Standard filters typically need to be replaced every 1 to 2 months, while long-lasting filters need to be replaced every 6 months."

      "content": "Put your pitcher back together to start drinking water again. Place the reservoir back into the pitcher itself, then reinstall the filter or replace it with a new one. Put the lid on top and fill the reservoir with water to enjoy a delicious glass of filtered water. [7] X Research source Brita recommends washing your pitcher about once a month."
