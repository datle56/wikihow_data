There are a few possible reasons for this: Wrong password - passwords are capital-sensitive, so make sure you're using capital letters as they appear. Router issues - maybe the hotel's router isn't powerful enough to send you signal, or maybe too many people are trying to connect at once. Try to connect again later, or call the front desk to see if this is a common issue. DNS error - You may need to fix your DNS settings. To do that, go to Settings > Network > Settings > Set up Internet connection and look for your current network. Press the \"Option\" button on your controller and select Advanced Settings > DNS Settings and make any necessary changes."
