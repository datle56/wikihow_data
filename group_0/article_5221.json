Hover your mouse over the photo and you'll see arrows appear on the left or right so you can see more photos. Read the ad description carefully. An ad should include the condition of the item, price, seller's area location, and, possibly, a phone number. Follow the seller's instructions to the buyer such as instructing you to use the secure Craigslist email inquiry, or to call a phone number. Avoid deals that seem too good to be true. Be aware that there are a lot of scammers."

      "title": "Agree on a price and transaction type.",
      "content": "Agree on a price and transaction type. If the item is physical, be aware that you'll most likely need to meet with the seller to get the item; if the item you're purchasing is digital, you can simply take care of the transaction over your computer. There are a few tips here to protect yourself and your privacy: Don't give your exact location to anyone you don't trust. You can often meet at a coffee shop, library, gas station, or another public location to finalize the transaction. Meet in a public space during daylight hours and bring a friend or family member if possible. #** If you're sending money digitally, like you're using PayPal , Venmo , or Cash App [1] X Research source , don't send the funds until you have the item in your hands. Some scammers promise you an item, get your money, and never give you what you paid for."

      "content": "Be persistent with your search. Maybe the specific item you're looking for isn't available in the city closest to you; but what about a different city that's 15 minutes further? You can also change the keywords you're searching or search again later in the week."

      "title": "Do your research.",
      "content": "Do your research. Once you've found the item for sale on Craigslist, look around for more of that same item so you can compare the listing amount.

      "title": "Ask detailed questions.",
      "content": "Ask detailed questions. If the condition is missing from the listing, don't hesitate to ask about it! You need to know about any potential imperfections before giving money away. If the seller doesn't want to answer this question, you should move on to another seller with that item. Not including the item's condition is a red flag."

      "content": "Stay calm and confident. Remember, you can easily decide that you don't want to make the purchase if you don't feel like you're getting a good deal. Be prepared to walk away if the seller increases the selling price or if the item's condition is not what you are expecting. Don't be pressured or coerced into buying anything."
