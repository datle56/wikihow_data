      "content": "Find (and read) a book for a beginner. Even if you are not brand new to using a computer, getting a book for beginners is a great way to fill the gaps in your knowledge. Ask your librarian to show you books for beginning computer users, search your favorite bookseller's website for “computers for beginners,” or try one of these: Any computer-related book in the “For Dummies” series, such as PCs for Dummies or Macs for Dummies .

      "content": "Learn the names of the hardware in your computer. To become a computer genius, you will need to understand how the different parts of a computer work with one another. Everything inside of your computer is connected to the motherboard, including the CPU, which acts as the computer’s “brain.” RAM stores data that’s currently in use. Become familiar with how it works with and connects to the motherboard. Peripheral cards add functions to the computer. Learn about sound, networking, and video cards. Storage and disk drives are places to store data. Research hard drives, CD/DVD-ROM drives, and removable media like USB flash drives and SD cards."

      "content": "Go to a computer store and try out the latest technology. Each computer’s hardware specs should be visible on a label or sign near the unit. Notice the different amounts of RAM, different CPU brands and speeds, and different screen resolutions. Try opening the same program on different computers and notice differences in speed. Ask a salesperson which computers they recommend for various tasks. For example, “Which of these units is good for gaming?” or “Which would you recommend to someone who just needs to write papers for college?” Then, observe the difference in specs between the different computers."

      "content": "Open your computer and locate each hardware component. If you’re feeling confident, look inside your own computer to see how the different hardware components connect to one another. If you feel apprehensive, ask someone who knows more about computers to walk you through the process. Never open a computer unless the machine is on a sturdy surface and you are properly grounded."

      "title": "Learn the differences between different operating systems.",
      "content": "Learn the differences between different operating systems. There are pros and cons to using Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Chrome OS, etc. Visit each operating system’s website to familiarize yourself with its features. Then, search the web for blogs that cater specifically to users of those operating systems. Reading user blogs is a great way to discover how people use their computers. Windows is pre-installed on most PCs and is used by businesses as both servers and workstations. Windows is also popular with home users and gamers who love tinkering with hardware. Mac OSX is known to be sleek and aesthetically pleasing. Made popular by artists, Mac OSX almost always runs on Apple hardware (although it can be installed on modern desktops) and has a familiar design that is gaining in popularity. Linux is a free (usually) flavor of “Unix” used by more advanced computer users. It’s highly customizable, secure, can be used on basically any type of hardware to perform any type of function. Chrome OS is a simple operating system found on Google Chromebooks. It’s geared toward people who are more interested in using the web (and web applications) than anything else."

      "content": "Use every opportunity to play with operating systems other than the one you use. To be a well-rounded computer genius, you should have experience using all operating systems and a wide variety of software. You can find Windows PCs at public libraries. Most college campuses have both PCs and Macs available for student use. Alternatively, you can ask a friend or a relative if you can try using their computer. Try doing the same sort of task (like browsing the web) on a Windows, Linux, or Mac computer and notice the differences."

Try to explore a new area of the Control Panel (Windows) or System Preferences (Mac) every day. Just poking around and clicking to view the different options will add necessary information to your budding genius brain. To open the Control Panel in Windows, press ⊞ Win + S to launch the search, then type control panel . Click “Control Panel” in the search results, then browse through the various panels. To view System Preferences on your Mac: Click the Apple menu at the top-left corner of the screen, then click “System Preferences.”"

Linux is a free operating system popular with the geeks (your team!) that can be installed on lots of different hardware configurations. Because Linux is so popular with people who love computers, there’s an entire community of Linux users active on chats and forums. Learning Linux is bound to make you new friends, perhaps even a mentor."

Knowing how to code separates the computer geniuses from casual users. Research what different programming languages do and select one to study. Get a book on the language. Starting with a beginner’s book will build a great foundation for your advanced study. Look into classes that provide hands-on coding experience. You will have to pay for some of the more prestigious courses available through coding academies, but you’ll find the occasional free class through Coursera and Khan Academy. [2] X Research source"

Troubleshooting is one of the most important skills to have in the IT industry. [3] X Research source When you’re experiencing a computer issue, start by figuring out what exactly is going on. Defining the problem as “The mouse doesn’t work” is too broad—narrow it down to the precise behavior or error message, such as “When I connect the mouse to the USB port, I see a message that says “This IRQ is assigned to the keyboard.”"
