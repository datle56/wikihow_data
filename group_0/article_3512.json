The American Bar Association does not recommend any particular undergraduate majors or courses; however, statistics show that prelaw and criminal justice majors are less likely to be accepted to law schools than students who major in fields that require intensive reading and writing. [2] X Research source Prestigious universities have a reputation for being competitive. Not attending a prestigious or expensive university is certainly not a bar to being accepted to law school or even becoming a district attorney, but a degree from a competitive university will impress admissions boards and future employers. Get real-world experience by completing an internship at a law firm or government office (especially the district attorney's office) during your undergraduate years. This experience will teach you how to think like a lawyer and give you a preview of what to expect after law school."
