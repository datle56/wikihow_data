      "content": "Understand your responsibilities. Being a Navy Pilot is an incredibly difficult, time-consuming, and emotionally and physically demanding job. Before you begin your career path, make sure you fully understand your responsibilities and are up to the task. As a pilot, you may take part in warfare. Your duties include antisubmarine efforts, search and rescue operations, and vertical replenishment operations. Vertical replenishment means transferring cargo and supplies between helicopters. [1] X Research source You will also likely conduct surveillance on enemies via collecting photographic evidence. [2] X Research source Training is longterm. Throughout your career, you will receive continued, specialized training for the specific plane you operate. [3] X Research source You will be in control of all internal and external functions of the aircraft you operate. Using the plane you're flying, you will provide attack and defense support for Navy fleets. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Make sure you can meet the physical requirements.",
      "content": "Make sure you can meet the physical requirements. The Navy has strict physical fitness requirements for all members. Work on staying physically fit in the time leading up to enlisting and strive to meet the Navy's requirements. To enlist in the Navy, you have to pass a physical readiness test. This consists of a series of push-ups, sit-ups, and a 1.5 mile (2.4 km) run. You will be asked to perform as many sit-ups and push-ups as possible in 2 minutes, and your run will also be timed. In addition, you have to ride a stationary bike or elliptical machine for 12 minutes without pause. [7] X Research source There's also a standard medical screening to make sure you meet basic health requirements. This includes taking basic vitals and an assessment of any risk factors you might have. [8] X Research source For body fat, men can have a maximum of 22% and women can have a maximum of 33%. In the event you are unable to pass, you will be given 3 weeks to prepare and then try again. Your vision must be no worse than 20/40 and needs to be correctable to 20/20. The Navy does accept officers who've undergone laser eye surgery. If your vision is a problem, this is something to look into. [9] X Research source If you are colorblind or have trouble with depth perception, you can't be a Navy pilot. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Be prepared to make sacrifices.",
      "content": "Be prepared to make sacrifices. Joining the Navy requires a great deal of personal sacrifice, for both you and your family. Make sure you're prepared for those sacrifices going in. Navy pilots move a lot, both during and after training. During your 2 to 2.5 years of flight school, you can expect to move 3 or 4 times. While you will be home during school, you will work odd and often inconsistent hours. Your work obligations are dependent on your country's needs. You may be overseas for long periods, with limited access to communication. You might not always know ahead of time when you'll be leaving, meaning plans in your personal and professional unrelated to the Navy are subject to change quickly. Training is a lifelong process. Even after you've completed flight school and gone on to earn your wings, you will be called back for training throughout your career. This means moving around and spending a great deal of time away from loved ones."

      "content": "Decide when to enlist in the Navy. The first step to becoming a Navy pilot is enlisting in the Navy. You can do so as soon as you turn 18. However, to be a pilot you will need a bachelor's degree. Many people therefore forego enlisting until after college. However, if you'd rather enlist sooner you can enroll in the Naval Reserve Officers' Training Corps (NROTC) at a civilian college. This allows you to take military classes while enrolled in regular college curriculum. Over the summer, you will report for midshipman cruises with the Navy. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Pursue a bachelor's degree. You need a bachelor's degree in order to become a Navy pilot. Before or after enlisting, complete the requirements to earn a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university. There is no specific path of study outlined to become a Navy pilot. Specific training comes after you undergraduate career, when you enlist in flight school. If you want to be a Naval Flight Officer, which is slightly higher up than a pilot, you need a degree in a technical field. Certain courses can help you in your goal of becoming a pilot. Physics and math factor heavily into the operation of an airline, so majoring or minoring in one of those fields can help. [12] X Research source Communication factors heavily into a pilot's job. Consider taking English, communication, and telecommunications classes. [13] X Research source Aeronautical Engineering provides you with advanced understanding of how an aircraft works. Consider majoring in the field, and seek out universities that offer that as a major or minor. This can really help when applying for flight schools, particularly if you're setting your eyes on the prestigious U.S Naval Academy. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Get your military education. After completing your bachelor's degree, you must become a Naval officer commissioned at the rank of ensign. In order to achieve this, you need specific military training. As stated, NROTC programs can be taken during your time at a civilian college. If you've decided to enroll in such a program, you may not need further education upon graduation. Officer Candidate School is an 12-week crash course in military studies. You will train at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida. In addition to becoming familiar with the basic rules and regulations Navy training, you'll engage in physical challenges like swimming, running, and other physical conditioning. [15] X Research source The U.S Naval Academy, located in Annapolis, Maryland, is the most difficult route to becoming an officer. Only about 10% of applicants are admitted each year. In order to make the cut, you should have a great academic record, a history of leadership, and a background in sports and other physically rigorous activities. [16] X Research source"

Once you've completed your military training, you need to pass the Aviation Selection Test Battery to qualify for flight school and subsequent pilot training. The test has not changed much since World War II, when it started being used as a screening tool for Navy pilots. [17] X Research source The test contains five timed subsets: mathematical and verbal, mechanical comprehension, aviation and nautical, spacial perception, and survey gauging interest in aviation. [18] X Research source Minimum requirements depend on the program and specialization you enroll in after taking the test. If you do not meet minimum requirements, you can retake the test. However, there is 3 time lifetime limit. If you cannot pass the test your 3rd time, you will be unable to become a Navy pilot."

[19] X Research source Flight school begins with an introductory flight screening, which includes 25 hours of instruction. Once this period has passed, you will begin an aviation program. This last 2 to 2.5 years and training begins in Florida. However, as stated, you should be prepared to move around throughout your training. [20] X Research source The screening period is followed by primary training. You will relocate to the Florida panhandle, where you'll get hands-on instruction in regards to operating and repairing aircrafts. You will spend roughly 100 hours in flight. [21] X Research source At the end of your primary training period, you will specialize in a particular aircraft. Where you go next depends on what type of aircraft you're chosen to specialize in operating. [22] X Research source"
