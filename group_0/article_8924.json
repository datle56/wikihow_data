However, they know what’s wrong and are probably already thinking about it. Asking about it in clear terms shows you care and are willing to deal with the issue as it is without sugarcoating it, which will likely come as a relief.

It’s normal to be confused and feel more than one emotion, so letting them open up about what they’re feeling can be helpful and supportive. [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source It’s also possible their feelings might be too complicated and overwhelming for them to talk about right away. Just sitting quietly with them can help them feel supported even when they aren’t ready to talk. For instance, if they had a parent die after a long and complicated illness, they would naturally feel sad. But they may also feel relief that the illness is over and guilt for the relief they’re feeling. When they’re ready to talk, be a good listener by staying focused on them and what they’re saying. Resist the temptation to compare what they're going through with a similar experience you’ve had. Show you understand by repeating what the person says back to them. For example, “What I hear you saying is that you are upset because your friend wasn't paying attention to you.” Keep your focus on them, and don’t get distracted. Take in what they’re saying, and don’t focus on thinking about what you want to say next. Make eye contact , nod, or show concern with a frown. Avoid crossing your arms and legs to keep your body language open. [3] X Research source"

It may be tempting to try to help them feel better by encouraging them to look one side. However, they may feel you’re glossing over what's wrong and that their feelings aren't important. Try to avoid saying things like, “Everything happens for a reason,” “It isn't all bad,” or “Time heals all wounds.” Instead, try saying phrases such as, “It's okay to feel bad. You're going through a tough time,” or “I can’t imagine what you’re feeling.

For instance, you could say, \"I'd love to be able to help. I can drive you somewhere if you need me, or I can help by bringing food over? Just let me know what would be more helpful.\" You may also be able to help by offering support with difficult tasks, such as supporting the person if they're obtaining a death certificate for a loved one. Sometimes making a plan can help them feel better . If they’re ready, encourage them to talk about and plan out what they want to do next. Be sincere when you offer support or help of any kind, and make sure you’re willing to follow through.

However, it often helps a grieving person to talk about their loved one. Sharing a memory of the deceased shows your friend that their loved one hasn’t been forgotten, which can be very comforting. [10] X Research source If you didn’t know the deceased person, encourage your friend to share memories with you. #*Say something like, “I’m sorry I never got to meet your grandmother.

Would you like to take a walk, or do you need someone to just sit with you?” Instead of “They wouldn’t want you to feel sad,” say, “There’s no right or wrong way to deal with this.
