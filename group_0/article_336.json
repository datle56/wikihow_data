It is important to have the proper tools of the trade before you get started. [1] X Research source If your hair is thick, coarse, or curly, you are in luck. This look is going to be easy for you. All you will need is a styling product to keep the frizz in control. If your hair is wavy, this look will be pretty easy for you. A little texture cream should be all you need. If your hair is fine or straight, do not worry. With the right products, you can add texture to your hair that will make sure the messy look stays put. Get some styling products that add texture (like sea salt, volumizer, or texturizing pomade). You will probably need to use those with some blow-drying and curling."

The length of your hair affects the amount of product you use, how long it takes to style your locks, and which messy look you want. Short and medium length hair look best with both tousled messy hair and curly messy hair. Tousled messy hair is done with your fingers. If you are going for the curly messy hair and you have short hair, be sure to use a smaller barrel size of curling iron. [2] X Research source Long hair can also do both types of messy hair but generally looks better with curly messy hair. You will use a larger barrel curling iron because you want loose curls that you can tousle with your fingers. [3] X Research source To get the best messy look, start off with a great haircut. The foundation of any hairstyle is the shape."

If your hair tends to frizz you can try a lightweight frizz control product as well. If your hair is wavy, try a sea salt spray to add texture and keep your messy look lasting all day long. If your hair is fine and straight, you will want a texture wax or molding balm. This will help your hair stay in place after curling and tousling. You will also need a brush, a blow dryer, and a curling or flat iron (unless your hair is already curly)."

To curl your hair you have a few options, depending on how controlled or messy you want your curls to look. If you want controlled curls you can use a wide barrel curling iron (Â½ inch to 1 inch wide). Curl sections of your hair, settings them aside as you go. When you have curled all your hair, spray the hair with sea salt or holding spray. Tousle it a bit by running your fingers through it and scrunching it. You can also achieve this using a flat iron as a curling iron. [1] If you want more casual curls, spray a section of your hair with sea salt or holding spray. Twist the section until it twists into a small bun, and clamp it down while it dries (or dry it with your blow dryer). Do this until all your hair is clamped down. Release all the twists and run your fingers through them. [2] If your curls are too controlled you can pull them apart with your fingers. This will create a looser look."

You can do this by pulling apart the top layer of your hair and running a comb or brush through it backward. Start from midway through the strand and comb to the root.

[11] X Research source If you have straight or fine hair, you can use a large dollop of volumizing mousse in your hair to give it some body.
