How’s your day been?” or “You’ve been on my mind all day so I figured I’d text you. How are you?” You could also try sending her a funny meme and say, “I thought you might like this.”"

Plus, if you’ve only been texting her, it could be a great opportunity to meet face to face without the high stakes of a formal date. Try asking her if she can meet you for coffee when you’re in town. You could try, “Hey! I’ll be visiting my cousin in a few weeks. You wanna grab some coffee?” If she happens to be visiting your area, you could try, “Awesome! Let’s get together and grab a coffee.” Reader Poll: We asked 2359 wikiHow readers about which first date they’d like to go on the most, and only 8% said going rock climbing . [Take Poll] So, suggesting a more casual activity, like grabbing coffee, might be more fun for her."

You can still keep texting her, and who knows, maybe one day she’ll be more open to the idea of going out with you. [8] X Research source Try something short and sweet like, “No worries!
