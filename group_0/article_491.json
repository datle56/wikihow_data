Not only are you going to enjoy your food more if you can actually taste it, but you’ll also get your tongue used to the sensation. [1] X Research source Dishes like jerk chicken, mild curry, and gumbo are great if you’re trying to expand your culinary horizons. Spicy mustard is a great way to inject some mild spice into a dish. For a quick dash of heat, try some spicy Mexican or Indian candy. If you’re scouting out new hot sauces, look for labels with “mild” printed on them. If they list the Scoville units/SHU (the unit of measurement for spice), look for something around 450 SHU. [2] X Research source For reference, a standard jalapeno pepper has between 2,500 and 8,000 SHU. [3] X Research source"

[4] X Research source If you keep at it, those mildly spicy foods will eventually taste like nothing, and moderately spicy food will start to taste mild. Try to eat something spicy at least once a week. It takes time to build up a tolerance to spicy food, so be patient! [5] X Research source The chemical responsible for the heat in spicy food is called capsaicin.

[8] X Research source This way, you’ll build your tolerance up over time. Once you’re ready for the really spicy peppers, look for habanero, Scotch bonnet, or ghost peppers."

Every few bites or so, take a sip. This will dramatically cut back on the amount of heat you experience, as the fat and protein in milk will neutralize the spice in your food. [10] X Research source A dollop of sour cream can also help if you’re eating some spicy chili or tacos.

      "content": "A regular glass of water isn’t going to do anything to help with the heat. In fact, it may make the burning feeling worse. This happens because the water spreads the capsaicin around in your mouth. [13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you have to drink water, put ice in it to at least numb your mouth. [14] X Research source Alternatively, sipping something acidic may soothe your pain. Lemonade, orange juice, or tomato juice will all work. [15] X Research source Alcohol may help dissolve some of the capsaicin, but you need to consume a lot to really feel the benefits, which isn’t ideal. Acidic ingredients will also help cut through the spice and cool you off. If your tacos come with a few lime wedges, add them to your dish. [16] X Research source"

It won’t do a ton to fight the capsaicin per se, but it will give your tongue something different to focus on. This can have a tremendous impact if you’re feeling the heat. [17] X Research source Something crunchy and acidic, like a cherry tomato, may help as well."

      "content": "Starchy carbohydrates will also create a barrier that makes it harder for the capsaicin to dig into your taste buds. Keep a slice of bread next to your glass of milk if you know you’re going to eat something extremely spicy. [18] X Research source Don’t skip the naan bread or rice when you’re digging into some chicken tikka masala, and turn that spicy burrito bowl into a regular burrito with a tortilla. Spicy Indian and Chinese food comes with rice for a reason—the texture and starch can dramatically cut back on your heat."

Exhale slowly to cool your mouth out and do your best not to blow air all over the person sitting across from you. This is one of those little things that most people don’t think about, but it can really make a world of difference. [19] X Research source This can also help on a psychological level. If you’re really in pain, picture yourself literally blowing the pepper flakes into the air. The visualization may help take the edge off."

Some buttery popcorn or buttered toast may also help if you prefer starches to dairy. [20] X Research source Something like cheesecake is a great option if you’re trying to hit all of your marks. It’s got plenty of saturated fat, some starch, and a large dose of dairy."
