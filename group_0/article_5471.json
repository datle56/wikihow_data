      "content": "Count your correct answers. Figure out how many questions you answered correctly and write this number down. Then, draw a line under this number so that it is the top number of a fraction. For example, if you had 21 correct answers, write down 21 / . Do not write anything under the fraction yet. [1] X Research source For long tests, it might be easier to subtract the number of questions you got wrong from the total number of questions on the test. For example, if you got 5 questions wrong on a 26-question test, subtract 5 from 26 (26 - 5 = 21). Then, use 21 as the top number in your fraction. If some questions are worth more points than others, use the total number of points you earned as your top number instead. For example, if you earned 53 points out of 70 points possible, then write 53 as your top number."

In our example, the test had 26 questions, so your fraction would be 21 / 26 . [2] X Research source Check your fraction to make sure that it is set up correctly. Remember that the number of questions you got right or the number of points you earned should be on top of the fraction. The total number of questions on the test or the total number of points possible should be at the bottom of the fraction."

Just divide the top number by the bottom number. For example, take /26 and plug it into the calculator as 21 ÷ 26. You should get the answer 0.8077 . [3] X Research source Don’t worry about the numbers past the first four digits of the answer. For example, if the answer was 0.8077777, you can ignore the last three sevens. They will not affect your percentage."

The answer will be your grade as a percentage (your score out of 100). In our example, 0.8077 x 100 = 80.77 . This means your test grade is 80.77% . [4] X Research source Depending on your teacher’s grading scale, 80.77% would be a B or a B-."

A “B” or higher is typically considered a “good” grade. A “D” is usually the lowest passing grade, but it may not fulfill requirements for further courses or college applications. [5] X Research source An \"A\" is 90% to 100% . A grade of 100% is an “A+.” A grade of 94-99% would be considered an “A.” A grade of 90-93% would be considered an “A-.” A \"B\" is 80% to 89% . A grade of 87% or higher would be considered a “B+.” A grade of 83-86% would be considered a “B.” A grade of 80%-82% would be considered a “B-.” A \"C\" is 70% to 79% . A grade of 77% or higher would be considered a “C+.” A grade of 73-76% would be considered a “C.” A grade of 70-72% would be considered a “C-.” A \"D\" is 60% to 69% . A grade of 67% or higher would be considered a “D+.” A grade of 63-66% would be considered a “D.” A grade of 60-62% would be considered a “D-.” An \"F\" is 59% and below . An “F” is a failing grade, so professors and teachers do not usually assign + or – values to “F” grades. [6] X Research source"

[7] X Research source 70% to 100% is the highest grade, a mark of Distinction. 60% to 69% earns a Merit. 50% to 59% is Pass. Some schools Fail at 49% or below , while others fail at 39% or below ."
