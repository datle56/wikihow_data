Some popular video captioning services include Rev, GoTranscript, and 3Play Media. You may have the option of getting your caption file separately or ordering a video with the captions already built in. Depending on how fast you want your captions—and how difficult the audio is to transcribe—you may need to pay some additional fees on top of the base charge per minute of video."
