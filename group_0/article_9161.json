Many apps, such as Hulu or Netflix, are already Chromecast-enabled, but casting from a web browser like Chrome requires a few extra steps. A third-party app such as Video and TV Cast therefore comes in handy. If you opt for Video and TV Cast, be sure to download the app labeled \"for Chromecast\" and not \"for Fire TV.\" [1] X Research source Video and TV Cast is free, but does offer a paid version to avoid ads."

Keep in mind that no screen mirroring apps, including Screen Mirror for Chromecast, can handle the audio transfer as well, as Chrome blocks this possibility."
