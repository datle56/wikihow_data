Mousse is generally preferable to wax or gel-based styling products, as it tends to leave less residue in your hair. As a general rule, the less you feel the product in your hair, the better it is at adding volume. You want your hair to feel flexible and lightweight after applying product. Find a product that works well for your particular look. Try out a few mousses, sprays, pomades, and gels to find a product that you like. Tip : Avoid heavy gels, sprays, waxes, and mousses that promise a long-lasting hold. These products can weigh down your hair, cause it to look matted down and greasy, and make it feel crispy or crunchy."
