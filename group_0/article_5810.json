      "content": "Ask the representative if you need to take additional action. In most cases, you won’t need to do anything else after you call customer service. However, some third-party companies that offer you “free” magazine deals will keep trying to send them until you cancel with them. Fortunately, the SI representative should be able to tell you if you need to contact a third-party company. [3] X Research source You don’t need to worry about this if you purchased your subscription through SI. Most third-party companies won’t renew your subscription after you cancel it. However, this does sometimes happen, so asking the customer service representative if you might be at risk for auto-renewal can save you a headache in the future."
