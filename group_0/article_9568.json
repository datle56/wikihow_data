If you do engage in sexual activity, be sure to use a condom to help prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

      "content": "Continue to exercise. Although your body might feel different as it is changing, it is important to keep on exercising. Learning to be coordinated with a new physical frame is important. When you do sports, your body creates extra beta-endorphins, which are hormones that can decrease stress and put you in a better mood. Understand that some sports might be harder for you than in the past. For example, if you were a star figure skater before entering puberty, you might find jumping is more difficult with increased weight. This happens to almost everyone! Talk with your coaches about how to adapt to your new physical frame. Exercising can also help girls who have menstrual pain.

[8] X Research source For girls, your body is producing extra estrogen and progesterone. Boys will receive more testosterone.

Girls tend to start puberty around the age 8 to 13, whereas boys tend to start puberty a bit later from ages 9 to 14. [9] X Research source Some children also enter puberty earlier or later than these ranges. If girls begin puberty before age 8 or boys before age 9, this is called “precocious puberty.” If you notice your body changing early, speak with your parents or doctor immediately.
