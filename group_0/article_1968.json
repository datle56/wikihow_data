      "content": "Determine if you're still new to each other. The early stages of a relationship are characterized by infatuation and spending more time with someone. Observe if you're still asking about the person's likes and dislikes, their hobbies and interests, and their beliefs. Notice if you are evaluating their personality characteristics and habits to see if they’re compatible with you. You’ll want to assess if you’re comfortable enough to continue being around them. For example, you may ask yourself: Is this person caring and friendly? Is this person controlling or mean? Does this person have a tendency to be unhappy or irritable? Is this person generally fun to be with?"

      "content": "Notice if you're focused on physical attraction. Notice if you idealize your partner, get easily excited by them, or think of them frequently.

      "title": "Look out for attempts to impress.",
      "content": "Look out for attempts to impress. Ask yourself if you are on your best behavior, go out of your way to please the other person, or make attempts to flatter and flirt. If so, you're likely still in the infatuation stage of dating, where there is more pressure to impress and build connection. You’ll be so excited by the attention you’re getting that you’ll try your best not to make a mistake. [2] X Research source For example, you may spend extra time getting ready for dates, say “yes” to activities you might not normally do, buy or wear nicer clothes, and spend more time with them than by yourself or with other friends. Keep in mind the importance of boundaries. For your relationship to grow and be successful, you’ll need to learn to be authentic and stop trying to impress your partner all the time. Giving up time with friends and family is not healthy for your relationship long-term."

      "content": "Assess if you've committed to dating. If you're spending more time together, feeling more comfortable with them, and getting to know them beyond the basics, you're now in an exclusive dating relationship.

      "content": "Pay attention to expectations. As you begin to date more, you’ll likely establish expectations of one another. Your expectations may be different and may affect whether your relationship will last. If you're considering these qualities and needs more, you're moving out of the infatuation stage and into a post-honeymoon type stage of more realistic love. [3] X Research source Think about: How you like to spend your free time, whether with friends or together. How much alone time you need. Who will pay for things when you go out together. How much physical touch or affection you need."

      "content": "See if you are accepting of your partner's imperfections. [4] X Expert Source Moshe Ratson, MFT, PCC Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 7 August 2019. Are you aware the other person’s faults and quirks? If so, then you’re in a normal phase of realistic love in which you may no longer see your partner through rose-colored glasses, but instead start to notice the things that might annoy or irritate you. It's okay to notice these things — no one is perfect, and your partner is going to start noticing quirks and imperfections about you, too. What's important is figuring out if you can accept these things about your partner. Are you starting to notice that your partner never cleans up the dishes after eating? Or have you noticed larger issues you may need to work on, like that they often say they are fine when they're actually very upset? If you cannot tolerate the other person's faults at this stage, or feel that they are things that the two of you cannot work on, you might decide to move on from the relationship."

At the committed stage, partners usually know each other very well, and can anticipate what the other may need during hard times or on a daily basis. Knowing and caring for your partner's needs before they ask is a great way to care for them daily. For instance, if you know your partner has had a stressful day, take it upon yourself to have dinner ready when they get home from work and do the clean up, too. Or if they've been going through a rough time, encourage them to have a night with their friends — let them know they shouldn't feel guilty for not including you, and to go out and enjoy themselves. If you aren't sure what your partner's wants and needs are, then you need to have a discussion. Sit down and ask them what they want and need from the relationship, and don't interrupt or get defensive. Then take your turn."

Don’t try to fix anything or judge, just listen and decompress together."

You'll be able to once again accept your partner for who they are, faults and all. You'll learn to manage or let go of your expectations of your partner at this stage. If you can't, or if you notice increased conflict or disrespect in your relationship, seek counseling. Violence is not healthy or acceptable at any relationship stage. Seek help from a counselor or domestic violence shelter if your partner become violent or verbally abusive."
