      "title": "Score the fat on the picanha.",
      "content": "Score the fat on the picanha. One side of the picanha will be entirely covered in a layer of white fat while the other side isn’t. Use a sharp knife to cut a criss-cross pattern into the fat, making sure you don’t cut into the actual meat. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Rub both sides of the meat with lots of salt.",
      "content": "Rub both sides of the meat with lots of salt. Sprinkle salt over each side of the picanha, using your hands to pat it into the meat if desired. Use a generous amount of salt, as this is the only seasoning that’s necessary. [2] X Research source Rock salt is the best type to use on the meat."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the skin from the non-fat side, if necessary.",
      "content": "Remove the skin from the non-fat side, if necessary. The skin is a similar color to the fat, but it's very thin and doesn’t cover all of the meat. If you see skin on the meat side of the picanha, cut it off with a sharp knife and discard it. [3] X Research source You don’t need to cut anything off of the fat side of the meat."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set the grill or pan to high heat.",
      "content": "Set the grill or pan to high heat. If you’re using a grill to cook the picanha, turn it to high heat and let it heat up for several minutes beforehand. You can also use a regular pan to cook the picanha if preferred, setting the stove to high heat as well. [4] X Research source If you’re using a pan, you don’t need to add oil to the pan as the fat will render once it heats up."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set the meat on the heat source with the fat facing down.",
      "content": "Set the meat on the heat source with the fat facing down. Once your grill or pan has heated up, place the meat onto the heat source. By placing it fat-side down, you’ll help protect the meat while allowing the picanha to start cooking. [5] X Research source If you’re using a pan, letting the fat render for a few minutes before pouring the rendered fat out will help get rid of the excess."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flip the meat after 5-8 minutes to sear the other side.",
      "content": "Flip the meat after 5-8 minutes to sear the other side. After the 5-8 minutes are up, use tongs to move the picanha to its other side. The picanha should be meat-side down, and you can let it cook like this for another 5 or so minutes. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the picanha from the heat once the outer layer is browned.",
      "content": "Remove the picanha from the heat once the outer layer is browned. After cooking the picanha for at least 5 minutes on each side, check to see that the fat and skin are seared on both sides. [7] X Research source The picanha won’t be fully cooked yet, which is okay."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slice the meat into 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) sections against the grain.",
      "content": "Slice the meat into 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) sections against the grain. Move the picanha to a cutting board and use a sharp knife to cut the seared meat into pieces like a steak. As you cut the picanha open, you’ll notice that the inner core is still uncooked. [8] X Research source You don't need to wait for the meat to cool before slicing it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Salt the picanha slices before setting them back on the grill or pan.",
      "content": "Salt the picanha slices before setting them back on the grill or pan. Sprinkle the salt on one side of each slice of the picanha only. Once they’re all salted, set each piece back on the grill or in the pan to continue cooking. [9] X Research source Remove any excess fat or salt from the pan before putting the meat back on the heat. Place the meat with the salted side up."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cook each piece for 2-5 minutes.",
      "content": "Cook each piece for 2-5 minutes. By slicing the picanha into manageable sections, you’ll be able to choose how long each piece is cooked. The sections of picanha should only take 2-5 more minutes to cook on high heat. Flip them over frequently to see how each side is cooking. [10] X Research source You can cook the slices to your desired doneness such as rare, medium, or well done. Remove the picanha from the heat source once they’re done cooking."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the picanha sit for 10-15 minutes before cutting it.",
      "content": "Let the picanha sit for 10-15 minutes before cutting it. It’s important not to immediately cut into the picanha after it’s done cooking so that the juices have time to settle. After 10-15 minutes, serve the picanha with a side like a green salad or baby potatoes. [11] X Research source Store leftovers in the fridge in a sealed container. You can leave the meat in the fridge for several days."
