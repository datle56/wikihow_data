Kurtz “Confirmation is a call to mission, to witness to Christ in every aspect of our lives, with our words and our actions.” – Pope Francis “Confirmation is an opportunity to renew our commitment to Christ and to the mission of his Church.” – Bishop Michael F. Burbidge “Confirmation is the sacrament that enables us to be rooted more deeply in the Father’s love and to be more fully committed to the life and mission of Jesus Christ.” – Archbishop Charles Chaput. “Confirmation is not the end, but rather the beginning of our journey as disciples of Christ.” – Pope Benedict XVI.
