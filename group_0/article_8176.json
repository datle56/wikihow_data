      "title": "De-carbonate your beer.",
      "content": "De-carbonate your beer. Pour a bottle or can of beer into a jug or bowl and let it sit overnight or throughout the day. The more air surface your beer is exposed to, the faster it will oxidize and become flat. Beer becomes flat by releasing the carbon dioxide it creates. It's important that the carbon dioxide is gone from the beer when using it to treat hair as carbon dioxide combined with water can create hard water or water with a high mineral content. [1] X Research source The presence of carbon dioxide can hinder the effects of shampoos and make it harder for you to wash your hair effectively. As well, hard water causes the scales on each hair to stand up, making your hair look tangled and tough."

      "content": "Mix a few tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in your beer. Vinegar helps with counteracting rough or brittle feeling hair but smoothing out the scales or cuticles found on each of strand of hair. Shampoo especially aggravates hair by lifting up these scales and preventing hair from feeling smooth and looking shiny. Consider using raw apple cider vinegar rather than commercial vinegar. Raw vinegar is not distilled, heated, or clarified. Raw vinegar has much of the good bacteria, nutrients, and enzymes needed to improve hair texture. You can mix 1 to 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar to 8 ounces (250 mL) of water instead of beer and treat your hair the same way you would with a beer wash. It's best to only use a vinegar rinse a few times a week. If used everyday, it can be quite drying for hair."
