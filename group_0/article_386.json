[7] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. If you’d like to save sex until marriage, say something like, “Sex is a really important part of any relationship, and it’s a big commitment. I’d like to wait until we’re married to cross that threshold.” Or, you might decide to wait until you’re in a serious, committed relationship before having sex. If that’s the case, and you haven’t established that you’re in this kind of relationship, address that first. Try saying something like, “I really like you, and I’d like to see where this goes. I’d also like to wait until we’re more serious about sex, because that would make me feel more comfortable.” Psychotherapist Kelli Miller encourages you to consider the situation completely before making a decision, including your motives and how it could affect the relationship. She says, “You really want to make this decision without feeling any type of pressure, either societal or from your partner. Then, you want to play it out: how would you feel if you did do this? Would you feel okay the next day? Would you feel scared? That's very telling.” [8] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 21 July 2020.

If you do decide to engage in a physical relationship with your partner before marriage, try not to fall into a routine as routine is more closely associated with marriage. Instead, keep things adventurous and dynamic by experimenting with new ideas, keeping an open line of communication about the things you like, and continuing to build trust with your better half. Remember that intimacy isn’t limited to the bedroom. You can enhance intimacy and grow your bond by doing relatively wholesome things like cuddling, holding hands, slow dancing when a favorite song comes on, and asking your partner deep questions about themselves."

You can try to compromise most of the time, but don’t be afraid to prioritize yourself every now and then.

If you’re a naturally nurturing person, it may be difficult to pump the brakes on taking your girlfriend duties more seriously. However, one idea that discourages this is the fact that it may give your partner the idea that he can receive all sorts of special treatment without taking the next step in your relationship, i.e. asking you to marry him. It touches on the same notion behind the popular idiom, “Why buy the cow when you’re getting the milk for free?” [23] X Research source This expression has a few uses, but originally referred to men who didn’t want to get married because they were already receiving all the benefits of marriage without having to commit."

If you decide to start taking care of more things for your partner— doing more chores around the house, scheduling his dentist appointments, folding and ironing his laundry— they might seriously appreciate it, or, they might not.

Treating them with respect, creating an image that they can truly live up to, looking for their strengths, and talking to them, instead of at them, should help restore the balance in your relationship.
