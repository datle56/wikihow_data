Simply get out a large bucket with a handle and pour in 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Using an easy-to-handle bucket helps prevent spills when you pour the solution into the water dispenser. Warning : Never mix bleach with vinegar or other household cleaners. The mixture can release a harmful gas that’s dangerous to breathe in.

Then, pour 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of liquid chlorine bleach into the bucket with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Mix the solution together gently. Use unscented bleach to help limit harsh smells and make flushing the bleach easier. Mix the solution in a well-ventilated area that can tolerate spills, such as your kitchen sink."

If you don’t want to clean with bleach, distilled white vinegar is a less harsh alternative. Just mix in 1 part white vinegar for every 3 parts water, which is 5 ⅓ cups (1.3 L) of vinegar for 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. [4] X Research source Note : While vinegar can kill some common germs and bacteria, it is not as effective as other disinfectants like chlorine bleach. [5] X Research source Vinegar is a great option if you are dealing with hard water and mineral deposits. [6] X Research source To reduce the scent of the vinegar, add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15-30 mL) of lemon juice to the solution."

      "content": "Unplug the cooler, remove the water bottle, and drain the reservoir. To safely clean your water cooler, unplug it from the wall. Then, lift out the water bottle. Some water might remain in the reservoir after taking out the bottle, so lift up the cool tap (and any other taps your cooler has) to drain it into a bucket. If your water cooler has a hot water tap, turn off the heater by flipping the switch on the back of the machine before you unplug it. If there are other electronics plugged into the outlet, unplug them too. This prevents any possibility, however small, of water meeting live electricity. Time your cleaning when the water bottle is empty, as this makes removing it easier."

      "content": "Lift out the no-spill guard and baffle inside the reservoir. If you have a top-loading water dispenser, look for a funnel-shaped no-spill guard that covers the top of your machine. Either align the arrows on the piece to remove it, or simply lift up on the notch. Then, reach into the exposed reservoir and lift out the disk-shaped baffle piece. In a water cooler, a baffle is typically a plastic disc or pane that directs the flow of water. If you’re having trouble finding the no-spill guard and baffle, check your water cooler’s manual for their specific locations and removal instructions."

Then, use a sponge or scrub brush with a long handle to scrub the inside of the reservoir. This helps remove any stuck-on dirt or mineral deposits inside. [7] X Research source If you’re cleaning with bleach, wear gloves as you scrub to protect your hands from getting irritated. For bottom-loading dispensers : Set the water pump directly in the bucket of cleaning solution. Then, drain about half of the solution into a new bucket using the tap (or taps, if you have more than one). Let the remaining solution sit in the cooler. [8] X Research source"

Then, drain the solution through the tap and into a separate container. Dispose of the bleach or vinegar solution by pouring it down the sink or toilet. [9] X Research source If you have cool and hot taps, drain the solution using both to clean them out. For bottom-loading dispensers : Drain the rest of the remaining solution into a bucket using the tap (or taps). [10] X Research source"

Then, use a sponge to scrub the no-spill guard and baffle. Rinse off the soap with water and let the pieces air dry. When the pieces are fully dry, reattach them to the water dispenser. If your no-spill guard has an air filter on it, do not get it wet. Simply lift off the small air filter piece before cleaning the guard."

Just grab a disinfecting wipe and scrub the water faucet tap (or taps). Then, wipe down the top and sides of the dispenser. Alternatively, wet a washcloth with warm water and dish soap and wipe down the tap and dispenser. Dust off the vents on the back of the dispenser with a duster, too."

Tighten the bottle to ensure it fits snugly and watch for air bubbles rising to the top; this indicates that the bottle is sealed to the dispenser. Then, plug in the dispenser and fill a glass of water, sipping it to make sure there’s no unpleasant taste. [14] X Research source For bottom-loading dispensers : Take off the water bottle’s cap and insert the water pump. Push it down until the lid clicks in place and the pump reaches the bottom of the bottle. Then, place the bottle inside the bottle cabinet.
