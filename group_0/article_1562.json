    {
      "title": "Prepare the cream.",
      "content": "Prepare the cream. The tube of cream should come with an applicator that you can screw it onto. Gently squeeze the tube from the bottom so that the applicator is filled with the correct dosage. Look for a fill mark on the applicator or fill the applicator completely, if instructed. Don't overfill the applicator since you'll need to unscrew the applicator from the tube. Hold the applicator upright so that none of the cream leaks out. Avoid screwing the applicator and the tube too tight. You'll need to be able to get the tube of cream out of the applicator for future use."

      "title": "Position your body.",
      "content": "Position your body. Stand with your legs and knees apart. Place one foot up on a stool, the edge of the toilet, the bathtub or a chair. Or, you could lay on your back with your knees bent and your feet about shoulder width apart. You should be somewhat comfortable and have easy access to your vaginal opening."
    },
    {
      "title": "Insert the applicator.",
      "content": "Insert the applicator. Take your non-dominant hand and separate the lips of your vulva (the labia) so that your vagina is exposed. Your dominant hand should be holding the applicator filled with cream. Relax and place the applicator into your vaginal opening. Insert it in your vagina and depress the plunger of the applicator using your index finger. Depress the plunger completely so that it stops moving and all the cream is inserted. It may help to point the applicator towards the small of your back when you place it into your vaginal opening."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dispose of the applicator.",
      "content": "Dispose of the applicator. Remove the applicator and dispose of it if you won't need it again. If you used a reusable applicator, wash it with warm soapy water. Rinse it well and let it air dry completely. Remember to wash and dry your hands. Since some of the cream may leak out, you might want to wear a pad (not a tampon) to collect any discharge."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the cream even if you start menstruating.",
      "content": "Use the cream even if you start menstruating. You should use the vaginal cream for the full number of days prescribed at the correct dose. Don't stop using the vaginal cream if you start menstruating. The vaginal cream will still be effective; it just may be a little messier to insert. Just make sure to use pads since tampons could absorb the cream. If you miss a dose or run out of the vaginal cream before your treatment is complete, call the doctor or pharmacist for a refill."
    },
    {
      "title": "Store the vaginal cream correctly.",
      "content": "Store the vaginal cream correctly. Most vaginal creams are designed to be stored at room temperature. Check the information on the box or ask your pharmacist to be sure. Storing the cream at a temperature that's too hot or cold could damage it. It's best to store most medications in a cool, dry place. Avoid storing medication in a medicine cabinet since heat and moisture from the bathroom could cause it to be less effective or expire early. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Apply the cream at night.",
      "content": "Apply the cream at night. The heat of your body will cause most creams to leak out a little after you apply them to your vagina. If you can, try to use the vaginal cream at night. Laying down after you apply the cream can also keep it in your vagina longer and reduce the amount that leaks out. If you need to use vaginal creams during the day, wear a pad to avoid staining your underwear and lay down for a few minutes immediately after you apply the cream, if you can."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch for side effects.",
      "content": "Watch for side effects. The side effects will vary depending on what medication is in the vaginal cream. In general, side effects may include vaginal discomfort, vaginal dryness, burning or itching and potentially messy discharge from the vagina. Be sure to read the information that came with the vaginal cream. This will give you more detailed information about the specific side effects you can expect."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get medical attention if you feel discomfort.",
      "content": "Get medical attention if you feel discomfort. If any side effects are causing you discomfort or you feel pain, contact your doctor. If you experience swelling of the vagina and vulva area, itching, hives, or tightness of the chest, you may be having an allergic reaction so it's important to get medication attention. Always ask your doctor if you have any questions about using the vaginal cream. You should also talk with your doctor about whether or not you need to refrain from sexual intercourse while you use the vaginal cream."
