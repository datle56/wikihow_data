      "content": "Make a paper clip tester. You can use a paper clip to help test your power supply and trick it into thinking it has been switched on. To do this, straighten a paperclip and then bend it into a “U” shape. This paperclip will act as the pins that are inserted into the power supply that gives it the “Power ON” signal."

      "title": "Find the green pin and black pin (make-specific).",
      "content": "Find the green pin and black pin (make-specific). You will insert the paperclip's ends into the green pin (there should be only one) and a neighboring black pin. This is make-specific, so check the manual or online to find out which pins you should use for your specific power supply. For example, a Corsair PSU requires you to short pins 16 & 17 while an ATX power supply requires you to use pins 15 & 16. [3] X Research source Before you do this, double-check to make sure that the power supply is completely disconnected from any power outlet, switched off, and not connected to any computer components. Failing to do so means sticking a metal paperclip into a live power supply with electricity running through it. You can shock yourself and cause physical harm as well as damage your computer."

      "title": "Check the fan.",
      "content": "Check the fan. Once the power supply is receiving power, you should be able to hear and/or see a fan moving. This will let you know that the power supply is at least working. If the power supply does not turn on at all, double-check your pins (after unplugging) and try again. If it still does not turn on, it is most likely dead. Many power supplies run the fan for only a second after it powers on; that is the zero-RAM feature. Don't be alarmed that the fan isn't continuously running! The fan briefly turning on means that your power supply is at least supplying output. This test will not tell you if the power supply is functioning as it should, just that it is turning on. You will need to perform the next test to ensure that it is outputting correctly."

You can also find them online easily at retailers like Newegg.com, MicroCenter, and TigerDirect. Unlike poking around with pins using a multimeter, a PSU tester is plug-and-play. All you'll need to do is disconnect the power supply from your computer, connect the PSU tester to the power supply and CPU, and power on your PC to check the power supply."

Depending on your power supply, you might actually have a 6-pin or 8-pin secondary connector. If there are multiple, connect the 24-pin connector, and just one of the other connectors, to the matching locations on your PSU tester. The PSU tester should still be turned off at this point."

      "content": "Check the voltage and PG value. It's normal for the voltages recorded not to match the suggested voltages exactly, as long as they are within a 5% range. If any values are outside of the suggested range, the tester will alert you with an LED or sound, depending on the tester. Any out-of-range values indicate it's time to replace your power supply unit. The PG value should be within 100-500 MS. If the PG value is way too high, your computer will constantly reboot or shut itself down. A new power supply should fix that problem."

Don't forget to plug in the power to your video card (if it requires one), your hard drive, and your optical drives. You can briefly use your computer without the case on, but just be careful not to ruin the insides of your computer! If the computer won't start without the case, you must remove the appropriate jumper on the motherboard. The manual for your computer should explain how you do this.
