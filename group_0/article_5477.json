      "title": "Check the item’s total price.",
      "content": "Check the item’s total price. The unit price is typically a fraction of the total cost of the product. Look at the price tag or use a price scanning tool to find the total price of the product. [2] X Research source If you have a coupon, subtract the coupon value from the total price before you calculate the unit price."

      "title": "Find the quantity of the item that the package contains.",
      "content": "Find the quantity of the item that the package contains. Look on the label to check the amount of product in the container. The quantity is normally listed on the bottom right corner of the package. [3] X Research source Some products will be sold by item, such as toilet paper, paper towels, or pencils. However, most items will have a unit of measurement, like ounces, cups, quarts, gallons, milliliters, liters, etc."

    {
      "title": "Make sure both products have the same unit of measurement.",
      "content": "Make sure both products have the same unit of measurement. Sometimes the products you’re comparing measure their quantity using different units, such as quarts versus gallons or ounces versus grams. If this is the case, change the unit of measurement for one of the products to match the other before you calculate the unit rate. [4] X Research source For example, let’s say you’re looking at a quart of milk for $1.25 and a gallon of milk for $4.29. There are 4 quarts in a gallon, so you could adjust the price for the quart of milk by multiplying it by 4. To purchase a gallon of milk in individual quart-size bottles, you’d pay $1.25 x 4, which is $5.00. Similarly, let’s say you’re looking at a liter of vegetable oil for $9.79 and a 12 oz bottle for $4.99. One liter contains 33.8 ounces, so you can use that number as your quantity."

      "title": "Divide the total price by the quantity to get the unit price.",
      "content": "Divide the total price by the quantity to get the unit price. Use your calculator or phone to find the unit price. If you're doing the math by hand, use long division to divide the total price by the quantity. Here are some examples: [5] X Research source Let’s say the product is a 6-roll pack of toilet paper for $4.59. To get the unit price, you’d divide $4.59 by 6 to get $0.77. The unit price is $0.77. Similarly, you might be considering a 24 oz bottle of shampoo for $13.79. Divide $13.79 by 24, which is $0.57."

    {
      "title": "Look for the unit cost on the product label for an easier option.",
      "content": "Look for the unit cost on the product label for an easier option. Most stores include the product’s unit price on the shelf label for that product. Typically, the unit price is printed in small type in the top or lower left corner and may have a box around it. Check the shelf label to see if the unit price is there. [6] X Research source As an example, when you’re looking at an 8 oz bottle of olive oil that costs $5.79, you might see a unit price of $0.72 printed in small type in the corner of the label."

      "title": "Calculate the unit price of the items you’re planning to buy.",
      "content": "Calculate the unit price of the items you’re planning to buy. Divide the total cost of each product by the quantity in the package. Get the unit price for each item. [7] X Research source For instance, let’s say you’re trying to choose between a 6-roll pack of toilet paper for $4.59 and a 9-roll pack of toilet paper for $7.29. To get the unit prices, calculate $4.59/6 = $0.77 and $7.29/9 = $0.81. Alternatively, you might be trying to choose between a 32-oz family-sized box of cereal for $4.89 and a 12-oz regular-sized box of cereal for $2.29. You’d calculate $4.89/32 = $0.15 and $2.29/12 = $0.19."

      "title": "Choose the item with the lowest unit price.",
      "content": "Choose the item with the lowest unit price. Generally, the product with the lowest unit cost is the best value. Compare the unit prices that you calculated to see which one is lower. Then, purchase that product. [8] X Research source As an example, if a 6-roll pack of toilet paper has a unit price of $0.77 and the 9-roll pack has a unit price of $0.81, the 6-roll pack is the best choice. Alternatively, a family-sized box of cereal is a better deal at a unit price of $0.15 versus a smaller box at a unit price of $0.19."

      "title": "Make sure that the quality of the items is similar, if that matters to you.",
      "content": "Make sure that the quality of the items is similar, if that matters to you. Typically, items that are of lesser quality will have a lower unit cost. You might still choose to purchase the less expensive item. However, consider the quality of the items when making a final purchasing decision. [9] X Research source For example, a toilet paper that has a thicker ply or more sheets may have a higher unit cost than single-ply toilet paper with a low sheet count. In this case, you might decide that the higher-quality toilet paper is a better value for you."
