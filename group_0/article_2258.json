    {
      "title": "Talk to your orthodontist or dentist about the procedure.",
      "content": "Talk to your orthodontist or dentist about the procedure. If you are anxious, tell them so they can adapt your treatment. [1] X Research source Dentists and orthodontists are used to dealing with anxious patients. They will explain the procedure to you and help you handle your anxiety. They can also suggest ways to reduce your nervousness."

    {
      "title": "Practice deep breathing before and during the procedure.",
      "content": "Practice deep breathing before and during the procedure. This will provide a distraction for you and it can help to reduce your anxiety. [2] X Research source If you are more relaxed, you are less likely to be in a lot of pain. Breathe in slowly through your nose. Pause before exhaling slowly. Keep breathing slowly and steadily in a rhythm. Concentrate on this and you will be distracted from what the dentist is doing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Close your eyes and listen to music.",
      "content": "Close your eyes and listen to music. Bring an iPod, phone, or music player with you and listen to music or a podcast. [3] X Research source Choose music that is calming, rather than something jarring and energetic. Alternatively, listen to an audiobook. Bring earbuds so other patients can't hear your music. Make a playlist ahead of time so you have enough music to last through your appointment. Some dentists or orthodontists may have televisions for you to watch during the procedure or music playing in the background to distract you. Some dentists' offices now have 3D virtual reality glasses, which you can wear to distract and entertain yourself during your entire procedure."

      "title": "Avoid caffeine before your appointment.",
      "content": "Avoid caffeine before your appointment. Caffeine can make you more nervous and jittery. [4] X Research source It can also keep your dental anesthetic from working as well, so it might be more difficult for your gum and teeth to become numb. Drinks that contain caffeine include coffee, tea, sodas, and energy drinks. Do drink plenty of water before your appointment. Make sure to avoid any sugary drinks or foods before your appointment too."

      "title": "Check to make sure none of the wires are poking you before leaving.",
      "content": "Check to make sure none of the wires are poking you before leaving. The best time to address this problem is at the appointment before you go home. [5] X Research source Ask your dentist or orthodontist to trim or adjust any wires that are poking or scraping your mouth. If it is the brackets causing discomfort, ask your dentist to apply some dental wax to reduce any scraping. Remember that it is normal for your braces to feel tight and to have some throbbing in your teeth after the procedure."

    {
      "title": "Take an over-the-counter painkiller or anti-inflammatory.",
      "content": "Take an over-the-counter painkiller or anti-inflammatory. Make sure you check with your doctor before doing so. Different medications you can take include acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil), and aspirin. Check the dosing guidelines for a schedule and amounts. Don't exceed the number of doses in a 24-hour period as labeled on the bottle. Don't take the medication more often than recommended. These can help take some of the aching and soreness associated with shifting teeth, but you may still experience some discomfort. Carry the painkiller with you so that you have it when needed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take the medicine one hour before entering the office.",
      "content": "Take the medicine one hour before entering the office. This way it will already be in effect before your appointment. Be sure to take the amount with at least one full 8 ounce glass of water. This should help to reduce any swelling and discomfort during your appointment. After your appointment, take a full dose of your chosen painkiller according to the time schedule on the bottle. Taking this on schedule for 24 hours after your appointment can help to reduce pain over the next day. Avoid using chewable tablets, since these can be difficult to chew if your teeth are already sore and they can get stuck in your braces. Painkillers in liquid form work best."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use an oral anesthetic to reduce discomfort.",
      "content": "Use an oral anesthetic to reduce discomfort. These come in gel form and are available at most pharmacies. [6] X Research source Gels like Oragel and Anbesol are examples of these products. The gel will numb any areas it contacts such as gums and teeth. Most are flavored, though they can have an unpleasant taste. Apply the gel to sore and tender areas of your mouth. Use a cotton swab to apply the gel and to spread it. Try not to get the gel on your tongue; you might not feel your tongue and then bite it by accident."

    {
      "title": "Modify your diet.",
      "content": "Modify your diet. You should avoid any foods that require lots of chewing. Eat a soft diet for the first 24 hours after your braces are tightened. Stick to foods such as Jello, pudding, mashed potatoes, applesauce, soups and smoothies. If you must eat something that has to be chewed, cut it into small pieces to reduce the amount of chewing you have to do. Use a small spoon or fork (preferably made out of plastic or wood) while eating to avoid hitting your teeth with utensils."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply cold to your face and teeth to reduce pain and swelling.",
      "content": "Apply cold to your face and teeth to reduce pain and swelling. You can use ice packs or drink cold water. Use a gel or soft ice pack. Apply this to your cheeks for 15 minutes. Drink plenty of cold water with a straw. The cold from the water will help to numb your teeth and reduce the swelling in your gums. Do not eat or drink warm substances immediately after drinking icy water; this can damage your braces and make your teeth hurt even more."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse your mouth frequently.",
      "content": "Rinse your mouth frequently. Use a recommended mouthwash or salt water. Mix a teaspoon of table salt into a glass of lukewarm water. Swish the salt water around your mouth for 60 seconds. This may sting any scrapes or sores you have from your braces at first, but will help to keep these clean and speed up healing. Do the same with any mouthwash recommended by your dentist."

    {
      "title": "Brush your teeth with a soft toothbrush.",
      "content": "Brush your teeth with a soft toothbrush. Using a regular toothbrush might cause more discomfort. Remember to brush your teeth and braces at least twice a day. Use a toothpaste for sensitive teeth, such as Sensodyne. Sensodyne can help to reduce sensitivity and pain in your teeth due to tightened braces."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use dental wax on any wires or brackets that are scraping your mouth.",
      "content": "Use dental wax on any wires or brackets that are scraping your mouth. This will protect you cheeks, lips and gums from scrapes and cuts. Ask your dentist or orthodontist for a supply of dental wax. You can also buy this at pharmacies. Apply a small amount of the wax to brackets and protruding wires in the morning after brushing your teeth. Remove any wax before brushing your teeth at night. Discard any used wax as it builds up bacteria. Try to sleep without dental wax on, but if you have a very troublesome wire it is ok to use this product at night. Keep your dental wax with you during the day in case you need to re-apply a small amount."

      "title": "Apply a fluoride gel three times a week.",
      "content": "Apply a fluoride gel three times a week. You should do this especially if your teeth are sensitive to cold things. In general, this gel can help with cavity prevention and tooth sensitivity. Sometimes you need a prescription for brush-on fluoride gel, so you should talk to your dentist about it before you use it. There are also fluoride gels that your dentist can apply to your teeth about twice a year. Talk to your dentist about this option if you're concern about the sensitivity of your teeth or the possibility of getting cavities. [7] X Research source"
