      "title": "Use brewed coffee and conditioner to darken your hair.",
      "content": "Use brewed coffee and conditioner to darken your hair. Place 2 cups (470 mL) of leave-in conditioner into a bowl. Stir in 2 tablespoons (10 g) of coffee grounds and 1 cup (240 mL) of room-temperature brewed coffee. Apply the mixture to your hair, wait 1 hour, then rinse it out with warm water. To help set the color, rinse your hair with apple cider vinegar afterward, then let your hair air dry. The stronger you brew your coffee, the darker the color will be. For best results, use white-colored conditioner. You can also substitute plain conditioner or a hair mask. This method may be able to dye lighter hair colors a dark shade of brown. This is not permanent and will only last 2 to 3 washes. You can reapply the dye more often to prolong the effect, however. Coffee can stain porcelain showers or tubs, so try washing your hair out in a stainless sink or shower."

      "title": "Use brewed tea to enhance your natural hair color.",
      "content": "Use brewed tea to enhance your natural hair color. Brew 3 to 5 tea bags in 2 cups (470 mL) of water. Allow the tea to cool completely before using it on your head. Pour the tea over your hair, or mix it with 2 cups (470 mL) of conditioner, and leave it in your hair for 1 hour before rinsing it out with warm water. Like coffee dye, this will only last about 2 to 3 washes. Use black tea if you want to darken your hair or cover up grays. Use rooibos or hibiscus if you want to enhance red tones. Try chamomile tea if you want to brighten up blonde hair or lighten light brown hair."

      "title": "Try brewed herbs to enhance your natural color or bring out highlights.",
      "content": "Try brewed herbs to enhance your natural color or bring out highlights. Simmer 1 to 2 tablespoons (4.5 to 9 g) of your desired dried herb in 2 cups (470 mL) of water for 30 minutes. Strain the solution into a spray bottle, then mist it onto your hair until it's damp. Just like coffee or tea dye, this is not permanent and will only last about 2 to 3 washes. Use calendula, hibiscus, marigold, or rosehips to bring out red tones. Let it air dry in the sun, then rinse it out using warm water. For dark hair, try crushed walnut shells, nettle, rosemary, or sage. Leave it in your hair for 1 hour before rinsing it out with warm water. You don't need the sun for this. To brighten blonde hair, try calendula, chamomile, marigold, saffron, or sunflower. Pour it over your hair, let it air dry, preferably in the sun, then rinse it out using warm water."

      "title": "Add hints of red with beet juice or carrot juice.",
      "content": "Add hints of red with beet juice or carrot juice. Simply apply 1 cup (240 mL) of beet or carrot juice to your hair, then cover your hair with a plastic shower cap. Wait at least 1 hour, then rinse your hair with warm water. Rinse it again with apple cider vinegar to set the color. Beet juice is good for strawberry blonde, deep red, or auburn tones. Carrot juice is better if you want something reddish-orange. If the color is not dark enough, repeat the process. Keep in mind that it is not permanent and won't last more than 2 or 3 washes. These juices can easily stain tubs and showers, so wash your hair out in a stainless sink to avoid the extra clean up."

      "title": "Start with bleached, blonde, or light-brown hair for best results.",
      "content": "Start with bleached , blonde, or light-brown hair for best results. Since the methods in this section are translucent, they’ll only add to whatever color is already in your hair. This means that the darker your hair is, the less you’ll see the new color. Be aware that blue and red may mix with blonde to create green or orange."

      "title": "Mix unsweetened Kool-Aid with conditioner if you want an all-over color.",
      "content": "Mix unsweetened Kool-Aid with conditioner if you want an all-over color. Dissolve 3 packets of unsweetened Kool-Aid drink mix in 1 cup (240 mL) of hot water. Stir the solution into enough conditioner to saturate your hair. Apply the mixture to your hair, then cover it with a plastic shower cap. Wait 1 hour, then rinse the color out. [1] X Research source You can use a different type of drink mix, but make sure that it is unsweetened; otherwise, you'll create a sticky mess. This method will typically last several shampoos. If it doesn't come out, try washing your hair with a clarifying shampoo. For best results, use white-colored conditioner. You don't need to shampoo your hair after this because the conditioner already removes some of the residue."

      "title": "Dissolve Kool-Aid in just water if you want to dip dye your hair.",
      "content": "Dissolve Kool-Aid in just water if you want to dip dye your hair. Stir 2 packets of Kool-Aid into 2 cups (470 mL) of hot water. Pull your hair into a ponytail or 2 pigtails, then dip your hair into the solution. Wait 10 to 15 minutes, then pull your hair out. Blot it dry with a paper towel, then let it air dry. Wash it with a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo afterwards. Washing your dyed hair afterwards is important because it will remove residue. If you don't do this, you might stain your clothes. [2] X Research source If you have long, thick hair, you might need to make more of your \"dye.\" Add 1 packet of Kool-Aid for every additional 1 cup (240 mL) of water. This is a temporary option and should come out in several washes. If it doesn't, try a clarifying shampoo."

      "content": "Mix some food coloring with conditioner as an alternative to Kool-Aid. Place enough white-colored conditioner into a bowl to saturate your hair, then stir in some food coloring until you get the shade you want. Apply the mixture to your hair as desired, wait about 40 minutes, then rinse it out with warm water. You don't need to use shampoo afterwards. [3] X Research source This will last only 2 to 3 shampoos. For a longer-lasting something color (about 2 weeks), use 20 volume developer instead. Read the instructions to find out how long you should leave it in your hair. Don't use vegetable-based food coloring, or the colors won't come out. Use standard food coloring."

      "title": "Apply food coloring directly onto your hair for something easy.",
      "content": "Apply food coloring directly onto your hair for something easy. Put on some plastic gloves, then use a tinting brush to apply liquid food coloring to strands of hair. Wait 5 to 10 minutes, then blow dry your hair for a few minutes to get it warm and set the color. Rinse your hair with cool water, then blow dry it completely. Coat your hairline with oil or petroleum jelly to protect it against stains. Wear gloves while rinsing your hair, as the food coloring will stain. This color will last about 2 to 3 washes; it will fade with each time that you shampoo it."

      "title": "Try hair mascara if you want to add streaks or touch up your roots.",
      "content": "Try hair mascara if you want to add streaks or touch up your roots. Hair mascara is just what is sounds like: mascara, but for your hair! Applying it is easy; you just pull out a thin section of hair, then comb the mascara wand through it using light strokes. [4] X Research source Hair mascara comes in both natural and non-natural colors. It is opaque, so it will appear even on dark-colored hair. If you can't find the right shade to touch up your roots with, go to the next, closest shade. A darker shade will look more natural than a lighter one. Hair mascara will last for 1 to 2 shampoos."

      "content": "Use hair chalk to get bright colors. Dampen the hair strand you want to dye, then rub your hair chalk across it—make sure that you get both the upper and undersides. Repeat this process as many times as you want to color your hair. Let your hair dry, then comb it out. Heat-set the chalk with a curling iron or flat iron, or set it with a holding spray. [5] X Research source If you can't get hair chalk, you can try using chalk pastel or eyeshadow. It typically comes in non-natural colors. Most hair dye is translucent, but hair chalk is opaque, making it a great choice for dark hair. This method is best for creating streaks, but you may be able to use it to mimic a full-color. Be aware that it may rub off on clothing. [6] X Research source Hair chalk will last for about 2 to 4 shampoos, but it may stain light-colored hair."

      "content": "Use colored hairspray as an alternative to chalk. Apply the hairspray to thin strands of dry hair. Let the hairspray dry, then brush your hair to break up any clumps. Be aware that there may still be some stiffness afterwards. [7] X Research source Colored hairspray comes in a variety of non-natural colors, but you can find it in natural colors as well. Because it's opaque, it's great for dark hair. This will last for about 2 to 4 shampoos, but it may permanently stain light-colored hair. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Try colored hair gel for wilder styles. Hair gel makes your hair stiff and is best used to create spikes and other extreme styles. Colored hair gel is no different, except that it is colored. Simply apply the gel to your hair like you would normal gel. [9] X Research source It typically comes in non-natural shades, but you may be able to find it in natural colors. It is opaque, making it a great option for darker hair colors. The gel should come out in 1 to 2 shampoos. Be aware that it may stain lighter hair colors."

      "content": "Use clip-in extensions if you don't want to use any product at all. Part your hair where you want the extension to go. Snap open the comb on the extension, and slide it into your hair, just below the part. Snap the comb shut, then let your hair down. Use a full set of extensions to create an ombre look, or individual extensions to create a streaked look. [10] X Research source You can get extensions in just about any color, both natural and non-natural. Full-sets typically come in natural colors, while individual clips come in non-natural colors. For the most realistic look, choose extensions made from human hair. If this is just for fun, however, synthetic extensions will do just fine. You can style natural, human hair extensions with curling irons, flat irons, bleach and dye. You can't style synthetic extensions."
