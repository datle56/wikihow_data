[2] X Expert Source Laura Bilotta Dating Coach & Matchmaker Expert Interview. 7 July 2020. Any chat or conversation is a two-way street; you need to be able to express your own thoughts and opinions while listening to what the girl says too. Talk about yourself in the conversation. For example, if you’re discussing music, you’ll need to share your own opinions and thoughts about your favorite songs. [3] X Research source It’s important that you don’t go overboard and dominate the conversation, or lecture the girl on one of your favorite topics. Try to keep the chat balanced; each of you should talk roughly the same amount."

Use the occasional compliment as a part of your chat with a girl. [5] X Research source You can do this to show your interest in keeping the conversation going, and your appreciation for the girl as a person.

Avoid these types of comments in your conversation."

[7] X Research source Don’t go overboard with questions; you need to show some restraint. Asking too many questions can be seen as prying, and you may motivate the girl to cut the conversation short. Asking too many questions can also be seen as a sign that you have nothing to talk about and are desperate for topics."

The girl you’re speaking to will not enjoy the conversation if her only answers to your questions are “yes” or “no,” as these answers can quickly become repetitive or boring.

If you’ve matched with a girl on a dating app or website (like Tinder or Plenty of Fish) and are interested in maintaining a conversation, keep things light and fun. At least for the early stage of a chat conversation, avoid bringing up politics, religion, or any philosophical beliefs you may hold.

Pick up on cues from the conversation(s) you’ve already had, and make it clear that you’d like to talk about a certain topic again. Or, if you don’t hear back from this girl within a week or so, you can use a topic as a conversation opener for the next chat. For example, if she mentioned that she has an upcoming exam, you could say, “Let me know if you survive that test!” Or, if she’s mentioned that she’s planning to watch a movie or TV show, try saying: “Tell me what you think of the show once you’ve watched it.”"
