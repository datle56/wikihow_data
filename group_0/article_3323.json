      "title": "Swipe left and right several times (optional).",
      "content": "Swipe left and right several times (optional). Start a new game, then swipe left and right rapidly. Continue until you have a couple rows of 2s, 4s, and 8s. This isn't necessary to win, but it usually puts you in a good position and gets you to your first larger tiles faster. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Build a higher tile in a corner.",
      "content": "Build a higher tile in a corner. Combine the early tiles into a 16 or 32, and put it in a corner. The goal of this method is to keep this tile in place for as long as possible, gradually building it higher and higher. [2] X Research source This strategy was used for the world speed record of 2048, which reached the final tile in 1 minute and 34 seconds. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Keep the row with the high tile filled.",
      "content": "Keep the row with the high tile filled. For instance, if your high-value corner is in the top right, fill the entire top row with tiles. Alternating the two directions toward the corner (\"up\" and \"right\" in this example) is a good way to achieve this. Once filled, you'll be able to move left and right as much as you like, without the high-value tile shifting from its corner. [4] X Research source Keep an eye on this row, and refill gaps that appear whenever possible, without shifting the corner tile."
    },
    {
      "title": "Focus on combining small tiles.",
      "content": "Focus on combining small tiles. For most of the game, it's much more important to make 8s, 16s, and 32s than it is to aim for a single larger number. Ideally, these mid-range tiles will gather near your chosen corner tile. This sets you up for chain reactions of several combinations, which will get you much further than focusing on building one single tile higher by itself. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Maneuver around small, trapped tiles.",
      "content": "Maneuver around small, trapped tiles. Often, things won't work out perfectly, and you'll end up with a 2 or 4 trapped between a 256 and a 64, or similarly inconvenient positions. This is a good time to pause and think carefully about each move, and aim to free that small tile. There are a couple different tactics for this: Choose a tile next to the trapped tile, and plan on how to combine it. If it's a large tile, you may need to plan multiple moves ahead to do this. Once it's set up with an equal tile next to it, swipe so the tile you've been planning to combine is the one that moves. Alternatively, try to create a gap in the row with the small, trapped tile, then shift left and right until it is positioned over a tile it can combine with. This will not typically work well on a crowded board."

    {
      "title": "Move your corner tile when forced to, then return it.",
      "content": "Move your corner tile when forced to, then return it. In almost every game, you'll come to a point where you're forced to move your corner tile out of position. Look ahead to see which of the available moves benefits you the most. Swipe that direction, then swipe immediately back to return the high-value tile to the corner. In some copycat versions of the game, you can make a move that does nothing, and a random tile will still appear. In this case, you theoretically never need to move your tile from the corner, but it still may be necessary if your screen is in danger of being filled."

    {
      "title": "Keep trying until you win.",
      "content": "Keep trying until you win. You'll still need some luck to beat the game, so don't expect to win first time. If you're forced to move your corner tile, and an unfortunate new tile appears in that corner, your chance of success are much lower. You might still win if you can clear off five or six empty tiles, or if your highest tiles are 64 or 128. [6] X Research source If it's later in the game than that, there's usually no point in trying to get out of it."

      "content": "Know the rules. You probably already know how 2048 works, but just in case, here are the basics. Note that this is how the official game works, but there are many parodies, imitations, and even predecessors , many of which have different mechanics. Swipe the screen up, down, left, or right to move all number tiles in that direction. Each tile moves in that direction until it hits the wall or another tile. (Use your arrow keys in the computer version.) Each time you make a move, a new 2 or 4 tile appears in an empty spot in a row or column that was moved last move."

      "title": "Try to get to 2048.",
      "content": "Try to get to 2048. When a move causes two tiles of the same number to hit each other, they merge into one tile with a value equal to the sum of the two tiles. For instance, two 2 tiles combine into a 4. The goal is to create a tile with a value of 2048. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Pause and look ahead.",
      "content": "Pause and look ahead. It's easy to get sucked into the game and make moves as quickly as possible. If you want a better shot at winning, fight this impulse and only make a move when you're ready. Look ahead and try to imagine how the board will look after you make the next move, or at least what will happen to a few important tiles."

    {
      "title": "Focus on a corner.",
      "content": "Focus on a corner. A common strategy among players is to build up a high number in one corner. It doesn't matter what corner you pick, but once you pick, stick with it. [8] X Research source This tactic works best when the corner is part of a row you keep permanently filled. This lets you move the tiles left to right without dislodging your high-value tile."

    {
      "title": "Try alternate tapping up and right.",
      "content": "Try alternate tapping up and right. One basic approach is to alternate tapping up and right until no squares are moving. Tap left when this happens, then go back to alternating up and right. This won't guarantee you a win - in fact, it usually won't get you there. However, it can get you a fairly high score, and it's a quick way to try to beat your previous record. [10] X Research source"
