Pull the cover out of the air conduit and lift it up so it comes off the lower part of the housing. [1] X Research source Consult a mechanic if you don't know how to lift the cover. If you have a turbocharged engine or a newer vehicle, you may notice something blocking (or attached to) the filter. This is the air filter restriction gauge.
