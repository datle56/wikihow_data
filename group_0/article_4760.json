      "title": "Purchase two 10 ft (3.0 m) lengths of 1.5–2 in (3.8–5.1 cm) PVC pipe.",
      "content": "Purchase two 10 ft (3.0 m) lengths of 1.5–2 in (3.8–5.1 cm) PVC pipe. Find the PVC pipe in the plumbing section of a home improvement center. A diameter of 1.5–2 in (3.8–5.1 cm) is ideal so that the poles can be easily hammered into the ground as well as support a bottle or can. [1] X Research source The 1.5 in (3.8 cm) diameter PVC pipe will be a little less sturdy than the 2 in (5.1 cm) pipe. A sturdier pipe makes the game a little harder since it will be harder to knock off the bottle."

    {
      "title": "Measure and mark each length of PVC pipe at 6 ft (1.8 m).",
      "content": "Measure and mark each length of PVC pipe at 6 ft (1.8 m). Use a measuring tape to measure 6 ft (1.8 m) from 1 end of the PVC pipe. Make a line with a permanent marker. [2] X Research source This will be your cut line for the bottom of the pole."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut each length of PVC pipe at a 45-degree angle away from the cut line.",
      "content": "Cut each length of PVC pipe at a 45-degree angle away from the cut line. Place the blade of a hacksaw or handheld saw against the cut line you marked and tilt it at an approximately 45-degree angle towards the shorter side of the line. Carefully saw through the PVC pipe all the way so you are left with a 6 ft (1.8 m) section that has a pointed tip and another 4 ft (1.2 m) section. [3] X Research source The angled tip makes it so you can hammer the poles into the ground."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap duct tape over the flat ends of the poles.",
      "content": "Wrap duct tape over the flat ends of the poles. Cover the end of each pole in a couple pieces of duct tape so that the hole is covered. Then, wrap a strip horizontally around the side of the end a few times to secure piece covering the hole. [4] X Research source The duct tape helps a can or bottle sit on top of the poles more easily. If you don’t have duct tape, you could also use electrical tape."

    {
      "title": "Lay the poles about 30–40 ft (9.1–12.2 m) apart.",
      "content": "Lay the poles about 30–40 ft (9.1–12.2 m) apart. Lay 1 pole on the ground at the end of a yard or field. Walk 30-40 steps, 1 foot in front of the other, to the other side of the field or lawn and lay the other pole down. You can increase or decrease the distance between poles depending on your preference and the players’ level of skill. Anything less than about 25 ft (7.6 m), however, may feel a little close."

      "title": "Hammer the poles into the ground with a rubber mallet.",
      "content": "Hammer the poles into the ground with a rubber mallet. Hold the pole as straight up-and-down as possible, with the pointed side facing towards the ground. Pound the flat end of the pole a few times with a rubber mallet until the pole is securely in the ground and it stands up straight on its own. [5] X Research source If you don’t have a rubber mallet, you can improvise with something else flat. For example, a wooden board, a rock, or even the lid of a plastic cooler could work in a pinch."

    {
      "title": "Set an empty bottle or can on top of each pole.",
      "content": "Set an empty bottle or can on top of each pole. Be careful not to bump into the pole after setting up the cans! To keep the game fair, you'll want to use either 2 cans or 2 bottles, but not 1 of each. [6] X Research source If you use cans, make sure you have a supply of extras ready to use as replacements. They will get crushed easily while you play the game."
