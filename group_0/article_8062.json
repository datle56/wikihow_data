      "content": "Gather your supplies. The electrolyte method for cleaning silver uses a basic chemical reaction with baking soda, salt, water, and aluminum foil to clean and polish sterling silver. This method isn’t suitable for silver pieces that have porous stones or gems, such as pearls, shells, or turquoise, or for antiques (such as candlesticks) or jewelry that are affixed with glue. [1] X Research source For this method, you will need: [2] X Research source 2 tablespoons (30 g) each of salt and baking soda 2 tablespoons (30 ml) liquid dish soap (optional) 2 cups (480 ml) boiling water A baking dish (or bowl) large enough to fit the pieces you wish to clean Aluminum foil to line the baking dish The silver pieces you want to clean."

      "title": "Prepare the baking dish.",
      "content": "Prepare the baking dish. Line the dish with the aluminum foil. Make sure the shiny side of the foil is facing up. [3] X Research source Then place your sterling silverware into the baking dish."

      "title": "Add the cleaning agents.",
      "content": "Add the cleaning agents. Pour the salt, baking soda, and dish soap over top of the silver pieces, and then pour the boiling water on top. Stir the solution to help dissolve the salt and baking soda. Make sure all the silver pieces are touching the foil, as the tarnish from the silver will transfer to the foil."

    {
      "title": "Wait for the reaction to occur.",
      "content": "Wait for the reaction to occur. Let the silverware sit in the solution for five to 10 minutes. Don’t be alarmed if it smells like rotten eggs: this is just the sulfur on the silver. To help the process along, use your fingers to gently rub and move the silver around in the solution. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Rinse and buff the silverware.",
      "content": "Rinse and buff the silverware. Remove the silver from the solution and rinse it under warm water. Gently buff the pieces with a soft cloth to dry and polish the silver. Because silver is so soft, it can scratch easily. Be sure to use a soft and non-abrasive cloth to polish, such as microfiber or lint-free flannel. Always polish and buff silver in the direction of the metal’s grain, and never in a circular motion."

    {
      "title": "Use soap and water.",
      "content": "Use soap and water. For jewelry decorated with porous gems, watches, antiques that have pieces held with glue, or other delicate silver pieces that can’t be immersed in water or cleaned with the electrolysis method, there are still several options for cleaning. Mix one tablespoon (15 ml) dishwashing soap (something that’s phosphate-free and ammonia-free) with one cup (240 ml) warm water and stir well. If you want, use a hand blender to mix up some suds. Dip a soft cloth into the soapy water and wring out the excess. Use the damp cloth to clean the silver. Rinse out the cloth with plain water, and wipe off any leftover soap residue. Use a fresh cloth to buff and dry the silver."

      "title": "Make a baking soda paste.",
      "content": "Make a baking soda paste. Take a tablespoon (15 g) of baking soda and mix it with just enough water to make a paste. With a soft-bristled toothbrush or cloth, clean the silver with the paste, making sure to get into the nooks and crannies with the bristles. When the silver is clean, rinse it under warm water or remove the excess paste with a damp cloth. Buff it dry with a clean cloth.

      "title": "Use lemon juice and olive oil.",
      "content": "Use lemon juice and olive oil. In a small bowl, whisk together 1 teaspoon (6 ml) lemon juice and 1.5 cups (327 ml) olive oil. Dip a cloth into the mixture, wring out the excess, and use this to polish your silver. For small pieces that can be immersed, soak them in the oil and lemon solution and place the bowl into a small saucepan. Fill the saucepan with enough water to bring the bowl off the bottom and turn the heat to medium. Bring up the water temperature and keep it hot, but not boiling, for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and take the silver out of the oil and lemon juice solution. Gently scrub the silver with a soft toothbrush. For either the hot bath or the polishing method, rinse the silver with hot water to remove excess solution, and dry it with a soft cloth. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Give glass cleaner a try. Glass cleaners like Windex can also be used to clean silver. Spray some glass cleaner directly onto a soft cloth or soft-bristled toothbrush. [6] X Research source Use the cloth to clean the silver, and then either rinse the piece under warm water or wipe off the excess cleaner with a damp cloth. Dry and buff the silver with a soft cloth."

      "content": "Take your jewelry off. Since there are so many things that can tarnish silver, it’s a good idea to remove your jewelry when you go swimming in chlorinated water or do household chores (to keep the silver away from the chemicals). Sunlight can also have an effect, so take your jewelry off any time you plan on spending time in the sun."

      "content": "Store your silver somewhere cool, dark, and dry. Moisture can cause silver to tarnish, so store your silver somewhere that isn’t too hot or too damp. You can also keep camphor, [7] X Research source silica gel packs, chalk, or activated charcoal to the storage area to help remove some of the moisture. [8] X Research source Store silver away from direct and indirect sunlight to prevent the sun from causing it to tarnish."

      "content": "Wrap it up. To store silver, seal individual pieces in sealable plastic bags. Push out as much of the air as you can before closing the seal. This will prevent the other metals in the sterling silver from oxidizing. [9] X Research source"
