      "content": "Know what to purchase. Flaxseed is a very small seed that is flat and oval shaped. The seeds are much smaller than sunflower seeds. It is found in more than one form and each has different properties. Flaxseed comes in red to golden varieties. The color of the seed doesn’t mean the nutritional content is different, but the seeds may have a slightly different flavor. You can try the different varieties and determine which one has the most pleasing flavor. Some natural food stores may let you sample them in store so you do not have to purchase several types."

[2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The drawback to purchasing ground flaxseed is the short shelf life. It doesn’t last for more than a few weeks once it has been opened and should be stored in a cool, dark place for best quality. Unless stored in special mylar packaging, ground flaxseed loses much of its nutritional potency, or active compounds, within 24 hours. If you wish to store it long-term, make sure you are keeping the flaxseed in a resealable mylar bag."

Some popular baked uses of flaxseed are in breads or muffins. It has a good heat stability so all the nutrients are available after the baking process and is a good way to get extra fiber in a baked item without affecting texture and taste dramatically. Because of its high oil content, flaxseed can replace oil in baking recipes. Use one cup of milled flaxseed to replace 1/3 cup of oil (3:1 substitution ratio)."
