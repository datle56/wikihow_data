According to dating coach Candice Mostisser, when you say something that you don’t really mean, it can come off as “disingenuous.” [1] X Expert Source Candice Mostisser Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 24 January 2020. The key to giving a genuine compliment is to reflect on the other person’s behavior, then think about why you appreciate them. Dig deep to find a specific trait or accomplishment that you admire, and look them in the eye when you deliver it. The more specific you are, the better! [2] X Research source For instance, saying “You’re a hard worker” doesn’t sound as sincere as “I respect how seriously you take work. We couldn’t have completed the project without your technical skills and attention to detail.”"

      "title": "Phrase compliments positively and be respectful.",
      "content": "Phrase compliments positively and be respectful. Make sure what you're saying to someone isn't critical or offensive, even if you mean it to be a compliment. If your compliment comes with a qualifier (“You look nice for a…”) or focuses on the other person’s age, race, sex, class, or physical appearance, you’re venturing into dangerous territory—and you may want to reconsider how it sounds or keep it to yourself. [3] X Research source For instance, telling a woman that she looks really pretty when she wears makeup implies that she isn’t pretty without it. Other problematic “compliments” include: “You look good for a woman over 50,” “You’re smart for someone who didn’t graduate high school,” “You’re super athletic for a girl,” or “You’re well-spoken for someone who wasn’t born here.” Phrase your statements in a positive and straightforward manner to avoid giving a backhanded compliment. For example, instead of saying “I appreciate that you finally cleaned your room,” you could say, “I appreciate that you remembered to clean your room.”"

      "content": "Consider the time and place before complimenting someone. To avoid making the other person feel uncomfortable or embarrassed, think of the context of the situation before giving a compliment. Commenting on someone’s appearance might be nice in casual settings, but it can come off as inappropriate in the workplace. [4] X Research source For example, complimenting a female coworker on her appearance after she's just given a presentation is demeaning and belittles the hard work she just put in. If you’re on a date, dating coach Candice Mostisser recommends “using compliments minimally” to reassure the other person that you’re glad to be there.

      "content": "Use adjectives to transform a simple compliment into a genuine one. If you want to give a more “surface-level” compliment, tie your words to a descriptive or emotional statement to make it more meaningful. For example, you could say, “Your eyes really sparkle when you wear green,” instead of just “I love your green sweater.” This is a great strategy if you’re trying to compliment someone’s style or appearance."

      "title": "Use “I” statements to sound more genuine.",
      "content": "Use “I” statements to sound more genuine. Begin your compliment with phrases like “I appreciate,” “I admire,” or “I value.” This puts yourself into the compliment and makes the other person feel like it’s really coming from your heart. [6] X Research source For example, you might say “I really appreciated how you spoke to the shareholders and carried yourself,” instead of “You did a great job presenting at the meeting.”"

      "title": "Don't make it about you.",
      "content": "Don't make it about you. Avoid turning a compliment towards someone into a conversation about yourself. This makes you seem self-centered or like you’re fishing for compliments . For example, don't say something like \"You did such a good job with that thing last week. I couldn't have done that. I'm rubbish at it.\""

      "content": "Compliment things that they control. When you're complimenting someone, it's best to focus on things that are under their control, such as their personality, style, or accomplishments. This will help them feel secure in themselves, rather than create worry that they might lose something that other people find valuable. For example, you could say, \"I love how you interact with little kids. You're so patient!\" or \"You did a great job on that poster! I just can't stop looking at it!\""

      "title": "Look for things that they value.",
      "content": "Look for things that they value. Look back on your interactions with them and think of the things that they talked about. To craft an authentic message, link your compliment to things that the other person cherishes, values, and holds dear to their heart. For example, if you notice your girlfriend looking sadly at another girl's clothes and saying that she wished she could dress like that, tell her how much you love her style."

      "title": "Comment on things that they struggle with in a positive way.",
      "content": "Comment on things that they struggle with in a positive way. If the other person frequently complains about a certain attribute that they have, compliment their hard work and determination. This is an incredibly meaningful gesture because it shows that you’re actively listening to them, and it may help boost their confidence and self-esteem. If your friend turns in a really difficult assignment, praise them for their effort and motivation. If your friend is trying to lose weight, you could compliment them if they eat super healthy or go to the gym often."

Avoid overly familiar compliments, like ones regarding their physical appearance. “Wow! That’s a sick jacket. Where did you get it?” “You have such an awesome collection of clothes.” “I respect how you carried yourself in that conversation.” “Thank you for helping me carry my things to the door. I wish more people were thoughtful like you.” “Thank you for being so kind to that man. It's hard to be patient in that situation, and I'm really impressed with how you handled it.”"
