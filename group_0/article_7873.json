      "content": "Empty out the bag and remove any debris with a lint roller. Remove all items from inside and outside of the tote bag. Then, use a lint roller or a dry soft-bristled brush to dust off any lint , crumbs, or other debris from the inside and outside of the bag. Alternatively, use a damp cloth or a handheld vacuum to remove any dirt or debris. Check the care label before cleaning. If the label says \"dry clean only,” consider taking it to a professional."

      "content": "Fill a clean sink with warm water and 1 tsp (5 mL) of laundry detergent. For standard canvas bags, fill a clean bucket or sink with warm water, then add a teaspoon (5 mL) of liquid or powder laundry detergent to the water. Use your hand to swish the water around so that the detergent dissolves evenly. For leather bags: Wipe the inside and outside down with a soft cloth and leather bag cleaner or a few drops of dishwashing soap and distilled water. For jacquard bags: Take them to a dry cleaner to have them deep-cleaned. [1] X Research source Avoid using hand or body soap or harsh cleaning products like bleach or ammonia—they may damage or discolor your tote bag."

      "content": "Soak the bag for about 15 minutes, then gently scrub the outside. Place the Marc Jacobs tote bag in the water so it’s completely submerged. Allow the bag to soak for 15 minutes. Then, remove the bag and gently scrub any spots or stains on the canvas with a soft-bristled brush.

      "title": "Rinse the bag with cold water and allow it to air dry.",
      "content": "Rinse the bag with cold water and allow it to air dry. Rinse your bag with cold water until the soap suds are completely removed. Then, hang it up and allow it to air-dry away from direct sunlight. For canvas bags: Use a bag shaper to keep its structure. Otherwise, the canvas may shrink while drying. For bags with leather features: Dry them with a soft cloth and gently rub them with leather conditioner while they’re still damp to keep the leather soft."

      "title": "Soak a cloth or soft-bristled brush in water and laundry detergent.",
      "content": "Soak a cloth or soft-bristled brush in water and laundry detergent. Mix 1 cup (237 mL) of water with a couple of drops of liquid detergent or a pinch of powder detergent and soak the brush or cloth in the solution. For leather bags or bags with leather features: Skip the soapy brush and instead apply leather conditioner to the spot with a soft cloth. Buff the leather until it shines. For jacquard bags: Use a damp or dry soft cloth to gently blot out stains instead of soaking a cloth or brush. For tougher stains, consider taking your bag to a dry cleaner."

      "content": "Gently scrub the stain. Use the cloth or soft-bristled brush to gently scrub any stains until they come out. Then, with a new damp cloth, wipe down the bag to remove leftover suds. [3] X Research source You can also use a shoe cleaner and conditioner or upholstery cleaner instead of detergent. Use a carpet cleaner to get really tough stains out of the canvas, but be sure to test the cleaner on a corner of the bag first."

      "title": "Deep clean your bag every 6 months.",
      "content": "Deep clean your bag every 6 months. To keep your tote bag looking great, aim to deep clean it about every 6 months and spot-clean as needed. If you use your bag every day, consider cleaning it a little more often (about every 3 months). To keep your bag clean, avoid setting it on the ground, where it might be more likely to get stained. Unless the care label says to, always hand wash your bag and avoid putting it in the washing machine to prevent it from becoming damaged."

      "title": "Apply a water-resistant spray to protect your bag from staining.",
      "content": "Apply a water-resistant spray to protect your bag from staining. To protect your bag from hard-to-clean stains and water damage in the future, apply a water-resistant spray to the inside and outside of the bag. Reapply the spray after each wash. Some recommend using Scotchguard Fabric Protector , a specific brand of stain and water-repellent spray."
