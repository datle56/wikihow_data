      "content": "Study the rhyming styles of legendary hip hop artists. Rap has evolved over the decades in not only the type of content that rappers talk about in their lyrics, but the way lyrics are strung together and delivered. [2] X Research source Study the delivery of greats like Tupac Shakur, Notorious BIG, Nas, Grandmaster Flash, Rakim, Jay-Z, Eminem and the Wu-Tang Clan to get an understanding of different rhyming styles. You can also get inspired by what's currently popular with artists like Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, and Nicki Minaj. Delivery is almost as important as the lyrics themselves. Take note on how some rappers delivery is faster, slower, smoother, or harsher than others. [3] X Research source Study the wordplay and context of songs. Look for double meanings and puns so you can incorporate these things into your lyrics. Remain original, but draw from the skills of artists that came before you. You don't have to sound the same, but you must understand why and how they made music."

      "content": "Master the various rhyming schemes that exist. Different rhyming schemes are available to rappers, from AABB to AXXA. [4] X Research source These rhyming styles dictate which words rhyme in your lyrics. Study them and develop your rhyming versatility. Most verses in rap songs are \"16 bars\" or 4 sets of 4 lines of lyrics in a song. Start with simple rhyming schemes like ABAB and build up to include more complex rhymes. An example of an ABAB rhyme is \"That cat, over there, in the hat, on the bear.\" The last word in the first and third lines rhyme as well as the last word in the second and fourth line. Some rhymes are known as half-rhymes if they have similar sounding ending consonant sounds but do not fully rhyme. An example would be \"bald\" and \"held.\""

      "content": "Build up your rhyming ability but keep it catchy. Some artists get so complex and into their art that they forget that it must also appeal to the general audience. As you build up your lyrical skills, make sure to keep the listener in mind and don't get too fancy or else you may lose fans. [5] X Research source Taking risks are a part of being a popular artist, but sometimes you can lose fans if they don't like the direction you're going in. Just because a song is catchy does not mean that it has to lack substance."

      "content": "Have the ability to deliver a good hook. The hook is the part of the song that is often repeated and is the portion of the track that's usually most remembered by fans. For other genres of music, this is typically referred to as the chorus. Having a good hook in a song is incredibly important if you want it to be popular. The hook should be catchy, memorable, and should embody the song. [6] X Research source A popular hook from the past is Chamillionaire's \"Ridin Dirty.\" \"They see me rollin', they hatin', Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty. Tryna catch me ridin' dirty.\" [7] X Research source If you aren't a singer or aren't good with hooks, consider collaborating with an R&B singer who would be better equipped. Think of something that helps support the verses in your songs. Keep the hook simple and repetitive with 3 or 4 notes."

      "content": "Write original songs that illicit an emotional response. While copying popular or iconic music may get you a small amount of success, it will never make you as popular as the artist that you're trying to be. It's important to draw from personal circumstances, events, and emotions from your life and the lives of people around you. If you've been through tough times it is likely people have shared similar experiences. Being open and genuine will affect people more than copying a lifestyle you've never lived. Try to mix up your catalog of music. Don't always rap about the same thing and make sure your songs don't all share the same mood. Showing a range of emotion will allow you to connect to more fans."

Try to get producers that have created successful songs in the past, and meet with them so that they can cater their beats to your unique style and voice. Talk to other rappers to find local producers that would be willing to collaborate. Send local recording studios a demo of your music if you're still unable to find a producer in your personal network.

[10] X Research source Call a local studio and ask for rates and schedule a time to record. Make sure to have a game plan before going into the studio. Studios usually charge an hourly fee, so wasting time is not smart. [11] X Research source Some musicians record in their bedroom, but it requires skill and knowledge on how to mix sound.
