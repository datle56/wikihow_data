      "content": "Consider a mesh Wi-Fi system. Adding a second wireless router to your home network is less common now that mesh Wi-Fi (also known as \"whole home Wi-Fi\") are more common. A mesh Wi-Fi system consists of one main wireless router and a serious of wireless access points placed around the home or office. [1] X Research source When you buy a mesh Wi-Fi system, all of your equipment is designed to work together. If you simply buy a second wireless router to add to your network, there's no guarantee your new router will work wirelessly with your existing router. Mesh systems generally run between $130 and $300 USD, but costs will vary depending on the number of units you'll need to cover your space. You can find mesh systems at any major retailer. Most mesh networks can be set up in minutes with a mobile app. This makes them a lot easier to configure and manage than adding a second router. You could also try a wireless extender, which is a great way to boost Wi-Fi signal in larger spaces ."

      "content": "Make sure the second router supports bridging. If you want to connect two routers wirelessly without a mesh network, the second router on your network must be able to \"bridge\" with the existing router. If your router's documentation says it supports WDS, has something called \"bridge mode,\" or works as a \"repeater,\" you can probably use it as a second Wi-Fi access point on your network. If router you want to add to your network doesn't support WDS, you can't use it to expand your network wirelessly."

      "content": "Plug in your primary router and connect it to the internet. Before you can add a second router to your network, you'll want to make sure your main router is online. The main router is usually given to you by your internet provider. Some internet providers will give you a single modem/router combination, while others give you two separate devices. If you have a modem that is separate from your wireless router, run an ethernet cable from the port on your modem to the WAN port on your router. Sometimes the WAN port is labeled \"Internet.\" If your modem and router are a single unit, connect it to the wall port using an ethernet or coaxial cable as instructed by your internet provider."

But if not, go ahead and plug one end of the ethernet cable into one of the LAN ports on the router, and the other end into your computer's ethernet port . If your computer doesn't have an ethernet port (it looks like a larger phone jack), you will need an adapter. Ethernet-to-USB and Ethernet-to-Thunderbolt are two common adapter types."

If you're connected wirelessly, it'll be several curved lines. Otherwise, it'll usually look like a globe or a computer. Click Network & Internet settings . Click View hardware and connection properties . The IP address is next to \"Default Gateway.\" Mac: Open your System Preferences and click the Network icon. Click your current internet connection.

All routers come with preset passwords and usernames (sometimes no username is required) that are simple, such as \"admin\" and \"password.\" See https://routerslogin.com/all/default-router-list for a list of common router admin logins and passwords. If you changed your router's admin password and don't remember what it is, you can always reset the router to its original settings by pressing its \"reset\" button."

When it's time to add your new router to the network, you'll need some information from the main router to make them work together: In the DHCP section of your router settings, look for the range of addresses used by the server. You may see something like \"Starting IP address,\" \"DHCP range,\" or \"IP Address Range.\" You'll want to write down the first and last addresses in this range (e.g., 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.254). Go to the Wireless or Wi-Fi settings and write down the SSID (the name of the wireless network) and password. Write down the security mode (usually WPA2-PSK AES) and the band frequency (e.g., 2.4GHz or 5GHz). Write down the IP address (this is the same address you navigated to to open the admin site) and subnet mask (e.g., 255.255.255.0). Depending on your secondary, you may need to write down the router's MAC address. If both of your routers are TP-Link or Linksys routers, you can skip this step."

If you have a Netgear router, navigate to Advanced > Advanced Setup > Router/AP/Bridge/Repeating Mode , choose Enable Wireless Repeating Function , and then select Wireless Repeater .

The IP address must be different than the main router's IP address but on the same subnet. So, if the main router's IP address is 192.168.0.1 and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, you might want to make this router's IP address 192.168.0.2.
