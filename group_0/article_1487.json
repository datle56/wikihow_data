      "content": "Exfoliate your lips (optional). If you don't have an exfoliating balm or scrub (available at most drug stores and shops that sell makeup), you can exfoliate your lips by applying a moisturizing lip balm and then gently scrubbing them with a clean toothbrush. Some experts recommend against exfoliating your lips, as this can cause small tears in the skin of your lips, making them dry and chapped in the long term. Having healthy, well-moisturized lips is better than exfoliating your lips, but if your lips are flaky, exfoliating is a quick way to make them smooth."

      "content": "Moisturize your lips. Before applying anything else to your lips, apply a light moisturizing balm. Make sure the balm isn't too waxy — you want it to sink into your lips, not sit on top of them. If your lips are dry, chapped, or cracked, it will be difficult to apply a smooth line to them, particularly if you intend to fill them in completely with liner."

    {
      "title": "Wait for the balm to dry.",
      "content": "Wait for the balm to dry. Some experts recommend waiting 20 minutes to apply anything else to your lips after putting on a moisturizer. If you don't have that kind of time, wait at least a couple of minutes, and then dab your lips with tissue to remove any excess moisturizer. You want your lips to dry but well moisturized before you apply anything else to them. If you find your balm takes too long to dry, try applying it right before bed. This will help ensure that you have hydrated lips for when you do your makeup the next day."

      "title": "Prime your lips (optional).",
      "content": "Prime your lips (optional). A primer isn't 100% necessary, but some makeup artists do recommend it, as it can help smooth your lips and hold both the liner and lipstick on your lips longer. If you intend to wear lipstick, you can apply a lip liner to your entire lips, and this will also help hold the lipstick in place. Concealer or foundation can be used in place of primer. These are good options if you're planning to change the shape of your lips. You can also apply concealer around your lips to highlight them.

If you're planning to wear red lipstick, go for a red liner; if you're planning to keep your lips looking natural, go for a nude or soft pink liner. You can also look for a lip liner that matches your natural lip color. This will work with any shade, though it may mute some bolder colors a little bit."

      "title": "Sharpen your lip liner.",
      "content": "Sharpen your lip liner. Always sharpen your liner before using it. A sharp liner will give you a good, precise line. When your liner is dull, it's closer to the wood of the pencil, and if any pieces are sticking up from the wood they might scratch your lips. Sharpening your liner before each use helps to remove bacteria before you use it. A trick to make sharpening easier is to place your lip pencil in the freezer 20 minutes before sharpening it. This is supposed to help prevent the tip from breaking off, and should produce a cleaner, sharper point."

      "content": "Trace your natural lip line. Many artists recommend sticking to your natural lip line, as overdrawn lips can look unnatural. A common thing to do is to start at the center-top and center-bottom of your lips and then work outward. Another common lining method is to start at the center, drawing an “x” at your cupid's bow, and then outline the corners and bottom of your mouth before lining the rest of your lips. [2] X Research source This helps get achieve an even shape. You can even do this, then fill in your liner on your lips if you want to skip lipstick. As you trace your natural lip line, be extra careful to ensure that you've applied liner to any creases or cracks in your lips; this will help prevent your lipstick from bleeding. To get a fuller look without over lining, trace from the outside corner to the center of your lips instead of from the center out. This helps create a fuller, rounder shape."

      "content": "Move in light, short strokes. Moving in light, short strokes will give you a more precise line than trying to trace over your line in one smooth movement. If the liner tugs at your lips at all, it's too hard. Try warming the tip up by rolling it between your thumb and index finger, or drawing on the back of your hand; you can also see if sharpening it helps."

If you're not wearing lipstick and simply want to use liner to define your lips, use a nude liner and fill in your lips with the pencil after you've outlined them. You could then finish the look off with a clear gloss. Even if you're not wearing lipstick, a little bit of lip liner lightly applied to your natural lip line can do wonders for helping to define your lips. If you're going for a natural lip, your lips should now be done!"

      "content": "Fill in your lips with liner. Using swift, short strokes, fill in your entire lips with liner. This will give you a good base that will help your lipstick stay put longer. It will also help keep the lip color even, meaning the lipstick won't change color where it overlaps with the liner. Some people fill their lips in with liner and just wear the liner itself. If you do this, consider using a gloss or similarly colored lip balm over top of the liner to help it look smooth and even."

This is particularly helpful if you're wearing a dramatic color that has left small stains around the edges of your lips; it also helps prevent your lip color from bleeding out to the skin around your lips. Use a small brush or a foundation brush to paint a small amount of concealer or foundation around your lips, as needed. You can also set the foundation/concealer with a small amount of powder."

Blot the finished look, too, to keep lipstick from transferring to your teeth. To blot your lips, open them, stick some tissue or blotting paper between them, and then close them gently in an “mmm” position. If you're going to use tissue paper, make sure it's a thick, good-quality tissue that won't leave any bits of fluff on your lips."

In 2014 Kylie Jenner sported newly plumped lips with a '90s-inspired lining style of having a darker liner and a lighter lipstick. Experts say it's important to use a darker liner and then lipstick that's only slightly lighter (e.g., a burgundy liner and a cranberry lipstick) for this look."
