      "content": "Classics are balanced between the extremes of yin and yang. The Classic body type falls in the exact middle of Kibbe’s yin/yang spectrum, perfectly balanced between the most extreme characteristics of yin and yang. This means they have a symmetrical physicality and a cool, reserved essence. Their physique is balanced with the evenly proportioned bust, waist, and hips that are associated with yin and the lithe, sinewy musculature and slightly longer arms associations with yang. [1] X Research source When a Classic gains weight, it tends to be evenly distributed on their body, so they keep their same basic shape. Kibbe has come to believe that no one falls perfectly into the pure Gamine, Classic, and Natural body types, so he has removed them from his system. However, many people still find these categories useful for determining their personal style."

Their figure is slightly straight and angular, with a tendency to be a little sharp around the edges. They are often described as lithe and perfectly balanced. If you have most of the following characteristics, your body type is most likely a Kibbe Classic: [2] X Research source Height – 5’5” (164 cm) - 5’7” (174 cm) Vertical lines of medium length Rectangular body with fat evenly distributed Slightly sloping shoulders that are proportionate to the hips Arms and legs are in proportion to or slightly longer than the torso Medium-sized, proportionate hands and feet Medium proportionate bust Delicately defined waist Hips in proportion to the shoulders and waist Forearms that are well-proportioned and medium length"

[3] X Research source They may have a slight sharpness to their jawline, nose, and cheekbones, but the overall effect is balanced. None of their features are overly dramatic, which creates a very balanced face. Here is a list of facial features associated with the Kibbe Classic: Proportionate jaw Medium-sized nose Symmetrical cheekbones of medium size Symmetrical eyes with average spacing and a medium size Balanced, proportionate lips of medium size Medium-sized cheeks with slight definition"

      "content": "Wear symmetrical clothing with smooth lines. Hanna says that dressing properly for your body type is a great way to express your individuality through fashion. With a Classic body type, choose symmetrical shapes with very slight curves. Keep your silhouette smooth and balanced with soft lines and even edges. Use soft tailoring and minimal details with flowing fabrics that are beautiful and lush for the most flattering look. [5] X Research source Lean into your balanced energy with fabrics that aren’t too light or heavy and have a matte finish or slight sheen. Add an elegant, understated touch with clean and simple detailing that doesn’t call attention to itself. A good guideline is to avoid chasing trends and choose pieces that are described as timeless."

      "title": "Choose tailored tops with simple detailing.",
      "content": "Choose tailored tops with simple detailing. Hanna says, “Every woman needs a classic, crisp white shirt. Probably a button-down .” This is a perfect description of your ideal shirt. Your best choices are shirts and blouses that have clean, tailored necklines and crisp finished cuffs. Small v-necks, turtle necks, jewel collars, and narrow cowls also look fantastic on you. Wear styles that have a smooth visible line that uses tailored pleats or crisp gathers. [6] X Research source Always iron your tops to create a smooth outline. Avoid overly flouncy or sharp silhouettes that may throw your look off-balance. Stay away from ornate details, fussy trims, and cutesy details that may overwhelm your symmetrical frame."

      "title": "Try slim pants with flat fronts or simple pleats.",
      "content": "Try slim pants with flat fronts or simple pleats. Always go with clean, tailored pant styles with very minimal detailing. Slim, narrow shapes look great on you and emphasize your natural symmetry. Styles with plain fronts or subtle trouser pleating are your best bet for an elegant, polished look. Choose a mid-rise whether you wear jeans or trousers, as a high or low rise can throw off your proportions. [7] X Research source Avoid pants and trousers that have extremely masculine tailoring, like deep pleats and cuffs. Ripped or distressed jeans can look untidy and slouchy on you. Oversized, unstructured, or baggy styles will hide your lithe frame, while overly clingy and tapered shapes may seem ill-fitting and uncomfortable."

      "title": "Opt for soft knee-length skirts that are straight or slightly fitted.",
      "content": "Opt for soft knee-length skirts that are straight or slightly fitted. Smooth, classic straight skirts with clean lines are perfect for you. Keep the length no longer than 1 inch (2.5 cm) below your knee if the skirt has a straight cut. If it’s slightly flowy or flared, wear it at mid-calf length. [8] X Research source Avoid long, overly narrow pencil skirts or flouncy styles, which can look too severe or too bouncy for your balanced frame. Keep skirts plain and simple without too many pockets, gathers, or frills."

      "title": "Go for dresses with soft tailoring that emphasizes your waist.",
      "content": "Go for dresses with soft tailoring that emphasizes your waist. When in doubt, go with an elegant, slim dress that has soft tailoring . Dresses with a row of buttons down the front look amazing on you because they draw attention to your natural symmetry. [9] X Research source Look for pieces that have moderate lengths, tasteful patterns, and a comfortable, body-skimming fit that subtly emphasizes your waist. Think of it as choosing classic pieces that fit “just right.” Avoid any dress that’s too long, too short, too tight, or has over-the-top patterns. Stay away from sharply tailored styles, ornate detailing, or oversized fits."

      "content": "Wear sweaters with medium knits and soft textures. Light, ribbed styles look beautiful and elegant on you as long as they aren’t too tight and constricting. Choose sleek, well-fitted sweaters with soft textures to look elegant and sophisticated. [10] X Research source Avoid chunky knits and oversized sweaters that may overwhelm your frame and throw off your symmetry. Stay away from nubby, roughly textured styles and clingy knits."

      "title": "Choose tailored jackets with smooth outlines.",
      "content": "Choose tailored jackets with smooth outlines. Narrow styles with a standard length that hits just below the hip accentuate your natural symmetry. If you wear an unstructured jacket, make sure it’s in a lightweight fabric and a narrow silhouette. Wear a slightly longer jacket when you’re pairing it with a longer skirt. Make sure the color, texture, or print of your jacket blends well with your pants or skirt to give a polished appearance. [11] X Research source Avoid jackets that are overly angular or ones that have peplums and nipped-in waists. Skip oversized, boxy jackets that swallow your frame, and cropped jackets that may make you look bottom-heavy and off-balance."

      "title": "Try slender shoe styles with tapered toes and narrow heels.",
      "content": "Try slender shoe styles with tapered toes and narrow heels. Classic styles like stiff ballet flats or kitten heels with pointy toes always look elegant on you. Choose platforms that have a narrower heel and aren’t too chunky. [12] X Research source Opt for slingbacks and slender pumps in an elegant leather for the perfect Classic look. Hanna adds that even lower heels give a sexier silhouette, so they’re better for evening than a ballet flat. Avoid heavy shoes and chunky heels that are too much for your balanced energies. Stay away from strappy styles and shoes that have lots of details or loud prints."

      "title": "Always opt for smooth, luscious fabrics in moderate weights.",
      "content": "Always opt for smooth, luscious fabrics in moderate weights. When it comes to fabrics, quality is more important than pattern or even color. Elegant, high-quality natural fibers like silk, linen, and very good cotton always look great on you. Just make sure to iron them to keep the smooth texture and avoid looking rumpled. Focus on knits that are luxurious to the touch, like cashmere and heavy jersey with soft ribbing. [13] X Research source Avoid rough textures, stiff metallics, and heavy, ornate fabrics like brocades, taffetas, and velvets. Stay away from sheer and clingy fabrics, or anything that’s overly shiny (unless it’s a lighter weight). [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Go for understated symmetrical prints that are evenly spaced. Classic pin dots, pinstripes, checks, and herringbone patterns look outstanding on you. Blended plaids and symmetrical paisleys are also good choices as long as they don’t have bold colors. [15] X Research source Avoid oversized prints, sharp and angular geometrics, and contemporary, avant-garde prints, which can clash with your sophisticated energy. Splashy watercolors, abstract florals, and ornate prints or animated prints can look too cutesy and awkward on your elegant frame."

This is another area where it’s worth investing in higher-quality pieces. If you wear a hat, choose something small and tailored with even, symmetrical brims. Avoid chunky, heavy, or oversized accessories and ornate styles. Sharply angled or unstructured accessories may throw off the balance of your energies. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Sleek hairstyles with blunt edges match the Classic’s vibe. As a Classic, the best hair for you is going to be well-groomed and in a rich, natural color no matter what style you choose. Straight and slightly wavy styles with a center part flatter your even and symmetrical facial features. If you have curly hair, ask for layers that work with your curls so they fall into a controlled style. [17] X Research source Avoid geometrical or cropped, boyish cuts that may look too severe with the slight sharpness in your bone structure. Stay away from overly layered cuts or wild and trendy hair that may clash with your Classic elegance. Lavish waves or stiff styles can unbalance your features and look awkward."

      "title": "Choose makeup in soft colors that are well blended.",
      "content": "Choose makeup in soft colors that are well blended. Reach for neutrals in a matte finish for eyes and cheeks. Go for a slightly smoky eye with a hint of soft color to keep the intensity of the eyes, cheeks, and lips balanced. [18] X Research source For example, if you have delicate eye makeup, delicately emphasize the lips. But if you have a more intense eye, match that intensity with your lip color. Avoid sharp angles and heavy contouring that can make your features look a little too sharp. Stay away from bright, bold colors and glittery finishes…even in the evening. The barest hint of sparkle is all you need."

      "content": "The Classic spectrum includes the Soft and Dramatic Classics. All three Classics have a symmetrical body with a medium height. However, there are a few characteristics that differentiate them from each other. Classic vs. Soft Classic Classics and Soft Classics are very close in their mixture of energies. Soft Classics are generally a little smaller, with slightly softer flesh, less angularity, and shorter bones than pure Classics. However, they are not as soft as Romantics, which are the body types with the most yin energy. Many Classics have been reclassified into the Soft Classic category. [19] X Research source Classic vs. Dramatic Classic Dramatic Classics typically have broader frames and slightly stronger energy than pure Classics. They may also be slightly taller and have a little more sharpness in their faces. [20] X Research source While the differences between a pure Classic and a Dramatic Classic are more pronounced than between a pure Classic and a Soft Classic, they are still very subtle. Some people originally categorized as pure Classics have been moved to the Dramatic Classic category."

In his book Metamorphosis: Discover Your Image Identity and Dazzle As Only You Can , David Kibbe originally defined a total of 13 body types that fell along a yin/yang spectrum. [21] X Research source On the Kibbe spectrum, yang is associated with a dramatic, masculine figure, while yin represents a more romantic and feminine figure. According to Kibbe, knowing your balance of yin/yang helps you choose a style with clothing, makeup, and hair that matches your energy and looks natural on you."
