      "title": "Determine how much shelter you need.",
      "content": "Determine how much shelter you need. To make this determination, consider the weather in your area. If you live in a mostly temperate climate, your goats may not need as substantial a shelter as other places. At bare minimum, you should provide a 3-sided structure that offers shelter from the sun and wind. However, if you're in an area that has severe winters, you'll need a full-on barn to protect your animals, though it can be a small one. You just need to provide protection from the elements."

    {
      "title": "Consider the size of your herd.",
      "content": "Consider the size of your herd. The size of your shelter is determined by the size of your herd. In general, you need to provide 15 to 20 square feet for each goat you have. So if you only have one goat, your shelter should be 15 to 20 square feet (1.4-1.9 sq. m). In practice, that's a 3-by-5-foot (0.9-by-1.5 m) shelter or a 4-by-5-foot (1.2-by-1.5 m) shelter. If you have 5 goats, you'll need 75 square feet (7 sq. m) to 100 square feet (9.3 sq. m), which translates to approximately an 8-by-9-foot (2.4-by-2.7 m) shelter or a 10-by-10-foot (3-by-3 m) shelter. In fact, you can use a large dog house for a pygmy goat if you are keeping it in your backyard. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Create stalls.",
      "content": "Create stalls. If you have multiple animals, create multiple stalls so each goat has his or her own space. The ideal floor for goats is gravel with clay on top of it. It's easy to clean out, and you can apply another layer every couple of years. Hay is sufficient for bedding, and goats generally won't eat what's on the floor. Also, you'll need troughs of some sort to feed the goats in."

      "title": "Install a fence.",
      "content": "Install a fence. The best fencing for pygmy goats is wire fence. To keep your pygmy goats from jumping over, the fence needs to be at least 4 feet (1.2 m) high. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Include climbing areas.",
      "content": "Include climbing areas. Goats love to climb, so you'll need to include some places for them to do so. For instance, any kind of picnic table is ideal for this pastime. You can even just create hills out of dirt, as goats will find that just as enjoyable. They also like to jump on and off these places. [3] X Research source Old tires also make good toys for your pets."

      "content": "Allow your goat to graze. Goats can eat grass, brush, and forbs, though they will eat the last 2 over grasses. Forbs are weeds such as dandelions and clovers. In the summer, goats may be able to subsist solely on pasture if you have enough land. [5] X Research source You will need about 1/4 of an acre (1101.7 sq. m) of land per goat. [6] X Research source If you have a herd of goats, you will need several pastures to keep up with your goats' demand.

      "content": "Provide a plentiful supply of water. Like all animals, goats need water to live. [10] X Research source However, water is especially important to goats, as they are ruminants, meaning it takes more water for them to process their food than other animals. [11] X Research source Always ensure they have access to clean, fresh water on a regular basis. Make sure to clean out the container you use fairly regularly and to change the water often."

      "content": "Bathe your goats only if they get parasites. Most of the time, brushing will be sufficient for your goat. To bathe the goat, slightly warm up the water so it's not cold. Lather the goat up with a shampoo meant for animals or specifically for goats. Use a washing mitt to help along the process. Rinse off the soap. [14] X Research source It makes it easier if your goat has a collar on because it is easier for you to hold on to her. [15] X Research source"
