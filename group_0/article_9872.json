      "content": "Bring a pot of water to a boil to make corn on the cob for a crowd. Just fill a big pot 3/4-full with water and bring it to a boil over high heat. Shuck as many ears as you like and lower them into the water. Then, bring the water back to a boil and turn it off. Set the lid on the pot and leave the corn in the water for 5 to 10 minutes or until the kernels are tender. You can keep the corn cobs in the pot of hot water until you're ready to serve them. Want creamy-tasting corn on the cob? Add 1 cup (240 ml) of milk, 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 ml) of heavy cream, and 1/4 cup (56 g) of butter to the pot with water before you add the corn."

      "content": "Heat a charcoal or gas grill to high if you want corn with a smoky flavor. Cut off silk that's sticking out of each ear of corn and peel off just 1 of the outer layers of the husk. Then, cut off the bottom stalk of each cob and throw them onto the hot grill. Cook the corn for 5 minutes before you turn them with a pair of tongs. Grill them for 5 more minutes so they're nice and charred. Let them sit on a serving plate for a few minutes before you shuck and serve them. [1] X Research source You may have heard that you should soak your corn in salty water before you toss them on the grill. You don't have to do this to get great-tasting corn, although it's a good idea if you're grilling older corn or the husks have started to dry out."

      "content": "Preheat your oven to 350 °F (177 °C) for a hands-off cooking method. If you don't have a grill or want an easy way to cook lots of corn, just preheat your oven! Carefully place as many ears of corn as you like right onto the oven rack without shucking them first. Cook the corn for 30 minutes and wear oven mitts when you take them out. [2] X Research source You can shuck the roasted corn before you serve it or let everyone shuck their own."

      "content": "Put 1 ear into the microwave for the fastest way to cook corn. There's no need to shuck the corn first—just set it right in your microwave and cook it on the highest heat setting for 3 to 4 minutes. Then, wear an oven mitt to take the hot corn out of the microwave. Slice the bottom stalk off and slip off the husk before you enjoy your tender corn. [3] X Research source If you want to microwave 2 ears of corn, add an extra 1 to 2 minutes to the cooking time."

      "content": "Cook up to 8 ears of corn in your pressure cooker. For a quick way to make corn on the cob, pour 1 1 ⁄ 2 cups (0.35 L) of water into an Instant Pot and put the rack in it. Shuck 8 ears of corn and put the stalk-ends on the rack. Then, close the cooker and secure it. Turn the cooker to high and cook the corn for 4 minutes. Once the steam is released, open your cooker and use tongs to get your steamed corn out. [4] X Research source Always be really careful when your pressure cooker is releasing steam since it's easy to accidentally burn yourself."

      "content": "Cook tender corn in a skillet to give it a crisp texture. Start with 4 ears of corn that you've shucked and boiled for 5 minutes. Heat 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat and add the corn cobs. Cook them for 2 minutes and turn them a few times so they crisp up on the outside. Then, brush them with a spice mixture and cook them for 3 more minutes. For a quick, flavorful spice mixture, combine: [5] X Research source 5 tablespoons (74 ml) of vegetable oil 1 clove of minced garlic 1/3 cup (33 g) of shredded Parmesan cheese 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of lime juice 1 teaspoon (2 g) of ground cumin 1 ⁄ 2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of hot pepper sauce Salt and pepper, to taste"

      "content": "Heat your classic smoker to 250 °F (121 °C) for corn that has incredible flavor. 2 hours before you're ready to cook, peel back the husks and rip out the silk, but don't pull off the husks. Wrap them back over the exposed kernels and soak the cobs in cool water for 2 hours. You should also soak your wood chips in a separate bowl of water for 30 minutes. When you're ready to smoke, arrange the corn cobs in a single layer in your old-school smoker and add the wood chips. Smoke the corn for about 1 hour or until the ears are tender. [6] X Research source Using a fancy new pellet smoker? Turn your pellet grill on to 350 °F (177 °C) and arrange shucked corn on the cob on the grill. Then, set the timer for 20 minutes and your corn should come out perfectly smoked! If you're smoking large ears of corn, they may need an extra 15 minutes in the smoker."

      "content": "Cook corn cobs with their husks in the embers of a fire for a smoky flavor. While your fire or charcoal dies down, carefully peel back the husks so you can rip the silk from 3 corn cobs. Wrap the husks back in place and secure them with a piece of string. Soak the corn cobs in water for at least 15 minutes. Then, push the coals to 1 side of the ground or grill grate and lay 3 ears of corn down on the ground or grate. Cover them with the coals and roast the corn for 10 minutes. [7] X Research source If you want to cook more corn, spread 3 more ears on the opposite side of your grill or fire. You'll know the corn is done when the kernels look deep brown in color."

      "content": "Vacuum seal corn on the cob if you want to use your sous vide cooker. Get perfectly cooked, plump kernels of corn by heating a water bath to 183 °F (84 °C) with your sous vide cooker. Shuck up to 4 ears of corn and put them into a vacuum-seal bag. Once you remove the air from the bag, lower the corn into the water and weigh it down with a skillet. Cook the corn in the water bath for 30 minutes. [8] X Research source If you'd like to make more corn, just fill another vacuum-seal bag and cook the two bags of corn at the same time. Want to season your corn while it cooks? No problem! Put a few pieces of butter along with salt into the bag before you vacuum seal it."
