Continue checking the strand of hair's color every few minutes. Make a note of your hair's coloring time. This is the length of time you will color the rest of your hair. In general, you should only about 20 more minutes. However for stubborn gray hair, this could take up to 45 minutes."

      "content": "Wash your hair. Shampoo your hair with a clarifying shampoo 12 to 24 hours before doing the color rinse. This will remove any build-up from styling products and allow for a nice even color. For best results, use a clarifying shampoo (such as Neutrogena Clarifying Shampoo) to remove build-up. [4] X Research source Professional salons do not always use clarifying shampoo due to time constraints, but it's usually a good idea."

Then, parting your hair in ¼ inch sections, apply the color to your roots, and then work through to the ends. Use your gloved fingers to help distribute the color throughout your hair, but do not rub the color into your scalp. [8] X Research source If you have long or thick locks, try separating your hair into four sections before coloring. This give you more control while you color, and a more even rinse afterwards."
