      "content": "Choose your gamemode. There are three game modes in Console Edition: Survival, Creative, and Adventure. [1] X Research source Survival is a gamemode where you have to mine, get food, and fight mobs to survive. It is easier to die with threats like zombies, lava, and other players. This is the gamemode for a little bit of challenge in the game. Creative is the second gamemode. You don't have to worry about health, hunger, and mobs in this mode. You have unlimited resources and items, and you can break any block (including bedrock) fast with no tools. This is the gamemode if you want to build for hours on end. Adventure mode is like Survival - except you can't break or place blocks without tools and commands. This gamemode is generally not very useful for regular Minecraft play with the exception of custom maps. Note that Spectator Mode is only available in the Java Edition."

Then you will need to enter /gamemode 0 to go to Survival mode, /gamemode 1 to go to Creative, and /gamemode 2 to go to Adventure. You can also change another player's gamemode by putting their name in front of the command. For example, to change Bob's gamemode to survival mode, you would type in /gamemode 0 Bob . You will need to have cheats enabled when you were creating your world for this to work. If you are playing on a LAN world, you need to be set to Operator by the world's owner for this to work."

This gamemode is generally not very useful for regular Minecraft play with the exception of custom maps. Spectator mode is also a fun gamemode. Being in Spectator mode is kind of like being a Minecraft ghost: you can go anywhere in your world, even through walls, without you and your nametag being seen or heard. You can even go underground and view all the cave systems, mineshafts, dungeons, and (if you're lucky) strongholds - all without the fear of suffocating."
