      "content": "Check your bank statements. Every month, your bank sends you a statement that details all of the transactions for your account, including things you bought and money you earned. Your statement also lists the current balance of your debit card or checking account. Depending on your bank, your statement might be sent at the beginning or end of the month. Most banks automatically send you your statements through the mail. They usually have the option to send statements to your email or phone, which you can opt in to by logging into your online banking account or calling your bank. Statements might not reflect your current balance, as any transactions you make after it's mailed won't be listed. To check your balance in real-time, go to your bank’s website, app, ATM, call them, or go in person. Tip : It’s good practice to check your statement each month to make sure there are no unauthorized charges on your card. If you see any transactions that you didn’t make, immediately call your bank."
