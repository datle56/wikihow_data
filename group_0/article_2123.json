      "content": "ACR is the technology used to identify what is playing. At the beginning of whatever you're watching, ACR compares the audio or visual signals of whatever you're watching with its library to find a match. Using ACR, smart TVs and streaming services can track real-time metrics like who's watching the premiere of a TV show or who's re-watching shows and movies that came out in the 1990s. Advertisers also use this watching information to more accurately present ads to the right audience."

      "content": "ACR can identify any content on a smart TV and is included in some streaming services. This includes streaming shows, digital videos, Blu-ray or DVD movies, and ads. While most laptops and desktop computers don't have ACR, streaming services or web browser extensions might. ACR won't recognize what's on your screen if it isn't in ACR's reference database."

      "content": "User viewing consumption habits are not private. Since ACR detects what's playing on the screen, your private viewing habits may not actually be private. What you watch, how often, and around what times, can be used to display highly personalized ads. Streamers also use this technology to make accurate \"What to watch next\" or \"Recommended\" sections."

      "title": "You can opt out of ACR.",
      "content": "You can opt out of ACR. The setting should default to off, and you have to opt-in to be able to use Automatic Content Recognition. In 2016, the FTC and the State of New Jersey collected $2.2 million to settle charges against Vizio for installing software that automatically turns on ACR. Since this case, the feature is off by default for all smart TVs and not even included on some newer Vizio TVs. ACR is typically not available on laptops, desktops, tablets, and phones, unlike on smart TVs. However, some streaming services and browser extensions can feature ACR, so check the privacy policy if you are concerned."
