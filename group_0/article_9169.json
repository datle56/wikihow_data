      "title": "Choose metal-containing epoxy for metal that won’t be stressed.",
      "content": "Choose metal-containing epoxy for metal that won’t be stressed. Metal-containing epoxy is great for joining together pieces of metal, but isn’t strong enough to keep the metal bonded if it’s put under too much pressure. [1] X Research source Additionally, if the metal heats up too much, then the epoxy may melt and won’t keep them connected. Epoxy is great for making quick repairs but shouldn’t be used to join metal that will be used as tools or used to support heavier objects."

      "title": "Clean the metal with a degreaser to remove rust and residue.",
      "content": "Clean the metal with a degreaser to remove rust and residue. Spray a degreaser over the surface of the metal and take a clean cloth or sponge and wipe the metal to remove any grease from the surface to create a better adhesion. If there’s rust or stubborn grime on the metal, use a stiff-bristled brush to scrub it clean. [2] X Research source You can find a degreaser at hardware stores, home improvement stores, department stores, and by ordering it online. Let the metal dry or wipe it dry with a clean cloth."

      "title": "Mix together 2-part metal-containing epoxy to activate it.",
      "content": "Mix together 2-part metal-containing epoxy to activate it. Metal-containing epoxy is a strong adhesive specially designed for metal that comes in 2 parts that need to be combined in order to be activated and create a strong bond. Squeeze out a dab of both parts of the epoxy and mix them together with a stir stick according to the directions on the packaging. [3] X Research source Look for 2-part metal-containing epoxy, such as J-B Weld SteelStik, at your local hardware or department store. You can also order it online."

      "title": "Spread epoxy over the areas where you’ll connect the metal.",
      "content": "Spread epoxy over the areas where you’ll connect the metal. Use your stir stick or applicator to spread the epoxy in a thin, even layer over the surface of the metal pieces where you plan to connect them. Spread the epoxy onto all of the pieces of metal to create a stronger bond. [4] X Research source You don’t need a glob or a thick layer of epoxy. A thin and even layer will bond better."

      "title": "Hold the metal pieces together for about 10 seconds.",
      "content": "Hold the metal pieces together for about 10 seconds. Use your hands or a clamp to connect the pieces of metal together. Apply pressure and hold the metal together for at least 10 seconds, then gently release them. The epoxy will bond together and keep them connected, but you need to wait 1-2 hours for the epoxy to fully harden. [5] X Research source Most epoxy will take a few hours to fully set and cure, but check the packaging for specific drying times."

      "content": "Use a rivet gun to drive rivets into thin metal sheets. A rivet gun is a handheld tool with a handle that you squeeze to drive a rivet through metal. Riveting is best used for thin sheets of metal that you want to connect together for light duty applications such as connecting gutters or attaching a metal sign to a wall. [6] X Research source You can find a rivet gun and rivets at your local hardware store or by ordering them online."

      "content": "Drill a hole slightly larger than your rivet into the metal sheets. Use a power drill and fit a bit into the end that’s just slightly larger than the rivet or rivets you plan to drive through the metal so they fit through the hole. Drill holes through the metal sheets where you want to place your rivets. [8] X Research source If you’re drilling multiple holes, use a ruler or tape measure to make sure they’re evenly spaced apart."

Push the rivet all of the way into the end of the gun so it’s held securely and won’t slide out. [9] X Research source The rivet needs to be fully inserted in order for the rivet gun to properly insert it into the metal."

      "content": "Slide the rivet into the hole and squeeze the handle of the rivet gun. Fit the rivet all the way into the hole you drilled so the end of the rivet gun is pressed against the surface of the metal. Squeeze the handle of the rivet gun to drive the rivet into the metal. Then, unclamp the handle and remove it. [10] X Research source If you’re driving multiple rivets into the sheets of metal, load up another one into rivet gun and keep going!"

      "content": "Use self-tapping screws to connect metal sheets securely. Self-tapping screws, sometimes called self-drilling screws, are screws that can be installed into metal without having to first drill pilot holes. They’re useful for connecting metal sheets more securely than by using pop rivets, and can be used to connect multiple layers of sheet metal. [11] X Research source You can find self-tapping screws at your local hardware store or by ordering them online."

      "content": "Clamp the metal sheets together and mark where you want to drill. Use a C-clamp to keep the metal sheets held tightly together so they don’t move when you drill. Take a marker and mark the locations where you plan to add your screws to connect the metal sheets. [13] X Research source The clamp also makes sure there isn’t space between the sheets so they’re better connected."

Hold the end of the screw against the surface of the metal and apply constant pressure as you start the drill slowly and increase the speed to drive the screw into the metal. Once the head of the screw is flush with the surface of the metal, remove the drill and install another one. [14] X Research source If a screw breaks or won’t penetrate the metal, try using another one."

      "content": "Use a brazing rod to connect metal without welding. Welding is the strongest way to connect metal together, but it requires special tools and training in order to do it properly and safely. A brazing rod is similar to a stick of solder or flux, but is made out of brass filler and isn’t heated directly like solder is. It’s great for connecting most types of metal, brass, and copper together. [15] X Research source Brazing is great for most metals except softer ones like aluminum, which require a special process in order to be done correctly and without melting."

      "content": "Clean the metal with soapy water. Fill a bowl or bucket with warm water and add a few drops of a liquid dish soap. Stir the solution together so it’s nice and sudsy. Dip a sponge or clean cloth into the mixture and use it to wipe the surface of the metal to remove grime and residue. If there are stubborn patches of dirt or residue on the metal, use a stiff-bristled scrubbing brush to remove them. [16] X Research source Clean all of the metal you plan to connect. It’s really important that you remove any grime, grease, or sticky residue from the surface of the metal or they won’t bond together properly."

      "content": "Scuff the surface of the metal with a wire brush. In order for the brass filler to properly adhere to the surface of the metal, there need to be tiny scratches on the surface. Take a wire brush and run it back and forth over the metal where you plan to connect it to scratch it up. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Place the metal on top of a damp piece of wood. Soak a piece of wood that’s at least twice the size of the metal items you’re brazing in water so it’s damp and place it on a flat surface like a worktable or the ground away from any flammable objects. Position your metal on top of the wood in the way you want it to be connected. [18] X Research source Make sure the wood is large enough so it can absorb any excess heat from the torch. Damp wood won’t catch on fire from the heat used to braze the metal together."

      "content": "Heat the metal with a propane blowtorch until it glows. Take a propane torch and ignite it to start up the flame. Hold the flame steady about 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) away from the metal where you want to connect it. Heat both sides of the seam between the metal to form a strong connection. Keep the flame on the metal until it glows a bright yellowy-orange color. [19] X Research source Be very careful not to touch the metal while it’s hot."

Hold the rod so it’s touching both sides of the seam between the metal. The rod will melt and weld the metal together. Spread the rod over the metal to form an even and consistent bond. Wait at least 1-2 hours for the metal to cool before you touch it. [20] X Research source"
