Put a green tablecloth over a centrally located table, and on top of that, place the Mkeka which is a straw or woven mat that symbolizes the historical foundation of African ancestry. [2] X Research source Place the following on the Mkeka : Mazao — fruit or crops placed in a bowl, representing the community's productivity. Kinara — a seven-pronged candle-holder. Mishumaa Saba — the seven candles which represent the seven core principles of Kwanzaa. Three candles on the left are red, representing struggle; three on the right are green, representing hope; and one in the center is black, signifying the African American people or those who draw their heritage from Africa. Muhindi — ears of corn. Lay out one ear of corn for each child; if there are no children, place two ears to represent the children of the community. Zawadi — various gifts for the children. Kikombe cha Umoja — a cup to represent family and community unity."

      "content": "The Kwanzaa Karamu feast always takes place on New Year’s Eve. The Kwanzaa feast is a very special event that brings everyone closer to their African roots. It is traditionally held on December 31st and is a communal and cooperative effort. Decorate the place where the feast will be held in a red, green, and black scheme. A large Kwanzaa setting should dominate the room where the feast will be held. A large Mkeka should be placed in the center of the floor where the food is placed creatively and made accessible to all to serve themselves. Before and during the feast, an informative and entertaining program should be presented. [6] X Research source Traditionally, the program should involve welcoming, remembering, reassessment, recommitment and rejoicing concluded by a farewell statement and a call for greater unity. During the feast, drinks are to be shared from a communal cup, the Kikombe cha Umoja , passed around to all celebrants."

      "content": "On January 1st, exchange presents for Kuumba. Kuumba, meaning creativity , is highly encouraged and brings a sense of self-satisfaction. The gifts are usually exchanged between the parents and children and are given out traditionally on January 1st, the last day of Kwanzaa. Since the giving of gifts has very much to do with Kuumba, the gifts should be of an educational or artistic nature."
