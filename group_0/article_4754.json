It should also be wide enough so that your feet won't hang off the sides. Around 33\" by 14\" is good. [1] X Research source"

Also purchase some large diameter, (5\" to 7\" is good), thick walled PVC or ABS pipe. It should be long enough to fit the width of your board, and strong enough that it does not flex easily, since you will be putting your weight on it. [2] X Research source"

Step on the board carefully, (using a chair or someone's shoulder for support, at least the first few times), and test your balance! [5] X Research source"
