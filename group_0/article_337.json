      "content": "Sit at the front of the class. Choose a seat at the front of the room so you can listen attentively to everything that your teacher says. Being up front makes it easier to pay attention in class because it removes distractions from your classmates, and it also puts you on your teacher’s radar, giving you a better opportunity to earn extra brownie points. [1] X Research source Sitting in front will also remove the temptation to pull out your phone, read something that isn’t pertinent to the class, or zone out. If you can't move to the front of the class, ask your classmates to let you focus and to not talk to you during class."

      "content": "Take concise notes during lessons. Absorb the most you can during each lesson by taking better notes in class . Instead of writing down every word your teacher says, listen attentively to pick up on important details, such as names, dates, and places. This narrows down the amount of information you need to learn, which can help boost your productivity and minimize stress. [2] X Expert Source Jennifer Kaifesh Founder, Great Expectations College Prep Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. For instance, you might write: \"Franz Ferdinand (archduke of Austria) was assassinated on June 28, 1914.\" If your teacher hints that a specific subject might show up on an upcoming exam, put a star next to your notes so you can go back and focus on studying it. If you’re a visual learner, create charts, diagrams, or doodles to help you remember things.

Bring up points and questions that relate directly to the specific lesson or module your class is covering that week. Mention other students’ ideas in a respectful way, either to agree or disagree, to show that you are fully engaged in the conversation.

For example, say something like, \"I agree with Andrea's point about global warming, and I think even more effort can be put into making a change.\" Try to think of questions that will spark further discussion. For instance, \"How do you think Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet might have been different if he had written the play in the age of social media?\""

[4] X Expert Source Jennifer Kaifesh Founder, Great Expectations College Prep Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. To block out time, think about your schedule outside of school, especially if you have a job or you’re involved with extracurricular activities. Tackle your hardest assignments first when you have the most energy and focus, then complete simpler homework toward the end of the day (or week) when you’re more tired. [5] X Research source Most students set aside 1-3 hours for homework each day, but give yourself an extra 1-2 hours if you learn a new topic or your teacher assigns more work than usual. To manage your time wisely, use different colored gel pens to prioritize your tasks and keep track of your due dates."

Completing your readings before class helps you fully engage in class discussions, impress your teachers , and prepare for any potential pop quizzes. [6] X Research source If possible, read during study periods, breaks in between classes, or lunch time so you can work on other assignments after school. If you don’t have enough time to get through your readings, read summaries of your assigned chapters for free on CliffsNotes on SparkNotes , or watch a quick analysis video on YouTube."

Track the due dates for your homework carefully, and write them down in your calendar as soon as your teacher assigns them. If you tend to forget things, set a reminder on your phone the day before the deadline. If you plan to be absent on a day when a homework assignment is due, hand it in early to avoid losing marks."

      "content": "Start studying for exams at least 3 weeks early. If you have a major exam coming up, begin studying as early as possible. Give yourself 3-4 weeks to cover all the material in small, manageable study sessions, and plan out these sessions in advance so you have enough time to keep up with all of your other course work. Planning ahead will remove stress from the studying process, making it easier to concentrate. Avoid cramming for your exam the night before, which increases your stress levels and doesn’t give you enough time to fully absorb the information. If you want to study in a group, be sure to invite people who actually want to study and succeed. If not, the other students will just distract you and waste your time."

Instead of simply reading over your notes, develop your own materials to fully understand lessons and study more efficiently . If you’re not sure how to actively revise and grasp concepts, here are some easy and effective strategies: [8] X Research source If you have a textbook for class, answer the practice questions at the end of each chapter. Act like you’re a teacher and explain a concept or lesson like you are teaching it to a class. Ask yourself the 5 W’s (Who? What? When? Where? Why?) to break down abstract concepts into simpler ones. Memorize formulas or equations with mnemonics (i.e. for coordinating conjunctions, use FANBOYS = for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so). Solve practice problems, then explain your thought process and how it worked (bonus tip: find out if there are other ways to solve the question and get the same answer). Make a Venn diagram to compare and contrast the big ideas for each topic. Create flowcharts, tables, graphs, timelines, mind-maps, and/or study guides for each subject."

      "content": "Test yourself to gauge your progress. While studying for exams, use practice tests or previous years’ exams to test yourself on the course content. Complete them within the same time frame as you’re given in class, and score them once you’re finished to see what areas you can improve on. If you don’t attain the scores you need to achieve first rank, schedule additional study time to improve your performance. Obtain practice exams from online resources like Course Hero or Chegg , or ask your teacher for a copy of a previous year’s exam. Tip: Some teachers reuse questions from the same test bank each year, which you can often find on Quizlet . To access potential exam questions, type in a question from one of your homework assignments on Google, then see if any Quizlet flashcards pop up in the results. If nothing shows up, search your course name or the last name of your teacher, followed by the word “Quizlet.”"

If possible, study without using your computer: read out of a book, use a paper and pen to take notes, and make physical flashcards. By limiting your access to digital devices, you can concentrate better and are more likely to study for longer periods of time. [9] X Research source If you have to use your computer to study, download third-party extensions that block distracting websites like StayFocusd and BlockSite . Wear noise-canceling headphones to remove any distracting noises in your environment. If there are too many distractions at home, go to your local library or community college to study in peace, and try to find a spot where you can’t see people moving around."

Studying for long periods of time can cause you to lose energy, decreasing your efficiency, motivation, and ability to retain information. During your break, try to forget about school so you can fully unwind, and set a timer so you know when to start studying again.

If you’re having trouble grasping certain topics or staying ahead of your class, find a tutor through your school, a tutoring center, or online, or ask your teacher for help . Taking initiative to get help can prevent yourself from falling behind, which saves you time (and stress) in the long run. Remember, there is no such thing as a “dumb” question, so don’t be afraid to ask someone if you’re struggling! [11] X Research source The cost of tutoring centers like Kumon and Sylvan vary by location, but they typically range between $100-200 per month.

While missing class won’t directly affect your rank, it can make you fall behind on work, interrupt your study schedule, and possibly disrupt your teacher’s lesson plan (if they assign partner or group work). Actively participating in class and asking questions is the key to becoming a class topper, so try not to miss any days during the semester. If you miss class because you’re sick, try to let a classmate know so they can inform the teacher, and ask them if you can borrow their notes.

Arrive to class on time (or a little bit early), and address your teacher by their preferred name and title. Being well-behaved will make your teacher happy , which may translate into better grades for effort and participation. When speaking to others, make sure you use polite words like “please” and “thank you,” and do not raise your voice at other students if you feel frustrated. Avoid passing notes, talking to your friends, making unnecessary jokes or comments, and moving around too much during lessons (or anytime your teacher seems serious)."

To remain respectful to your teacher and classmates, place your phone on silent mode and put it somewhere out of reach so you aren’t tempted to look at it. Scrolling on your phone reduces your concentration and success in class, which will eventually translate on your transcript. If you find it hard not to look at your phone, ask your friend (or your teacher) if they can hold it for you until the end of class."

      "content": "Make friends with other high achievers. Sit next to other successful students in class, and ask them to explain topics you’re having trouble with. Befriending other high achievers may boost your grades because you can do homework together and implement their learning strategies. When it’s exam season, consider setting up a study group so you can test each other on the material and work through the study guide more efficiently. To avoid trouble in class, distance yourself from distracting students. If you have assigned seating, ask your teacher if you can move seats so you can focus better."
