The Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card is the most popular option, and it gives you 5% of your money back from Amazon and Whole Foods, 2% of your money back from restaurants, drug stores, and gas stations, and 1% of your money back on all other purchases. You won’t be charged extra for using the card out of the country, and it provides fraud and theft protection; however, you could be charged anywhere from 14% to 24% interest depending on your credit score . [1] X Research source The Visa Signature Card is provided through Chase Bank, so you can look on their website for any other information you need.

The Store Card gives you 5% of your money back on all of your Amazon purchases as long as you have an Amazon Prime membership. When you sign up for the card, a $60 credit will automatically be loaded onto your Amazon account; however, the interest rate of this card is 25.99% no matter what your credit score is. [2] X Research source This card is provided by Synchrony Bank. You can use this card for other purchases, but you won’t get money back unless you use it on Amazon items. This card is easier to get approved for since you get less money back overall."
