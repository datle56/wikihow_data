Typically, you’ll administer 1-2 sprays or drops every 2 to 3 hours. Alternatively, use a neti pot to flush out your sinuses. However, make sure you never fill a neti pot or create a saline solution with tap water as it may contain bacteria or amoebas that can cause life-threatening illness. Also, keep your neti pot very clean by washing it after each use. You can find saline spray options for purchase here and neti pot options here ."

Wet a washcloth with water that's as hot as you can stand, lie down, and lay the cloth over the bridge of your nose so that it covers your sinuses but leaves the path to your nostrils clear. Alternatively, place the cloth over your forehead. Rewet the washcloth when it starts to feel uncomfortably cold. It might take a few rounds of reheating the washcloth for you to feel any benefit, so be patient. Try using a compress while you do something relaxing, like listening to music or watching TV."

Depending on the cause of the stuffiness, you might be able to find some relief with an over-the-counter (OTC) medication. If your child between the age of 4 to 12 is sick, choose a decongestant or antihistamine formulated especially for children. Be sure to speak to your doctor before taking medication of any kind and ask what they recommend for your specific symptoms. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you have a cold, a decongestant can ease the swelling and inflammation in your nasal passages , leading to easier breathing. You can take this medication orally, as a pill or liquid, or use a decongestant nasal spray. Be aware that decongestant nasal sprays are only recommended for 3 consecutive days of use due to the risk of rebound congestion, while oral decongestants can be taken for up to 5 to 7 days. You can find decongestant options online for purchase here . If you're suffering from allergies, such as hay fever, get an antihistamine, such as Claritin, Zyrtec, or Allegra, or the generic equivalent of one of these medications. An antihistamine will both relieve congestion and take care of other symptoms, like sneezing. Be aware that some antihistamines can make you feel tired. Look for non-drowsy options to take during the day and wait to drive or use heavy machinery until you see how the antihistamine affects you. Flonase and Nasacort sprays, which contain corticosteroids, may also be helpful if your nose is congested due to allergies. Corticosteroids help reduce inflammation."

[9] X Research source To make your own saline solution , mix 1/4 teaspoon (1.42 grams) of non-iodized salt with 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of filtered or distilled lukewarm water. If you only have tap water on hand, boil it and allow it cool before using to make a saline solution. Otherwise, you could introduce bacteria or amoebas into your child’s sinus cavity, which, while rare, can be life-threatening."

Release the bulb to suck up the mucus, then remove it from the nostril and squeeze out the mucus onto a tissue. Repeat on the other side.
