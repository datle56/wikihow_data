The symptoms of a yeast infection can look similar to a variety of other vaginal infections, which may require different kinds of medications (such as antibiotics).

The suppositories are easy to insert, but are messier than the ovules. Once they are inserted, they dissolve quickly and create a lot of leakage. This option is usually cheaper than the ovules. The pre-filled cream applicators make the whole process quick and easy, but these are also the messiest option.
