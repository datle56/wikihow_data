      "content": "Start out young. 4 out of the 5 last World Series of Poker champions were 25 or under. It seems as though the younger you start, the better your chances of rising to the top. This is likely because the younger you are, the more fearless and aggressive you are, too. [1] X Research source It's not enough to know how to play poker . You've got to know strategy, the ins and outs, how to bluff , and how to detect when others are bluffing. In many states, you have to be 21 to enter a casino. However, in certain states this is not the case – and sometimes different rules apply to card rooms. If you're under 21, try to find a place in your area where you're allowed to play with others who take it just as seriously as you do."

It doesn’t matter if you’re playing the same small casino day in and day out, you’ve gotta be routinely coming out on top. [2] X Research source Try to play all types of people. Those you can read, those you can't read, those who stick to the same strategy, those who have no strategy at all – have your opponents run the gamut of personalities. When you find a type of person you're weaker against, zero in on them and play them until the weakness goes away. Don't just play hold 'em, either. Know how to play Omaha, 5-card draw, and 7-card stud, too. The more variants you know, the better your skills. And you may run into a tournament of this variation someday, too."

      "content": "Keep track of at least 1,500 hours worth of play.

And that means keeping track of every game you play and the results. Here’s three reasons why: [3] X Research source It forces you to see how much you’re losing. So don’t lie to yourself. If you’re losing, you need to know, so you can jump ship and keep what winnings you can. This lets you see how much money you’re actually making.

If you write in a certain amount of detail, you’ll see patterns in where you went wrong."

      "content": "Determine your budget. Since you’ve been keeping records, this part is easy. How much money do you need to earn, say, every month to be financially safe? For some people its $5,000 and for some it’s $25,000. Do you make enough right now to do it full time? How much do you average an hour? If you determine you need higher stakes to make more money in a smaller amount of time, your competition just got upped. You’ll be playing in the tournaments with the big boys. Or you can stay local and chug away at it slowly. What are you capable of?"

      "content": "Play under intense pressure. Playing with Jimbo and Bubba from down the street and constantly beating them isn’t exactly the same as constantly beating tables of people in red-carpeted VIP rooms. To be sure you’re made of quality stuff, play when the going gets tough. Can you keep your cool? [4] X Research source Staying calm and logical is large part of poker. Sometimes even good players get nervous and end up doing something they'd regret. When you're familiar with intense competition, you get used to the anxiety and it (in part, at least) eventually dissipates."

      "content": "Figure out your bankroll. Your bankroll is the term used for how much money you need in your pocket to play the game. There are two varieties: [5] X Research source Limit Poker bankroll. The most common number used for limit poker is 300 big bets. Determine what stakes you need to play to make the amount of money you are aiming for. Once that is done, anticipate an earn rate of one big bet an hour. Then, multiply the big bet times 300. If you are playing $10-$20, with a big bet of $40, it would result in an earn rate of (at 40 hours per week) $1,600, and you would need a bankroll of $12,000. No-limit Poker bankroll . No-limit has no set standard. Let's start with a good rule of thumb, which is 20 to 25 maximum buy-ins. If you've decided you need to play in a $500 max buy-in game to profit, then you should have a $12,500 bankroll."

You don’t need to travel circuits around the world to be a professional poker player – you just need to make it your main source of income. If you find a place or two you jive with, stick with those places. It’s your bread and butter. You will likely develop a reputation for yourself if you stick to one or two places. People may start not wanting to play with you, or worse, recognizing your habits and strategy. If you sense this coming, you may have to widen your circuit and play unsuspecting strangers."

Lots of people find this easier – it’s often quicker, pain-free, and, quite frankly, it’s easier to take money from the faceless. If you do live in the USA, it’s possible, but it may not be legal. The US decreed a law recently banning banks from dealing with online poker companies. However, you can play for free online to practice – or you could hack into the system and get a foreign IP address, though that’s not at all recommended."

If you’re playing often, you should have it in a few months’ time. [6] X Research source Don't be tempted to get into intense tournaments when you don't have it just yet.

Have some money saved up for a rainy day in case you become a little too addicted to the game and happen upon an unfortunate losing streak.

So you’ve graduated from Jimbo and Bubba, you played in the big tournaments in a few of your local casinos and did well, but then you went off to Vegas and got your shirt handed to you?

The stakes for you are higher than ever. Hey, maybe it'll improve your game. Try to take other opportunities that come with being a pro, like teaching, writing a book, or starting a website. This way poker is your life, but it doesn't depend on you playing 40 hours a week and always winning. Life, even as a professional poker player, can be stressful."
