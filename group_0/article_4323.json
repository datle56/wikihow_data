Based on the Old Testament in the Bible, some Rastafarians believe that sleeping with a menstruating woman is impure or sinful. The taboo surrounding menstruation carried over and became widespread in Jamaican culture, in the form of “bomboclat.” [8] X Research source In the 1980s, Jamaicans living in New York City started using “bomboclat” in place of “bulls***.” This didn’t go mainstream, but it eventually became part of American gang slang in the late ‘80s and ‘90s to mean “motherf***er.”"
