      "content": "Recognize what the hijab is. The term hijab is actually the Arabic term for creating a partition or barrier, and doesn't specifically mean a type of head covering. [1] X Research source In Islam, hijab consists of the fundamental behaviors for modesty, as well as how Muslims should dress. These rules apply to both men and women, and vary depending on how close the person is to reaching puberty. Many people frequently refer to a headscarf of any sort as a hijab, so the meaning is often context-dependent. One of the most important purposes of hijab is to identify the wearer as an adherent of Islam."

Muslims are required by the Quran to be modest, especially around those of another gender, and must cover their awrah (what is deemed a private area in Islam). What counts as the awrah is largely dependent on the age and sex of the person in question - for example, babies do not have an awrah, and young children only need to cover their private parts. [2] X Research source The awrah for a woman shortly before and after she reaches puberty is from her head to her ankles. Most scholars agree that it's acceptable to leave your face and hands uncovered, though not everyone agrees on whether you should cover your feet. [3] X Research source"

To gain a better understanding of the rules of veiling, it's important to read the Quran verses that address it, with the most frequently cited verses being 24:31 and 33:59. \"And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment except that which [necessarily] appears thereof and to wrap [a portion of] their headcovers over their chests and not expose their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women, that which their right hands possess, or those male attendants having no physical desire, or children who are not yet aware of the private aspects of women. And let them not stamp their feet to make known what they conceal of their adornment. And turn to Allah in repentance, all of you, O believers, that you might succeed.\" [Quran 24:31] This verse is interpreted as the rules for both modesty and for veiling, and is the reason why most Muslims consider it a requirement to veil. \"O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and all the women of the believers to bring down over themselves [part] of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known and not abused.\" [Quran 33:59] This verse, prior to translation, uses the Arabic word jalabib (the plural of jilbab ), which translates as \"loose outer garments\". This is frequently interpreted to mean that Muslim women should wear loose clothing, rather than anything tight or form-fitting. [4] X Research source"

Hadith , the sayings of the Prophet Muhammed and other religious figures of his time, often give further insight to parts of Islam that aren't elaborated on by the Quran.

Most Muslim girls are accustomed to wearing the hijab by the time they've reached puberty, though there are many views on when is the best time to start. [8] X Research source New converts are encouraged to begin veiling as soon as possible, though it's acceptable to gradually transition into covering instead of all at once. Some people believe that all girls should begin veiling by age nine, even if she hasn't started puberty yet; others think it's best to wait until signs of puberty appear (such as the developing of underarm or pubic hair, or the onset of periods). If no signs appear, then the girl will be considered an adult by age 15 in lunar years. [9] X Research source Other people introduce their daughters to wearing the hijab when they start learning their prayers at age seven, or by age 10 when the five-times daily prayer habit may be established. Most madrassas have rules requiring girls to wear the hijab when attending Qur'an classes, which could be as young as age five, as it helps them to develop their Muslim identity and to feel part of the global body of Muslims."

The requirements of hijab mean that the awrah must be covered. Simply put, the \"rules\" of wearing the hijab are: To not display your appearance (beauty) except what is already apparent (i.e., your face and hands, and possibly your feet). To avoid showing hair on your head. To refrain from wearing tight clothing, so your figure isn't exposed. To wear your hijab so that it covers your head, neck, and chest (though not all Muslims wear their hijab in this way). To avoid unveiling around those who are non- mahram . The use of makeup while wearing hijab is debated, since the use of makeup can draw attention to your features. Most people agree that light application of makeup is acceptable, though, as long as it wasn't meant to draw the attention of others. [10] X Research source"

For new Muslims, it can be difficult to tell all the various types of head coverings apart; however, the hijab and niqab are not the same thing. The hijab is frequently a catch-all term for head coverings which always leave the face exposed; the niqab covers the wearer's face as well, with only the eyes left uncovered. [13] X Research source Wearing the niqab is the norm in many Muslim countries, especially in the Gulf region, and is becoming increasingly commonplace in some Western countries, though most Islamic scholars agree that covering the face is not a requirement under the Quran. [14] X Research source [15] X Research source Some women choose to wear the niqab to feel closer to Allah or to follow the example of the Prophet's wives, who wore niqab. Don't mistake the niqab for the burqa , which also fully covers the wearer, but has a small mesh paneling over the eyes. [16] X Research source It has a negative reputation, as it's closely associated with the Taliban (as they forced women to wear burqas). Other types of head coverings include the al-amira , a two-piece tube-like scarf; the shayla , a long scarf that covers the head and is pinned at the shoulders; the khimar , a head covering that extends down to the waist; and the chador , a cloak that covers the head and is held closed by the hands.

While many countries don't have laws about the hijab in and of itself, some countries require that certain veils not be worn, restrict where they can be worn, or require that they are worn. To avoid legal trouble in your area, look up the laws regarding hijab where you live. Most bans on head coverings tend to apply to facial veils, like the niqab and the burqa. Bans on all types of headscarves are uncommon, but not unheard of. Conversely, some Muslim countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, require that women wear a veil. The consensus amongst Muslim scholars is that wearing the hijab after puberty is mandatory under Islamic law (Shariah). However, most non-Muslim countries do not legally mandate the hijab."

If you're not certain how close you feel to your religion, or don't want to identify yourself as a Muslim, you may want to hold off on veiling; if you definitely want people to know you're Muslim and feel very close to Islam, wearing the hijab or even niqab may seem like a natural step to take. If you are not Muslim and want to wear the hijab anyway, it's recommended not to do so, as the hijab is an act of worship.

There are many reasons someone may not be able to wear it all the time - whether due to needing to get used to it, not living in a safe or supportive environment, or working a job where covering your head would be unsafe or cause you to lose your job. Consider your circumstances - can you and do you want to start veiling all at once, or would you need to make the shift gradually? Frequently switching between wearing and not wearing the hijab is discouraged, so if you can't wear the hijab every day, you may want to wait until you can wear it regularly.

If you live in a household where Islam isn't accepted, it may be in your better interest to wait until you live on your own or with more accepting people, especially if you fear you may be disowned, kicked out, or abused for your religious beliefs. While it is possible to wear the hijab when not with your housemates or family members, there's potential for someone to see and mention it to your living partners (such as a teacher commenting about your hijab to your parents), so tread carefully. Alternatively, if you live in a Muslim family but don't feel very connected to Islam, you may have to veil until you move out if you know your family would cause you physical or mental harm for not doing so."

Social norms vary from place to place, and even if wearing or not wearing a hijab isn't technically illegal in your area, you may be harshly judged by those around you or even be physically harmed. While you may stand out in some areas depending on whether or not you veil, consider your actual safety, not just whether you'd be drawing attention to yourself. Do you live in a safe area and have friends and family that accept the right for you to choose whether to veil, or would there be serious risk of you being threatened or attacked for not conforming? The residents of some Muslim-majority areas may treat a lack of hijab as socially unacceptable, and those who have chosen not to veil in Islamic countries (e.g. Saudi Arabia or Iran) have received death threats and even been arrested. [18] X Research source In non-Muslim countries or neighbourhoods, it's common to get odd looks or questions from those who aren't familiar with Islam and might not be sure as to what you're wearing.

While some women cover themselves in some non-traditional ways (for example, exposing their wrists or ankles), it's extremely uncommon to wear shorts and short-sleeved shirts with a hijab and is disliked by other Muslims. Generally, if you want to wear the hijab, you should be willing to cover up to your elbows or wrists and ankles daily at the least, even when it's hot outside. Wearing hijab doesn't mean you have to wear thick clothes during the summer. Those who wear hijab often wear thin and loose (but not see-through) clothing, such as the abaya, to avoid overheating."

However, you should only change your mind if you have a different point of view; pressure from peers or family can be difficult to overcome, but remember, they aren't you and can't make your decision. Try saying something like, \"I respect your views and understand that you want me to do what you feel is best for me, but whether or not I wear the hijab is a decision between Allah and I.

Join Muslim groups, such as youth groups, events, clubs, study circles or mosques, where wearing the hijab is a choice. Perform religious duties such as praying, bodily cleansing, or fasting.
