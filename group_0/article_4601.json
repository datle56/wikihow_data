      "content": "Exfoliate your skin 1-2 times per week to remove dead cells. Throughout your daily life, residues and dead cells can accumulate on the surface of your skin. This can lead to uneven texture that may cause your skin to appear dull. To get smoother and brighter skin, exfoliate your face once or twice a week using a brush, sponge, or chemical exfoliant such as alpha or beta hydroxy acid (found in many store-bought face washes). [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If you use a scrub or chemical exfoliator, rub the product onto your skin gently using small, circular motions for about 30 seconds. Then rinse off using lukewarm, rather than hot, water. If you are using a brush or sponge, use short, light strokes. You can make your own exfoliant using two parts sugar or salt mixed with one part oil of any kind. Since it dissolves more easily, sugar is less abrasive than salt, making it a better option for more sensitive skin."
