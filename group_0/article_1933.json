  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Thank them for the offer.",
      "content": "Thank them for the offer. Express your gratitude to let the hiring manager know that you appreciate it. This will make them more likely to grant you an extension, since they’ll know you understand just how good of an opportunity it is. [1] X Research source “Thanks so much for the offer.” “I really appreciate the offer you sent.” “This offer is really wonderful; I’m so honored.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Inquire about the deadline for the offer.",
      "content": "Inquire about the deadline for the offer. Different jobs may have different hiring deadlines. If the hiring manager hasn’t given you a deadline already, ask them if there is one so you get a sense of the timeline. That way, they’ll know that you’re keeping their needs in mind as well. “Is there a specific deadline for this role?” “Are you trying to fill this position as soon as possible, or is there some wiggle room?” “What is the deadline for this offer?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Give a concrete reason for asking for more time.",
      "content": "Give a concrete reason for asking for more time. Hiring managers appreciate honesty, and they’re much more likely to give you extra time if you have a solid reason for it. Be as honest as you can, but don’t say you’re keeping your options open (since that can sound a little rude). “As you may know, I’m in contact with other companies, and am in the late stages of the interview process for a few other positions.” “Since this role would involve relocating to a new state, I need some time to think this over with my spouse.” “I’d like to fully consider the job role and the position before I accept the offer.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask for 2 to 3 days of extra time.",
      "content": "Ask for 2 to 3 days of extra time. In general, 48 to 72 hours is the sweet spot when asking for more time to consider a job offer. Any more, and you risk sounding like you’re hesitant or going to decline the job offer anyway. [2] X Research source Be sure to mull over everything during your allotted time, as asking for an extension on top of an extension is generally frowned upon. “I was wondering if you could give me until the end of the week to think things through.” “I’d love to think this over and get back to you by the end of the day on Wednesday.” “Can you give me until Monday to think this over?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask questions about the offer.",
      "content": "Ask questions about the offer. If you have any concerns that are holding you back from accepting the offer, now is the time to ask them. You can ask about the salary range and if it’s flexible at all. You might also inquire about the room for growth or why the last person in this position left. [3] X Research source “Is the salary range set in stone, or is it open to negotiation?” “Can I ask why the last person in this position decided to move on from the role?” “Does your company offer benefits?”"

    {
      "title": "Give yourself time to think over the position and the offer.",
      "content": "Give yourself time to think over the position and the offer. Getting a job offer is super exciting, but it’s important to give yourself a chance to step back and evaluate it . Sit with the idea of the job offer for a couple of days and decide whether it’s a good fit for you and your career path. [4] X Research source You might ask yourself questions like: “Is this the field I’d like to be in?” “Is there room for growth within this company?” “Will this job look good on my resumé?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Research the company and the position.",
      "content": "Research the company and the position. Not sure if you’d fit in with the company culture? Now’s your chance to look into it. Check out reviews of the company on sites like Glassdoor or Indeed , or reach out to past employees on LinkedIn. [5] X Research source If you aren’t sure whether or not you’re a good fit for the position, try looking up the position title on LinkedIn. Then, check out the people who have the same position title and see what their experience is like and if it aligns with yours."

    {
      "title": "Decide if you’re going to negotiate the salary at all.",
      "content": "Decide if you’re going to negotiate the salary at all. Most job offers come with a salary offer as well. As you think things over, be extra careful about the salary that’s been proposed. If you’re unhappy with it, try negotiating with the hiring manager before accepting the job. [6] X Research source It’s almost always a good idea to ask for a higher salary before accepting a job offer . The worst they can say is no!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Compare the offer against other job offers.",
      "content": "Compare the offer against other job offers. Are you in talks with other companies? Do you have other job offers on the table? If so, compare and contrast this offer with your others to see which one you like best. Take the salary, the position, and the location into account. [7] X Research source You might also compare the benefits offered and the commute time for each position. If you have other offers on the table and you have questions about them, reach out to those companies to get your questions answered. That way, you can make your final decision quickly."

    {
      "title": "See if there’s room for growth.",
      "content": "See if there’s room for growth. Getting a job right now is great, but having the opportunity to advance your career is even better. As you look into the company and the position, try to see if there’s any way you can get promoted or learn new things about your field. If you can’t tell at all, you can even ask the hiring manager. [8] X Research source “I’m very interested in this position, and even more interested in the opportunity for growth it might provide me. Do people generally get opportunities to move up in this company?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Take relocation into account.",
      "content": "Take relocation into account. If the job is in another state, think about how that might impact your living situation and your family. If you do have to relocate, you can even negotiate a relocation bonus into your starting salary. [9] X Research source If you aren’t relocating, take the commute into account instead. “Given the fact that I’d have to relocate for this job, would your company provide any sort of relocation fee?”"

      "content": "“Jason, Thank you for the offer! I’m delighted that my skills align with the role so well. While interviewing for this position, I was under the impression that I would not have to relocate, but the offer states that working in the office is required (which would require me to move to Colorado). Could you clarify? I’m happy to talk about this over the phone as well. Thanks, Brian”"

As you may know, I’ve been in contact with a few other companies in the field, and am in the late stages of interviews with them as well. Would you mind giving me until the end of the week to respond to this offer? Thanks so much, Ashley”"
