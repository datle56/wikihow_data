      "title": "Thaw frozen meat in the fridge for 24 hours.",
      "content": "Thaw frozen meat in the fridge for 24 hours. Keep the frozen foods chilled while they thaw so they do not develop harmful bacteria. Meat in the fridge is safe to use 1 to 2 days after it’s completely thawed or it can be refrozen if you end up not using it. Larger meats will require more time to thaw in the fridge. For example, a large frozen turkey should be thawed in the fridge for 24 hours for every 5 pounds (2.3 kg) it weighs. You can also thaw meat in a sink filled with cold water. Put the meat in a water-tight bag and fully submerge it in the sink. Change the water every 30 minutes as it starts to warm up. Meat thawed this way needs to be cooked immediately. Never thaw foods at room temperature or else harmful bacteria could form."

      "content": "Marinate meat for up to 12 hours for added flavor. Once the meat is thawed, put the marinade in a resealable plastic bag along with your meat and leave it in the fridge. Not only will it help tenderize your meat, but the meat will absorb the flavors and make your meat tastier. [1] X Research source Marinating for longer than 12 hours can make your meat too mushy or stringy once it’s time to cook it. Marinades can be made with balsamic vinegar , red wine, or any liquid with herbs and spices."

Cut with a chef’s knife where the fat meets the meat with a slow slicing motion. Tilt the knife towards the fat as you cut so you don’t remove portions of good meat. [3] X Research source Remove small strips at a time so you have the most control. Leave some fat on the meat. The fat will render as you cook it and make your meat more flavorful.

Sprinkle ¾ tsp (4 g) of salt and pepper per 1 lb (0.45 kg) and rub it in so the meat absorbs the flavor as it cooks.

Add the meat, then place the pan on the center rack of the oven and close the door. If you’re cooking a full chicken, find a pan with an attachable wire rack. Place the chicken on the wire rack so heat can evenly cook all sides of the bird and makes the skin crispy. [10] X Research source Avoid opening the door while the meat is cooking.
