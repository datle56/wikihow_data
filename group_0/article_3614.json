      "content": "Figure out your personal strengths as an actor. As you gain acting experience, your strengths will start to show themselves. Maybe you’re great at dramatic roles, but comedic acting is difficult for you. Continue to hone your dramatic chops, but put more time into getting better at comedy roles. Work on becoming as versatile as possible. [6] X Research source Keep in mind that Nickelodeon is a lighthearted channel, so most of the shows will call for comedic acting. Consider working on your singing abilities. Many Nickelodeon auditions will require you to sing an audition song, but it really just depends on the role you're going for."

      "title": "Hire an agent or manager from a reputable talent agency.",
      "content": "Hire an agent or manager from a reputable talent agency. Agents help you find and negotiate acting opportunities. They also have connections in the industry, and this can be helpful when you’re ready to audition for Nickelodeon. Research talent agencies with your parents to make sure they’re reputable. If an agent asks for payment upfront, do not work with that person. Agents should only take a percentage (usually 10%) of what the actor actually earns. [7] X Research source Make sure the agent is licensed and bonded before hiring them. [8] X Research source There are a lot of scams out there, especially with talent agencies and agents, so research thoroughly. Your agent doesn't have to be affiliated with any specific organizations, although connections to a legit organization like SAG-ATRA (Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) is definitely a bonus."

Your new agent will immediately ask you to get professional headshots, even if you already have some. This is standard practice and not a reason to suspect you’re being scammed. Ask the agent to suggest a company for you to work with, then set up the appointment. [9] X Research source At minimum, the headshot should accurately show your face and its features. If possible, work on getting a headshot that captures your essence and represents the kinds of roles you’d work well for. [10] X Research source"

List all the acting experience you have in your resume. Create a separate section to list any special skills you have, such as dancing, singing, sports, dialects, and so on. [11] X Research source Be sure to include personal and contact information, such as your name, date of birth, email address, and phone number. However, for safety reasons, do not put your home address on the resume. Don't hesitate to ask your agent or parents for help with your resume."

These allow you to get comfortable in front of the camera before auditioning for Nickelodeon. You’ll also get a sneak peek into the industry and learn how to interact with camera crews.

      "content": "Prepare for the specific role you’re auditioning for. In some cases, you may be given a script to study, but not always. Sometimes the casting directors might ask you to come in and perform a monologue. Choose a monologue from one of their past television shows and practice until you’ve perfected it. You don’t have to choose a monologue from a past Nick show. Feel free to change it up! Use classic or recent material that makes sense for the role you’re auditioning for.

Just work on being the best actor you can be. Stardom usually doesn’t happen overnight. Keep your eyes on the prize!

Have your agent work on getting you auditions with the Disney Channel, ABC Family, Cartoon Network, and other young-adult networks. Acting for any of these networks would be really cool. Plus, that experience will look great on your resume if you decide to audition for Nickelodeon again in the future."
