      "content": "Become familiar with your mask. Use the mask whenever it is necessary; this is only when there is an animatronic in your vent, or when there is an animatronic directly in front of you. As a rule of thumb, try to put your mask on immediately when you bring your camera down. On later nights, the time you have to put your mask on after taking your camera down becomes very short. [1] X Research source Your mask disables you from doing anything except moving your head, so you cannot open the monitor or flash your light; be aware of this. Don't waste time putting your mask on if any of the animatronics are in the hallway, or in the Vent Cams. However, if any animatronics are in your vents' blind spots, or if Toy Freddy is about to enter the Office from the Hallway, then put it on until they go away. Only Foxy can be disabled with the flashlight; the older animatronics require you putting on the mask as quickly as you can when they're in front of you. Failing to put your mask on quickly will make the older animatronics pop up to you, even if you are wearing the Freddy mask. Remember to put it on right away whenever you bring your camera down on later nights, without taking the time to check if an animatronic is present."

      "title": "Wind up the music box.",
      "content": "Wind up the music box. If you fail to keep winding up the music box, the Puppet will rise from their present box and kill you. Wind it all up, but don't check any other cameras! On later nights you only have time to wind it up partly before you have another problem. This becomes a great rules of thumb: you're wasting time if you try to wind it up all the way. If the Puppet gets out of the box, don't give up if you haven't died yet. If you wind the box quickly enough, the Puppet will stay in their room as long as the music keeps playing. However, once you hear \"Pop Goes the Weasel,\" you're dead, unless 6AM comes before they get into the Office. Sort of like FNAF 1 when you ran out of power. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Don't waste time on the cameras!",
      "content": "Don't waste time on the cameras! The only camera necessary to your survival is the prize corner, or Cam 11. Because it takes such a short time for animatronics to get on the move, especially from Night 3 onwards, keeping track of them is essentially pointless since you can only react to them when they're in your vents, face or, with Foxy, the hall."

      "content": "Watch out for Balloon Boy. Although he does not jumpscare , he will disable your flashlight and vent lights as soon as he gets into your office, which will most likely result in death by Foxy unless you're very near the end of the night. Put on your mask if you see him in the vents. [4] X Research source You can also hear him when he says \"Hello\"or laughs. If he gets in without you knowing it, the mask will not work on him, as he will stay inside your office until 6 AM arrives, or, most likely, you are killed."

      "content": "Listen for Mangle. Mangle lets out a a kind of garbled, staticky noise much like a police scanner when she's in your vents. If you hear this, put your mask on, unless you can see her on the camera. If you have your mask on, and you stop hearing her, than she's no longer in your vent. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Start a routine. First, open your monitor and set it to Cam 11. [6] X Research source Mute Phone Guy, you don't need him. Check your vents. Flash the Hall, since Foxy will most likely already be there. Quickly wind up the Music Box. Once you flip down the monitor, put on the mask immediately. This is also a great rule of thumb: once you flip down the monitor, flip down the mask, whether or not an animatronic is in your Office. You don't want to take a risk. Make it part of your muscle memory. If you hear BB, or Mangle, put on the mask. Flash the Hall. Wind up the Music Box. Flip up your mask. BB or Mangle, mask again. Flash the hallway. Wind up the Music Box. Flip your mask. BB or Mangle, mask. Flash. Wind, flip, vent, flash. Practice this until you get faster and more efficient. This routine is tried-and-true. Follow it, and you'll have no mishaps."

      "content": "If you fail to follow these steps properly, prepare for a jumpscare. Some animatronics have different jumpscares. Foxy jumps at you if you don't flash the flash light at him enough or if Balloon Boy disables your flashlight. Mangle swings from the ceiling to bite you. Bonnie reaches out for you. Chica, Freddy, and Toy Freddy pop up. Toy Chica, Toy Bonnie, and The Puppet jump at you. Balloon Boy does not have a jumpscare."
