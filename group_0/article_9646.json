To find the router's IP address : Windows Open Command Prompt. Type ipconfig and press Enter . Locate the entry for the adapter you're using to connect to the network. Make a note of the IP address next to \"Default Gateway\" (e.g., 192.168.1.1). Mac Click the Apple menu and select System Settings . Click Network in the left panel. Select your network connection. Click the Details button next to the network. Find the IP address next to \"Router\" (e.g., 192.168.1.1)."

For your Linksys WRT54G to function as an access point on your network, you will need to assign it a static IP address from the range assigned by your main router.

If you're unsure which IP addresses your router assigns to systems that connect to the network, log in to your main router's admin page and locate its DHCP settings . Choose a high-end available IP from the DHCP range. For example, if your main router's DHCP server starts assigning IP addresses at 192.168.1.100 and can assign a maximum of 100 IP addresses, 192.168.1.199 should be safe. Enter the default gateway IP address you found earlier into the Gateway field."

After a few moments, the WRT54G should connect to your main router and be assigned the static IP address you entered. After a few moments, any Wi-Fi capable device within its range should be able to connect to it using the same SSID and password used for your main router. If you need to make configuration changes to your Linksys WRT54G, you'll need to access it using the new IP address you've assigned it.
