I should just call you Google since you’re everything I’m looking for. I was so unproductive today. All I did was sit around and think of you. If being gorgeous was a crime, you’d be on the FBI’s most wanted list. Could you turn down your greatness? You’re blinding us mere mortals. I’m not a mathematician, but I’m pretty sure we’re the perfect equation. You’re like pizza…perfect in every way and impossible to get enough of.

      "content": "How can I come up with a personal compliment? Think about what you truly admire and appreciate about your girlfriend and be as specific as possible. “Honesty is the best policy” when it comes to giving compliments, and it “becomes disingenuous when you say something just to impress someone,” says dating coach Louie Felix. Here are the best tips to give your girlfriend a personal compliment: Start your compliment with an “I” statement: Using “I” statements, such as “I admire…” or “I appreciate…” gives your words more weight and makes your compliment seem more sincere. Give a compliment that matches her personality: If she’s lovey dovey, for example, you could say something deeply romantic and sentimental. If she’s more playful, you could deliver a witty or flirty compliment. Celebrate her skills, talents, and best traits: Think about her words and actions, and try to craft a meaningful compliment that goes beyond looks. If you need help, search positive adjectives online, and weave them into your compliment. Acknowledge the impact she’s made in your life: People love feeling like they’ve made a difference in the world, so bring up all the ways she has affected you. It could be as simple as making you smile on a bad day, or as deep as making you believe in love again."
