Acidic (low pH) cleaners can damage marble, slate, and granite, so make sure your cleaner doesn’t have any lemon juice, vinegar, or other acidic ingredients. [4] X Research source Instead, use a trusted brand like ZEP or Rejuvenate All Floors Cleaner . [5] X Research source Rejuvenate’s cleaner can be sprayed directly on the floor, while Zep’s cleaner needs to be diluted in a bucket. You can also use a diluted mixture of water and mild dish detergent to clean slate. Always clean marble flooring with a soft rag or mop, rather than a hard-bristle brush.
