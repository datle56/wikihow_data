Committing to a plan or strategy beforehand, particularly one that implements things that you learned from your last competition, will allow you to perform in a decisive and confident manner. In a swimming competition, for example, a swimmer's strategy might involve considering whether to go as fast as possible right after the dive, break out mid-race, or alternate between high and low speed."
