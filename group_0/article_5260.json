      "content": "Understand that it costs money to borrow money. If you're using a credit card or taking out a mortgage on a home, you may need to use more money than you currently have. If you're given credit, the lenders who give you that credit expect you to pay the premium back, in addition to a finance charge for the luxury of being given money. This finance charge is called APR."

Use this information as a guidepost when shopping for a mortgage. However, you should always use an online APR calculator to check your exact APR before signing on a loan. The directions to do so follow this graph. Note how,in most cases, the APR is almost identical to the interest rate, but changes depending on the amount of finance charges. This difference is why you must compare APR when shopping for a loan.

For example, if you take a $1,000 loan, and your APR is 10%, at the end of the year you'll owe $100 (10%) of your $1,000 premium. If you want to know the monthly periodic rate, just divide your APR by twelve, 10 % 12 = .83 % {\\displaystyle {\\frac {10\\%}{12}}=.83\\%} , to find out what your APR is for every month. You can also divide it by 365 to find you daily APR. Different banks will calculate APR over different times, [2] X Research source and this affects how much they charge you. Note how a yearly APR is higher than monthly or daily, but is ultimately cheaper: Monthly, Yearly, and Daily APR and the Effect on Total Cost for a $100,000 Loan Compound Type Interest Finance Charges APR Total Amount Paid Yearly 4.00% $5,000 8.1021% $110,412.17 Monthly 4.00% $5,000 7.8888% $110,512.24 Daily 4.00% $5,000 7.8704% $110,521.28"

This simply means that the interest rate you pay can be changed depending on your current debts or the bank's whims. As such, fixed are usually the safest bets, since you will always know what you're paying. [3] X Research source Fixed APRs remain constant for the life of the loan or the credit card. Variable APRs can fluctuate daily, leaving the debtor in the dark about how much interest she's paying. Be very careful with variable APR. [4] X Research source Tiered APRs depend on what tier the debt falls into, raising and lowering depending on your current debt. For example, your APR might be 4% for debts below $1,000, but raise to 7% if you cross $1,000. [5] X Research source For stability, choose a fixed APR. For potentially lower rates, consider a variable APR—just be prepared for fluctuations."

APR, or annual percentage rate, is the amount of money your bank charges you when it lends you money.

Finding out your APR is simple if you follow this formula: F i n a n c e C h a r g e s C u r r e n t B a l a n c e ∗ 12 m o n t h s ∗ 100 = A P R % {\\displaystyle {\\frac {FinanceCharges}{CurrentBalance}}*12months*100=APR\\%} You should end up with a decimal before multiplying by 100.
