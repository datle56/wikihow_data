      "title": "Follow the label’s directions.",
      "content": "Follow the label’s directions. Locate the label on your pants, usually in the middle back of the waistline, and read it carefully. A label that gives machine washing instructions will generally do well with a gentle wash and dry cycle. If the label states “Dry Clean Only” or “Not Washable,” then you may want to consider taking it to a dry cleaner or leather specialist. [1] X Research source If your pants do not have a label, or if you’ve cut it off, and you know the manufacturer, then you may be able to contact them directly for cleaning advice. Go to the manufacturer’s website and look for customer information or help contact information."

      "title": "Do a test spot.",
      "content": "Do a test spot. Before you expose your pants to any cleaning process, it is a good idea to apply a damp cloth to a small, less noticeable part of your pants. Then, wait to see if you notice any discoloration, fading, or wrinkling. This will let you know how well your pants will tolerate being wetted down via steaming or in a washing machine. [2] X Research source If your pants do wrinkle or stain in the test area, it would be a good idea to take them to a leather specialist for cleaning."

      "content": "Use the delicate cycle with cold water. Turn your pants inside out and place them directly into the washing machine. Add a small amount of color-safe liquid detergent and nothing else. Choose the “delicate” washing cycle and set the water temperature to cold. If you can choose the spin speed, set it to the slowest setting. For extra protection, place your pants into a garment bag and then toss this bag into the washing machine. The bag will help to minimize the wear on your garment from the washing machine’s agitations."

      "content": "Wipe them down with water. If you aren’t comfortable using the washing machine, then set your pants out on a towel. Get a damp microfiber cloth and gently run it over the surface of pants. It is best if you use warm, not hot, water. Resist the urge to scrub and keep your movements light. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Steam them.",
      "content": "Steam them. Get a clothing steam machine and adjust the setting to gentle. When the machine is ready, pass the wand lightly on top of the pants. It should make them damp, but not wet. Repeat until you see fewer signs of wear. This is another gentle alternative to using a washing machine. [4] X Research source A simple way to steam your pants, and other clothing items, is to hang them up in your shower, then run the water to warm. The water should not touch the clothes directly, but the steam will. This is an especially good way to remove strong odors, such as smoke. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Lay them out to dry.",
      "content": "Lay them out to dry. The safest way to keep your pants shape post-washing or steaming is to lay them down on a dry towel or to place them on a drying rack. The drying rack is the best option, as it allows the air to pull the moisture away from your garment. Some people suggest machine drying, but that can destroy certain types of leather pants."

      "content": "Clean only when necessary. It is not necessary to clean your pants after each time you wear them. Instead, go by the appearance of the pants and whether they appear dirty or in need of an odor adjustment. Cleaning your pants too often can change their shape and make them lose that supple leather feel."

Others, like salt, can be fairly easy to remove if you address them in a timely manner.

If you live in an area where salt is applied to the roads and sidewalks in colder weather, then you know how hard these stains can be to remove. To get salt stains off of your leather pants, start by dipping a cloth into a 50-50 water and vinegar mixture. Wring the cloth out and apply it to the areas with salt stains. If the salt is dried on the surface of your pants, brush it off with a soft-bristled toothbrush or a cloth."

These usually come in small spray bottles are available at most clothing stores. Just one pass with the spray will protect your pants, to a limited extent, for an entire season. [12] X Research source As with any product, test out your protectant on a small area of your pants before applying it all over."

      "content": "Apply a leather conditioner monthly. Lay your pants out on a towel. Take a bit of the conditioner into your hands, it will have a soapy feel, and gently rub it into the surface of your pants. Keep rubbing in small circles until the product is absorbed entirely. Repeat this process every month to keep your leather pants feeling soft and flexible. Make a homemade version of leather conditioner by mixing three parts of olive oil with two parts vinegar in a small bowl. [13] X Research source"

If they do, when you bring in your pants make sure to point out any stains or areas of concern. Also, if your pants have a matching top or other accessory, get those cleaned as well. [15] X Research source Some dry cleaners are considered leather specialists. This means that they follow practices that are less likely to damage your pants, but this extra level of service may result in a higher bill.
