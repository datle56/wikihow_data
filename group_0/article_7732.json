Move back and forth across the top of the wall, and slowly work your way down toward the floor. Stop and shake the brush or mop off outside when it looks dirty to remove the excess dust. [2] X Research source If you’re cleaning after fully remodeling the room, start by brushing the ceiling before the walls. Some people recommend spraying the drywall dust with water so it doesn’t get into the air while you’re brushing it, but the moisture could cause the dust to harden. Brushing also works if you have drywall dust on glass fixtures or window panes."

      "content": "Sweep up as much drywall dust as you can. Raymond Chiu, a house cleaning professional, says that “it is important to sweep and pick up the dust slowly [because]...being too aggressive will cause the dust to go everywhere in the room.” He recommends sweeping the dust into a pile and collecting it in a garbage bag to throw away immediately. [3] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 15 October 2019. Start from the edges of the room and work your way toward the center. Keep sweeping your floors until most of the dust is gone so you can clean up the residue more easily. Use a standard broom to reach dust in the corners of the wall, and switch to a soft push broom to sweep larger areas of the floor. [4] X Research source If you laid down a plastic drop cloth , slowly fold the edges toward the middle to trap the drywall dust inside. Throw the drop cloth out before sweeping the floor. If the dust kicks up into the air, try spreading a sweeping compound over your floor. The compound has a dust/sawdust-like consistency that holds the dust down so it’s easier to sweep up.

      "content": "Clean the walls and floors with a wet/dry vacuum . Raymond Chiu, a cleaning professional, recommends using “a [brush or crevice] attachment to get the hard-to-reach areas,” like corners, between floorboards, and on any other hard surfaces. Start at the top of your walls and work down toward the floor using light pressure. Then, vacuum the entire floor. [6] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 15 October 2019. According to Chiu, you should avoid using your standard household vacuum because “a small or weak vacuum will not be effective in getting the dust out and it will more likely damage the vacuum.” Check with local hardware stores to see if they offer vacuum rentals so you don’t have to buy one. Wet/dry vacuums have a HEPA filter inside to catch dust, but they may get clogged while you’re cleaning. Wash the filter or keep a spare on hand if your vacuum starts working poorly. If you have drywall dust on furniture, bedding, or other upholstery, vacuum it thoroughly. If possible, take the dust-covered items outside so they can air out. Shake out the fabric or point a fan at it to blow out any of the dust."

Run the cloth over the walls, baseboards, windows, and other surfaces one more time. [7] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 15 October 2019. When the cloth looks dirty or covered in dust, rinse it out with clean water so you don’t spread dust back over the surface. Change out the water as soon as it gets cloudy. Avoid using a soaked cloth because too much water could damage drywall and cause mold to grow. Alternatively, you may use a tack cloth that’s made for picking up dust and small particle residue. If you’re trying to clean drywall dust that has hardened or is stuck, apply additional force or use a damp sanding sponge ."

Lay a mat in front of the entrance to wipe off your shoes and reduce the amount of dust you track into another room. [10] X Research source If you’re doing work in your own home, keeping a change of clothes right outside your work area will prevent dust from spreading to other rooms.

To help drywall dust move outside, house cleaning professional Raymond Chiu recommends that you “open the windows to allow for ventilation.” [12] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 15 October 2019. Place box fans in the windows so they blow the air out of the room, and tape plastic sheeting around the fans and window frames to seal off the area. [13] X Research source If you’re able to, remove the window screens to allow the dust to move freely from inside to outside. If any of the windows have air conditioning units in them, remove them from the room because they get clogged with dust easily. Use the box fans on a low setting, which will cause the least air disturbance. Setting them on high will suck out a lot of the dust, but it will also increase the amount that’s moving through the air."
