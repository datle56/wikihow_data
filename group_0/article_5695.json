      "content": "Yes, TSA allows you to bring solid foods, but no liquids over 3.4 oz (100 mL). For example, you can bring a sandwich from home through the TSA line – it can even have mayonnaise on it, as long as it doesn't make the sandwich excessively soggy. [1] X Research source But if you want to bring an 8 oz (237 mL) jar of mayonnaise, you must pack it in your checked luggage. Otherwise, if it's in your carry-on, TSA will make you discard it. [2] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Transportation Security Administration U.S. government agency responsible for ensuring safety by setting and enforcing travel protocols Go to source It's ultimately up to each agent's discretion whether or not to allow a food item to pass through their checkpoint. If one of your food items raises their suspicions or triggers a security alarm for some reason, they have the authority to discard it – even if it's not on the restricted list and you packed it properly."

These items are considered medically necessary and aren't restricted by amount, meaning you can transport more than 3.4 oz (100 mL) of it in a single container. Anyone traveling with these items is encouraged to pack them in clear plastic bottles so they're easier for TSA agents to examine. [4] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Transportation Security Administration U.S. government agency responsible for ensuring safety by setting and enforcing travel protocols Go to source TSA also recommends letting the TSA agent know before they open your bag that you're carrying breast milk, baby formula, or baby juice to expedite the inspection process.

To make the process flow as quickly as possible, store your snacks, sandwiches, and other solid foods in separate, clear containers.

This rule has three requirements: each separate liquid, gel, aerosol, cream, or paste must not exceed 3.4 oz (100 mL); all the separate containers for these items must fit in a zip-top, quart-sized plastic bag; and each passenger is only allowed one quart-sized plastic bag each. [6] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Transportation Security Administration U.S. government agency responsible for ensuring safety by setting and enforcing travel protocols Go to source If you're packing liquid food to go with your solid food, separate those items, as well. For example, if you're taking a salad through TSA, store the salad dressing in a 3.4 oz (100 mL) (or smaller) container and put it in a quart-sized plastic bag in your carry-on to adhere to the 3-1-1 rule."
