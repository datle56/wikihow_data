It will cost you GTA$2.2 Million and will allow you to go to Cayo Perico. [2] X Research source Optional but recommended: You can buy the sparrow helicopter for GTA$1.8M. While not required for Cayo Perico, it will help massively with the setup missions and in general is a good vehicle for getting around the map, especially if you do not yet have an Oppressor MK2. Once the kosatka is brought, you can open your interaction menu, click \"service vehicles\" and then \"kosatka\" and then click \"request kosatka\". This will spawn the kosatka nearby."

This can be found under the compound under the water. You do not have to take a picture of it.

If you get the Merryweather mission, feel free to reset to get an easier one. In addition, you should buy the suppressors in case you need to kill any guards in the finale. [6] X Research source"

First, head straight, then take a left, go past the twin guards, make another left, then right, then wait for the armed guard to leave, then continue and after climbing the fence next to the tower building make a left and hug the wall. When a guard comes, hug the wall before the stair. Then, continue to the office. Take the keycard, open the vault and take the loot. Then, use the fingerprint cloner. A tip with this is to select the top part and then move it for every number before that row, so move row 3 2 times. Once this is done, enter the basement. When you are in the primary room, cut open the gate and either use the plasma cutter or the safe code, depending on your primary target. Afterwards, head out to the exit. Once you are out, kill the guard with the motorbike and take it. Go to the water and start swimming away, being careful to avoid the traps. After a few minutes, you will complete the heist and earn your reward. [11] X Research source"
