      "content": "A Virgo guy is unlikely to approach you first. This shouldn't be any problem for you, Aries, since you're bold and confident. You're not afraid to take a risk and put it all on the line, so it's pretty easy for you to just walk up to him and ask him out. [1] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021 If you already know each other, you might ask him to join you for a drink or dinner immediately. If it's the first time you've met, it's probably better to chat him up a little before asking him out. Virgos are typically pretty introverted, so he's likely to be a little shy or withdrawn at first. It might take a little effort to get him to open up, but then, as an Aries woman, you've always loved a challenge."

      "content": "Virgos love intelligent and informed women. Current events might seem like a minefield for early conversations, but important topics are really interesting for Virgos. Even better, he likes an opinionated woman—and as a fiery Aries, you certainly have no shortage of opinions! He likes to debate issues, so he won't necessarily take offense if you happen to disagree with him—just be prepared for him to question your reasoning. Your sign is ruled by Mars, the god of war, so of course, you enjoy some good verbal sparring."

      "content": "Virgos love to help out and feel needed. [2] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021 As an Aries woman, you're strong and independent. You probably don't think you need any help with anything—if there's something you don't know, you'd rather figure it out yourself than ask someone else. But the way to a Virgo guy's heart is to give him an opportunity to be of service. So if you have something you could use some help with (or just don't want to do yourself), ask him—he'll be excited and honored to come to your aid. It helps if you know at least a little about what he's good at before you ask for his help. If he's a computer tech, for example, you might ask him to fix a glitch with your computer. If you ask him to help you with something that he's not particularly skilled at, you're more likely to just make him feel bad. That's why you want to do your homework ahead of time and make sure what you're asking is in his wheelhouse.

[3] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021 He can even be a stickler for neatness, which can annoy many other signs. This shouldn't be a problem for you, though, since Aries women tend to keep their homes and workspaces fairly straight and clean. [4] X Research source This applies to your appearance as well. Virgo guys care a great deal about their partner's appearance and expect you to be neat, clean, and well-groomed at all times. Even though you can be more casual, Aries, this is an opportunity for you to show him he's worth the effort. Don't be offended if he redoes or \"corrects\" something you've cleaned or suggests a better method of organization. He's a perfectionist and focuses on details—he's just trying to help!"

But if you make the effort to be on time when meeting up with him, he'll see how important he is to you. If you have to, set a reminder a few minutes before you need to leave so you don't lose track of time. If you are going to be late, text him immediately and let him know what happened. Virgo guys can be pretty forgiving—as long as it doesn't become a regular habit."

      "content": "Both of you are highly committed to social causes. [5] X Research source As you're chatting, you're likely to land on some cause that both of you support. As an extroverted Aries woman, you're great at kickstarting things, which makes you the perfect person to find out where the two of you can volunteer to support the cause you care about. He'll be really excited when you mention that you've found a way for the two of you to help, and you'll work well side by side. Since he tends to be more introverted, you might look for opportunities that don't require a lot of outgoing social interaction from him. For example, the two of you might man a booth at a community fair—you could talk to visitors while he organized the pamphlets and took down people's contact information."

As an Aries woman, you're the athlete of the zodiac. Why not combine forces? Together, you can both crush your fitness goals. This partnership also works because you tend to be a leader while he prefers more of a support role. For example, he could create a diet and nutrition plan for you and you could motivate him to push through extra sets."

      "content": "A Virgo guy loves a woman who sticks by his side. This is one area where your relatively opposing signs come together. If you agree on nothing else, you agree that the two of you should be 100% loyal to each other, even when you don't necessarily see eye to eye. As an Aries woman, you tend to be a truly devoted partner—with every demonstration, he'll fall a little more in love with you. For example, if you're always on time when the two of you make plans, he'll understand that you respect him and value his time. He'll also understand how devoted you are to him."

      "content": "A cautious Virgo man wants to weigh all the pros and cons. His ruling planet, Mercury, is logical and analytical, which explains why he approaches all major decisions with caution. This can be frustrating for the Aries woman who tends to leap first and look later. But if you have patience, he will eventually come around. Patience is one of the biggest things your Virgo man can teach you, if you're willing to let him. [7] X Research source As bold and confident as Aries women are, you'll likely bring up relationship questions before he's even seriously considered them. It's fine to broach the topic—just don't hound him about it. Let him know how you feel and say something like, \"I know you have a lot to think about because you take our relationship so seriously, and I totally respect that. I just wanted to let you know how I feel.\" He'll really appreciate it that you understand his point of view."

The two of you typically work really well as a team—you like to get things started and take the lead, while he works behind the scenes fleshing out all the details. He's fine to follow your suggestions as long as he understands the reasons behind them. Always having some common goals will ensure a long-lived relationship. You can set goals to cover any aspect of your lives together, including planning a vacation, finding a house or apartment, creating an investment or retirement plan, or even adopting a pet. While these sorts of projects are important for your relationship, it's also not something you want to force. If you're just making up things that neither of you really needs, you'll both get frustrated and abandon the project, then you'll be right back where you started."
