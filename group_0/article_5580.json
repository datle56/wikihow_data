      "content": "Enter your country's exit code. In order to make an international call, you must first dial the exit code for your country. This code, also known as a dial-out code or international access code, lets the carrier know that you will be calling another country. In the United States, Canada, and parts of the Caribbean, for instance, the exit code is 011, while in Mexico, the code is 00.

      "content": "Dial 966 to connect to Saudi Arabia. After you dial the exit code for your country, you must then dial the prefix for the country you’re calling. Saudi Arabia's country code is 966. For example, if you’re in the U.S. and you want to call Saudi Arabia, you would dial 011 966."

      "title": "Add the city code, omitting the leading 0 if there is one.",
      "content": "Add the city code, omitting the leading 0 if there is one. Once you’ve dialed the country code, you have to enter the city code, which may also be called an area code or a zone code. If the person gave you a 9-digit phone number, the city code is the first 2 numbers, so you don’t need to do anything special to find it. Otherwise, you’ll need to know the city you’re calling in order to find the city code. [2] X Research source If you know the city you’re calling, you can find the city code by visiting this website, then scrolling down to click on “Saudi Arabia City Codes:” https://countrycode.org/saudiarabia . For instance, if you’re in the U.S. and the person you're calling is in Riyadh, you would dial 011 966 11."

      "content": "Finish with the 7-digit phone number of the party you're calling. After you’ve entered in all of the prefix information, you can dial the phone number you’re trying to call. This will either be a 7-digit number if you’re calling a landline, or an 8-digit number if you’re dialing a mobile number. For the call from the U.S. to Riyadh, this number would be 011 966 11 xxx-xxxx."

      "title": "Use a VoIP service to call using your computer.",
      "content": "Use a VoIP service to call using your computer. VoIP, which stands for Voice over Internet Protocol, works much the same way as a telephone, but it uses an internet connection instead of a phone line or cell service. To use a VoIP, you'll have to download the program offered by the service you choose, and the other party may need to install the same program. You'll also need a microphone and a speaker or headset, and some VoIP services require you to use a special phone that plugs into your computer. [3] X Research source The main advantage of VoIP is that you can make calls for free or for a low monthly fee. However, the call quality may not be as high as calling from a traditional phone. Also, there may be an additional charge if you use the service to call a cell phone or land line. Popular VoIP services include Vonage, Google Voice , and Skype."

      "content": "Download a digital calling app to make free calls from your phone. There are a number of different apps that you can use to make international calls from your tablet or phone. Ask your family, friends, and social media contacts to recommend their favorite, and play around with a few to find the features you like the most. These apps are generally free, although you may incur charges from data use if you don't have an unlimited plan or wi-fi. [4] X Research source If the other person needs to use the same app, make sure they know which one to install! Internet calling services were banned at one time in Saudi Arabia, but that ban was lifted in late 2017. However, you should keep in mind that phone calls made over the internet in Saudi Arabia may still be recorded and monitored, and some apps may not work properly. [5] X Research source Some popular calling apps include WhatsApp, Viber, and FaceTime."

      "content": "Use email or instant messaging for a quick and easy way to get in touch. Depending on where you live, it can sometimes be hard to get in touch with someone in Saudi Arabia, due to the differences in time zones and their Sunday-Thursday work week. If you're having trouble finding the time to meet up for a phone call, try sending them a message or an e-mail instead. That way, they'll be able to respond at their leisure."

      "content": "Keep the time zone in mind. Saudi Arabia goes by Arabia Standard Time, or +0300 UTC/GMT. Depending on where you live, this could mean a drastic difference in the time of day. Before you place a call, calculate what time it will be there; otherwise, you might accidentally call and wake someone up in the middle of the night! [6] X Research source AST is 8 hours ahead of U.S. Eastern Standard Time (EST) and 7 hours ahead of U.S. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), which lasts from April to October. For example if it's 11:00 a.m. EST in New York, it will be 7:00 p.m. the same day in Saudi Arabia."

      "content": "Observe the Saudi work week. In Saudi Arabia, the work week goes from Sunday through Thursday, as opposed to the Monday-Friday week used in much of the Western world. This is because many businesses are closed each week on Friday to observe the Muslim day of prayer. Avoid calling someone in Saudi Arabia on a Friday for either business or personal reasons. Of course, it's fine if the person specifically asks you to call."

They then re-open from 3:00 p.m. until about 6:00 p.m., or later in some cases. If you call between 12:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. AST and don’t reach your party, they may be available in the afternoon. If you're making a personal call, try calling between 12:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. AST, or after 6:00 p.m."
