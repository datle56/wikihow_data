      "content": "Learn the details about your base-period wages. Base-period wages cover the first four of the last five calendar quarters you have worked. These amounts earned will determine your maximum and weekly benefits. This period begins from the day you apply, not the date you became unemployed. Your base-period wage will determine your: [1] X Research source Weekly benefit allowance (WBA) Maximum benefit amount (MBA) You may qualify for an alternative base-period if you do not have enough funds in your standard base-period."

      "content": "Calculate your expected benefits. Once you have gathered your base-payments, you will use them to discover your weekly benefit allowance (WBA) and maximum benefit amount (MBA). You will mainly be using the pay quarter with the highest wages earned. Take the following steps to learn what your benefits will be: [2] X Research source Determine your WBA by finding the quarter with the highest wages earned. Divide the total wages earned in that quarter by 25, rounding to the nearest dollar. This will give you an approximation of your WBA. An example of a WBA would be $1,500/25, which is $60 for the WBA. Your MBA will be either 26 times your weekly benefit amount or half of your base-period wages, depending on which is the lower number. An example of a MBA would be finding 26*60=1560 and $4,000/2=2,000. Since $1,560 is lower, this is your MBA. Your claim is only valid for one year. If you have qualified before, you must earn at least six times more than your new WBA."
