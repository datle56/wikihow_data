      "title": "Train optimism in yourself.",
      "content": "Train optimism in yourself. By learning to be optimistic, the extra effort you need to put in to become a hard worker will become less severe. Optimists see negative occurrences as short lived and narrowly focused events. Adopt the explanatory style of the optimist to help yourself view both good and bad events in a more optimistic light. Describe negative events, like a difficult presentation, in its positive light. For example, instead of complaining about responsibility, you could celebrate it as a chance to show your dedication and work ethic to your boss. Describe positive things in your life as permanent and everyday. This will help you feel encouraged as you try to step up your game at work. Optimists have also been found to score more highly on tests designed to gauge luck and self-perception. [1] X Research source The higher your self-perception, the more likely you'll be able to shore up weak points in your life."

      "content": "Identify and oppose irrational thoughts. Notice when you see only the worst possible outcomes (catastrophizing), minimize your own good attributes and contributions, or any \"all or nothing\" thinking. [2] X Research source Small successes are no less of a success, and you should allow yourself to feel pride at your accomplishment."

      "title": "Re-frame problems as lessons.",
      "content": "Re-frame problems as lessons. Positive re-framing will reinforce the positive aspects of your situation and prevent you from feeling overwhelmed. [3] X Research source This will also encourage you to approach the situation with a more open minded perspective. Open mindedness will facilitate problem solving, and a sense of having your work situation in hand will contribute to peace of mind, making your work easier in the long run."

      "title": "Don't multi-task.",
      "content": "Don't multi-task. Much research has recently shown that no matter how good of a multi-tasker you think you are, there are some serious downsides to performing many tasks at once. [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Multi-tasking impairs your overall performance, so that even if you feel like you are accomplishing a lot, you really might be missing out on important information and cues. Constantly being distracted with many tasks can leave the problem solving and creative parts of your brain unable to function optimally."

    {
      "title": "Try not to complain.",
      "content": "Try not to complain. Complaining is a natural part of the human condition, and it's unlikely you'll be able to remove this completely from your life. Be that as it may, complaining without a goal or solution in mind can lead to negative cycles that contribute to depression, poor self opinion, and stress. [5] X Research source These will only make it harder for you to put in the time and effort required to become a better, more industrious worker."

      "title": "Raise your social awareness.",
      "content": "Raise your social awareness. By intentionally reaching out and trying to connect with people that you work with, you will further develop your empathy. Empathy is a key component of conflict resolution, collaboration, compromise, effective listening, and decision making. [6] X Research source Raising your social awareness and developing your empathy will allow you to work even harder with your coworkers, and hold you more accountable to your goals. Research supports that what scientists call \"willed empathy,\" or the imagining of the pain of others, activates the pain response in your brain similar to naturally occurring empathy.

Admit the limits of your understanding and ask questions to create conditions where you can feel, and practice, empathy."

      "content": "Put in overtime when appropriate. Even if there is something that you would much rather be doing, during busy times you can practice your diligence and show your coworkers your commitment by putting in when necessary. Gauge how busy your place of employment by checking in with a manager and asking how other projects are going. Be careful not to overdo it. Working too hard can have serious health side effects.

      "content": "Culture accountability. It's impossible for you to address issues if you are unwilling to face them. It can be difficult to take responsibility for your actions, but complete and timely resolution of conflict is impossible if you don't honestly deal with the root of the problem. Avoid justifications and unnecessary explanations. These are, generally speaking, a waste of time, as there are always additional factors you could list to explain your actions.

      "content": "Maximize potential and improve weaknesses. Avoid minimizing your successes, no matter how minor, and identify areas in which you would like to improve. Further improve your strengths by joining seminars, classes, and take on roles in the community that utilize your abilities. Weaknesses can be addressed by interrupting negative thought patterns by doing something else, like taking a walk, admitting your humanity and the impossibility of true perfection, and by finding a mentor to provide guidance and support. Make specific changes to help yourself be accountable. You might ask your manager to speak about performance related issues privately in the event you are shy."

      "title": "Take the initiative.",
      "content": "Take the initiative. Jumping on an opportunity when it arrives takes self confidence, and you can build this in yourself by starting with small goals and working your way up to a more major responsibility. [10] X Research source Before you make a suggestion, pause and think if the idea can be implemented effectively. It's easy to be defensive over your own idea, but weeding out implausible suggestions might leave you feeling less self-conscious."

      "content": "Build a healthy support system. Human beings are social creatures. No matter how much of a loner you believe yourself to be, a healthy support system will improve efficiency at work, the keeping of resolutions, and diminish the feeling of being overwhelmed. [11] X Research source Use your support system for recommendations when trying for a new position or if you are asking for a promotion. Collaborate with your coworkers. You never know when you might need their help. Try not to compete. This can be difficult, especially since many managers use competition to encourage performance, but constantly comparing yourself to other workers can leave you feeling dissatisfied or inadequate.

      "content": "Practice positive self-talk. Coach yourself by using phrases that resonate with you. Self-talk should positively affirm your accomplishments and the achievement of your personal best. Use present tense messages when practicing self talk to remove future worry with positive assertions. Talk yourself through fears by asking yourself what the source may be and how you intend on correcting it."
