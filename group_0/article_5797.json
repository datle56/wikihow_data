      "content": "An apology goes a long way when canceling plans. If you don’t want to go into heavy detail about why you’re canceling, you can just tell your date that something came up. Then, ask them to reschedule so they know you’d still like to go out on that date. Usually, they won’t be too offended, and you two can reconnect on a different day. [1] X Research source You could also try something like, “I just remembered I have a prior engagement. Would sometime next week work for you?” You don’t have to be too self-deprecating—saying things like “I’m the worst, I know,” can be a little off-putting, and might make the other person feel bad. Keep it short and sweet to move on quickly without making it a big deal."

      "content": "If you’re canceling the day of, apologize for the inconvenience. Your date might be (understandably) a little hurt or annoyed. Make sure they know that you still want to see them by rescheduling the date, and try to meet up with them as soon as possible. [2] X Research source You might also say something like, “Really sorry for the late text, but I’m gonna have to reschedule.

      "content": "Get specific about why, exactly, you’re cancelling. If something came up that you just can’t get out of, it’s a good enough excuse to cancel your plans. Plus, having a valid excuse means you won’t hurt their feelings. [3] X Research source It’s not a great idea to tell a lie to cancel a date, but you can fib if you have to. Something like, “My kid got sick at school,” or, “My pet needs to go to the vet” are good excuses to use if you really want to reschedule."

If you really aren’t sure when you’re going to be available next, just tell your date that something’s come up, and you can’t make it to your date. They might be a little bit bummed out, but hopefully, they’ll understand where you’re coming from. [5] X Research source With a message like this, your date might offer to come pick you up instead. If you really don’t want to go on the date, you could say something like, “I have to take care of this today, so I’m not gonna be free to meet up at all. Sorry!” You might even follow up with something like, “Since my car is in the shop, I’m not sure when I’ll be able to reschedule. Can I text you next week when my car is fixed?”"

If you have to take care of something in your personal life, just tell your date that you need to cancel. They might feel a little sad that you don’t want to go out with them, but they should hopefully be understanding. [6] X Research source You could also say something like, “I’m dealing with some family problems that are stressing me out, so I’m probably not the most fun person to hang out with right now.” If you and your date are close, you could open up to them about what’s going on.
