      "content": "Cancer and Scorpio are one of the zodiac's strongest matches. These fellow water signs will form an instant connection to one another, with Cancer attracted to Scorpio's mysterious charm and Scorpio drawn to Cancer's nurturing personality. While they have some minor differences, overall, Scorpio and Cancer have so much in common that it'll feel like this romance was written in the stars! [1] X Research source Cancer and Scorpio form a trine aspect in astrology—the strongest positive aspect a pair can have. It means that they're 120 degrees apart on the zodiac wheel and harmonize well with each other. Cancer is looking for \"the one,\" a partner they can settle down with. Scorpios are loyal and have an \"all or nothing\" approach to relationships that Cancer will appreciate."

      "content": "These signs have high emotional compatibility. They're both water signs, so Scorpio and Cancer are extremely empathetic, sensitive, and intuitive.

      "title": "Cancer expresses their emotions more freely than Scorpio.",
      "content": "Cancer expresses their emotions more freely than Scorpio. Cancer lives and breathes emotion and is less likely to hold back when they think something needs to be said. On the other hand, Scorpio is secretive, so they tend to bury their emotions or even dismiss them. To stay on the same page, these signs may need to find a middle ground between their very different styles. Scorpio should work on being more open, giving Cancer the emotional vulnerability they want from a partner—and Cancer should give Scorpio the breathing room they need to comfortably open up."

      "title": "Scorpio may be a little too intense for Cancer at times.",
      "content": "Scorpio may be a little too intense for Cancer at times. Overall, Scorpios are more likely to be kinky or sexually adventurous than gentle Cancers, which could be more than Cancer is prepared for. However, this problem shouldn't stop either sign for long. Once they build up enough trust in one another, Scorpio will be able to ease up and let Cancer see their softer side, while Cancer will feel more comfortable indulging Scorpio's rougher urges. Scorpio and Cancer can raise their level of intimacy by having an honest talk about their preferences. In the bedroom, they can build trust as they progress slowly from tamer fantasies to more adventurous ones."

      "title": "Their modalities may cause friction from time to time.",
      "content": "Their modalities may cause friction from time to time. The 3 modalities in astrology are cardinal, fixed, and mutable, each representing a different pattern of behavior. Scorpio is a fixed sign, meaning they're more stubborn and slow to move on when something upsets them. Cancer is a cardinal sign, making them fast-paced leaders who can quickly process hurt feelings and look for solutions. Cancer may struggle to understand Scorpio's stubbornness, but their patience and empathy can help this couple push through lapses in communication."

      "content": "Overall, these signs will find it easy to trust each other. Scorpio can become jealous and possessive at the drop of a hat if they doubt their partner even a little. Cancer is the perfect match because the tender and earnest Cancer has no reason to stir up Scorpio's doubts. They're one of the most loyal signs and so empathetic that they'd never hurt Scorpio's feelings."

      "title": "Cancer may be frustrated by Scorpio's reluctance to openly trust.",
      "content": "Cancer may be frustrated by Scorpio's reluctance to openly trust. Scorpio is often paranoid and has a hard time relying on anyone until they have proven themselves totally trustworthy. Fortunately, Cancer is one of the few zodiac signs naturally equipped to break through Scorpio's carefully-drawn veil of mystery and can make Scorpio feel at ease enough to be transparent and honest . Cancer can further win Scorpio's trust by being reliable, accountable, and direct. This will allow Scorpio to relax and enjoy the relationship. Reader Poll: We asked 636 wikiHow readers who are Scorpios, and 67% of them said that their biggest dealbreaker in a relationship is lying. [Take Poll] So for a Cancer to finally break down Scorpio's walls, they should also avoid lying at all costs."

      "title": "These signs may need to be more supportive of one another.",
      "content": "These signs may need to be more supportive of one another. They both feel things so intensely that they can get caught up in their own emotions and don't pay enough attention to their partner's. To fix this problem, both signs should focus on being more direct and upfront with their partner when something is bothering them. Cancer can coach Scorpio on emotional vulnerability, and Scorpio can make Cancer feel safe enough to open up in return. Both signs tend to get moody and pessimistic at times. If they make an effort to look on the bright side and focus on things to be grateful for (like each other), they can raise their partner's spirits no matter what!"
