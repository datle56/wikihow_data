      "title": "Be a good listener.",
      "content": "Be a good listener . Support your girlfriend by listening to what she has to say. Avoid interrupting her or cutting her off when she speaks. Instead, make eye contact with her when she talks and nod your head to show her you are listening. Give her your full attention so she knows you care about what she has to say. [1] X Research source Avoid looking at your phone or your computer while she speaks, as this will just show her you are not listening. Try not to speak too much when she speaks or feel like you need to come up with a solution to her issue. Men have a tendency to want to fix things. Instead, simply pay attention to her when she speaks. Sometimes, listening is really what she wants you to do. Let her know you are listening by telling her, “I hear what you are saying” or “What I think you are saying is..”"

      "content": "Show an interest in her interests. Let your girlfriend know you want to know about her likes and dislikes as well as what she likes to do for fun. Ask questions about her day and her interests to show her you want to get to know her as a person and connect on a deeper level. [2] X Research source For example, you may ask her, “What television shows are you into lately?” or “How was your workout this morning?” You may also ask follow up questions if you know she is interested in certain things, such as books, movies, sports, or art. For example, you may ask, “How was that book you were reading?” or “Did soccer practice go well?” You can also invite her to participate in your interests. If you like rock climbing, for example, offer to take her to a beginner's climbing wall sometime and teach her. This lets her see part of your world, and helps establish common ground."

      "content": "Compliment her and thank her. Let your girlfriend know you appreciate her by expressing your gratitude and appreciation. A compliment as simple as “You look beautiful” or “I like your new haircut” can make your girlfriend feel needed and desired by you. When she does something thoughtful for you, give her your thanks. [5] X Research source You can also compliment her on a deeper level to let her know you appreciate her. For example, you may say, “I appreciate all that you do for me, thank you” or “I’m so glad I found you.” Make your compliments specific. If she makes your favorite meal just to surprise you, for example, tell her, \"I really appreciate that you know how much this meal means to me, and it is so meaningful that you went out of your way to do this. You made me feel so special.\""

      "content": "Support her when she is going through a hard time. If you know your girlfriend is struggling with something in her life, such as school, her job, her friends, or her family, be an emotional support for her. You can do this by asking her how she’s doing and by paying extra attention to her needs. You can also let her know you are there if she wants to talk about her struggles. [6] X Research source For example, if you know she is having a hard time with school, you may offer to tutor her after class. Or you may work on homework with her so she can get it done and succeed in her classes. If your girlfriend appreciates physical affection, try giving her a warm hug to show your support. Reader Poll: We asked 502 wikiHow readers how they want their partner to comfort them when they’re feeling down, and 56% of them agreed that the best gesture is a sweet hug or tender touch.

      "title": "Avoid the urge to yell or shout.",
      "content": "Avoid the urge to yell or shout. Yelling, shouting, and raising your voice at your girlfriend will only lead to a dramatic fight. It will likely make the situation worse and make your girlfriend more angry or upset. When you feel the urge to yell or shout, try taking a deep breath so you can calm down. Remember that lashing out at your girlfriend will not help to resolve the argument or make the situation better. Avoid name calling and criticizing, too."

      "title": "Try to discuss the issue rationally and honestly.",
      "content": "Try to discuss the issue rationally and honestly. Use an even tone of voice and try to approach the conflict or argument in a rational way. Encourage your girlfriend to share her point of view and express why she is upset. Be open to her honesty and her perspective. For example, you may say to her, “I’m struggling to understand your perspective. Please explain it to me” or “I’m not sure what I did wrong. Can you explain it to me?”"

      "title": "Be upfront about your feelings.",
      "content": "Be upfront about your feelings. It is important that you not be afraid to express how you are feeling to your girlfriend, especially during an argument. Try not to shut down or close off from her. Instead, be honest about your emotions. For example, you may say, “To be honest, I’ve been feeling pretty down this past week and that’s why I haven’t been as attentive to your needs.” Or you may say, “Honestly, I’ve been feeling overwhelmed at school so that might be why I haven’t been as emotionally present for you.” Men sometimes have difficulty naming their emotions. Let her know if you are feeling something that you can't quite name or express and try to explain what you're feeling as best as possible."

      "title": "Admit when you are wrong and apologize.",
      "content": "Admit when you are wrong and apologize. If you have done something to hurt your girlfriend or make her upset, swallow your pride and apologize for your actions. Admitting when you are wrong does not mean you are being weak or less of a man. In fact, being willing to admit your mistakes shows that you are able to be self-reflective and self-aware. It also lets your girlfriend know you are willing to take accountability for your actions. For example, you may say to your girlfriend, “After our discussion, I realize I was wrong to have not called you. I’m sorry I did that to you.” Or you may say, “Now that we’ve talked, I get why you are upset at me. I’m sorry for what I did.”"

      "title": "Work with your girlfriend to resolve the issue.",
      "content": "Work with your girlfriend to resolve the issue. Talk with your girlfriend about how you can resolve the issue or problem you are fighting about. Rather than ask her what to do, come up with your own possible solutions. Maybe the solution is an apology from you or a compromise where you both get half of what you want. Work together as a team to come to a resolution. For example, you may agree to change your behavior as a solution to the issue. You may say, “I will work on being on time for our dates from now on” or “I promise that I won’t forget to call you back.” You can also both agree to compromise to resolve the conflict. For example, you may both agree to be more honest with each other about any problems you are having at home or at school in the future."

[7] X Research source Part of being committed to your girlfriend is also trusting her and not being too protective or overbearing. Try not to control her life or her decisions.
