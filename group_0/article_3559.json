      "content": "Consider your career goals. The Judge Advocate General (JAG) corps of the five military branches is as competitive and demanding as any military career. Along with completing the educational and licensing requirements of the legal profession, you must also be able to meet the same standards as any prospective officer. Applicants must be a citizen of the United States. JAG candidates must be able to pass a security clearance. The security clearance procedure will investigate your allegiance to the United States, any ties with foreign governments, criminal history, substance abuse issues, finances, and general psychological health. The government investigators use a series of guidelines and you will be given an opportunity to explain the findings. For example, if your credit history is very poor, you can show that the debts were unavoidable and you are in a repayment plan. If you are interested in becoming a JAG attorney, you must start your studies so that you will be licensed to practice law and ready for entry into active duty before you are the age of 42 years. The age limit is 40 for the Air Force. You must be able to meet all the physical fitness requirements for your chosen branch of the military. [1] X Research source"
