      "content": "Create an account called \"Customer Deposits\" or \"Prepaid Sales\" in your accounting journal. While a customer deposit sounds like straight income to you, it is in fact a liability to the business because you \"owe\" the customer something. This is why you need to create a special account. Think of an account as like a line item on your personal budget. Check to make sure that this \"Customer Deposits\" account has not already been created under another name."

      "title": "Determine which accounts to debit or credit.",
      "content": "Determine which accounts to debit or credit. All financial transactions must be entered in the company's general financial ledger. Each transaction is listed as a debit or credit and for every debit there must be a credit. Debits increase expenses, assets (such as cash or furniture) and dividend accounts. Credits decrease these accounts. An easy way to remember this is D-E-A-D (Debits-Expenses-Assets-Dividends). For example, if you are paying a utility bill you would debit accounts payable and credit cash."
