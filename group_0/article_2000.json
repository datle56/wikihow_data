This will ensure that you are quick to find out about the latest 'gigs' in time to buy tickets. Not all shows are advertised on the radio or paper. Some ticket and tour sites allow you to sign up for cell updates whenever your favorite artists add new dates in your area."

      "content": "Look for the ticket release dates. When you hear about a concert you're interested in, check ticket availability. Many popular concerts may sell out before you get a chance to buy your tickets. Don't assume it is sold out until you are told so by the venue Talk to people with similar music interests as you. They are likely to know about upcoming shows. Venues often release \"hold\" tickets a day or two before the show. These are tickets the band or promoter has \"held back\" and must be offered for sale if not used. Keep checking back. Bands that are growing in popularity may still be playing smaller venues. Although this is a great time to see them you should plan on getting your tickets early as possible."

      "title": "Encourage friends to come along.",
      "content": "Encourage friends to come along. This will increase your safety and make for an altogether more enjoyable experience. Start asking around when you hear about the show. Coordinate who will buy the tickets since buying them individually will mean you sit apart. (Unless it is a general admission show.) Keep in contact with your friends after you've decided to go. Make sure no one changes their minds or makes other plans and you buy a ticket for them."

      "title": "Book your tickets from a reliable company.",
      "content": "Book your tickets from a reliable company. Either go through the venue website, the band website, an authorized ticket website or authorized ticket site, such as the box office. Compare prices between websites to confirm you are getting your tickets at a reasonable price. Booking online or in person will offer you the same chance for good tickets. Spending the night outside the venue no longer offers the opportunities for good seats, unless general admission for this venue means standing room close to the stage. In this case, the earlier you get to the venue the higher the likelihood that you will be front and center. Find out the date and time tickets go on sale and try to book at that time. Online sites may offer bad seats for your first search. Unless the show is a guaranteed sell out you can usually refresh the search a few times and find better tickets. If your under 18, have a parent or adult guardian purchase the tickets for you, this doesn't have to mean they spend their money, you can pay them back. Buying smaller numbers of tickets will usually result in better seats. Trying to buy 10 tickets at once will probably have nosebleed seats. Purchases online require a credit card. Box office purchases can usually use cash or credit."

      "content": "Select the method of delivery that works best for your timetable and situation. You can avoid some fees by getting an e-ticket that you can print. These are easy to duplicate and since you don't know if it's valid until it is scanned people may shy away from buying your ticket should you need to sell . Most venues offer \"Will Call\" service. This is when you buy your ticket and have it waiting for you at the venue for pick up. Will Call will require you show a driver's license and the credit card used to buy the tickets. Most require the names match on the credit card, the driver's license and the name the tickets are being held. You should avoid waiting until the day of the show to pick up your will call tickets. Lines will be long and you won't have time to correct a mistake (such as your tickets not being there but your card was charged). Picking up your tickets from Will Call ahead of time also gives you an option should an emergency happen and you must sell your tickets on short notice. Since the buyer can't pick up your tickets from will call. The Will Call window is usually open during the box office's regular business hours and extended hours the day of the show. Smaller venues may have later hours and not offer Will Call service. Call and ask before you assume."

The venue can tell you if this is expected for the show you are attending. These festivities can start in the morning and go until show time.

Usually, the larger the group the better, and this cuts down on parking fees, gas, etc. Arrange a neutral meeting place, perhaps someone's house with adequate parking and centrally located. Determine a mutually agreeable time to meet for the carpool. Habitually late friends should be told an earlier time. Larger cities offer mass transit to the venue. Leave early enough to avoid the rush just before show time."

      "content": "Dress appropriately for the weather but assume the interior of the venue will become quite warm. Dress in layers and consider a light jacket if it's cold. If you are attending at an outdoor venue then consider the weather in advance. The chances are that you will be standing around for a great deal of time waiting for something to happen. Avoid wearing high heels or sandals. These will feel very uncomfortable as you are standing up for most of the day. High heels will give you a risk you having a twisted ankle. Sandals won't give you a broken ankle but you will still feel uncomfortable or have your toes trodden on. Trainers or sneakers are the best to wear for the concert. If you bring a jumper or coat these should be stored in the cloakroom facility as it is too hot to wear. If you are female, try not to wear anything that might get sexual attention if you don't want it, it's honestly not your fault if you do, just an extremely handy tip. Avoid wearing too much makeup. This won't look great if you are crying or sweating. Sometimes the place of concert can get very hot. If possible don't wear it at all. If you don't feel comfortable without it, then just wear waterproof products and use a little bit. Not all venues have coat checks and the ones that do may be very busy before an after the show. It's best you bring something manageable."

Some bands and venues also have attendees patted down or frisked for weapons or prohibited items. They will have women pat down women and men for checking other men. Listen to instructions on the way in and the process should only take a few seconds. Hide your camera if you forgot to leave it in the car. Try to carry a bag that is easy to manage while at the show. The less you carry, the better. Bags should be worn over your head or easily fit between feet on the floor. The best bags close completely to avoid being picked as you walk through the crowd."

Apologize, put your camera away and don't let them see it again. Most security or staff would prefer to warn you than throw you out but don't push your luck by ignoring the warning. Video is usually more frowned upon than pictures and bring about swifter actions by the staff. Photos taken with camera phones are still photos. They may confiscate your phone. If you are able to get it back that night, it may be damaged, missing the sim card, in a box with 20 other phones that look just like yours and not available until an hour or more after the show."
