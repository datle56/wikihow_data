      "content": "Know the basic terminology. One of the first things any boy should learn is the difference between \"breakdancing\" and \"Bboying\". Bboying is the first term made to describe the dance; it's usually the term used when in the community. The term \"breakdancing\" was invented by the mainstream media in the 1980s to market the dance. Recently, serious performers have tried to reclaim the name \"Bboying\" for their performance. The dance is called B-boying whether the performer is male or female. But when describing a certain individual, there's Bboy (male breaker) and B-girl (female breaker). All breakers have a nickname, such as Bboy Darkness, Bboy Cloud, etc. At first, this shouldn't be too important, but it is in the long run when you want to gain a better hold of who you are as a dancer and gain recognition in your community."

The arm movements are really up to you, so groove to the music and let your body express itself. Practice in a mirror to check that you are not flailing your arms too much."

Put down a cushion of some sort such as a mattress to practice the suicide move and stand with your feet about two feet apart and your arms out in a T-shape straight out from your shoulders. Kick your right leg out in front of you then swing it back, simultaneously jumping forward with your left leg. Tuck your body in tight and essentially perform a front flip. Land on the middle part of your back and proceed to move into your groundwork. This move is often performed at the end of a sequence as well."

Straighten out your legs behind you and hold your body weight with your left forearm. Raise your left leg up and bend your knee. Kick up your right leg, simultaneously swinging your left leg under your right leg. As you complete this move, push off the ground with your hands and roll over your left shoulder onto your upper back. Make sure your chin is tucked in toward your collar bone during this step to avoid injury. Return to your home position with your arms on the ground supporting your legs in the air. Now your hands will be on the right side of your body. Now complete the push off and leg swing on the other side of your body, swinging your left leg under your right and rolling over your right shoulder onto your upper back. Continue this transfer of momentum from left to right using your entire body, and you've completed a windmill power move!"

Once you're able to perform these tasks, you're ready to try a headspin move. Put on a beanie or a bandana to aid your spinning motion. Cross your legs and alternate swinging them in a circular motion keeping your upper body in one place to get the feel of the movement. Keep your hands on the ground when just beginning to learn this move. When you're comfortable with that, begin to let your hands lift off the ground as your legs uncross to allow yourself to spin slowly. Be ready to return your hands to the ground and catch yourself if you need to. The wider you spread your legs, the more momentum you will gain, causing you to spin faster. Concentrate on keeping your back straight and your neck safe. If you start to feel neck pain, take a break immediately."

Balance your body on your two bent arms, with your elbows hugged in at your hips and your feet flared out behind you. Then try to release one hand and spin on the other, using the free hand to aid you in your spinning. Once you can spin without difficulty, you can move on to the hop. Place both hands back down on the ground and incorporate small hops into your spin motion. You will now be rotating in a circle as you balance on two hands and hop slightly. Now take one hand off of the ground and push with it as you spin yourself with the other. Shift all of your weight over to the balancing hand and place your pushing hand behind your back. Bounce on one hand while spinning and you've completed the jack hammer! The jackhammer is an extremely hard move that takes a lot of strength, so don't be discouraged if this move takes months to get down."

Lift your right leg and rest your right ankle on top of your left knee, like you would to cross your legs in a chair."
