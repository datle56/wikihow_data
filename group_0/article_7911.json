Use the edges of the alcohol wipe to clean in and around this section to remove as much grime as possible. [2] X Research source If you don't have a clean alcohol wipe or want a little bit more control when cleaning harder to reach spots, dip a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol and gently scrub the area. If you’re still noticing green residue, try picking it out with the end of a toothpick."

      "content": "Soak your glasses in warm soapy water to remove any leftover grime. Fill your sink or a small bowl with warm water and stir in a few drops of lotion-free hand soap. Leave your glasses to soak for 10 to 15 minutes to help lift out any remaining dirt or grease. [3] X Research source For really stubborn grime, you may be able to soak your glasses overnight, though this long exposure to water and shifting temperatures could damage your glasses. Soaking your glasses in soapy water is also a great way to clean the lenses and frames ."

      "content": "Dry your glasses thoroughly with a microfiber cloth . Use a clean, soft cloth to dry your glasses all over, being careful not to smudge the lenses. Make sure to dry every nook and cranny of your glasses to prevent water from getting trapped around the lenses. [4] X Research source David Felsted, a comprehensive ophthalmologist, says to avoid using a shirt or other fabric to dry your classes because you could scratch off any special coatings that are on your glasses. Alternatively, you can wait for your glasses to air dry. This will prevent any streaks on the lenses from cloth-drying but will take much longer if you're in a rush."

Look for a small screw holding each nose pad in place and carefully unscrew them with a glasses screwdriver . [5] X Research source Set the small screws in a bowl or dish so you don’t lose them while you’re cleaning. If you can’t find a way to detach your nose pads, it’s okay to leave them on while you’re cleaning. Just be extra careful around the lenses and frames so you don’t damage them by accident."

This will give you glasses a thorough clean and remove any green gunk without having to use a stronger solution such as rubbing alcohol. [6] X Research source Hand soap and warm water works well for nose pads made from any material. If you don’t have any hand soap, dish soap makes a good replacement."

Dip your toothbrush or cotton swab in the paste and scrub the nose pads a little more.

Ask at your local eye specialist or check online to find some nose pads that exactly match your current ones. They may come individually, or as part of a complete nose pad repair kit. [12] X Research source Find the size of a nose pad by measuring along the longest part of one pad. The sizes are generally listed in millimeters. Replacement nose pad kits will come with all of the tools you need, including a screwdriver, new screws, a magnifying glass, and replacement nose pads.

Use a small, flathead screwdriver to pry the old nose pads out of place, and they should easily pop out. [14] X Research source The same screws can be used to attach the new nose pads, but make sure they are intact and functional before doing so. Check the threading and the head for any signs of damage, and get replacements if the old ones look worn."

Be careful not to overtighten or damage the heads of the screw because it makes removing or replacing them more difficult. [15] X Research source If you have snap-on nose pads, simply rest them on the mounts on your glasses and push them until they click into place. If you have D-shaped nose pads, make sure they are attached so that the flat edge of the D faces away from your face. Use a small pair of tweezers to hold the nose pads or screws if getting them into the right place by hand is too difficult."
