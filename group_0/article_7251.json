      "title": "Identify the jurisdiction.",
      "content": "Identify the jurisdiction. Warrants are typically issued by county courts, so you will need to identify the county where you want to search for a warrant. If you have a court case or committed an offense in a particular county, a neighboring county is unlikely to have access to information about your arrest warrant. If you are not sure where to search, try counties where you have lived or where you frequently visit. In additional to state courts, there are also federal district courts, which deal with violations of federal law. Federal courts can issue federal arrest warrants. However, federal courts do not offer public warrant databases. To find out about a federal warrant, you will have to call a court clerk and ask for more information."

      "title": "Visit the sheriff's department website.",
      "content": "Visit the sheriff's department website. Navigate to the sheriff's office website for the county you want to search. Look for warrant information. Different counties make their warrant information available in different formats. Some counties, like San Diego County, California, let you search by name. [1] X Research source Others, like Lake County, Illinois, periodically post extensive lists of active warrants. [2] X Research source Some searchable databases allow you to refine your search by nickname, date of birth, and other identifying characteristics. Some counties do not have publicly available warrant information. You may need to contact the sheriff's department or court clerk directly. If you cannot locate warrant information on the sheriff's department website, visit the website for your local court or police station. You can also use your search engine to search for, for example, \"Placer County arrest warrant search.\""

      "content": "Consider an online third-party service. Some non-government websites purport to provide warrant searches. Some are free, such as GotWarrants.org, but most others require you to pay a fee or sign up for a subscription service. [3] X Research source Be aware that these sites are not run by or accountable to the government, so the information they provide may not be complete or accurate. For instance, they may return address, property, and birth records, but miss a person's criminal history. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Telephone the court clerk.",
      "content": "Telephone the court clerk. If you want more information about a warrant you found online (or if your online search was unsuccessful), you can call the court clerk. Ask the clerk to do a warrant search for your name. You may not wish to disclose that you are the named person, in case the clerk . Be prepared to provide your birth date, Social Security number, and/or case number if the clerk asks for additional identifying information. [5] X Research source In sensitive cases, such as family, juvenile delinquency, and domestic violence matters, the clerk may not be able to give you specific information about the case, due to the privacy interests of the other parties. You should still be able to get any related warrant information."

      "content": "Review public records at the courthouse. Courts usually have computers available for public use. You can use a public computer to search the courtâ€™s records for warrant information. You can have someone else search on your behalf if you are concerned about being taken into custody while visiting the court."

      "title": "Note the details.",
      "content": "Note the details. Whether you are searching online, speaking with a court clerk, or reviewing public records, you should make note of certain important details about the warrant. These details may not be available online, so you may need to contact the clerk for more complete information. When was the warrant issued? You may discover a warrant you did not know existed. Learning when it was issued can help you remember or figure out what incident in the past led to a warrant being issued for your arrest. Have fines accumulated? Warrants sometimes have fines associated with them, which can accumulate for as long as the fines go unpaid. Ask if there are any unpaid fines related to the warrant, and whether more fines are still accumulating. What are the charges? If the charges are serious, you should consider hiring an attorney to start preparing your defense. What is the bail amount? If you know the bail amount, you can decide how much money to bring with you when you turn yourself in, or arrange for your bail to be paid by someone else."

      "title": "Hire an attorney.",
      "content": "Hire an attorney. An attorney can help you gather more information about your warrant, respond appropriately, and prepare your defense. Have your attorney contact the court or district attorney to schedule a new hearing, or accompany you to turn yourself in. If you turn yourself in before retaining an attorney, you will have to wait until the jail gives you an opportunity to contact an attorney (or until a public defender is assigned to your case, if you cannot afford an attorney). [6] X Research source Ask friends and family for attorney referrals. You can also consult your state and local bar association websites for attorney referral services, or just search online. If you cannot afford to hire a private criminal defense attorney, contact your local public defender's office about your warrant before turning yourself in."

      "title": "Turn yourself in.",
      "content": "Turn yourself in. You can turn yourself in by visiting your local jail. Bring your photo identification, any court documents you may have, and cash to pay your bail amount. [7] X Research source You can also bring a friend or family member to post bail for you. If you are not eligible for bail, or if you cannot afford to post bail, you may be taken into custody until your arraignment. Avoid turning yourself in on a Friday or before a holiday, since it might then be necessary to hold you in jail over the weekend."
