For best results, you will need to perform the stretches three times per day. [4] X Research source To perform a piriformis stretch, you will need to lay on the floor with your knees bent and both of your feet flat on the floor. Place one foot on the opposite knee. Then, pull that knee toward your chest, keeping it to the outside of your shoulder.

In some cases, piriformis symptoms might actually be caused by trigger points, or muscle knots. These knots may be found in the piriformis or gluteal muscles, and the pressure they cause can lead to pain at the site of the knot or even elsewhere on the body. Locate a health professional who is trained in trigger point therapy (a doctor, massage therapist, physical therapist) and see if this is the source of your pain."
