      "title": "Thaw the shrimp if they are frozen.",
      "content": "Thaw the shrimp if they are frozen. Run the frozen shrimp under cold water for 5 minutes to thaw them. When the shrimp are thawed, they should bend easily and be slightly translucent. If the shrimp are fresh, you can skip this step. [1] X Research source Do not put the shrimp in the microwave to thaw them."

      "title": "Remove the shell if you have to devein the shrimp.",
      "content": "Remove the shell if you have to devein the shrimp. If you have shrimp with veins still in them, you’ll need to remove them so that you don’t eat what was in the shrimp’s digestive tract. Use a pair of cooking scissors to make a vertical cut along the back of the shrimp's shell. Then, peel the shell away from the shrimp. [2] X Research source You can also remove the tail or leave it on, depending on your preference. Pinch the tail and pull to remove it by hand. You can also cut the tail off."

      "title": "Devein the shrimp if they aren't deveined.",
      "content": "Devein the shrimp if they aren't deveined. Use a knife and cut a couple of centimeters into the back of the shrimp to reveal the intestinal vein. This vein will be black in appearance and usually runs down the back of the shrimp. Use your fingers or the knife to carefully pull up the dark black vein running along the back of the shrimp. [3] X Research source Some frozen shrimp come deveined in the package. The vein should lift up easily if you pull on it."

      "title": "Wash the shrimp under cold water.",
      "content": "Wash the shrimp under cold water. Rinsing the shrimp removes dirt and bacteria. Once the shrimp are thoroughly rinsed, set them on a paper towel to drain until you’re ready to cook them. [4] X Research source Shrimp should always be kept on ice if you're storing them."
