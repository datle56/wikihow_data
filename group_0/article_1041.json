      "content": "Know how to tell if your feelings are romantic. Romantic love involves a fondness for the other person, but it's accompanied by a deeper attraction in which you want to develop a sexual/intimate relationship with them. This goes one step beyond typical feelings of friendship or companionship. [1] X Research source For example, with romantic love, you like being around the person, but you are also physically attracted to the person and feel aroused by them. Romantic love is a step further than just friendship, which may be considered platonic love."

Do you mention feeling jealousy when this person is with another love interest? Do you find yourself worrying about your appearance or trying to put your best foot forward around them?

      "content": "Reflect on past experiences. Many people who are same-gender attracted report having these feelings previously with others. Thinking about your past dating or sexual history can help you determine if these feelings portray an orientation or merely mean that you have strong feelings for just one person.

      "content": "Give it time to see if the feelings stick around. It can be tempting to dive in headfirst once you realize you like the other person, but wait it out. If these feelings are relatively new, they could change. Delay telling the person until you’re absolutely sure you like them and you want to act on those feelings. For instance, if you decide to wait 2 weeks before you say anything and your attraction only grows during that time, then you’ll have confirmation that your feelings are real. Reader Poll: We asked 715 wikiHow readers who've told their crush they like them, and 55% of them agreed that their goal in doing so is to see if there’s a chance for a romantic relationship. [Take Poll] Consider your relationship with the person you like and decide if you’re comfortable with that relationship changing before you tell them you like them."

      "content": "Come to terms with your sexuality before sharing it with the world. Some people argue that coming out relieves stress and gives others the opportunity to support you, but you should only come out when you’re ready. Coming out as gay, lesbian, pansexual, queer, bisexual, or another identity can open you up to stigma or discrimination, so it makes sense to be okay with the idea yourself before telling others.

      "content": "Get emotional support from someone you trust first. Have a chat with a close friend or family member and share your feelings. Ask for their support and/or advice about how you should proceed. [6] X Research source You might say, “I think I might have feelings for Andrea. This is new to me and I don’t know what to do.” Be sure you confide in a person who is supportive and non-judgmental. Reach out to a friend who is queer.

      "content": "Ask for support when telling your parents. Most people may feel more comfortable telling a friend, sibling, or trusted adult about same-gender attraction before revealing these feelings to their parents. If this describes you, ask someone you trust to join you in telling your parents. This person doesn't have to say anything-they're just there to offer support. You might ask your best friend, older sibling, or guidance counselor to act as an ally and accompany you when you break the news to your parents. When you tell your parents, be sure to communicate your feelings with certainty, so they don't assume what you're feeling is just a \"phase.\" Prepare for potential resistance from your parents. You may wish to put this off until you are certain about how you feel."

      "content": "Answer questions to the extent you feel comfortable. Your friends or family may question your same-gender attraction by asking what changed, if you were previously dating someone of the opposite gender. They may also ask how you are sure about your sexuality. Answer these questions honestly and to the best of your ability, so they can have clarity. But, don't be afraid to say \"I don't know\" or \"I'd rather not say.\" Your loved ones don't have to know all the details of your journey to being same-gender attracted."

Use your past interactions or experiences with them to predict if they’ll be receptive. For example, if the person often flirts with you, that’s a clear indicator that they probably like you. You might also review what you know about their sexuality: have they dated others of the same gender? Are they currently exploring their own sexuality?"

      "content": "Broach the subject with a question. Sometimes, it's hard to tell if someone likes you, so you may want to take a more subtle approach. Act curious about their sexuality and ask a few questions to gauge whether they’d be receptive to dating you. You might ask, “So, have you ever thought about dating girls/guys?” or “Have you ever been attracted to someone of the same gender?” Their response to your question can serve as a lead-in to you telling them you're attracted to them."
