If there’s liquid in it, do your best to not jostle it too much and keep it level so that nothing spills out. Rinse it in the dishwasher on the top rack, or clean it with soapy water and a soft cloth. Then, let the drip tray air dry completely or dry it with a soft towel. [2] X Research source Clean your drip tray at least once a week or whenever you notice a lot of liquid starting to collect in it. Clean the area beneath where you pulled out the drip tray as well in case any liquid managed to spill down there. Use something like a toothbrush to scrub at any stubborn buildups that won’t come off easily."

      "content": "Pull the water reservoir out and scrub it with soapy water. To remove the water reservoir from your Keurig, simply lift it up from where it’s located on the side of the machine. Dump out any excess water into the sink, then use soapy water and a non-abrasive cloth to thoroughly clean the inside and outside of the reservoir. If you have a Keurig water filter in the reservoir, remove that before cleaning out the reservoir. Let the reservoir air dry completely before reassembling. [3] X Research source Clean your water reservoir at least once a week. Do not put the water reservoir in the dishwasher. If your water reservoir has a filter screen on the bottom, aim a strong stream of water at the screen to clean off any buildups of dirt or debris. Avoid using a cloth to dry the inside of the reservoir since it may leave behind lint that could get into your water. Place the water reservoir upside down on a towel while it air dries to make sure all of the water drips out."

Snap the water reservoir back into the side of the Keurig and slide the drip tray back into position on the bottom. Then, take a damp, soapy cloth and use it to do a thorough wipe-down of the entire machine. Finally, dry it with a non-abrasive towel or let it air dry. [4] X Research source Don’t plug your Keurig back into the power source until it’s completely dry. Never submerge your Keurig machine entirely in water. Only rinse the removable water reservoir and drip tray. Wipe your Keurig off every time you use it to keep it clean and prevent any residue from forming. If your Keurig has a touchscreen display, wipe it dry with a paper towel when you’re finished cleaning it so it doesn’t get damaged."

Once you’re done rinsing out the two pieces, let them air dry completely. [7] X Research source If your Keurig is dispensing your drink at a much slower pace than normal or if you hear any strange gurgling or sputtering sounds, these might be signs it’s time to unclog the needles. As a general rule of thumb, clean and unclog your Keurig’s needles once a month or more. A second needle is at the bottom of the pod holder, so be careful when rinsing it since it’s very sharp. Use a damp cloth or a toothbrush to scrub around the area where you insert the pod holder into the machine in case there’s any buildup of dirt there."

Finally, empty the mug and run the machine one more time with just water so it can clean out any residue.

Instead of the descaling solution, fill the water reservoir with equal parts white vinegar and water (about 14 oz (410 ml) each). See what fellow wikiHow users have to say about cleaning their machines with vinegar on the wikiHow forum post, \"How to clean my Keurig with vinegar?\" Use distilled water when descaling your machine and also when brewing drinks to avoid having to descale your Keurig as often."
