      "title": "\"Bruh” is often used to show disbelief.",
      "content": "\"Bruh” is often used to show disbelief. Although “bruh” started out as a way to address a friend (and not your brother, surprisingly enough), it has morphed into a word that shows shock and displeasure. People use “bruh,” usually in a negative way, in place of “Are you serious?” [1] X Research source \"I broke your phone, bro.” “BRUH what???” \"Did you hear this class has two finals?” “Bruh.”"

      "content": "\"Bruh\" can be a response to a less-than-informed question.

      "content": "Bruh can also be used to show you’re excited. “Bruh” is an interjection, and is super versatile. You can say “bruh” when you’re mad at someone, but it makes just as much sense to add it to a celebratory text. \"Dude I just won the lottery!” “Bruh no way!!” \"Bruh” can be used to show basically any emphatic emotion, that is to say, it can replace interjections like “wow,” “yay,” “aw,” “sick,” “no,” and “c’mon.”"

      "content": "Use \"bruh\" when you’re mad at someone. It’s good to let people know how you feel, even when you’re disappointed in them.

      "content": "Girls use “bruh” the same way guys do. When a girl calls you “bruh,” she means it like “friend” or “homie.” She’s addressing you as a friend, just like you’d address her. She also could be using it to express exasperation or disbelief, as “bruh\" doesn't need to refer to someone as much as “dude” or “bro” do. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "\"Bruh girl” is a term for a girl who’s one of the guys.",
      "content": "\"Bruh girl” is a term for a girl who’s one of the guys. Calling a girl “bruh” doesn’t mean you see her as a man, just that you’re close and comfortable with her in a similar way to your guy friends. “Bruh girls” are associated with casual clothes, a good sense of humor, and tomboyness. Not everyone likes being called “bruh”, but as long as you’re using it with close friends and are open to feedback—\"hey, don’t call me “bruh”\"—you’re okay."

      "content": "While “bruh” is traditionally masculine, no guys need to be involved to use it. A “bruh girl” is usually considered to be tomboy-like or to have masculine interests, but they aren’t defined around men. Women can use “bruh” together, and often do!

      "content": "\"Bruh” comes from 19th century African American Vernacular English. Black Americans first started using “bruh\" way back in the 1890s (some say 1850s) as an honorific. [5] X Research source Calling people other than your family “brother” or “sister” has been a way to express familiarity for centuries, and in different dialects “brother” was shortened to “bruh.” Other honorifics, like Mrs. and Mr., are a little more formal than the original “bruh.” Its familiarity puts it closer to words like “sis” and “sweetie”. You’d use “Bruh” just like Mr., so “Bruh Jackie” instead of “Mr. Jackie.”"

      "content": "In 2003, “bruh\" showed up on Urban Dictionary.

      "content": "Reaction images and vines made “bruh” go viral in 2014. Two pieces of media shot “bruh” into stardom. The first, a picture of NBA player John Wall with the word “BRUH” on the bottom, was used to convey that “are you serious right now?” energy. [6] X Research source The second, the word “bruh\" dubbed over a video of high school basketballer Tony Farmer fainting started an entire “bruh” trend on Vine. Bruh's usage as an exasperated phrase stems from these reaction videos. It became a funny way to say “Are you kidding me right now?” that’s a little less aggressive."
