      "title": "Get out of your current environment.",
      "content": "Get out of your current environment. Try to step away from any environment where you feel it's difficult to control your urges. If you are at home and feeling a compulsion to masturbate , for example, try taking a quick walk to the store. If you can’t leave your current environment (if you’re at work, for example), try talking to another coworker or taking a break. It might also be helpful to have someone to help keep you accountable, such as a trusted friend or even a therapist ."

      "content": "Keep a to-do list in your pocket. Write down all the tasks, errands, or things around the house you need to do today. If you are feeling the need to engage in a compulsive behavior, look at your list and distract yourself with another activity. If you think it is unlikely that you will be able to do something productive when you experience a strong sexual urge, then try to keep an easy distraction on hand, such as a good book or a puzzle you can work on."

      "title": "Postpone your behavior until a later time.",
      "content": "Postpone your behavior until a later time. Putting off the compulsive behavior makes you think about your behavior before committing to it. It also helps you tolerate uncomfortable feelings and distress. [1] X Research source Set a time goal for yourself. Try telling yourself, “I’ll watch porn in an hour,” or whatever the largest amount of time you can commit to postponing may be. You may only be comfortable postponing your behavior for one minute. That’s okay, give yourself one minute. After your allotted time is up, you can choose to postpone again, or engage in your behavior. But choose to postpone whenever possible, even if it is just another minute. After a while, you may be able to extend the amount of time you go without feeling the need to engage in the behavior."

      "title": "Identify the triggers for your sexual urges.",
      "content": "Identify the triggers for your sexual urges. Spend some time thinking about your behavior and what leads you to have sexual impulses. Think about triggering stimuli, the time of day, as well as the environment in which you tend to have these urgings. See if there are any patterns that emerge in your behavior. If you have discovered a pattern, figure out how you can break the cycle with new behaviors or lifestyle changes. For example, you may notice that you feel most overwhelmed with sexual urges in the evenings and on weekends -- when you are not working and don’t have anything to do. You may decide to take up a new hobby in order to keep your mind off sex. Perhaps you are triggered by stimuli in your environment. If you find yourself aroused by steamy love scenes in movies, for example, it may be best to watch other kinds of non-romantic films until you can get a better grip on your urges. Consider keeping a journal of your actions and behavior leading up to sexual urges. A journal can help you identify triggers and patterns."

For example, if you have a tendency to view porn at home alone, find a hobby that takes you out of the house and surrounds you with people, so that you are not in a triggering environment."

Are you happy with our sex life?” Understand that you and your partner may have different levels of sex drive. You may want to have sex more frequently than your partner. This doesn’t make either of you wrong or right, it is just how you were made. Be honest with yourself and each other about if this can be managed or if this is a deal-breaker for the relationship. Talk to your partner if you feel compelled to cheat on them. Be honest, even though it may be a difficult conversation. You could say, “I know this is painful to hear, but I am having sexual urges toward other people. I am telling you this because I want to be honest, and I am struggling.” [10] X Research source Consider seeing a couples counselor with training in sexual addiction or sexual problems to help you navigate your relationship.

Most likely, leaders in your faith community have heard it all before and know how to address concerns. You could indicate your embarrassment when you ask to speak to them; for example, “I’ve been struggling with something kind of personal and embarrassing.
