To help you focus, take the time to write or type out a physical list for the day. That way, you're not trying to keep them all in your head at once. Plus a list can help you see just how much you've done in a day, which can motivate you. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Break work into smaller chunks. When you're depressed, even small tasks can seem monumental; therefore, it's best to try to view tasks in smaller chunks, so that you can accomplish things piece by piece. Instead of thinking, \"I need to send 500 emails today,\" think \"I have one email to send in the next five minutes. I can do that.\" [2] X Research source Making tasks smaller makes it seem easier to do them. If it doesn't seem to be working, try even smaller chunks. You could say, \"I just need to get through this one sentence. That's it.\""

      "content": "Skip the pressure to begin. Sometimes, trying to figure out how to begin a task is the hardest part. Maybe you can't find the words you need to start a report, for instance. The key is to just start somewhere. You don't have to start at the \"beginning.\" You just need to get started. [3] X Research source Once you have some work done, you'll find it easier to go back and work through the beginning. Also, you won't be paralyzed with indecision about how to \"start.\""

      "content": "Make yourself work for five minutes straight. It can be tempting to give in to procrastination when you're feeling depressed. You have a tendency to get distracted, for instance, or you have a desire to get up and do something else; however, just promising yourself you'll work for a set amount of time can help get you started. [4] X Research source Cut out distractions. Don't go anywhere else on the internet than what you need for work. Don't go talk to a friend. Just sit down and pay attention only to your work. Remind yourself you can't do anything else. Even if you don't work, don't allow yourself to do something more interesting. If you're in a more active job, try to cut distractions like talking to co-workers and just focus on the task at hand. Set a timer if you need to. Set it for five minutes, then give yourself a short break and start again."

A reward system can be as simple as, \"If I get this task done, I'll get a cup of coffee.\" You could also try, \"If I get this task done, I'll go talk to my friend for five minutes.\" Only give yourself the reward if you actually get it done. [5] X Research source Another reward could be a task you enjoy more. Maybe you hate sending emails but enjoy interviewing customers. Try the task you hate first, and reward yourself with the more enjoyable task. You can also set rewards for the day, such as, \"If I get this list accomplished, I'll get Thai food tonight.\" Make sure you don't make your tasks unattainable. You should be able to accomplish them if you get down to work."

      "content": "Identify feelings of apathy and lethargy . Apathy and lethargy are commonly experienced by people who are depressed and they can make it extremely difficult to feel motivated to do things, from seeking help to going to work to simply getting out of bed in the morning. Apathy is an actual lack of emotion — it means you feel nothing. It has been shown that you must have a feeling about something in order to be motivated to change it, so feeling apathetic makes it extremely difficult to change your situation. You might know that your lack of productivity at work might get you in trouble or even fired, but you simply can't make yourself care enough to actually do anything about it. [9] X Research source Lethargy is a feeling of fatigue, which can make it even harder to work up the motivation to do things, even when you know you must. [10] X Research source Apathy may cause you to feel like happiness, fulfillment, or the ability to reach your goals are impossible. You may feel bored, worn out, and like there is nothing to look forward to. If you notice feelings of apathy or lethargy as part of your depression, you will need to learn to manage and overcome them to be productive at work."

      "title": "Change your mindset.",
      "content": "Change your mindset. The challenge with apathy and lethargy is that you don't feel like doing anything. So, while there may be many things you can do to relieve those feelings, you can't get yourself motivated to actually do them. Overcoming these feelings begins with changing your mindset so you get to a place where you can begin to take action. [11] X Research source Start challenging your apathy. Recall the times in the past when you felt happy, motivated, and enthusiastic. What were you doing? Who were you with? Try to do something as small as text someone who always makes you laugh, or do a crossword puzzle if that's something you used to enjoy. Start small. Ask yourself what you can do right now to move forward, even a tiny bit. Maybe you know you should see a doctor, but your lethargy and apathy are making it seem impossible. Try simply doing an online search of doctors in your area. You don't need to call or make an appointment today — just take that first, small step. Identify the things you cannot change. Perhaps you feel apathetic because there are some things about your situation you simply cannot change right now. Work on accepting those things and focusing on what you can change. Manage your expectations. Setting your expectations too high and asking too much of yourself sets you up for failure and can make you feel worse about yourself. It's okay to adjust your expectations throughout the day — even multiple times. If you start to feel overwhelmed, check in with yourself and consider that your current expectations may be too high."

      "content": "Address lethargy by eating well. Depression may cause you to lose your appetite or turn to unhealthy comfort foods, which can drain your energy and leave you tired and fatigued. Try setting an alarm to go off ever two to three hours and make yourself eat a healthy snack containing protein and complex carbs. These foods can give you energy. Try eggs, yogurt, meat, raw greens, and nuts. [12] X Research source Avoid sugar, which can give you a quick burst of energy but ultimately cause you to crash. It may also cause you to feel irritable."

Putting yourself down and calling yourself \"lazy\" won't do anything to motivate you to do more work. Take steps to end negative self-talk by first becoming aware that you are doing it. Ask yourself — What am I saying to myself? What messages am I sending? Would I say this to a friend? [13] X Research source Try apologizing to yourself when you catch yourself engaging in negative self-talk. Say something like, \"I didn't deserve that. I'm not lazy — I'm depressed, and there is a difference. I am doing the best I can right now.\""

[15] X Research source Try breathing in for four counts, holding for four counts, breathing out for four counts, and holding for four counts.
