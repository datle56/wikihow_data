      "content": "Watch for physiological signs of anger. Anger is certainly a psychological emotion, but it is also physiological, involving chemical reactions in your brain. [1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source When you get angry, your amygdala, the center for emotional processing, sends a distress signal to your hypothalamus, which sends epinephrine along your autonomic nervous system through the path of the sympathetic nervous system to the adrenal glands, which starts pumping epinephrine (adrenaline) throughout your body. The adrenaline gets your body ready to meet a threat, increasing your heart rate and sharpening your senses. [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source This process serves a biological purpose (preparing you for fight or flight), but if you have an anger problem, your threshold for what triggers this physiological response may be too low (for example, if you get angry at a coworker for playing music too loudly)."

      "title": "Take inventory of your emotions.",
      "content": "Take inventory of your emotions. Anger often masks another emotion; many times, anger is a secondary emotion to hurt, sadness, grief, depression, or fear. [3] X Research source Anger emerges almost as a defense mechanism because it is easier for many people to deal with than other emotions. Think about whether you allow yourself to feel a wide range of emotions or if you may be suppressing emotions that you think you “shouldn’t” feel or “aren’t allowed” to feel. If you commonly substitute anger for other emotions that you find more difficult to deal with, consider seeing a therapist to learn how to handle and accept those emotions."

      "title": "Accept that anger can be a normal, healthy emotion.",
      "content": "Accept that anger can be a normal, healthy emotion. Anger is not always a bad thing. Anger can serve a healthy purpose by protecting you against continued abuse or wrongdoing. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source If you perceive that someone is harming you, you will likely become angry, and that anger will prompt you to confront the person or end the harm in another way. Some people are taught that it is impolite to feel or express anger. But suppressing natural feelings of anger can have negative effects on your emotions and your relationships with others. If you are worried about hurting someone’s feelings, be polite about your anger. Simply saying “I am angry” will do far more than keeping it bottled up."

      "content": "Watch for signs that your anger is out of control. While anger can be healthy, it can also be unhealthy. You may need to deal with an anger problem through self-help or professional help if the following are true: [5] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Insignificant occurrences make you very angry, such as spilled milk and accidentally dropping an object. When you’re angry, you display aggressive behaviors, including yelling, screaming, or hitting. The problem is chronic; it happens over and over again. You have an addiction, and when you are under the influence of drugs or alcohol, your temper gets worse and your behavior more violent."

      "content": "Engage in physical activity. The endorphins that come from exercise can help you calm down, and moving your body provides a physical outlet for your rage: in this way, exercise can help you relieve anger in the moment. However, maintaining a regular exercise schedule can also help you regulate your emotions in general. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source While you exercise, focus on thinking about the exercise and your body, not what has been on your mind lately. Some forms of exercise that might appeal to you and help you control your anger include: Running/Jogging Weight training Cycling Yoga Basketball Martial arts Swimming Dance Boxing Meditating"

      "content": "Get enough sleep at night. Most adults need at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night to thrive. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Being sleep deprived can contribute to a wide range of health problems, including the inability to manage emotions properly. Getting adequate sleep can improve your mood and lessen your anger. If you have chronic sleep problems, consult your physician. You may be able to make dietary or lifestyle changes to improve your sleep. You may also be able to try herbal or medicinal supplements to sleep more."

      "content": "Keep an anger journal. Begin writing down details about your anger. If you have an episode or event in which you lost control of your emotions, write it down. Be sure to include exactly how you felt, what caused you to be angry, where you were, who you were with, how you reacted, and how you felt afterwards. [8] X Research source After you have kept your journal for a while, look for commonalities among entries to identify the people, places, or things that trigger your anger. A sample journal entry may look like this: Today, I became very angry at a coworker. He called me selfish for not offering to pick up lunch for everyone. We were in the lounge area, and I was taking a break from a stressful day by eating a cheeseburger from the restaurant next door. I got really angry and yelled back at him, called him a name and stormed off. I punched the desk when I got back to my office. Then I felt guilty and ashamed and hid in my office the rest of the day. Over time, you may evaluate your journal and find that being called a name (such as selfish) is a trigger for your anger."

      "content": "Put together an anger management plan. Once you begin to identify triggers to your anger, you can make a plan for dealing with those triggers. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Using strategies for controlling anger can help, along with scripting an if-then response ahead of time. For example, you may know that you are going to visit your mother-in-law, who makes disparaging remarks about your parenting style: You could decide ahead of time, “If she makes a comment about my parenting, I will calmly tell her that I appreciate her input, but I am going to make decisions about the way that I parent regardless of her opinions.” You may also decide that you will leave the room or even pack up and go home if you feel that your anger is growing."

      "content": "Practice assertive expression of your anger. People using assertive expression of anger acknowledge the needs of both parties involved in a disagreement. [10] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source To practice assertive expression, stick to the facts involved, communicate requests (rather than demands) in a respectful way, and express your feelings clearly. This approach differs from passive expression, which involves being angry without saying anything, and aggressive expression, which manifests as an explosion or outburst that seems disproportionate to the problem. For example, if you are angered by a coworker playing loud music at work, you could say, “I know that you enjoy listening to music while you work, but it makes it hard for me to focus. Do you think you could use headphones instead of playing the music out loud?”"

[11] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Attending a group class can help you feel as though you are not alone in your situation, and many people find that peer groups are as helpful as individual therapy for some kinds of problems. To find an anger management program that is right for you, try searching online for “anger management class” plus the name of your city, state, or region. You can also include search terms like “for teens” or “for PTSD” to find a group tailored to your specific situation. You can also look for appropriate programs by asking your physician or therapist, or consulting the self-improvement course offerings at your local community center."

You can take a break by stopping what you're doing, getting away from whatever is irritating you, and/or just taking a breather. Getting away from whatever is upsetting you will make it infinitely easier to calm down. Remember that you do not have to respond to a situation immediately. You can count to 10 or even say “I will think about it and get back to you” to give yourself additional time to cool down as necessary.

[18] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source After you have given yourself a moment to calm down, \"discuss\" the situation with yourself in positive and relieving terms. For example, if you experience road rage, you could try turning from “That idiot almost killed me! I'm furious!” to \"That guy almost sideswiped me, but maybe he was experiencing an emergency and I'll probably never have to see him again. I’m lucky that I'm alive and my car is unscratched.

Clearly express what you want from the other person. If you just want a sounding board, state at the beginning that you don't want help or advice, just sympathy. If you're looking for a solution, let the other person know. [19] X Research source Give yourself a set amount of time to vent about what's upsetting you, and stick to it—when time is up, your rant is over.

Casting the incident in a humorous light can actually change the chemical response in your body from anger to humor. [20] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source For example, if someone runs you off the road in your car, you might think about how silly it is that they might get where they are going 15 seconds faster by not yielding to you.
