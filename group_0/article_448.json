Mix in more lotion, 1 squirt at a time, until the slime is as stretchy as you want it. [1] X Research source Any kind of moisturizing hand or body lotion will work for this. This works well rubbery slime that just breaks when you try to stretch it out."

      "content": "Moisten dried-out slime with warm water. Hold dried-out slime under warm running water or dunk it in a bowl of warm water for 1 second at a time, then play with the slime in your hands to mix the water in. Repeat this as many times as needed until the slime becomes moist and stretchy again. This works well for slime that has dried out slightly because it was left out and not stored in an airtight container."

      "content": "Add baking soda and contact lens solution to make slime less sticky. Put the sticky slime into any kind of bowl or container. Pour 1 ⁄ 2 tsp (2.5 mL) of contact lens solution and 1/2 tsp (2 g) of baking soda onto the slime, then mix it in thoroughly by kneading the slime with your hands. Add more of each substance if the slime is still too sticky. [2] X Research source Don’t add more than 1 ⁄ 2 tsp (2.5 mL) of contact lens solution and 1/2 tsp (2 g) of baking soda at a time. If you add too much, the slime can become rubbery and break apart."

Stir the liquid starch in thoroughly with a metal spoon. Keep stirring in liquid starch, 1 US tbsp (15 mL) at a time, until there are no strings of slime sticking to the spoon. [3] X Research source Once the slime loses its stringiness, you can pick it up and start to knead it with your hands to firm it up."

Flip it over and do the same to the other side. Repeat this process for at least 5 minutes until the slime has a fluffy, doughy consistency and doesn’t feel too sticky. [7] X Research source If you find that the slime is too sticky after kneading it, try adding more cornstarch and continue to knead it until you’re happy with the consistency."

As long as you store slime correctly, it can last for months."
