[1] X Expert Source Louie Felix Dating Coach & Matchmaker Expert Interview. 5 May 2020. One great way to sound more genuine when complimenting a woman is to say her name, which makes a super intimate verbal connection. It’s even better if you say something like, “Wow, Elizabeth.” Using her name implies that she has your whole attention.. “Kristen, you’ve done it again!” “You look radiant, Monica.” “Oh my god, Catherine, that outfit is stunning.” “Grace, I love what you’re wearing.” “Carmen! That sweater is gorgeous!”"

Dating coach Laura Bilotta recommends that you “compliment them on their accessories” as an easy way to zero in on a detail. [2] X Expert Source Laura Bilotta Dating Coach Expert Interview. 26 February 2020. Instead of just saying, “Nice outfit,” try something like, “I really like that bracelet.” It will sound more meaningful and heartfelt the more specific it is. “That necklace is beautiful.” “Those pants look great.” “Your earrings are incredible.” “Wow, I love the embroidery on your cuff.” “Those pearl-snap buttons are so cool.” “Your jewelry is always so gorgeous.”"

      "content": "Reference her style icon to totally flatter her. Tell her an outfit looks just like something Zendaya would wear (or Rihanna, or Audrey Hepburn, etc.). If that’s what she was going for, she’ll be super glad that you noticed! And if it’s not, it’s still a pretty safe bet. “You look like Rihanna with your hair like that!” “That looks just like something Beyoncé would wear.” “Your outfit reminds me a bit of Ariana Grande’s look!” “I feel like I’m sitting across from Kristen Bell, only better.” “You look like some sort of celebrity!” “That reminds me of something a celebrity would wear on the red carpet.”"

[3] X Research source It’s likely she chose it intentionally just for that purpose. Pay attention to what color your girlfriend’s eyes are, then compliment her on anything she chooses in that color. For instance: “That dress is beautiful. The color really brings out your eyes.” “I love that blue sweater on you. It really makes your eyes pop.” “The coffee color in your jacket goes perfect with your eyes.” “I can’t believe you found a green that matches your incredible eyes.” “Did you mean to match your blouse to your eyes? Because it looks great.”"

      "content": "Comment on her taste if you need a more vague compliment. This is a great option if you’re not sure what else to say. If she has a sporty style, you might say, “You always look so athletic and put-together.” If she’s more of the girly type, you could say, “Your style is so chic yet casual.” If she has a streetwear vibe, you might say, “You always look so laid-back and cool.” If she’s more of a business casual type person, you could say, “Your style is so sophisticated.” “I never know what to expect from your wardrobe, but I’m always delighted.” “Either you have a personal stylist, or you just have excellent taste.” “You always know how to elevate a look.” “How did you find your style? You always make me so envious.”"

      "content": "Give a more enthusiastic compliment in the form of a question. Asking a question makes you more involved and interested, which tells her that you care. If your girlfriend is into fashion, she might appreciate the opportunity to tell you where she got something. Plus, it shows that your compliment was genuine, and you weren’t saying it just to get brownie points. [4] X Research source Try something like, “Wow, I love those shoes! Where’d you get them?” “I have to know where you got that shirt. It’s so cool!” “Woah, that looks vintage! Did you thrift it?” “Where’d you get that? Do they sell men’s clothing, too?” “You gotta tell me your clothes shopping spots.”"

      "content": "Give a more personal compliment by focusing on her vibe. If your girlfriend is constantly trying out new styles or being bold with her appearance, you might tell her you admire her confidence. Just stay away from anything like, “Wow, you’re so brave to wear that in public!” That’s not really a compliment, and you might offend your girlfriend. “You’re so confident in your own skin. I really admire that about you.” “Your outfit’s great, and your confidence really pulls it together.” “Gosh, it must feel incredible to have such good taste.” “You know, your warm personality really shows in your wardrobe.” “If I had your confidence, I could wear anything I wanted. Good thing you also have great style.”"

      "title": "Tell her the clothes seem like they were made for her.",
      "content": "Tell her the clothes seem like they were made for her. Loads of people struggle with getting clothes to fit just right, and when we do, it feels like we’re on top of the world. Acknowledging that can be super flattering. Just be sure to steer clear of comments about her body when doing so. Keep your compliments about her clothes! For example: “Is that jacket tailored? It’s perfect for you.” “Would you recommend that brand of jeans? I can never find ones that fit me, but those look so comfy.” “You always know exactly what looks good on you. But then, I bet everything would.” “Did you make that? It just seems like it was made for you.” “I love the taper on those pants. It’s so chic.”"

Felix reminds us that a compliment “becomes disingenuous when you say it to try to impress someone.” [5] X Expert Source Louie Felix Dating Coach & Matchmaker Expert Interview. 5 May 2020. Don’t tell her that you don’t like it (after all, it’s her outfit, not yours), but don’t fake it, either. If you don’t actually like something and you say you do, your girlfriend will probably notice. If she’s asking for your honest opinion, be honest! You might say, “I think that other skirt might pop a little more,” or, “It’s honestly not my favorite, but I don’t really think I’m the authority here.” Avoid honesty if she didn’t specifically ask your opinion. Sometimes it’s best to just not mention it! “I love that color, but I think we could find something even better.” In a pinch, a simple, “You look lovely tonight” can get you out of a sticky situation."

Psychologist Dr. Sarah Schewitz says, “Don’t compliment her on her boobs or her butt or anything like that.” [6] X Expert Source Sarah Schewitz, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 April 2019. It suggests to her that you see her as an object, not as a person. Unless she asks you about something in particular, don’t point out parts of her body that you like. Stick to her overall look or the pieces of clothing instead. If you must, stick to things that are pretty normal to comment on, like her hair or her smile, Dr. Schewitz says, but do your best to tie it back to the outfit. “Your hair sits just right on your shoulders when you wear that dress.” “Your smile absolutely ties this look together.” “That shade of lipstick really accentuates your smile.” “Purple goes so well with your complexion.” “That sweater contrasts your hair so nicely.”"
