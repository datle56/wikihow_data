Your regimen should be comprehensive, targeting all the major muscle groups of the body, and you should perform workouts on a consistent basis, taking days off only to rest. If you want to build muscle, weight training must become part of your lifestyle.

[2] X Expert Source Laila Ajani Fitness Trainer Expert Interview. 31 October 2019. Weight training can be tough on inexperienced muscles and joints, and an acclimation period is usually necessary to prepare the body to regularly overcome resistance. As you gain experience and your body becomes used to the strain, you can incorporate another workout or 2 per week, though you should still take a couple off days to allow for muscular recovery. [3] X Research source To make the most efficient use of your time in the gym, consider performing a traditional bodybuilding “split” workout, in which 2 or more muscle groups (e.g. back and biceps/legs and abs) are exercised consecutively during the same workout.

There is a persistent debate over the best number of sets and reps to perform to achieve certain goals, but most modern fitness research points to one simple rule: if you want to build muscle, you have to lift something heavy a lot of times. [5] X Expert Source Laila Ajani Fitness Trainer Expert Interview. 31 October 2019. Don’t overthink it: start with a straightforward 3x10 structure (three sets of ten repetitions of a given exercise) until progress begins to slow, then either increase the weight you’re using or the number of reps you’re performing to keep improving. [6] X Research source Once you’ve gained a little experience with strength training, you can start experimenting with different weights and rep ranges to find out what works best for your body type: low reps (1 to 3) with extremely high weights are most often used to gain explosive strength, while high rep ranges (15 – 30) are useful for increasing endurance. [7] X Research source When implementing a set-rep scheme like a 3x10 or 5x5, you should pick a weight that’s heavy enough so that you can only perform that many repetitions per set."

      "content": "Incorporate bodyweight movements. Round out your weight training sessions with bodyweight movements like push ups, pull-ups, crunches and unweighted squats and lunges. Bodyweight exercises force you to stabilize and control the movement of your own body, which means they’re very effective at building muscle and translate well to athletic endeavors. While on your weight lifting journey, don’t forget about the basics. [8] X Research source Bodyweight exercises are a saving grace for many people who don’t have access to gym equipment, or with past injuries that make excessive weight-bearing movements too difficult; all you need is a few feet of space in your own home and the will to push yourself. Try ending your workout with a series of “finishers” (exercises of moderate intensity performed for long periods, designed to totally exhaust you at the end of a session) consisting of bodyweight movements. Pushups, burpees, squat jumps and mountain climbers all work well for this purpose. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Feel the “mind/muscle connection. ” When you lift weights, you should make an effort to be conscious of the way the muscle feels when exerting itself through the movement. This is what scientists and strength coaches refer to as the “mind/muscle connection.” The basic principle is that the more you concentrate on actively engaging a muscle during a particular lift, the more you’ll get out of that muscle and the better your results will be. The mind/muscle connection can help you get more bang for your buck so that you’re working efficiently, not just hard. [10] X Research source While performing a bicep curl, for example, fix your focus on the contraction of the muscle itself, think about how all parts of the movement feel and squeeze the muscle to keep the muscle fibers active throughout the lift. Understanding basic kinesiology and the mechanical workings of the human body are an integral part of lifting weights."

      "content": "Get plenty of protein. Every tissue in your body is comprised of cellular proteins, and these are broken down and depleted when your body undergoes the strain of exercise. Replenish lost proteins and provide your body with enough to generate new muscular growth by consuming lean meats, eggs, nuts or dairy with every meal. Protein is the cornerstone of every bodybuilder’s diet. [11] X Research source Grilled, skinless chicken breasts, eggs cooked in olive oil instead of butter, almonds and skim milk are all excellent low-cost, high-protein choices. Athletes and those seeking to build muscle mass require much more daily protein than the average person. A good general rule is to ingest at least half a gram of protein for every pound of your body weight per day (if you weigh 200 lbs, that’s 100 g of protein). [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Use supplements to complete your diet. Try adding basic supplements to your diet to ensure that you’re meeting your nutrition requirements. It can be difficult to get as much protein and other nutrients as you need every day from regular food. This is where supplements come in. A protein shake or bar can quickly net you 30 or 40 g of pure protein without the need to painstakingly prepare a meal. These supplements are available at any time and are a good way to stave off hunger cravings. They can even be used to replace meals if you’re in a hurry. For most people, a high-quality whey protein supplement (and possibly some creatine, if you’re serious about packing on size) will be enough to supplement a standard diet. Protein supplements are especially important for vegans and vegetarians seeking to build muscle mass, as the foods richest in protein are usually forbidden from these diets. Vegetarian and vegan proteins are derived from natural plant sources and function identically in the body. While they are convenient, protein shakes, energy bars and other supplements should never take the place of fresh, whole food on a day-to-day basis. They are just that: supplements."

Brightly-colored vegetables are full of antioxidants and other nutrients like iron, potassium, dietary fiber and vitamins. These should find a steady place in your diet. Generally speaking, vegetables that are green, leafy, or come in especially bright or dark colors contain the highest concentrations of beneficial nutrients.

While most people arguably rely too much on the availability and culinary appeal of these foods, they are indispensable for active individuals. The majority of your carbohydrates should come from “clean” sources, such as whole grains, fruits and vegetables (as opposed to enriched grains, starchy pastas, processed sugar, etc.), while for fats you should mostly stick to the mono- and polyunsaturated variety, which includes offerings like avocados, almonds, and olive oil.

Your recommended carb intake depends on a variety of factors (including age, weight, height, and activity level). Try an online calculator to determine how many grams of carbohydrates you should eat daily. Mono- and polyunsaturated fats contain compounds that target free-radicals in the body’s cells, reversing oxidation damage and keeping you looking and feeling healthy.

This is a no-brainer, but everyone sometimes needs a gentle reminder, especially with the renewed popularity of junk food items like pizza, cupcakes and mac and cheese. Save these treats for a hard-earned cheat day, or for the first meal following a grueling workout, where most of the excess calories will be used to restore the muscles’ lost energy. Building a strong body requires restraint as well as effort — it would be a shame to blow a week’s worth of sweat on a couple ill-advised food choices. [15] X Research source Resist the urge to binge eat. If you’re hungry, make or order a balanced meal that contains at least 1/3 lean protein with a carbohydrate source and a fresh fruit or veggie.

You should be taking at least 2 days off from weight lifting and other exercise during the week. Few things are more important in building strong, healthy muscle mass than rest. When you perform weight-bearing exercise, you’re actually causing wear-and-tear on the muscles and joints that accumulates if not given adequate time to heal. Resting gives those hard-working muscle fibers time to recover and thicken, making them more resistant to strain and causing the muscle itself to grow larger. Stagger your rest days so that they fall within your regular training routine. For instance, you might work out your back and biceps on Monday, your legs and core on Tuesday, rest Wednesday, exercise chest and triceps Thursday, go for a run Friday, rest Saturday, etc. That way, all your major muscle groups are receiving attention while being given ample time to rest between muscle-specific days, which 2 days a week to take off entirely. Muscles that are not given a chance to recover and heal themselves will accumulate damage until they become prone to injury."

This means that small tears and strains are being fixed, fat is being metabolized for continual energy and new muscle is being constructed whenever you’re tucked in for the night. Too many people give themselves reasons not to get enough sleep, not realizing that sleep-deprivation and having a strong, healthy body are in opposition of each other. [18] X Research source Try to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep every night. Turn off all visually and aurally-stimulating distractions at least 1 hour before bed. The electromagnetic energy from your TV, iPad or gaming system may be making it harder for you to fall asleep and stay that way."

This is equally true when it comes to your health and fitness. Not only is alcohol packed with non-nutritive calories, too much of it can leach calcium from your bones, making weightlifting difficult and dangerous. Don’t be afraid to have a couple beers on special occasions, but make sure it’s not an everyday occurrence, and beware of drinking to excess. Most beers and liquors are distilled from fruits, vegetables and grains, which means they contain all of the carbohydrates from sugar with none of the nutritional value. Alcohol consumption is also linked with tissue damage, nerve dysfunction and even organ failure in habitually large quantities. [19] X Research source"

Natural hormones like testosterone play an important role in directing muscular growth, and these hormones can be negatively influenced by factors such as stress and anxiety. More than anything, stress is an inhibiting response — building the muscular physique you desire can become more of a challenge if your body’s resources are not being utilized effectively. [20] X Research source Find constructive ways of reducing stress. Practice positive thinking, take a few minutes for silent meditation at the end of the day or slip into a relaxing bath. Anything you can do to minimize the effect stress has on your life will enable you to reach new peaks in your fitness goals and quest for a healthy mind and body.
