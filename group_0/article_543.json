You will also need to download either 7Zip, WinRar, WinZip, or other file extracting software if you do not already have one downloaded (won't go into detail on how to use file extracting software). The file extracting software will be used to extract the files for GHTCP. Download GHTCP here, located in the intro section of the thread: http://www.scorehero.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=72367 Download the GH3 1.31 patch here: http://www.patches-scrolls.com/guitar_hero3.php Download Microsoft .NET Framework by searching the Microsoft download main site: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download"

Once the control panel is opened, go to file, and under file, click on \"Open Game Settings\". A list will pop up with \"Guitar Hero III\" and different languages. Choose \"Guitar Hero III (English)\", and click OK. After several seconds, your game's song list should load. Now, you will learn how to add custom songs to the game. It's suggested that you use the FretsOnFire website to find songs to add to the game, as FretsOnFire has the most extensive list of song downloads, and you will have to do as little work as necessary to download songs from the site."

You can either browse through the various threads which contain other users' custom songs, or to make it more simple, which it is suggested you do, you can go to the \"SONGS DATABASE\" thread, which is stickied and located near the top of the page. In the original post, there is a link next to where it says \"custom songs:\". Click on it to access the FoF wiki which has a huge database of custom songs, listed from A-Z, 0-9, Packs, and Albums. Keep in mind that the A-Z and 0-9 are listed by Artist name, and not song name. In the next steps, you will be shown how to download a song and add it to your GH3PC using the GHTCP."

Some of the download links will take you to a download/dropbox site where you can download the file, while others will take you to the thread which contains the song download. The song used for an example is \"Nottingham Lace\" by Buckethead. Under \"B\", you will scroll down to find the artist Buckethead, and the song Nottingham Lace. Notice that there are multiple links for the same song. Click on the link next to \"Puppetz\". The link will take you to a separate forum, which contains FoF user Puppetz. Located under \"My Official Career Packs\", click on \"Puppetz Hero Zero\"; this will take you to another thread with a setlist of songs from PHZ. Scroll down to the list of songs, and find Nottingham Lace once again, and click on the download link on the right. This will take you to an external site where you can download the song .zip file. Download the song from the external website. You will again need to use your file extractor to extract the files from the download into another folder."

If you are following the example, type in \"nottinghamlace\" in the Song Name section. After that, go down to where it says \"Guitar Track\", and click on the \"...\" to the right of that. Now you will locate the folder where you extracted the song files to. Open the guitar.ogg file from that folder. You can preview the guitar.ogg below to make sure the file works properly. Next, go down to \"Chart File\", and click on the \"...\" to the right of it. Open the notes.mid file from the same folder. Once these steps are completed, click on \"Apply\" in the top right of the pop up. This will take you to another pop up, \"Song Properties\". Here, you will enter the song title, Artist, and Year (optional). Once this is done, click on \"Apply\" once again. The song should now be added to the GHTCP. Next, you will add that song to the in-game setlist using GHTCP."

For this example, a separate new setlist will be created to add the song to. Click on \"Create Setlist\". Next, you will name your setlist whatever you'd like to name it, and you will name the tier where you will be adding the song to. Once you name these, locate your song in the song list to the left, and drag the song over to \"Tier Songs\". Next to \"Default Unlocked Songs\", click on the \"=\". This allocates space in the game for the song that you are adding (in the picture it shows 0 for default unlocked songs, but it should say 1). Once all of this is done, click on BOTH \"Apply Tier Changes\" and \"Apply Setlist Changes\". The next step will be one of the most important steps which you must not forget to do."

There are a lot of cool features to use within this custom menu, but the one that you are going to use for this tutorial is the \"Setlist Switcher\". Go to that menu, and you will notice that it lists all of the in-game setlists like \"Quickplay\" and \"Bonus\". Go to the \"Download\" setlist, and scroll down through that until you find your newly created setlist. Once this is done, MAKE SURE TO PRESS THE ORANGE BUTTON. The game will not change to the new setlist unless you press this button. Once this is done, go back to the main menu, and it will save these changes. Go to Quickplay, and then go to the \"Download\" setlist. If everything went right, the new setlist and the song that you added should be here. You are now ready to become a plastic guitar legend!"
