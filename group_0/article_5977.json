      "title": "Get out a container with a lid and add air holes.",
      "content": "Get out a container with a lid and add air holes. Woolly bear caterpillars are safe to keep in a clear glass or plastic container , like a mason jar, or a cardboard box. Just make sure the container has a jar lid to prevent the caterpillar from escaping. Then, punch holes in the lid so the caterpillar can breathe. [1] X Research source Alternatively, use a mesh lid. It's just important that the lid allows for some air circulation. Only keep 1 to 2 woolly bear caterpillars in the same container at a time. Dr. Ramsey says “it's important that you don't end up with a cage so full of woolly bears that everybody is not getting enough food because…they don't like to have to compete for resources.” [2] X Expert Source Samuel Ramsey, PhD Entomologist Expert Interview. 20 January 2021."

      "title": "Place twigs and leaves inside the container.",
      "content": "Place twigs and leaves inside the container. Your caterpillar needs places where they feel safe to hide, sleep, and eventually hibernate and build a cocoon. Cover the bottom of the container with leaves and plant debris. Then, find a few small twigs or branches outside and place them in the jar. [3] X Research source Angle the branches diagonally, as this allows the caterpillar to climb onto it when it's ready to build its cocoon. Adding twigs and leaves helps mimic the woolly bear caterpillar’s natural habitat. They live in moist fields, meadows, and forests."

    {
      "title": "Remove droppings in the container every day.",
      "content": "Remove droppings in the container every day. Each day, look for droppings (called frass) in the container. Simply scoop up the caterpillar with a twig or leaf and place it in a different jar as you clean. Then, use a tissue or paper towel to wipe up the droppings. Just add the caterpillar back to the container when you’re done. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep the container outside in a sheltered spot.",
      "content": "Keep the container outside in a sheltered spot. Woolly bear caterpillars need to feel the outside temperatures to know when to hibernate and build a cocoon. Set the container in a secure location outdoors, like on your patio, screened-in porch, garage, or a shed near your house. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Provide plants from where you found your caterpillar.",
      "content": "Provide plants from where you found your caterpillar. The easiest way to feed your woolly bear caterpillar is to give it leaves from the host plant you found it munching on. Simply remove some of the leaves and plants from where you found your caterpillar . Then, place them in the caterpillar's container. For example, if you found your caterpillar on a maple tree in your yard, remove some leaves and put them in your caterpillar's home. Tiger moths (the adult form of the woolly bear caterpillar) lay their eggs on leaves, weeds, and grasses, which are called host plants. When the eggs hatch, the larvae start eating. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Feed the caterpillar dandelions, clover, or grass if it wasn’t near plants.",
      "content": "Feed the caterpillar dandelions, clover, or grass if it wasn’t near plants. If you didn’t find the caterpillar on its host plant or near other plants, that’s okay—woolly bears are herbivores that like to eat a wide variety of plants. They tend to prefer low-growing, seed-bearing plants like dandelions, plantain weeds, dock, burdock, aster, nettle, goldenrod, clover, and sunflowers. They also munch on grasses, herbs, and leafy greens like spinach and cabbage. [7] X Research source Woolly bear caterpillars also eat some tree leaves. Dr. Ramsey says they usually like to eat “maple leaves and birch leaves .” [8] X Expert Source Samuel Ramsey, PhD Entomologist Expert Interview. 20 January 2021."

      "title": "Give your woolly bear fresh food every day.",
      "content": "Give your woolly bear fresh food every day. Woolly bear caterpillars need a constant supply of food until they hibernate and build their cocoon. Ensure your caterpillar has a fresh supply of leaves, weeds, and grasses each day. If you already fed your woolly bear for the day but they’re out of food, give them another helping. [9] X Research source Dr. Ramsey says to “make sure to replace the leaves when they start to become crunchy” because “woolly bears will only eat them while they are still soft.” [10] X Expert Source Samuel Ramsey, PhD Entomologist Expert Interview. 20 January 2021."

      "title": "Mist the jar or container with water regularly.",
      "content": "Mist the jar or container with water regularly. Woolly bear caterpillars get most of their water from plants. However, small droplets of water can help your caterpillar stay hydrated. Each day, use a spray bottle to mist the bottom of the container. [11] X Research source Woolly bear caterpillars do not need a water container to stay hydrated. Plus, they can actually be a drowning hazard"

    {
      "title": "Give your caterpillar food when it hibernates and after it wakes up.",
      "content": "Give your caterpillar food when it hibernates and after it wakes up. In the winter, woolly caterpillars go into hibernation to protect themselves from the cold temperatures. However, they may wake up from time to time and need to eat. Once they’re done hibernating in the spring, they’ll also need food to prepare for their transformation. [12] X Research source Check on your caterpillar regularly to see if it’s awake. Then, give it fresh leaves, weeds, or grass."

    {
      "title": "Move the container indoors when your caterpillar builds its cocoon.",
      "content": "Move the container indoors when your caterpillar builds its cocoon. In the spring, your caterpillar will rest on some leaves or a branch and stop moving. Then, it will start to spin a cocoon around itself. Once the caterpillar is fully inside the cocoon, it is safe to bring it inside. [13] X Research source This can also help you better observe the cocoon and watch for signs that the moth is emerging. When the woolly bear caterpillar spins its cocoon around itself, it’s called a pupa. During the pupa stage, it goes through metamorphosis and turns into a moth. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Feed the moth nectar when it emerges from the cocoon.",
      "content": "Feed the moth nectar when it emerges from the cocoon. After 1 to 3 weeks, a tiger moth will start to break out of the woolly bear’s cocoon. When you notice signs that it’s emerging, add a few fresh flowers to the container. Unlike the caterpillars, tiger moths only drink nectar. [15] X Research source Add a few extra twigs to the container to give the newly emerged moth something to perch on and dry its wings."

    {
      "title": "Release the moth after a few hours to 1 day.",
      "content": "Release the moth after a few hours to 1 day. Once the woolly bear caterpillar transforms into a tiger moth, Dr. Ramsey says “it's best to simply let them go.” You can keep your moth in the container for a few hours after it emerges to observe its new form and watch it eat. Then, release the moth outdoors near where you found it as a caterpillar. [16] X Expert Source Samuel Ramsey, PhD Entomologist Expert Interview. 20 January 2021. Dr. Ramsey says “it is very difficult for you to raise an adult moth,” as they can’t comfortably live in a container like a caterpillar can. [17] X Expert Source Samuel Ramsey, PhD Entomologist Expert Interview. 20 January 2021. Plus, your moth belongs in the wild. It needs to reproduce and lay eggs that hatch into new woolly bear caterpillars."

      "title": "Find woolly bears in the fall and spring in yards, fields, and trails.",
      "content": "Find woolly bears in the fall and spring in yards, fields, and trails. Most woolly bear caterpillars hatch in the fall. At this time, you’ll start to see them crawling almost anywhere there are plants, like yards, gardens, fields, and wooded areas. [18] X Research source Some species of woolly bear caterpillars lay a second round of eggs in the spring, so you may see caterpillars starting around May. [19] X Research source Woolly bear caterpillars tend to prefer moist, damp areas. In the fall, you might find woolly bear caterpillars under leaves, twigs, and logs to stay warm. You may see them crossing roads and sidewalks, too. Woolly bear caterpillars are widespread throughout the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. They are not found outside of North America."
