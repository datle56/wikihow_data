      "content": "Measure out the dry ingredients and mix for 5 seconds. Get out a large food processor and measure all of the dry ingredients into it. You'll need 2 1/3 cups (291 g) of unbleached, all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon (4 g) of sugar, 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 g) of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon (1 g) of baking powder. Put the lid on the processor and pulse the dry ingredients for about 5 seconds so they're combined. [1] X Research source If you don't have a food processor, you can whisk the ingredients in a mixing bowl."

      "content": "Cut 1 cup (226 g) of chilled, unsalted butter into 1/2-inch (12 mm) pieces. Put half of the butter into the food processor and pulse the mixture for 2 seconds. Put the rest of the butter into the processor and pulse the mixture three times (for about one second each). The dough will look somewhat crumbly. [2] X Research source If you're making the dough in a mixing bowl, use a pastry blender to cut the butter until it looks like coarse crumbs."

      "content": "Mix in the egg yolks. Place 2 large egg yolks into the dough mixture and pulse the dough twice. Each pulse should last 1 second. You'll still see bits of butter, but the egg yolks should be incorporated. [3] X Research source You can also stir the egg yolks in using a rubber spatula."

      "content": "Blend in the vinegar and vodka. Pour in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of chilled white or cider vinegar and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of ice-cold vodka. Process the dough for one or two seconds or until the dough forms a shaggy ball. You might need to add another teaspoon of vodka to get the dough to come together. [4] X Research source If you'd like to leave out the vodka, just add an extra 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 ml) of cold water."

If you'll be making classic tart shells, you can divide the dough into 8 evenly sized pieces and press them into 5-inch (12 cm) circles). Wrap each circle of dough in plastic wrap. Transfer your dough to the fridge and chill it for at least 30 minutes. [6] X Research source"

Use your fingers to gently press the dough into the bottom of the pan and up along the edges. Don't worry if excess dough hangs over the edges. [10] X Research source If you're having trouble transferring the dough to the tart pans, try folding them in half before you lift them.

Chill the tarts for at least 30 minutes. [12] X Research source You can refrigerate the prepared tart shells for up to 2 hours. If you want to freeze the shells to use later, remove the pie weights and re-wrap the tarts in more plastic wrap. Freeze the tarts for four to six weeks."
