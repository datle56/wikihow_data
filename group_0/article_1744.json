      "title": "A Sagittarius man and Aquarius woman are a dream team.",
      "content": "A Sagittarius man and Aquarius woman are a dream team. They have a ton in common—they’re both independent, loyal, spontaneous, and open-minded—and their expressive natures help them form a strong bond. Both are dedicated to pursuing their passions and being supportive of each other. Disagreements are rare in this pair, and chances are high that they can form a long-term relationship. [1] X Research source The Sagittarius man will accept an eccentric Aquarius woman wholly as she is, and she will enjoy his adventurous, impulsive side. From sex to conversations to dates, “fun” is the name of the game with these signs. Both partners are commitment-shy (especially Sagittarius, the most non-committal of all the signs), so it might take some time for them to settle into a relationship."

      "title": "An Aquarius woman and Sagittarius man understand each other like best friends.",
      "content": "An Aquarius woman and Sagittarius man understand each other like best friends. Their mental connection and the way they “get” each other is the foundation for their relationship. To outsiders, it might look like they’re just friends with benefits, but this is usually the kind of relationship both partners need (and neither of them is likely to care what other people think!). This is especially true for an Aquarius—they blend love and friendships, so there may not be a clear line where one ends and the other begins."

      "title": "A Sagittarius man and Aquarius woman have a fiery connection in bed.",
      "content": "A Sagittarius man and Aquarius woman have a fiery connection in bed. They both love to experiment and try new things, so they’ll never be bored or feel inhibited with each other. Sex isn’t super emotional for either of them—Sagittarius and Aquarius both prefer fun and excitement over romantic cuddles, kisses, and hugs. This is pretty common with passionate fire signs like Sagittarius and detached air signs like Aquarius (although the Aquarius woman will be less emotionally intense than her Sagittarius partner). Sometimes, an Aquarius woman might have a hard time bridging the gap from a physical relationship to something more serious. A Sagittarius man needs to make a point to let his Aquarius partner know he’s interested in her in a sexual manner pretty early on, or she’ll just think about sex as a concept instead of acting on it."

      "title": "Forming an intimate bond is a challenge for a Sagittarius man and Aquarius woman.",
      "content": "Forming an intimate bond is a challenge for a Sagittarius man and Aquarius woman. They both value personal freedom and want to give each other space, but they run the risk of drifting so far apart that there’s hardly a relationship. They’ll both have to prioritize each other and their relationship over their own needs for space to form a close connection. Thankfully, they’re both rational and when they do come together, they can communicate their emotions without guilt or pressure. Emotional vulnerability is especially hard for an Aquarius, who’s often described as an emotionally frozen air sign. In general, emotional intimacy might be the biggest issue in a Sagittarius-Aquarius partnership."

      "title": "A Sagittarius man will never run out of things to talk about with an Aquarius woman.",
      "content": "A Sagittarius man will never run out of things to talk about with an Aquarius woman. They both have varied interests and hobbies and enjoy each other’s conversation and intellectual ideas. Finding a mutual interest to talk about is key (especially for the boredom-prone Aquarius). These signs will never stop talking about a topic they both love, especially if it’s a problem that needs solving—they’ll work together to generate new ideas, solutions, and philosophies. [2] X Research source The best way for a Sagittarius man to engage an Aquarius woman is through an intellectual conversation. In fact, a great intellectual debate might seem flirtatious to her. Both partners can be hot headed and flare up during arguments (particularly blunt Sagittarius), but they forgive and forget quickly and easily. Aquarius is a fixed sign, so when she reaches a decision, it’s hard to get her to change her mind. Thankfully, mutable Sagittarius men know how to roll with things and they’re very flexible."

      "title": "Trust is solid between an Aquarius woman and Sagittarius man.",
      "content": "Trust is solid between an Aquarius woman and Sagittarius man. They understand each other’s need for space and are happy to give it. They’re not possessive of each other, but they can sometimes get jealous. Thankfully, both signs value commitment and they share an expectation that physical relationships outside of their partnership are off the table. Both partners deeply value honesty. This is never a problem unless Sagittarius’s blunt delivery upsets Aquarius, who is sensitive about feeling judged."

      "title": "Their many shared values are what make a Sagittarius man and Aquarius woman work.",
      "content": "Their many shared values are what make a Sagittarius man and Aquarius woman work. The most important of these is their mutual respect for independence—it’s what they both need for individual progress. An Aquarian woman needs space socially (she’s very definite about how she wants to be in society) and a Sagittarian man has a need for freedom to seek truth and justice throughout the world. They both also value making the world a better place, especially the Aquarius woman, who tends to be an altruist. Chances are they’ll support a lot of humanitarian causes together throughout their relationship. A thriving social life is important to them both too. Sagittarius and Aquarius attract friends easily because of their charisma, loyalty, and honesty."

      "title": "A Sagittarius man and Aquarius woman are a match made in the stars.",
      "content": "A Sagittarius man and Aquarius woman are a match made in the stars. Whatever issues they run into are typically minor, and their chemistry is off the charts. Bold Aquarius will give Sagittarius fiery energy on his adventures, while Sagittarius gives his Aquarian partner the support and assurance she needs to feel accepted and achieve her goals. They understand what the other needs without having to ask, and their relationship is full of love, enthusiasm, optimism, and adventure."

      "title": "Balancing independence and intimacy will make this relationship last.",
      "content": "Balancing independence and intimacy will make this relationship last. A Sagittarius man and Aquarius woman’s mental and sexual connection will be excellent, but their relationship won’t go far if they can’t find emotional closeness. Open, judgment-free communication will help them build that bond. They’re both fast-paced individuals, so slowing down and taking the time to acknowledge their own feelings will make their connection more genuine, too. When a Sagittarius man strives to be less self-centered and an Aquarius woman works on being less cold, they can be vulnerable enough to let each other in."
