Use a measuring tape or ruler to measure the distance between the 2 blocks and position them so they are parallel. The holes on the cinder blocks should be facing up. [1] X Research source If you don’t have concrete slabs lay down a 1 inch (2.5 cm)-thick layer of gravel under each cinder block. Concrete blocks or gravel will prevent bugs from eating away at the wood. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Lay 2 4x4 boards on top of the cinder blocks. Each 4x4 board should be 5–6 feet (1.5–1.8 m) long. Lay the boards on top of the cinder blocks on their wide side. The boards should run parallel and be around 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) apart depending on the size of your cinder blocks. This will form the base that you’ll rest your firewood on. [3] X Research source Make sure the boards don’t completely cover the holes in the cinder blocks. If your boards are longer than 6 feet (1.8 m) long, use a saw to cut them down to size. You can also use thick landscaping timbers as an alternative to the 4x4 boards."

Each 2x4 board should be at least 4 feet (1.2 m) long. The boards should be sticking up vertically out of the cinder blocks. [4] X Research source The 2x4 boards will hold the wood in and ensure that it doesn’t overflow on the sides of the rack."
