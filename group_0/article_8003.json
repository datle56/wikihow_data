      "content": "Wipe away light dirt and grime. If your boots aren’t especially dirty, you can usually clean them easily with a damp cloth. To prevent dirtiness from building up on your boots and causing longer cleaning times, do this after each time you use your boots. To increase the dirt fighting potential of your damp cloth, mix 1 tsp (5 ml) of dish soap with a ¼ gallon (1 L) of water. Douse your rag in this, and wipe down the boots. Wipe your boots from the top to the bottom. This way, you’re less likely to cause dirt and grime to drip onto already cleaned parts of the boots. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove dirtiness with a hose. Take your boots to a suitable area in your yard and spray them thoroughly with water from a hose. It may take some time before the dirtiness loosens and comes off. After most of the dirtiness has been removed, wipe away any that remains with a damp cloth. If you do not have a suitable place in your yard to do this, or if you do not have a yard, wash your boots in your bathtub or shower instead. For mud that just doesn’t want to come off, combine 1 tsp (5 ml) of baking soda with ½ cup (237 ml) of warm water. Rub this onto the stubborn mud, wait 15 to 30 minutes, then rinse the solution and the mud free. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Brush difficult grime from the soles of your boots. Use caution when using a brush on your boots. Stiff bristle brushes, especially, can do damage to the boots or cause them to discolor. Use a soft bristle scrub brush to prevent damage. Avoid using a brush on the upper parts of the brush. Use moderate to light pressure when scrubbing. Failing to do so can cause premature wear on the rubber. Use an old toothbrush to get into the small grooves on the soles of your boots.

      "content": "Erase scuff marks with oil. Over time, your rubber boots may have become scuffed, creating unsightly discoloration. Apply some oil, like olive oil, to a soft cloth. Rub the cloth on the scuff marks in a circular fashion to erase these. If the rag-oil technique didn’t work on your scuff marks, try a normal gum eraser, like the kind you use for pencils. Apply this gently to scuff marks to make them disappear."
