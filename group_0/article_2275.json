      "content": "Examine common practices. A majority of scams follow similar types of fact patterns. This occurs because scammers know what works and what doesn't, and they try to scam you by doing what works best. First, scammers will use fear to try and get you to do something. For example, some scammers might say that a relative has been arrested and needs money. Second, scammers will try to rush you to make a decision quickly. The longer you think about what is happening, the more likely it is that you will not become a victim."

Because some of the most common scams attempt to gain access to your personal information, one of the easiest ways to avoid scams is to protect that personal information. Keep passwords, account numbers, and sensitive paperwork in a safe place. Do not keep this information on your phone where it can be found. In addition, do not leave your mail somewhere where scammers might be able to get ahold of it. If you can, have your mail deposited directly into your home, as opposed to a mailbox. If you have a mailbox, take your mail out as soon as possible. If you get a solicitation asking you for your personal information, never willingly give it out. Take extra steps to ensure the solicitation is legitimate before you move forward.
