      "content": "Plan a date night by randomly selecting a letter and choosing a date idea. There are a few different ways to organize your alphabet dating challenge—depending on you and your partner’s preferences and schedule. One way to play is to label twenty-six slips of paper with letters A-Z. Put all of the letters into a bowl or jar and set the container aside. When you and your partner want to go on a date, select a random letter from the bowl and pick a date from that letter’s list. [1] X Research source If you and your partner want to be a bit more regimented and purposeful with your dates, set a goal to complete one “alphabet date night” every week or every month. You can set yourself a timeframe (i.e., complete all letters within six months or one year), or not! [2] X Research source Alternatively, plan ahead of time by designating each letter to a week and going in order. Planning ahead may be especially useful if some of your favorite alphabet date ideas are seasonal—like ice skating or a Renaissance Faire. Instead of using paper slips, you can also use a virtual roulette wheel or other online tool to randomly select your letter. Make sure to personalize your alphabet date ideas to you and your partner. Choose options that speak to your personality and interests, but be open to try new things too! Aim for a balance of extravagant vs. simple, seasonal vs. year-round, and new-to-you vs. comfortable."

If you’ve ever struggled to come up with new date night ideas for you and a partner, the alphabet dating challenge seeks to provide a solution! Instead of trying to come up with a fun and unique date idea from scratch, simply choose a letter of the alphabet and plan a date that starts with that letter. [3] X Research source For example, let’s say your letter for date night that week is C. You could go c ycling, take a c ooking class, or watch a c omedy show!"
