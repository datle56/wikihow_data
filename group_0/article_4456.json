      "content": "Schedule time to have the breakup discussion. It’s best and most respectful to end your relationship in person and discuss your reasoning. Scheduling some time in a quiet place that will allow you and your partner to be alone can help make the process easier and minimize intrusive interruptions. [1] X Research source . Consider scheduling time that is not during the work or school week so the person can begin to mourn the relationship in private without having to face others immediately. [2] X Research source You may want to signal your partner or significant other about the nature of the conversation so that they can prepare themselves and don’t feel blindsided. [3] X Research source For example, say something like “I’d like to talk about the status of our relationship in a calm and peaceful manner.”"

      "content": "Choose an appropriate location to break up. Have the conversation privately to prevent the risk of embarrassing yourself or the other person. In addition, pick a place you can leave easily so that you don’t get into a protracted or circuitous conversation. [4] X Research source If you feel unsafe with your partner, break up in public or bring someone who can back you up without being confrontational. If you and your significant other live together, breaking up can be particularly problematic and stressful. It is up to you whether or not you move out immediately or take your time. If you don't feel safe or comfortable staying in the home you share with your partner, arrange for a place to stay before you have the talk. Move all of your stuff while they are not home and then break up when they come home or break up and leave with some of your things, then plan to come back when things have calmed down."

      "content": "Plan what you want to say during the breakup conversation. Consider what to say to the person. Having a basic plan for your conversation can help you avoid becoming over-emotional and keep you on track. It may also make it easier for you not to hurt the person any more than necessary. [5] X Research source The actual break-up conversation may last longer than you expect, especially if your partner is devastated or completely surprised by your decision. Many conversations can go around in circles, so consider giving it a time limit. [6] X Research source Be honest with the person, but not mean or brutal. Try to be as honest as possible without hurting the other person’s feelings. “While it might be difficult to share your true feelings and reasons for the breakup, in the long run, it will hurt your partner more if you don’t acknowledge the real issues involved. At the same time, it’s also important to recognize when too much honesty can be counterproductive,” advises Ratson. You may want to consider telling the person what first attracted you to them or highlight some of his good qualities as you discuss why you no longer want to stay in the relationship. [7] X Research source For example, you can say, “I was really attracted to your outgoing personality and kindness when we were first together, but I am afraid we have different goals that make it difficult to continue as a couple.”"

      "content": "Break up in person if it’s safe. Although it may be easier to break up with someone if you don't have to look them in the eye, ending a relationship by phone, text, or email is impersonal and disrespectful. Ratson says, “Breakups by text may be common these days, but if the relationship was meaningful to you, it’s respectful to break up in person.” Unless you're in a long-distance relationship and choose not to wait until you see the person again or are afraid of the other person, give the person the respect they and your former relationship deserve. [8] X Research source Breaking up in person can also help the person realize you are serious about ending the relationship. [9] X Research source"

Approach the break-up as calmly and respectfully as possible, with a sense of resolution, which may help make a bad situation seem slightly less negative and devastating. [10] X Research source Don’t badmouth the person or say things you may regret. Remember that this can come back and hurt you in the long run. [11] X Research source For example, you wouldn’t want to say, “I think your personal hygiene is terrible, and it disgusts me to be with you.” Instead, say, “I think we just have different styles of living that are not compatible with one another.” Avoid being overly emotional. This can help minimize any feelings of guilt you may have and can also help you stay resolute in your decision. [12] X Research source Say, “I think you’re a fine person with many really great qualities that will make someone happy, but they’re just not compatible with what I envision in a relationship.”"

      "content": "Focus on the relationship issues, not the person. Talk about what isn't working for you in the relationship rather than telling the other person what is wrong with them. “Own your decision and acknowledge that it’s what you want, rather than blaming it on circumstances or your partner,” Ratson suggests. Talking about them personally can worsen an already devastating situation. [13] X Research source For instance, instead of saying, \"You're clingy and insecure,\" try saying, \"I need a lot of independence and freedom in my relationships.\" [14] X Research source Don’t put the reasons for breaking up on the person, either. For example, saying “You deserve more” allows your partner to say that you are perfect for them and that there is no reason to split up. [15] X Research source Instead, say, “I feel like we’re on different paths in life. I want a career in academia that requires a lot of travel and time alone.”"

Ratson says to “be clear about your reasons for breaking up. Avoid vagueness. Show your partner the respect and integrity needed for closure.” Leaving the door open for them can only hurt them and you more. [16] X Research source Making statements such as “we’ll talk later” or “I want to be friends/I want you in my life” leave the door open for the person to hope things will work out in the end, even if you’ve decided they won’t. [17] X Research source Tell them nicely you can’t have any contact going forward. You may want to tell them this is the best thing for both of you to allow time to heal. [18] X Research source If you want to stay friends , set the parameters for this in your conversation. You may both realize that breaking up is best for your relationship, but you still enjoy one another’s company. However, be very clear in your expectations and needs for the friendship."

This can help you stick to your decision and may minimize potential manipulation by the person. Prepare for: Questions Your partner will likely want to know why you don't want to be with them anymore and whether there was anything they could have done to prevent the breakup. Answer the questions as honestly as possible. Crying Your partner may be very upset and show it. Offer comfort, but don't allow yourself to be manipulated into changing your decision. [20] X Research source Arguing Your partner may dispute anything you've said during the breakup, including dissecting examples you used in your reasons for breaking up. Don't get dragged into a fight about petty details that don't matter in the bigger picture. Let your partner know that arguing isn't going to change your decision. If they try to argue with you, simply say, “I’m not going to get involved in an argument and will walk away if you continue.” Bargaining or begging Your partner may offer to change or to do things differently to preserve the relationship. If the person didn't change when you discussed your problems in the past, it's too late to expect them to truly change now. Lashing out Your partner may say hurtful things and \"push your buttons\" to feel better. For example, if your partner calls you a nasty name, simply acknowledge it and move on. Say, “I can tell you are very angry with me, but I will not tolerate being called nasty names, so maybe we need to end this conversation.” Threats of physical harm or escalations are serious. If this happens, leave immediately."

Minimize contact with your ex and his friends to help prevent feelings of guilt over their sadness or give them false hope. If you have children with the person, you may be unable to distance yourself completely. Keep your relationship as civil as possible when you run into them, and put the well-being of your children first. It may help to delete the person’s number from your phone and their email from your computer. If you live together, move out as quickly as possible. If you can't move permanently, find somewhere to keep your stuff and somewhere to stay for the short term. Allowing them to hold on to your belongings prolongs the entanglement and complicates the process."

This is especially true if it was a long-term relationship or you broke up due to conflicting life goals. Tell yourself it’s normal to have these feelings and give yourself whatever time you need to work through your emotions. [21] X Research source Grief is a necessary reaction to any type of loss. It can cause both emotional and physical symptoms, like sadness, anger, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and low appetite. While grief may not be fun, it’s a part of the healing process.

It’s important to clarify your reasons for breaking up for your own peace of mind and so you can give the other person concrete answers. This helps you distinguish between simple road bumps in a relationship and more serious, irreconcilable issues between you and your partner. [27] X Research source Only you can decide which issues are irreconcilable issues and what you can overcome. For example, if your partner doesn’t treat others well or doesn’t want children, these are often factors that cannot be changed. On the other hand, a person’s unwillingness to help around the house may be something they can amend. Every couple has arguments, but if those spats are constant and ugly, it may suggest deeper issues and incompatibility. [28] X Research source If you're in an emotionally or physically harmful relationship, it’s usually a clear sign to end the partnership. [29] X Research source Not all abuse is physical. If you suspect you may be in a controlling or emotionally abusive relationship, learn the signs of an abusive relationship and talk to a counselor."

If you eventually decide to end the relationship, this may make it seem less abrupt and soften the blow because you'll have already voiced your frustration. [37] X Research source Bottling up your feelings often leads to blowing up or expressing your emotions in inappropriate ways. [38] X Research source Try to respectfully and calmly tell your partner what is bothering you. Avoid shouting, abuse, or blaming. Ratson shares that it’s always best to take the high road and have compassion. If your partner has cheated on or harmed you in some way, you may consider these irreconcilable differences that don’t deserve communicating your frustration or giving the person a chance to change. If you fear for your safety or the safety of children or pets, talking to your partner may not be the best step. Contact a domestic violence program in your area or reach out to the National Domestic Violence Hotline for help in creating a safety plan."

Setting a time limit for any changes you ask of your partner can help make your decision easier in the long run. You may or may not tell your partner about your timetable. Issuing ultimatums by saying, \"If you quit smoking by next month, we can stay together,\" can lead partners to agree in the short term before going back to their old ways in the near future. If you give an ultimatum, make sure it’s helpful. In most cases, ultimatums don’t work. However, it may be necessary for your relationship to remain tenable. For example, say, “I need to see you make an effort to quit or significantly reduce your smoking habit for this to work.” Issuing ultimatums such as “You need to want to have children” will likely never work and only cause harm and feelings of guilt. [39] X Research source For some people, changing long-established behaviors can take a while. For example, it can take smokers months or years to quit their habit.
