      "content": "Wipe off visible dirt with a soft brush or pick it up with a lint roller. Gently brush the dirt off the shoe with an upward motion so it doesn’t get ground further into the fibers. If you’re using a lint roller, go over the dirty area lightly to pick up dirt without pushing it deeper into the exterior. If your shoes got muddy, it’s best to let the mud fully dry before trying to treat the stain. It’s easier to brush away dried mud and the likelihood of spreading the mud to other areas of the shoe will be smaller."

      "content": "Combine 1 cup (240 mL) of cool water and 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of mild laundry detergent. Put the water and laundry detergent into a small bowl and stir them together until the water gets sudsy. If you have a gentle detergent, like Woolite, that would work great for your felt shoes. But regular dye- and fragrance-free laundry detergent will also work. If you don’t have mild laundry detergent, you could sub 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of white vinegar to create a gentle alternative cleaning solution."

      "title": "Dip a clean towel into the soapy water and blot the stain.",
      "content": "Dip a clean towel into the soapy water and blot the stain. If possible, use a white towel so you can see how much of the stain has transferred off of the shoes and onto the towel. Rinse the towel in clean water and repeat the blotting process until the stain is gone, which may take 5-10 minutes depending on how large the stain was to begin with. Because felt is a fairly fragile fabric, avoid vigorous scrubbing and instead gently press down on the stain repeatedly."

      "title": "Treat tougher stains by scrubbing them gently with a soft brush.",
      "content": "Treat tougher stains by scrubbing them gently with a soft brush. If the stain still seems like it’s not coming up after blotting it with the soapy towel, you may need to scrub it a little harder. Dip a soft brush into the water and laundry detergent mixture, then gently brush the stained area back and forth. Avoid pressing down too hard and try your best to use a light touch. [1] X Research source Brushing the stain back and forth helps the soap get deeper into the fibers of the shoe. After scrubbing the stain, you could go back to blotting the area with the damp towel to see if the combination of the two methods helps."

      "title": "Use a specific spot remover if the detergent doesn’t work on the stain.",
      "content": "Use a specific spot remover if the detergent doesn’t work on the stain. Depending on what you got on your shoes, you may need something a little stronger to remove the stain. A grease remover, white vinegar, or rubbing alcohol may work. Try the following methods for various stains: [2] X Research source Blot grease stains with a towel soaked in rubbing alcohol or grease remover. Dab bloodstains with a towel soaked in white vinegar, then blot the area with cold water. Treat grass stains by putting mild laundry detergent directly on the stain, then blot it with a towel soaked in rubbing alcohol."

      "title": "Trim away stained fibers that won’t come clean.",
      "content": "Trim away stained fibers that won’t come clean. This won’t always be an option depending on how deep the stain is, but if there are fuzzy, discolored fibers that can be cut off, try to carefully trim them with a pair of fine scissors. [3] X Research source This may work especially well if the fibers got a little fuzzy or stretched while you were cleaning the stain."

      "title": "Lay your shoes on a clean towel and let them air dry.",
      "content": "Lay your shoes on a clean towel and let them air dry. Never put your felt shoes into the dryer, and avoid placing them close to any heat sources. Heat has the potential to misshape your shoes. Instead, place your shoes somewhere safe where they won’t be in the way, and let them dry for 12-24 hours. [4] X Research source Once the exterior and interior of your shoes are dry to the touch, you can go ahead and wear them again."

      "title": "Remove the laces and insoles from your felt shoes.",
      "content": "Remove the laces and insoles from your felt shoes. Slide the insole out from the interior of each shoe. Undo the laces and put them off to the side so they can be cleaned separately from the actual shoe itself. [5] X Research source Some shoes don’t have removable insoles."

      "title": "Use a soft brush to wipe off any visible dirt from the outside of the shoes.",
      "content": "Use a soft brush to wipe off any visible dirt from the outside of the shoes. Before putting the shoes into the washing machine, take a moment to brush away any dirt or grime that is stuck to the shoes. This will help them get cleaner and won’t potentially clog your washing machine. [7] X Research source Wipe away from the shoe so you don’t grind the dirt further into the felt."

      "title": "Keep the shoes from warping by washing them with a load of towels.",
      "content": "Keep the shoes from warping by washing them with a load of towels. The buffer of towels will keep the shoes from getting misshapen from hitting the sides of the machine repeatedly, and it’ll also keep the noise level down. If you’re worried about the towels getting roughed up by the shoes, place the shoes in a mesh laundry bag beforehand. [8] X Research source If you don’t have a load of towels to wash, throw in a blanket for the same effect."

      "content": "Wash the shoes on a delicate cycle with cold water and a mild detergent. If you don’t have Woolite, use a dye- and fragrance-free laundry detergent to clean your shoes. Set the washing machine to use cold water and run the shoes through a delicate cycle to clean them without exposing them to too much agitation. [9] X Research source Avoid using hot water, as heat can shrink and warp felt."

      "title": "Clean your insoles and laces by hand in cool water with a mild detergent.",
      "content": "Clean your insoles and laces by hand in cool water with a mild detergent. Fill a bowl or basin with cool water and about 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of mild laundry detergent. Soak the insoles and laces in the water, then use a soft brush to gently scrub them. Rinse them with cool, clean water, and squeeze out the excess liquid before setting them to the side to dry. [10] X Research source If your shoes are hand-wash only, follow this same process to clean them."

      "content": "Air-dry your shoes, insoles, and laces rather than putting them into the dryer. High heat could damage your shoes, so avoid putting them in the dryer or in front of other heat sources, like a radiator or space heater. Instead, lay them out on a clean, dry towel and let them air-dry for about 24 hours, or until they’re dry to the touch. [11] X Research source If you live in a high-humidity area, it may take longer for your shoes to dry."

      "content": "Replace the insoles and the laces and enjoy your freshly-cleaned shoes. Once everything is dry, slip the insoles back in place, and re-lace your shoes. Hopefully, any stains will be gone and your shoes will smell good for the next couple of weeks. [12] X Research source You can clean your shoes anytime they get dirty or smelly. Just make sure there is enough time for them to dry before you need to wear them again."
