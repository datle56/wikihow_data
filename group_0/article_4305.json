      "content": "Leave the skin in place. Red potatoes can actually be boiled with the skin still on. This better preserves the flavor during the boiling process and adds a nice texture. A potato's skin is also rich in nutrients. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Chop the potatoes.",
      "content": "Chop the potatoes. Potatoes boil faster when chopped into small chunks. Cut your potato into small cubes of roughly even size. [2] X Research source If you're going to be mashing the potatoes, you do not have to worry too much about precise size. However, if you're making something like potato salad, consult your recipe. It should advise you on the correct sized chunks. When not following a recipe, chunk about an inch or half an inch thick (2.5 or 1.2 centimeters) should be sufficient."

      "content": "Submerge your potatoes in water. Place your potatoes in a pot. Cover the potatoes with enough water so they are fully submerged. [3] X Research source As salt helps flavor potatoes as they cook, add about one and a half to tablespoons of salt to the water (22.5 to 30 mL). [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Simmer the potatoes until they're tender.",
      "content": "Simmer the potatoes until they're tender. Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high. Simmer your potatoes for 10 to 15 minutes. When they're done, the potatoes should be tender. [6] X Research source You should be able to easily cut through the potatoes with a fork. When you're done, you can drain the potatoes over the sink using a colander. If you're using a specific recipe, consult that recipe. If your recipe requires firmer potatoes, you may need to simmer your potatoes for a shorter timeframe."

      "title": "Use the boiled red potatoes for mashed potatoes.",
      "content": "Use the boiled red potatoes for mashed potatoes. While russet (brown) potatoes are more commonly used for mashed potatoes, red potatoes can make excellent mashed potatoes, too. If you want mashed potatoes, you can easily mash your potatoes with a fork after boiling them. It may help to boil the potatoes for 5 to 10 minutes longer if mashing them, as they'll be more tender. In addition to butter, add some milk to your potatoes before mashing them."

      "title": "Make potato salad.",
      "content": "Make potato salad. If you want to use your red potatoes for cold potato salad, boil them, drain them, and place them in the refrigerator for an hour or so until they cool. Then, you can mix them with other ingredients to make potato salad. Chop the potatoes once cool. The pieces should be less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. Toss the potatoes with 6 hard boiled and chopped eggs, 1 lb (450 g) fried and crumbled bacon, 1 stalk chopped celery, 1 chopped onion, and 2 cups (500 ml) mayonnaise until evenly mixed. Keep the potato salad cool until you serve it."

      "title": "Top with cheese.",
      "content": "Top with cheese. A simple way to dress up your boiled red potatoes is simply to cover them with melted or toasted cheese. Parmesan cheese works for a quick, no fuss dressing, but cheddar cheese or mozzarella cheese works well if you are willing to put in a few extra minutes of effort. Grated Parmesan cheese can just be sprinkled on without any additional work. For shredded cheddar, mozzarella, or other similar cheeses, sprinkle the boiled and drained potatoes. Microwave the cheese-covered potatoes for 30 seconds to melt the cheese. If you want to toast the cheese lightly and give the edges of the potatoes a mildly crispy edge, transfer the boiled and cheese-covered potatoes to a greased baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) on the top rack of the oven."

      "title": "Sprinkle with additional spices or dressings.",
      "content": "Sprinkle with additional spices or dressings. Red potatoes are versatile, so they can work well with many dressings made from savory herbs or savory spices. Experiment with different spices to add flavor to your potatoes. For instance, a quick way to add color and flavor to your boiled and drained red potatoes would be to sprinkle them with 1 tsp (5 ml) of paprika. Similarly, you can combine 1 tsp (5 ml) of paprika with 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of olive oil, whisking well until combined. Toss the cooked and drained potatoes in this mixture so that they benefit from the flavors of both the paprika and the oil."

      "content": "Make “loaded” potatoes. While loaded potatoes tend to be baked russet potatoes, you can create a similar dish with boiled and drained red potatoes. This can be a great appetizer for a party. If the potatoes are not already quartered, cut them into quarters. Place a serving size on a dish. Coat with butter and toss until covered. Cover with a sprinkle of shredded cheddar cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and a dash of chopped fresh chives or green onions. Consider sprinkling with bacon bits, as well."
