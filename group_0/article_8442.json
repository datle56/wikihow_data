      "content": "Locate the speakers on your phone. iPhone speakers are typically located on the bottom to the left and right of the charger port. Samsung speakers are typically on the bottom as well, but usually restricted to the left or right of the charger port. Ear speakers are almost always located on the top of the front face of the phone where you place your ear. Take note of alternative speaker locations, such as the side near the volume button or on the bottom of the phone's front face. You may want to clean your phone screen first to remove any excess debris."

Gently move it in circular motions over your speaker holes while applying a bit of pressure. Continue this process until all the dirt is out. If the speaker holes are big enough, press the swab into the holes. But don't press too hard—just enough that the cotton at the tip enters the slot. Once inside, rub the swab left and right while applying a bit of pressure. [2] X Research source Switch cotton swabs when they get dirty. For better results, dab a small amount of rubbing alcohol onto your cotton swab. [3] X Expert Source Mitch Harris Consumer Technology Expert Expert Interview. 31 August 31 2021."

      "content": "Compress sticky tac into a small ball and press it onto the speaker holes. Break off a 1 inch (2.5 cm) piece of sticky tac and start squeezing it into a ball. Keep compressing it until it's soft and malleable. Afterward, press it down onto the speaker holes. Apply enough pressure that the sticky tac gets into the speaker. Hold it down for 2 to 3 seconds and remove it—you should see dirt stuck to the sticky tac. Continue this process until no more dirt comes out of the speakers. [4] X Research source Move your sticky tac around so that you're always using its clean surface. Purchase sticky tac from office supply stores or online suppliers."

      "content": "Clean small speaker grills using a medium bristle toothbrush. Tilt the brush toward either the top or bottom of your phone. Keep it parallel to the top of your phone and move it in up and down motions. Afterward, turn your toothbrush vertical (parallel to the side of your phone) and clean by moving it in left and right motions. [5] X Research source Angle the brush upward and scrub with the bottom bristles for tough dirt. Always use a medium bristle brush—soft bristles aren't good enough to remove dirt, while the stronger ones are too thick to reach into the small speaker holes."

      "content": "Purchase a can of compressed air. You can find compressed air cans at office supply stores, electronics stores, and online suppliers. Test it by aiming it downward and pressing the nozzle down. Get a feel for how much air comes out with each spray. Purchase a can with a straw for increased accuracy. This is also a great way to clean a television screen."

      "content": "Connect the straw to the nozzle of the can to improve accuracy. Screw the thin straw onto the nozzle of your compressed air can. Give it a test by aiming it downward and pressing the nozzle down. The air should blow from the tip of the straw. [6] X Research source Tighten the straw if you can feel air coming out of the sides of the nozzle as you spray. Skip the straw if you're comfortable aiming your compressed air can without it."

      "content": "Blow compressed air into the speaker slot in 3 to 4 short blasts. Keep the nozzle or tip of the straw at least 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) from the speaker opening. This will remove excess dirt that was pressed into the speaker from your cotton swab. [7] X Research source Don't blow too close to the speaker or you can damage the phone's internal electrical components. If you're using the straw, hold it with your non-dominant hand to keep it steady as you blow air."

      "content": "Remove the back lid from your phone with a suction cup and spudger. Heat the perimeter of your phone for about 15 seconds using a hairdryer on low heat. Afterward, apply a suction cup to the back. With the screen facing down, gently pull the suction handle toward you. At the same time, insert the flat end of a spudger in between the perimeter opening and lever it toward you. Continue levering the back piece—while still pulling on the suction cup—until it pops off. [8] X Research source You can purchase a spudger—a tool with a wide flat-head screwdriver end that is used as a wedge—from home hardware stores If you're having trouble, apply more heat to the perimeter to loosen the glue holding to two phone pieces in place. With older and cheaper phone models, you can pry the back off with your hands. For newer and more expensive phones with glass backs, this isn't possible."

Gently scrub the speaker pieces until they are clean. For the openings, blow into them gently from the outside. Afterward, dip a cotton swab into alcohol and gently rub it through the speaker openings. You can also use a soft cloth or lint-free paper towel. However, they are not as effective at picking up dirt. Be sure to let the speakers and openings dry before putting your speaker back together."

      "content": "Remove the second back piece if you still can't access your speakers. In some phones—typically Samsung brands—you need to remove a second back piece to access your speaker openings. These phones will have 10 to 13 more screws to remove, although the exact number varies by model and manufacturer. Use a #3 Phillips 4 inch (10 cm) screwdriver to turn each screw counterclockwise until they come loose. Afterward, pull off the second back piece. [10] X Research source Pull off the plastic film covering the screws if your phone has one. Once the second back piece is off, you can access and clean speaker openings and speakers. However, in some cases you will only be able to clean the openings. Snap the back piece back on when you're finished cleaning the speakers and reattach the screws. Afterward, you can reattach the metal covers to the speakers and snap the back lid back on."
