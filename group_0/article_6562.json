      "title": "Wash and dry your hands thoroughly.",
      "content": "Wash and dry your hands thoroughly. Lather your hands with antibacterial soap and rub them together for at least 20 seconds. Make sure that the soap gets in between your fingers as you go. Once you‘ve thoroughly scrubbed your hands, rinse them off with warm water. Be sure to air-dry or wipe them on a paper towel before continuing. [1] X Research source If you aren’t near any soap or water, use a hand sanitizer instead. It's extremely important to clean your hands so as to not deposit any bacteria into the piercing."

      "content": "Unscrew the metal balls at the end of bar jewelry. Pinch the end of the metal ball on one side of your nipple bar. Rotate this ball counter-clockwise until it comes off the jewelry. Be sure to set this aside in a safe place so that you don’t lose it. [2] X Research source Keep in mind the “righty-tighty, lefty-loosey” rule whenever you remove body jewelry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slide the metal bar out of your nipple.",
      "content": "Slide the metal bar out of your nipple. Pinch the end of the metal bar with the ball still attached. Carefully and methodically, pull the bar straight out of the piercing. Don’t try to force it out or remove it too quickly, as you don’t want to damage the piercing in the process. Afterwards, set the bar aside for safekeeping so you don’t lose it. [3] X Research source If you have difficulty removing the bar, contact a local piercer for assistance. If you’re wearing a nipple shield, slide this part off first."

    {
      "title": "Place the bar back in the metal ball so you don’t lose it.",
      "content": "Place the bar back in the metal ball so you don’t lose it. Screw the loose metal ball back onto the end of the bar. Rotate the ball clockwise, continuing until it’s securely attached to the rest of the jewelry. Set this item into a jewelry box or other secure place so you don’t lose it later. [4] X Research source If you don’t have one already, consider making or purchasing a jewelry box for your nipple ornaments."

    {
      "title": "Sterilize your hands with soap and water.",
      "content": "Sterilize your hands with soap and water. Coat your hands with soap, lathering the product all over your fingers and palms until it’s sudsy. Ideally, try using antibacterial soap to make your hands as sterile as possible. Rub your hands together for at least 20 seconds before rinsing off all of the soap with warm water. After this, be sure to dry your hands thoroughly with a towel or air-dry them. [5] X Research source Be sure to also wash your wrists and the back of your hands."

      "title": "Slide a thin, closed pair of scissors into the ring.",
      "content": "Slide a thin, closed pair of scissors into the ring. Take a pair of scissors and insert it in the open loop of the nipple ring. Use extreme caution when you do this, and make sure that the pair of scissors is closed before placing it anywhere near your nipple. Only slide the scissors about 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so through the ring. [6] X Research source To be extra cautious, use a small, thin pair of safety scissors instead of regular scissors."

    {
      "title": "Open the scissors slightly to loosen the ring.",
      "content": "Open the scissors slightly to loosen the ring. Pry open the handle of the scissors slowly to force the edges of the ring apart. Use slow, methodical motions as you do this, as you don’t want to damage the jewelry in the process. Continue opening the scissors by a few millimeters until the hoop opens up. [7] X Research source Some nipple rings have a clasping mechanism. In this case, pinch your fingers on both sides of the ring to pry it open. Try and angle the tips of the scissors away from your nipple as you remove the ring."

      "title": "Remove the metal hoop from your nipple to take out the jewelry.",
      "content": "Remove the metal hoop from your nipple to take out the jewelry. Angle the ring carefully so that it’s easier to pull out of the piercing. Using slow, careful movements, ease the metal ring out of the piercing. If the bead is connected or attached to one side of the hoop, slide the ring out via the non-bead side. [8] X Research source If you have any trouble getting a nipple ring out, be sure to contact a professional for help."

    {
      "title": "Wash your jewelry",
      "content": "Wash your jewelry with warm water and salt to keep it sterile. Create a cleaning mixture by stirring 1 tsp (5.69 g) of antibacterial soap into a small glass of warm water. Place your ring, bar, or shield in the solution for 5 minutes. Be sure to stir in the salt until it dissolves. [9] X Research source If your jewelry doesn’t have extra accessories like rhinestones, jewels, or acrylics, consider boiling the metal instead."

      "title": "Slide the bar through the piercing to keep it in place.",
      "content": "Slide the bar through the piercing to keep it in place. Pinch the end of the metal bar with 2 fingers and begin finessing it through the piercing. Work slowly and methodically as you do this, unless the bar immediately slides through the piercing. If the jewelry doesn’t go in, try inserting it with slow, careful movements. Don’t force in any jewelry, though, as you don’t want to damage your nipple. [10] X Research source If you’re having difficulty inserting any of your jewelry, ask a piercing professional for assistance. They have the tools and the skill that makes it much easier to put it back in."

      "title": "Screw the loose metal ball on the end of the jewelry if you’re using a bar.",
      "content": "Screw the loose metal ball on the end of the jewelry if you’re using a bar. Secure the piercing into place by screwing the other metal ball to the end of the bar. Slowly turn the ball clockwise, using your pinched fingers to keep the metal piece in place. Don’t let go of the metal ball until you’re positive that it’s secured to the rest of the jewelry.

      "title": "Line the bar up in the center slot if you’re wearing a shield.",
      "content": "Line the bar up in the center slot if you’re wearing a shield. Place the nipple shield on top of the metal bar, setting the bar in the center. Make sure that metal is centered in the nipple shield before placing the shield onto the surface of your nipple. Proceed as you normally would, inserting the metal bar through both the shield opening and the piercing to secure the jewelry into place. [12] X Research source Nipple shields have a special slot for the bar to go through. Make sure that the bar goes through this, or else the shield won’t be secure."

      "title": "Secure the jewelry with a bead when wearing a nipple ring.",
      "content": "Secure the jewelry with a bead when wearing a nipple ring. Take the bead-free end of the nipple ring and gently slide it through the entrance of the piercing. Don’t try to force it in or push it through quickly—instead, use gentle, careful movements as you guide the ring through. Once the ring is in place, secure both ends with the metal bead. [13] X Research source Some nipple rings have different clasping mechanisms. Keep this in mind when securing your jewelry."
