      "content": "Position your hand properly. Get your mouse ready, and place your pointer finger on the left (or right) mouse clicker. Make sure it is either at a large slant or straight up and down. Keep your finger near the mouse, and between clicks, don't take your finger very far away from your mouse, or even keep your finger on the mouse. Click lightly. You don't want to put too much pressure on the mouse, or it can slide out of position. Even worse, it can slow the speed of your clicks. Be sure to have a good grip or the mouse can slide out of your hand. Make sure your hand is not doing something else, like scrolling. If you are not doing anything else, and have your other hand free, you can use both hands. Put both of your fingers on your mouse, and alternate clicking between your hands. Get a rhythm in your head, and put it into your fingers. If you still are not clicking fast enough try an auto-clicker, if it's allowed in what you are doing. Some gaming servers don't allow auto-clickers. If it is allowed, then download one and follow the instructions on how to use it."
