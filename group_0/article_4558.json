Don't breed her until she has her second heat cycle. She'll probably have her first heat cycle at 5 to 7 months, but her body isn't mature enough for breeding at that time.

The stud dog only needs to perform one job (getting the dog pregnant), but the dog must carry the puppies to term and care for them when they are young. A calm female dog is more likely to be a good mother to the pups.

      "content": "Make sure both dogs are registered with a kennel club. If maintaining a pure husky bloodline is important to you, both dogs should be registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC), the Continental Kennel Club (CKC) or the United Kennel Club (UKC). Both dogs need to be registered with the same club in order for the puppies to be eligible for registration. Only purebred dogs can be registered with the AKC. Research the bloodlines of both dogs to learn about potential health problems or temperament issues. Try running a Google search using key words like \"husky bloodlines\" and \"breeding husky bloodlines.\" You can also visit http://siberian-husky-bloodlines.seppalasleddogs.com/index.htm ."

Get them up-to-date on vaccinations and make sure they're free from parasites. Have them screened for brucellosis, which is a disease that can cause infertility. It's also a good idea to ask the vet to screen both dogs for evidence of hip dysplasia. The bitch should have good muscle tone and should not be overweight."

During proestrus, your dog may bleed and her vulva may become swollen, but she will not accept a mate. After around 9 days, you dog will move into the second period of her heat cycle, known as estrus. During estrus—which also lasts about 9 days—your dog will be fertile.

You may be able to spot them as early as 3 weeks after breeding. After about 28 days, you can bring your dog to the vet to have the pregnancy confirmed. Your vet will use ultrasound, palpitations, or X-rays to diagnose a pregnancy. Sometimes dogs will show these symptoms when they are not pregnant."
