      "content": "This is a very sweet pair, but stubbornness may come between them.

Greatest challenge: Their stubbornness can cause friction between them. What to work on: As fixed signs, Taurus and Leo are both stubborn and like to be right.

Scorpio also tends to get jealous easily—which independent Leo likely won’t appreciate. [8] X Research source Greatest challenge: Their dominant personalities. What to work on: Leo and Scorpio actually have a lot in common. Their passion and ambition can make them a great match as long as they learn to compromise rather than try to control one another."

      "title": "Leo and Capricorn tend to approach life with very different mindsets.",
      "content": "Leo and Capricorn tend to approach life with very different mindsets. Ambition is something that Leo women and Capricorn both understand, but they might struggle to understand (or respect) the other’s methods of achieving success. Capricorn might not grasp how Leo can party as hard as they work, and Leo might decide that Capricorn is a stick in the mud because they keep their nose to the grindstone. Greatest challenge: Their clashing habits and values. What to work on: This pair can grow together if they focus on working as a team. Leo can help Capricorn loosen up a little, and Capricorn can show Leo how to put in the work to achieve their dreams."
