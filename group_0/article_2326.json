Instead of just thinking of you as a reliable friend, they'll suddenly see you as potential dating material. Here are some flirty text messages to get you started: [1] X Research source \"Why can't everyone be more like you?!\" \"Not everyone can pull off that outfit you were wearing today.\" \"Why haven't you asked me to go see that new movie? üòú\""

      "content": "Desire language is bolder and flirtier than friendship language. You shouldn't be using the same casual tone that you use to text everyone else in your phone. Instead, you need to send signals to the person that you see them differently‚Äîas relationship material. These are a few great examples: [2] X Research source \"You've been on my mind all morning.\" \"I can't get over how you looked last night.\" \"We're meeting up Friday, right? It can't get here soon enough. üòè\""

      "content": "Compliments get their attention and make them value your opinion. It also shows them that you're confident enough to tell them what you like and that you're paying attention to them. For instance, text: [3] X Research source \"You know what I like about you? You have such a generous spirit.\" \"I like that you always know how to cheer someone up.\" \"I love that it's so easy to talk to you. You're a great listener.\""

Although they might not have considered you as relationship material in the past, they might be open to it if you convince them. [4] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 2020 July 21. For example, text, \"I see some amazing qualities in you that are important to me,\" or, \"I think we'd make a good couple‚Äîwe're in all the same clubs and have the same taste in movies!\" Reader Poll: We asked 480 wikiHow readers which texting game they‚Äôd most enjoy playing with their boyfriend, and 53% of them said 20 Questions.

      "content": "Being honest will make you seem bolder and more interesting. They'll start to see you as a sympathetic friend who's always got their back rather than someone who speaks their own mind. It's totally fine that you two don't always share the same opinion! What's important is that they see you standing up for your ideas. [5] X Research source Turn your differences of opinion into something you can joke about. For instance, if she texts, \"My favorite band is playing this week. Have you ever heard of them?\" you could text, \"I still like you even though you're into that band. Maybe I should give you some musical education. Want to see a show with me next week?\""

[6] X Research source Keep your texts balanced. So, if they text you once, wait a bit and text back with a single response. Resist the urge to send multiple messages. Remember, they're supposed to chase you!"

In fact, you may even want to ignore some of their texts, especially if you can tell they're bored and looking to fill their time. [7] X Research source For instance, it's better to ignore a text like, \"Hey, this class just won't end. What are you doing?\" Instead of replying, let them think you're too busy. They may even start to wonder what you're up to. You could wait until the end of the day to reply to a message. You might text something like, \"Sorry to respond late. I got tied up with some stuff.\" Don't elaborate or go into details. You want them to realize that you have a life outside of them!"

This would put you firmly in the friend zone! If they start to text about someone else, quickly change the subject. [8] X Research source If you don't feel like you can easily change the subject, just ignore the text. They'll get the idea that they can't talk with you about other relationships and that's good! For instance, if they text something like, \"Derek was telling me about a new restaurant,\" you could ignore it or say, \"I went to a food cart the other day that I know you'll love.\""

Before you know it, you're in the friend zone! To prevent this from happening, work on being bold‚Äîtell yourself that you are dating material and you know what you want. Confidence is attractive, and here are a few ways to make that come across through your texts: [9] X Research source \"I've always thought that you and I would make a great couple.\" \"We share so much in common. I've wondered what it might be like to date. üòâ\" \"I feel a spark with you and I'd be curious to see where our relationship could go.\""

The person might just see you as a friend because you're not clear about what kind of a relationship you want with them. To avoid or get out of the friend zone, be super direct and ask them out . This way, they know exactly what you want! For instance, text: [10] X Research source \"I've been meaning to ask for a while‚Äîwould you like to go out for coffee or drinks?\" \"I'd love to take you on a date. Are you free sometime?\" \"I like texting you, but I love talking in person more. Lunch or dinner this week?\""

They might find that they miss texting you or they may wonder what you're up to when you're not talking. [11] X Research source A lengthy break might even reset how they feel about you. When you choose to resume texting them, be bolder and sure of yourself. They might decide that they've changed how they feel about you."
