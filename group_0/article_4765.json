      "title": "Trim a large, 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick piece of wood to your desired size.",
      "content": "Trim a large, 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) thick piece of wood to your desired size. Use a measuring tape to mark out the desired size of your bird table tabletop. With a handsaw or circular saw, trim off any excess wood to bring your tabletop to the right size. If you’re unsure, start with a tabletop roughly 12 by 18 inches (30 by 46 cm) in size. The top of your table won’t need to support a large amount of weight, so any large sheet of wood should work. Make sure the wood you use for the tabletop and all other parts of the table is properly weather treated. If it’s not, you can waterproof the wood yourself."

      "title": "Cut 4 pieces of 1 by 1 in (2.5 by 2.5 cm) wood to make trim for the table.",
      "content": "Cut 4 pieces of 1 by 1 in (2.5 by 2.5 cm) wood to make trim for the table. Trim around the edges of the table will help prevent the bird food from being blown away. Cut 4 pieces of 1 by 1 in (2.5 by 2.5 cm) wood so that they are roughly 2 inches (5.1 cm) shorter than the each of the edges of your tabletop. Making the trim shorter than the tabletop will allow water to drain off it when it rains. If you’re making a table that is 12 by 18 inches (30 by 46 cm) in size, for example, you will need 2 pieces of trim 10 inches (25 cm) in length and 2 pieces that are 16 inches (41 cm) long."

      "title": "Glue the wooden trim to the middle of each edge on the tabletop.",
      "content": "Glue the wooden trim to the middle of each edge on the tabletop. Use a tape measure to find and mark the middle of each side on your tabletop and each piece of trim wood. Cover one side of each piece of trim with a small amount of wood glue and press it onto the tabletop. The edge should be flush with the edge of the tabletop, and the 2 marks made should line up. [1] X Research source Use clamps to hold the wood in place as the glue dries fully. Make sure that you put the smaller pieces of trim on the shorter sides of the table. You should have a flat tabletop with trim around the edges, leaving a small gap between each piece of trim in the 4 corners. The wood glue should be dry after around 30 minutes to 1 hour. Check the instructions on your specific brand of wood glue for further advice on drying times."

      "title": "Screw the trim into place.",
      "content": "Screw the trim into place. While the wood glue will hold the trim steady, it won’t be as long-lasting as screwing the trim in place. Use 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) wood screws or deck screws to drill through the bottom of the tabletop and into the pieces of trim. Use 3 screws on each piece, with 1 in the middle and 1 roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) from each end. [2] X Research source To make sure the screws go into the wood straight, drill some pilot holes first. Use a 3 ⁄ 32 inch (0.24 cm) drill bit to drill a small hole through the bottom of the tabletop and roughly 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) into the trim."

      "content": "Cut 2 pieces of 2 by 4 in (5.1 by 10.2 cm) wood to the length of the tabletop. In order to ensure the bird table can stand properly, you will need a wide base to support it. Measure 2 pieces of 2 by 4 in (5.1 by 10.2 cm) wood to the largest dimension of your tabletop and cut it to this size. If you’re making a bird table that is 30 by 50 inches (76 by 127 cm) in size, your 2 base pieces should be 50 inches (130 cm) in length. This will make a very sturdy table, but you could also make the base smaller than this. Try finding a measurement between the 2 dimensions of your tabletop. Anything too much smaller than the shorter dimension may be too unsteady, but something halfway between should work well. If you don’t want to make a base for your bird table, you could also screw it into the top of a wooden fence post installed somewhere in your yard."

Use a tape measure to find the middle of each piece of wood and mark a point 2 inches (5.1 cm) away from the middle in each direction. Use a circular saw, table saw, or even a handsaw to cut a notch into the 2 pieces of wood, 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep in between the 2 marks you made. [3] X Research source This should leave you with a 4 in (10 cm) wide notch that goes halfway through each piece of wood."

      "content": "Connect the 2 pieces of wood to create a cross. Turn 1 piece of wood upside down and rotate it 90-degrees so that the 2 notches on the wood match up. Press the notches together and use a rubber or wooden mallet to knock them into each other. If the notches are cut correctly and this is done properly, you should have a flat cross of wood. This will create a flat bottom on which the bird table can sit. For extra stability, cover the inside of each notch with a little wood glue to hold the cross together."

      "content": "Trim a 2 by 2 in (5.1 by 5.1 cm) post to the desired height of your bird table. The post is what will connect the base of the bird table to the tabletop itself. Measure a 2 by 2 in (5.1 by 5.1 cm) post to be roughly 3 feet (91 cm) in length and use a saw to cut it to down to size. Make sure that the cut is as flat and straight as possible to avoid a crooked bird table. [4] X Research source If you have a different wooden post that you’d like to use, such as an old table leg or a different dimension of wood, this will work as well. Make sure it's not bigger than 4 by 4 inches (10 by 10 cm), or else it will overlap the wooden base."

Attach a 3 ⁄ 32 inch (0.24 cm) drillbit to an electric drill and drill through the center of the wooden cross. Repeat on the base of the wooden post, going roughly 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) into the post. A pilot hole will help make sure that screws go in properly and that everything is lined up perfectly. Rather than using a measuring tape, you can rule a straight line from each diagonal corner of the wooden post. The place where the 2 lines intersect is the center."

Place the wooden cross over the post so that the pilot holes line up perfectly. Use an electric drill or screwdriver to screw in a 3 in (7.6 cm) deck or wood screw until it is flush with the bottom of the cross. [5] X Research source For extra stability, you could drill pilot holes and add additional screws in other corners of the post. This will prevent it from rotating, so make sure it is perfectly square with the base before doing so."

Use a tape measure to mark 8 lengths of 2 by 2 in (5.1 by 5.1 cm) wood at 12 inches (30 cm). Use a handsaw or something similar to cut them to size. [6] X Research source If you are using a smaller base or making a larger table, you may need braces of a different size. Position a ruler at a 45-degree angle between the post and brace. Adjust it until the length looks good relative to the size of your table and use that measurement instead."

Set the saw or miter box to a 45-degree angle and begin cutting your braces. Repeat for each end of each brace until you have 8 even trapezoids. [7] X Research source If you don't have a miter box or circular saw, you could also mark a 45-degree line on the wood with a protractor and pencil. This won't be as accurate, but with a little extra sanding and some wood glue, it should still be functional."

Press each piece onto the faces of the cross and post to create a triangle with the corner between them. Screw 1 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) wood screw through each end of the angled wood into the face of the post and into the cross. [8] X Research source It may help to drill pilot holes with a 3 ⁄ 32 inch (0.24 cm) drillbit first. The screws should go through the angled wood at an angle so that they go into the post or the cross completely straight."

Use a 3 ⁄ 32 inch (0.24 cm) drill bit to drill through the center of the tabletop and the center of the wooden post. [9] X Research source This will help ensure that the tabletop is perfectly balanced on the post and perfectly centered. You can also find the middle point of a post and the tabletop by drawing a straight line between each diagonal corner. The point where they intersect is the middle."

Choose a paint or wood stain that is graded for external use and apply it to the bird table according to the manufacturer’s instructions. [12] X Research source Make sure that whichever paint or stain you choose won’t be harmful to any birds. As they eat off the table, they may ingest small amounts of paint or stain, so make sure it is completely non-toxic."

Place the bird table in an exposed and easily accessible area of your yard or garden and scatter it with a few small handfuls of bird seed. [13] X Research source You can buy bird seed online or from your local pet store. For extra stability, hammer some metal or wooden pegs into the ground on either side of each plank in the base of your table. Tie a piece of rope over each plank between the pegs to hold the table in stronger winds."
