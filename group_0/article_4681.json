Before you begin purchasing materials and building your deck stairs, you need to go online, call your local government, or contact a building inspector to make sure you’re following your local building codes. Building codes can vary, so you need to be sure you’re following your local codes or you could face a fine and be forced to remove your deck stairs. [1] X Research source Many local governments list their building codes online. Note that \"riser height\" is defined as the height from the top of one tread to the top of the next. Stairs with more than 1 step will probably also be required to include a handrail on both sides of the stairs. Open stairs, and the deck they serve, rising over 30 inches may also need guards on any open sides above the point 30 inches high. [2] X Research source NFPA 101 (2015):7.2.2.4."

      "content": "Check if you can use pre-cut stringers. Handyman suggests \"stopping by a home center or builders' supply store, which both sell pre-cut stringers that are cut to standard dimensions. Using these is the best option unless you need the stairway to be steeper because there is not enough space on the ground.\" Measure the approximate height of the stairway you will build and the maximum space you can use on the ground. Check the pre-cut stringers at the store and measure their height and length. If they are longer than you need, you can cut them to size. To cut a stringer to size, cut it so the bottom step is not as high as the others. It can be much less high."

      "content": "Imagine a 40-degree slope to find the landing zone of your stairs. The first thing you need to do is find where your stairs will end, or where the landing spot will be. Picture a line running from the edge of your deck down to the ground at a 40-degree angle. Place a tape measure on the ground where you think the stairs will end. It does not have to be measured precisely. [3] X Research source The 40-degree slope should start the bottom of the support beam of the deck because this is where the stringers will be attached."

Handyman Walter Brant advises \"laying a long, straight board on the deck, extending to directly above where the bottom of the stairs will be (the landing spot). Then, set a large level on the board to check that it is level.\" Brant also suggests to \"level the board with shims if it slopes upward toward the landing spot. If the board slopes downward, still level it with shims but also measure from the ground to the board to see how much this raised the end above the landing spot.\" Write down the measurements so you can calculate the materials later."

Take the measurement you made of the total rise, divide it by 7, and round the number to find the total number of stairs you’ll need for your deck. Round this number up or down to the closest whole number to find the number of steps. [4] X Research source For example, if your total rise was 60 inches (150 cm), then divide that number by 7 to get 8.57. Round that number up to get 9, and use 9 steps.

The rise, or height, of each step can be calculated by dividing the total rise by the approximate number of stairs—this will tell you how tall each step will be. [5] X Research source According to handyman Walter Brant, \"Typical building codes require that stair risers should be no taller than 7.75 inches (19.7 cm). This is the height of each notch in the riser.\" For example, if your total rise is 60 inches (150 cm) and your approximate number of steps is 9, divide 60 inches (150 cm) by 9 to get 6.67 inches (16.9 cm) per step."

According to many building codes, the stair treads should be at least 36 inches (91 cm) long (width of stairs) 10 inches (25 cm) deep.

      "content": "Find the length of the staircase by calculating the length of the stringers. Stringers are boards that have sawtoothed or stair-shaped notches cut into them and run diagonally along the length of the stairs to support them. To find their length, add together the square of the run, or tread, and the square of the rise. Then take that number, find the square root, and multiply it by the number of steps to find the actual length of the stringers you’ll need. For example, if your tread is 10 inches (25 cm), square 10 by multiplying the number by itself, which gives you 100. If your rise is 7 inches (18 cm), square that number by multiplying it by itself to get 49. Add 100 to 49 to get 149, then find the square root of 149, which is 12.206. Multiply that by the number of steps that you have to find the total length of your stringers."

The stringers are what you’ll attach your treads and risers to, and it’s often difficult or impossible to find pre-fabricated stringers that will fit your deck stairs. You’ll need to cut your own. [7] X Research source Most building codes stipulate that the stair stringers can’t have notches (saw-toothed or stair-shaped cuts) that are deeper than half the width of the board, or the stringer will be too weak."

Lay the square on the board and mark the lines, then slide the square down and align it with the previous mark before adding the next ones. [8] X Research source Draw all of your cuttings lines onto the wood first, then check and recheck your measurements before you make any cuts.

You need at least 2 stringers to support your deck stairs, so use the same measurements and mark a 2 in (5.1 cm) by 12 in (30 cm) board to be cut. Use the circular saw to cut the notches and finish the cuts with a hand saw to separate another stringer from the board. It should be the exact same measurements and cuts as your first stringer. [12] X Research source Use the first stringer you cut as a template for the next two. [13] X Expert Source Walter Brant Handyman Expert Interview. 2 September 2020. If you're building the stairs on a surface that isn't level, your stringers may all 3 need to be slightly different lengths. Start by cutting the shortest one, then make the other two slightly longer on the bottom. Avoid using shims to adjust the stringers—they could fall out. [14] X Expert Source Walter Brant Handyman Expert Interview. 2 September 2020. Measure, mark and cut with precision; the limit for differences between tread depths or riser heights is 3/16 per stair and 3/8 total for a flight of stairs.

After you’ve attached the first stringer, connect the second stringer to the deck by following the same process. Use 6 in (15 cm)-long corner braces on the two inside corners—look for the ones labeled \"braces for stringers,\" as they're heavier steel than most braces. For extra strength, screw several 3 1 ⁄ 2 in (8.9 cm) framing and decking screws diagonally through the stinger into the deck.
