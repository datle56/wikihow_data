Whole grains like brown rice, as well as nuts and seeds like walnuts, almonds, and chia seeds all provide important vitamins and minerals to keep your body healthy and help your lymphatic system work properly. [7] X Research source Vitamin A should be consumed in the amount of 700-900 mcg/day. It works in the gut to help prevent germs and viruses from entering into the body. Vitamin C's recommended daily allowance is 75-90 mg/day. Vitamin C has been hypothesized by Linus Pauling to boost the immune system and prevent infection from viruses. Vitamin E has a recommended daily amount of 15 mg. This vitamin acts as an antioxidant and prevents redox reactions that can potentially be harmful to the arteries and the lymphatic system from occurring. Vitamin Bs are a class of vitamins that help with energy and boost the immune system. Zinc is a mineral that works to boost the immune system through protein production."

Yoga practitioners believe yoga postures like “Twisting Chair” and “Seated Twist” can help to wringing out any toxins in your body, although there is no scientific evidence to support this. To do Utkatasana (Twisting Chair): Stand with your feet hip-width apart on a yoga mat. Place your hands in prayer at the heart center, or middle of your chest. Inhale, then exhale and place your left elbow on the outside of your right thigh, just above your knee. You should be twisting to the right, with your prayer hands facing the right side of the room. Check that your knees are in line with each other and your hips are square to the front of the room. Use your left elbow to press against the outside of your right thigh and help you twist further to the right with each inhale and exhale. Hold this posture for 5-6 breaths and then return your prayer hands to the middle of your chest. Complete the same posture on your left side, with your right elbow sitting against the outside of your left thigh. To do Marichyasana 3 (Seated Twist): Sit on a yoga mat with your legs extended straight in front of you, toes flexed towards you. Bend your right knee and draw the foot to the inside of your left thigh. You can keep your right foot on the inside of your thigh or cross it to the outside of your left thigh for a deeper twist. You can also keep your left leg straight or bend it at the knee and draw your left foot back to the outside of your right hip. Hug your right knee towards your chest with your left arm. Raise your right arm and rotate your body to the left. Place your right hand about a few inches behind you on your mat. Continue to hug your right knee towards your chest as you twist to the left. To deepen the twist, press your left elbow to the outside of your right thigh. Inhale to lengthen your spine and exhale to rotate further to the left. Hold this post for 5-6 breaths and then repeat it on the other side."

      "content": "Do deep breathing exercises. Though there is no scientific evidence that deep breathing stimulates your lymphatic system, doing breathing exercises can help to improve overall health, including your lymphatic system. When you breathe in, the pressure in your chest decreases and the pressure in your abdomen increases. This can pump lymphatic fluid upwards from your legs and suck lymph from your arms and head to drainage points behind your clavicles. Your clavicles are one way valves, so toxins cannot go in reverse and are essentially being cleaned out of your body. To practice deep breathing: Lay on a flat surface, like a bed or a yoga mat on the floor. Take a deep breath through your nose. As you inhale, tilt your head back and point your feet away from you. Hold the breath for a count of 5, taking in as much air as you can. Exhale slowly through your nose, and at the same time point your feet towards your head. Tilt your head so your chin moves closer to your chest. Repeat these deep inhales and exhales for 8-10 breaths, breathing through your nose only. If you get lightheaded, don’t be alarmed as this is a natural response to deep breathing. Try to practice deep breathing at least once a day, for 8-10 breaths."

The general theory of acupuncture is based on patterns of energy flow (Qi) through your body that are essential for health. Disruptions of this flow are believed to be responsible for disease and illness. One of the major focuses of acupuncture is on de-clogging your lymphatic system. Before you undergo lymphatic system acupuncture, check that the acupuncturist is a trained and certified practitioner. [11] X Research source Side effects of acupuncture can include infections from unsterilized needles and a partial collapse of your lung due to accidental puncture of your lung with a needle. If your acupuncturist has the correct training and hygiene standards, these side effects should be minimal."

      "content": "Talk to your doctor about enzyme supplements. Before you take any enzyme supplements, talk to your doctor about how these supplements will work for your body. According to natural health practitioners, enzyme supplements help the lymph system to break down complex fats and proteins and aids the digestive system. [12] X Research source You can take digestive enzymes with your meals and take systemic proteolytic enzymes between meals. Proteolytic enzymes are the primary tools your body uses to digest organic debris in your circulatory and lymph systems. Supplementing this improves your body’s ability to do this. Proteolytic enzymes also help to remove Circulating Immune Complexes (CICs) from your body. As CICs accumulate in your body, they can trigger an allergic response from your immune system and overwhelm it. Taking proteolytic enzyme supplements eases this burden on your body and frees up your immune system to do its real work: prevent disease and illness."

      "content": "Do a three day lymphatic cleanse. There is no scientific evidence that cleanses benefit your overall health. But some natural health practitioners believe a cleanse can help to activate your lymph system and flush out other toxins in your body. Try a three day cleanse if you have never done a cleanse before and are looking to clean out your lymph system. Three days is considered the minimum time it takes to flush out your lymph system. One week prior to the cleanse, try to adhere to a meat free, flourless and sugar-free diet. One or two days before the flush, eat only raw fruits, seeds, nuts, sprouts, and vegetables. Choose one juice you’d like to drink for the full three days: apple, grape, or carrot. The only other juice you’ll be drinking during the cleanse is prune juice. In the morning, have one glass of water, followed by 8-10 ounces of prune juice, mixed with the juice of one lemon. This will promote bowel movement. Sip the juice slowly and chew it so it mixes well with your saliva. Drink alternating glasses of your chosen juice and filtered water all day until you have consumed close to 1 gallon (3.8 L) of juice and 1 gallon of water. You can add lemon juice to the water or the juice. Mix together 1 tablespoon wheat germ, flax seed, or borage, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) apple cider vinegar, 1 teaspoon kelp or dulse powder, and ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper. Drink this 1-3 times a day. By the end of each day, you should consume 2 gallons (7.6 L) of liquid. You can also consume anti-microbial herbs like garlic and echinacea. Your bowels should be eliminated each day. If your bowels are sluggish, drink another glass of prune juice with lemon before bed to stimulate them. During the three day detox, it’s important to stimulate your lymph system with 30 minutes - 1 hours of exercise. But if you feel tired during the cleanse, don’t push yourself too hard. As toxins are released from your body, you may experience physical side effect such as nausea, headache, backache, or dizziness. These symptoms are a sign of the toxins being eliminated from your body and should lessen after the first day of the cleanse."

      "content": "Try an herbal cleanse for 7-10 days. Natural health practitioners think some herbs, such as echinacea, goldenseal, red clover, poke root, and licorice root, can enhance lymphatic function. These herbs also strip away layers of debris from your lymph system’s filtering system. Look for cleanses at your local health food store. Avoid using these cleanses for extended periods of time, no more than 7-10 days. Echinacea is also theorized to help the immune system work better. If you are on other medications, speak to your doctor or a herbalist before you try an herbal cleanse. You should avoid herbal teas and herbal cleanses if you are pregnant or lactating."
