If you're using a cloth diaper, fold it or stuff it with an absorbent insert depending on the style of diaper you have. Set the diaper to the side so it's ready once you've removed the dirty diaper. [3] X Research source Many people place the clean diaper directly under the dirty diaper before they remove it, to catch any accidents that occur during changing. Just keep in mind, the clean diaper can get dirty, so you may need to use a second one if that happens."

Pull down the front part of the dirty diaper and gently lift the baby's legs up a little. If the diaper is wet, slide the back of the dirty diaper out from under the baby's bottom. If there is poop, use the front half of the dirty diaper to scoop as much of it off the baby as you can. Set the dirty diaper aside until you can fold it.

Gently lift your baby's legs by the ankles and wipe in between the baby's buttocks. [5] X Research source Ensure that there's no poop around the baby's genitals or along the creases of their thighs. During the first few weeks of the baby’s life, it’s a good idea to use a cotton ball or soft washcloth dampened with a little bit of warm water. This can be less irritating to newborn skin than pre-moistened baby wipes. [6] X Research source If there is fecal matter, use the front of the diaper to wipe any fecal matter off the genitals then fold it underneath the bottom of the baby or toddler."
