      "content": "Detangle your hair using a brush or wide-toothed comb. Braiding goes a lot faster with hair that’s kept knot-free . Keep brushing your hair out until your comb or brush pulls easily through without getting snagged on any tangles and knots. If you're working with thick or layered hair, use a bit of water or leave-in conditioner to dampen the hair first. This will make it easier to handle. Braiding your hair when it’s damp will give it a very smooth, tight appearance. Meanwhile, braids done on dry hair will have a bit more of a messy look. If braiding your hair dry, do it a few days after washing so that it’s not so slippery. Slightly oily hair will hold a braid better than freshly washed hair, and you'll have fewer flyaways."

Once you’ve gotten the hang of braiding starting with a ponytail, move on to braiding loose hair at the nape of your neck."

Keep using the free index finger and thumb of one hand to grab the section of hair held against the palm of the other hand. Repeat until you run out of space to braid, leaving about 1–3 inches (2.5–7.6 cm) of unbraided hair at the end. Tighten the braid as you go and keep the tension even for all 3 sections by gently pulling down on the braid as you weave. Any time a strand changes hands, tug gently on the hair so that the braid gets tightened."

Avoid using rubber bands, as these can damage the hair and be difficult to remove at the end of the day. Use a ponytail holder that’s the same color as your hair or translucent so that it blends in with your braid. This makes your braid look more natural."

Hold your hairspray about 12 inches (30 cm) away from your head and lightly mist the entire length of your braid. If you decide to use hairspray, apply it before adding any other hair accessories, like headbands or clips. Use a shine serum along your braid to give it some extra glow. Rub a bit of serum between your hands and then run them along the length of the braid. Use a nourishing oil to protect your braids at night."

[5] X Research source You don't have to start a French braid at the top of your head. This is the easiest starting point for beginners, but a French braid can technically be started from any point on your head. Just make sure you're including the hair above your ears in your starter section if you decide to braid moving downwards. You can create multiple French braids on your hair using several parts. If you have short hair, it may be easier to make two medium braids rather than one large one."
