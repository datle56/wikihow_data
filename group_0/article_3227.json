      "content": "Educate yourself in the arts: Develop an interest in music other than the current Top 40: classical pieces, opera, and early jazz. Bach, Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Wagner, and of course Beethoven are great composers to start with. In the way of popular music, the Universal Music Group publishes a series of CD compilations called 20th Century Masters , which accolades \"the best of\" great modern artists, such as Louis Armstrong and Chet Baker. Read regularly, especially the news and literary classics. Know what is happening in the news (subscribe to and skim through TIME magazine or The Economist ) and read contemporary novels geared towards society and your generation. Read poetry and also visit book stores and pick up novels by the great authors. (Tolstoy, Dickens, Hemingway, etc. are all respected but look for things that interest you.) Get a basic understanding of the visual arts, including painting, sculpture, and architecture. Learn about aesthetics, art theory, criticism, and other related topics. Travel to see famous paintings and buildings in person if you can spare the expense. Attend presentations of the performing arts, such as theater plays, ballets and operas. Learn about the art of film. Purchase a movie guide. Rent (and possibly buy) films of all genres. The cable channel Turner Classic Movies generally airs unedited, commercial-free classics, and The Criterion Collection distributes digitally restored DVDs of authoritative motion pictures. Pick up side interests in other arts that pique your curiosity, such as, for example, culinary art (cooking and cuisine), decorative arts (furniture arrangement), and calligraphy (handwriting)."

If you can't afford a designer sport coat, check out higher-end mall stores which sell tailored, classic looks. Banana Republic, Brooks Brothers and Calvin Klein are good starts. Go with a neutral color. If you want to appear more mature, wear clothes that fit properly. Make sure that your clothes are pressed, and not wrinkled. You want to make sure that you look presentable, and dress appropriately for the occasion."

Abstain from friends that are too provocative, such as the obviously fake profiles of lingerie-clad women who send friend requests out to thousands of men. Remove yourself from groups that are no longer appropriate for your new image. Replace them with more social or economic associates. Adjust your background images and pick something non-offensive and more mature. The same goes for any headlines or positioning statements about yourself. Remove excessive personal information and never include an annual salary. Misleading information seems immature and it really isn't anyone's business anyway."

Remember, it isn't about getting wasted with your friends anymore, it's about being seen, networking and getting to know other people."

Instead of going for low quality domestic beers you should look to nice imported beers or a classic cocktail like vodka tonics, martinis, or a well drink. Try some different cocktails and find one you like and can sip. Not all bars have a great wine selection so you should have a backup cocktail preference. As your income increases you can improve your preference to higher quality beverages and top shelf cocktails. Avoid getting into drinking contest. Shots are for getting very intoxicated quickly. The more sophisticated male will be content with enjoying the beverages and spending time with old friends and making new ones. Hopefully you will even remember these friends and be able to plan future meet ups. If you're in a place known for an excellent imported beer selection you should try the beer. Ask the bartender or server for their recommendation. If the restaurant is known for wine or their vast collection of quality liquors you should discuss it with someone who knows. Don't be afraid to discuss the menu. Make notes in your phone when you find something you really like."
