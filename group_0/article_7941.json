      "content": "Prepare a cleaning solution of warm water and Castile soap. You can use 1 gallon (3.8 L) of warm water to 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of Castile soap for a simple, mild detergent. Alternatively, you can also buy a detergent specifically meant to clean limestone. [2] X Research source Most exterior limestone will have a honed finish, for which using a mild soap is the best option for regular cleaning. But if you have polished limestone outdoors, use a pH-neutral detergent, such as a mild dish soap, in place of the castile soap. Make sure not to apply any acidic cleaners to the limestone! Limestone can easily become damaged when exposed to acidic solutions. Keep cleaning agents like vinegar or lemon juice away from your floors. [3] X Research source If you’re using a store-bought detergent for limestone, follow the instructions on the product. Different products require different amounts of water, and you should stick to the product guidelines in order to avoid harming your limestone."

By working in sections, you can make sure each area of the wall is sufficiently cleaned before moving on to the next area. Be sure not to set the pressure too high.

Consult the product guidelines for more information. If you're renting your power washer, ask beforehand whether the model allows for detergent to be added.
