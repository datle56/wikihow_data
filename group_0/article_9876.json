      "content": "Brush your sausages or grill gates with olive oil. To make sure your sausages don’t stick to the grill, use a basting brush to cover the links with a small amount of olive oil. If your grates are messy, oil the grill instead by dipping a paper towel in olive oil and brushing it across the grates. [2] X Research source Consider using a 50/50 blend of canola/olive oil or just pure canola oil. It's less invasive and doesn't add strong flavors. Even avocado and grapeseed oils can handle the heat better."

For most links, this should take between 10 and 20 minutes. To make sure a sausage is safe to eat, use a food thermometer to check the fattest area of the sausage, removing the link once its internal temperature reaches 160 °F (71 °C).
