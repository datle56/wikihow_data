Since the whole point of using a VPN is to protect your privacy and keep your personal information secure, it’s important to choose a service you can trust. Before you use a VPN, read reviews from as many sources as possible and check out how it’s rated on transparency and trustworthiness. [3] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source The Wirecutter, a product review website owned by the New York Times, maintains a list of highly-rated VPNs: https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-vpn-service/ . The Center for Democracy & Technology has a list of questions and answers from VPN providers that are meant to demonstrate their accountability and trustworthiness: https://cdt.org/insights/unedited-answers-signals-of-trustworthy-vpns/ . Some VPN providers enlist independent third-party testing firms to audit their services. However, these reports can sometimes be biased. Check multiple reviews before deciding that a VPN is trustworthy based on a single audit. [4] X Research source"

This means that an unscrupulous VPN provider would be in a prime position to collect and exploit your data. [5] X Expert Source Luigi Oppido Computer & Tech Specialist Expert Interview. 31 July 2019. If a VPN promises not to log and sell your data, check that they are able to support these claims with independently published, fully accessible third-party security audits. [6] X Research source Don’t take promises that a VPN won’t sell your data at face value. Many scam VPNs make false claims about how they use their customers’ data. Always look for third-party verification of these claims. VPN providers that have been caught sharing customer data or violating their own privacy policies include EarthVPN, Onavo (a VPN offered by Facebook that has since been discontinued), and HideMyAss. VPNs that have proven their claims not to log customer data include ExpressVPN, PIA, and Perfect Privacy."

      "content": "Check for transparency about which data the VPN keeps. Most VPNs collect and keep at least a small amount of data from their users. A trustworthy VPN should be open and honest about which data they keep and what they do with it. Be cautious of VPN providers that claim that they don’t keep any of your data. [9] X Research source For example, most VPN providers keep information such as the personal data you provided when you originally signed up for the service, your true internet address or IP address (a number that helps identify your computer and your location within the network you’re using), and the timestamps for when you connect or disconnect from the VPN. Look for VPN providers that offer regular transparency reports, such as TunnelBear, IVPN, and CyberGhost. [10] X Research source"

If a VPN provider makes claims upfront about their privacy and security, read over the fine print to make sure it matches. The privacy policy should be clear and easy to understand. Watch out for vague or confusing language. TunnelBear, Mullvad, and IVPN are all examples of VPN providers with fairly clear and readable privacy policies and terms of service. [11] X Research source Hotspot Shield is an example of a VPN with marketing claims that contradict the fine print in its privacy policies, an issue highlighted in a complaint brought by the Center for Democracy & Technology before the Federal Trade Commission.

VPN security protocols translate your data into a format that can’t easily be read while it’s passing between your device and other locations online. A good VPN should have strong security protocols that ensure your information won’t be leaked in transit. [13] X Expert Source Luigi Oppido Computer & Tech Specialist Expert Interview. 31 July 2019. OpenVPN is a highly secure communication protocol that’s great to have if you’re using a PC or Mac computer, but not all smartphones support it. L2TP/IPsec is a good alternative protocol for mobile devices that don’t support OpenVPN. For the most flexibility, look for a VPN that has both. [14] X Research source L2TP/IPsec is more vulnerable to security issues than OpenVPN, so it’s best to use OpenVPN if your device supports it. [15] X Research source Stay away from VPNs like VyprVPN that use PPTP, an older protocol that is no longer secure."

      "content": "Steer clear of free VPN services. Reputable VPN providers tend to charge at least a small monthly fee for their services. Be wary of any VPN that’s completely free of charge, since this is often a sign that the provider is either making money off of your data or running an ad-based business. [16] X Research source For example, one popular free VPN app, VPN Patron, is owned by a Hong Kong-based advertisement company that is known for monetizing its users’ data. [17] X Research source Some trustworthy VPN providers, such as TunnelBear, offer a free trial period or provide a free version of the VPN that covers only a very limited amount of data per month (e.g., 500 MB). These can be useful for testing out the service before you commit. Some IT security experts claim that not all free VPNs are untrustworthy, but you should always proceed with caution and do extensive research before trying one.

[21] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Once you find a few trustworthy potential VPN providers, compare their prices to see which option seems like the best deal. Most VPNs cost around $4-$6 per month. They may charge more if you pay by the month instead of signing up for a full year. Some providers allow you to sign up for a free trial or offer a free version with limited data. In some cases, you might also be able to get a refund if you aren’t satisfied with the service."

[22] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source The disadvantage of more complicated VPNs, or those that require you to log in every time you want to use them, is that it’s easy to forget to activate them or to become frustrated and not bother. Choose a VPN that will give you security without the hassle. TunnelBear is one of the easiest VPNs to set up and use. IVPN and Mullvad are also solid, user-friendly options. [23] X Research source NordVPN also has strong ratings on ease of use, but has had some negative publicity due to a major security breach. [24] X Research source"

      "content": "Get a VPN that has lots of servers. VPNs work by routing your data through their own servers. This means that the more servers the VPN has access to, the more quickly your data can move. VPNs with lots of servers are also less likely to throttle your bandwidth (the practice of intentionally slowing down connection speeds to reduce pressure on the network). [25] X Research source To avoid slow connection speeds, look for a VPN that has at least 75 server locations in at least 20 countries. [26] X Research source Ideally, a VPN should have at least 1000 servers. A higher number of servers doesn’t always guarantee the highest speeds. For example, TunnelBear has 4,000 servers, but it does not perform quite as well in speed tests as Mullvad, which has only 553 servers."

Many VPNs feature a kill switch option, which allows you to shut off network traffic in and out of your device in case your connection is disrupted. This feature can help prevent you from becoming vulnerable to hackers in moments when your VPN stops securing your connection. Check that any VPN you choose has a kill switch that’s easy to access and activate. [27] X Research source Additionally, your VPN software should alert you whenever there’s a problem or interruption in your secure connection. The kill switch is a feature of most modern VPNs, including TunnelBear, Mullvad, and IVPN."

However, it’s also a good idea to have VPN protection on your smart phone, tablet, and other devices that you use to browse the Internet. Look for a VPN that has apps or software that will cover all the devices you’d like to protect. [28] X Research source Ideally, a VPN should work on multiple operating systems (such as Android, iOS, and less common operating systems). Some VPNs, such as NordVPN and ExpressVPN, even have native apps for smart TVs!"

Bonus features may include: [30] X Research source A variety of payment options, such as cash, PayPal, Amazon Pay, or cryptocurrency (such as bitcoin). Stealth modes, which can help you get around networks that block VPNs. Custom ad blockers. Multihop connections, which can pass your data through multiple servers instead of just one for extra security. Keep in mind that using these connections will likely result in slower speeds."
