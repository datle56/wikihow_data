      "content": "Practice getting used to inconvenience. The biggest thing Amazon has going for it is its convenience, bar-none. Free two-day shipping? Cheap goods? It’s almost irresistible! But to avoid Amazon, it’s important to remember what things were like before we relied on it so much. Remember: Amazon is only convenient because it relies on unethical labor practices. Also remember, a lot of non-Amazon stores now offer fast and/or free shipping too. These stores may also rely on unethical labor practices, but they’re likely less of a threat than Amazon is. What’s more, Amazon is no longer the king of cheap goods. We take it for granted it’s the thriftiest way to buy, but oftentimes, you can find the same items cheaper elsewhere. [1] X Research source Try avoiding Amazon for 2 months—this is about as long as it takes to form a new habit. [2] X Research source By the end of the second month, you’ll likely find your brain has begun to adapt to “less convenient” modes of shopping."

Go easy on yourself if you mess up now and again, or if you can’t cut Amazon cold-turkey. Many of the companies owned by Amazon have comparable alternatives—for instance, instead of Goodreads, try Storygraph . Instead of AbeBooks, try Thrift Books . Instead of Prime Video, try Hulu , Netflix , or Max ."

The odds that you avoiding Amazon will save the world are pretty much null. And yet! Following your values and shopping more intentionally or reevaluating whether you need to shop at all will make you a happier, more grounded person—even if it doesn’t have much effect in the grand scheme. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The reverse idea—that if you continue to shop at Amazon, it won’t matter much—is also, unfortunately, probably accurate. But you’ll know you’re shopping there. And your opinion of you matters. Anyway, even if a lot of people use Amazon, there are a lot of others who refuse to. You’re not alone."

Amazon relies on and promotes a culture of overconsumption: we need the next thing now, now, now, and what we don't want can be easily tossed out. But resisting the pressure to \"shop 'til you drop\" or \"keep up with the Joneses\" or some other third consumption-related idiom can help you be more intentional about what you buy, where you buy it, when, and for how much. Instead, you'll be buying based on your values, based on your budget, and based on your personal needs, style, and taste. All of which is to say, you won't be a slave to consumerism."

Instead of giving your money to Amazon and padding Billionaire Bezos's pockets, why not support independent businesses? Not only is it great to support small businesses and help your community thrive, it’s also probably better for you in the long run, since you’re more likely to find higher-quality goods that last longer than the stuff you’d find on Amazon. Getting out and shopping in person is also a great way to find community. The more you shop at your local stores, the more likely you are to get to know the owners, employees, and other customers. [5] X Research source Shopping with friends or a date is also a great way to pass the time and be social. It’ll get you out of the house, too, which will likely make you feel happier and more a part of your town."

You might have to wait a little longer if it’s a popular title, but you won’t have to pay a cent—and you’ll be supporting one of the greatest institutions in the world, the public library (which Amazon doesn’t really do, because they avoid paying taxes). [6] X Research source You can get a book in print, but you can likely also check out the eBook version or the audio version. There are also often large-print copies of books for users who need them. Most libraries stock more than books these days, so also look into the latest DVDs, CDs, video games, and more. And while you’re at the library, look into all the other amazing services they offer!

This leads to tremendous waste, which hurts the environment on a massive scale. Instead of buying new items and contributing to more waste, why not see what you find at your local thrift store? Goodwill is a great choice, but there are likely tons of independent second-hand stores in your area as well. Second-hand stores are so much fun because you never know what you’re going to find! Take a few friends, grab a coffee to go, and make a day of browsing. Or host a swap with friends! Invite your buds to bring over their old clothes and other items and exchange them.

If you’re reluctant to let go of free shipping, know that lots of other stores have begun offering this, especially if you spend over a certain amount. You can shop specifically for ethically made goods, but ultimately, almost any store is better than Amazon, so if you need to, don’t be afraid to take it slow and shop at another store you love—like American Eagle or Target—even if it’s still a little problematic. “Lesser of two evils” and all that."

Amazon claims to be reducing their carbon footprint, but closer inspection reveals they’re not really doing anything at all to accomplish this: They use “creative accounting” (such as planting trees or buying renewable energy credits to offset energy usage) to avoid taking responsibility for the fact that around 78% of the energy they use comes from nonrenewable resources. [19] X Research source They purportedly have a smaller carbon footprint than big box store competitors, but this is because Amazon doesn’t count the vast majority of the products they sell towards their carbon footprint—which is where most stores’ carbon footprint really comes from. [20] X Research source Also, Amazon sells technology to fossil fuel companies to help them locate more oil and gas. They’ve been accused of pursuing the oil and gas industry and offering tech to enable more fossil fuel extraction—despite climate experts saying this is exactly what we need to avoid to save the planet.

Reframing how you think of “shopping” as an activity may make it easier to stop. Even if you need the item, ask yourself if you can wait until you can purchase it at another store. Also consider asking yourself if you can wait just one day to purchase what you’re looking at. You may wake up the next day and realize it was just a passing craving.
