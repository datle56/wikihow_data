      "content": "Ask ChatGPT to create images for you. Use standard text prompts to tell ChatGPT what type of image you want to generate. For best results, make your prompts as descriptive as possible. Include a subject, a description of the subject, an action (what the subject is doing), and a background or location. You can also include an art style (3D, photograph, oil painting, cartoon sketch, etc.). Avoid using vague and subjective terms like \"ugly,\" \"beautiful,\" or \"gross.\" Use physical descriptions instead. You can also ask ChatGPT to generate images in Square (1024 x 1024 pixels), Wide (1792 x 1024 pixels), and Tall (1024 x 1792 pixels) sizes. You may have to wait a minute or two to generate the image."
