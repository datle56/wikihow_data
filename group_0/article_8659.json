      "title": "Moonlight has a pure energy that clears and charges crystals.",
      "content": "Moonlight has a pure energy that clears and charges crystals. Lay your hematite stone or jewelry on a windowsill or other safe spot that receives lots of moonlight and let it absorb the rays while you sleep. In the morning, it will be refreshed and energized. [1] X Research source Cleanse your hematite under a full moon for a stronger, longer lasting cleanse. Make sure you rest it in a location where it won’t roll away or get knocked to the ground."

      "title": "Sunlight is a powerful way to cleanse stones and crystals quickly.",
      "content": "Sunlight is a powerful way to cleanse stones and crystals quickly. Lay your crystal on a windowsill or in a safe place outside while the sun’s out, even if it’s a little cloudy (as long as there’s natural light, you’re good). After about 30 minutes, your hematite will be good as new. [2] X Research source Hematite is opaque and is less sensitive to direct sunlight than translucent crystals, which can fade after too much exposure. [3] X Research source For an extra strong cleanse, leave your hematite out during dawn or dusk so it can absorb light from the sun and moon all at once."

      "title": "Stones like selenite cleanse other crystals when they come into contact.",
      "content": "Stones like selenite cleanse other crystals when they come into contact. Simply place your hematite on top of a selenite slab or in a selenite bowl . Over the course of a few hours, the selenite will restore the hematite to a clear, energetic state. [4] X Research source Other cleansing crystals include quartz clusters, black tourmaline, and amethyst geodes. Selenite will also charge crystals you place on top of it, especially if the selenite has been in sunlight recently. [5] X Research source Selenite and other cleansing crystals are a great way to cleanse hematite jewelry, like rings or bracelets."

      "title": "Brown rice absorbs bad energy from healing stones and crystals.",
      "content": "Brown rice absorbs bad energy from healing stones and crystals. Fill a bowl with uncooked brown rice and place the hematite on top. Add more rice until it’s completely covered, then wait up to 24 hours or until your intuition tells you the stone has been restored. [6] X Research source Rub the stone with a soft polishing cloth afterward to remove any rice dust on the surface. Throw away the rice after the cleansing. It’s full of negative energy, so you definitely don’t want to cook or eat it."

      "title": "Salt is a natural cleanser with connections to the earth.",
      "content": "Salt is a natural cleanser with connections to the earth. Simply place your hematite in a bowl or container of sea salt or Himalayan salt , making sure it’s fully covered. [7] X Research source Take the container outside and let it sit for 24 hours while the hematite releases negative energy. [8] X Research source Make sure to use dry salt and not saltwater (a popular way to cleanse many other types of water-safe crystals). Try adding herbs like rosemary, sage, or sandalwood to the salt for additional cleansing power. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Earth has cleansing powers that charge stones with grounding energy.",
      "content": "Earth has cleansing powers that charge stones with grounding energy. Dig a small hole somewhere surrounded by plants and nature and cover your hematite with soil. Mark your burial spot and wait at least one full day and night (up to 3 days) to recover it. [10] X Research source Choose a spot that’s free of mud or puddles since hematite should not be wet for long. Wipe your hematite clean afterward with a soft cloth and a small amount of warm water if necessary. Hematite has an especially strong connection to the earth compared to many other stones and crystals."

      "title": "Sound waves remove vibrational impurities from crystals.",
      "content": "Sound waves remove vibrational impurities from crystals. Lay your hematite near you and generate a constant tone with a tuning fork , singing bowl , or bell . If you don’t have these, sing or chant instead. Visualize resonant sound waves flowing over the stone and carrying negativity away into the air. [11] X Research source Sound waves are great for cleansing heavy stones that are hard to move or large collections of crystals all at one time. The exact pitch you generate doesn’t matter as long as you have a clear intention to cleanse the hematite before you begin."

      "title": "Sage has been used for its cleansing powers since ancient times.",
      "content": "Sage has been used for its cleansing powers since ancient times. To smudge for cleansing , burn a sage stick on one end until it begins smoking, then place it in a ceramic or heat-safe bowl. With a feather, waft the smoke around your hematite with the intent of clearing it out for several minutes or until you sense it’s cleansed. In place of sage, use Palo Santo or any herb that you have a connection to. Sage is antimicrobial, so it will also cleanse the air in the room or space around the stone. If you’re smudging inside, open some windows or doors to ventilate the space. Smudge outside if possible."

      "title": "Incense cleanses crystals and spiritually purifies the air around them.",
      "content": "Incense cleanses crystals and spiritually purifies the air around them. To cleanse with incense, burn an incense stick until it’s smoking, then place the stick in a holder. Grab your hematite and wave it around slowly in the smoke until you feel the weight of its impurities has been lifted. [12] X Research source If possible, use incense made from herbs that are native to your homeland or that you have a strong connection with. Try scents that are connected to the issues you want to solve with your hematite. For example, burning cedar or sandalwood is helpful for physical illness or financial stress."

      "content": "Your breath is a personal way to carry bad energy away into the air. Hold your hematite in your dominant hand, take a deep breath, and gently blow on the stone. Imagine all of its impurities drifting away while you ask the Universe to clear it of stale, stagnant energy. [13] X Research source Blow on the hematite for several minutes, or until you sense that it’s refreshed."

      "title": "With focus and intent, you can cleanse hematite with just your mind.",
      "content": "With focus and intent, you can cleanse hematite with just your mind. Hold the stone in one hand and imagine a pure, white, cleansing light coming from inside it. See the light flow and surround the stone, expelling all negative energy as it gets brighter and brighter. [14] X Research source Once you’re used to visualization, it only takes about a minute to cleanse a crystal. Do breathing exercises or meditate on your intent to refresh the hematite before your visualization session to help you focus."
