Basically, you use eyeshadow primer to create the perfect foundation for the rest of your eye makeup look. Without it, your beautiful smokey eye or bold wing will fade, crease, and become patchy throughout the day, something you obviously don't want after spending all that time doing your eye makeup.

Moisturizer will keep the makeup from drying out your skin. Wait at least 20 seconds after applying moisturizer, or until your skin feels dry and not dewy. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Dab a small amount of primer on the back of your hand. The amount should only be about the size of a grain of rice. While you want the primer to cover your eyelid completely, too much primer can completely backfire. It can cause your makeup to pill, clump, appear chalky, or look shiny. Too little, and your eye makeup won't stay. [3] X Research source This amount of primer should be enough for both eyes. It's always better to start with less product and build layers if you need to instead of starting with too much and trying to wipe it off. Remember: less is more when it comes to primer."

      "content": "Dab the primer onto your eyelid with your finger or a small brush. You want to gently dab, pat, smooth, and blend (but not rub) the primer into your skin. Use gentle pressure, as your eyelid skin is very thin. You can start near the inner corner of your eye and spread out and up toward the brow bone and outer corner of your lid, or you can start at the center of your lid and blend outwards and upwards. [4] X Research source A (clean) finger is a perfect tool for applying primer, and most of the time it's all you will need. You can easily control how much product you are applying, and the warmth from your fingertips can help you spread the primer. A small makeup brush can really get into the little corners and edges by your tear duct and lash line and usually helps you get an even application. Always be gentle and never pull on the skin around your eye, as this can lead to sagging and wrinkles later in life. Really work the primer into the creases of your eyelid. The primer's job is to fill the fine lines in your skin so that your makeup doesn't settle into the creases. If you are applying makeup to your bottom lid, use a thin brush or your finger to gently dab it along your lower lash line."

      "content": "Allow the primer to dry before completing your eye makeup. It should take about 20 seconds for the primer to absorb and dry. You can then apply your eye makeup as you normally would. Your eyelid should feel like a flat canvas and your shadow should go on smoothly. If it appears cakey or clumpy, you used too much primer and should use a little less next application. [5] X Research source Try using the primer on your eyebrows to keep brow powder in place, too."

      "content": "Choose the right shade of primer. For general, everyday use, you want to look for a primer that matches your complexion or is just a tiny bit lighter. This will look the most natural if you forego eyeshadow and just do a liner and it won't alter the shade of your eyeshadow by adding pigmentation. [6] X Research source Devorah Kuperland. Makeup Artist. Personal interview. 7 May 2020. Keep in mind that using a tinted primer can affect the look of your eyeshadow. You'll get the truest color if you stick to a transparent primer or one with very little color. If you're doing a smokey eye or a dark eyeshadow, look for a darker primer to add depth to your look. If you are using multiple colors and really want them to pop, try a white primer. Consider color correcting primer if you have dark circles or want to brighten your eyes. Primers with a yellow or peach cast will neutralize the purples, browns, and \"bruise\" shades of under eye circles. A primer with a little bit of green can neutralize pink or reddish skin."

      "title": "Choose the finish of your primer.",
      "content": "Choose the finish of your primer. Matte primers are great for everyday use, because they tend to last longer and give you a more neutral base for your eye makeup. Even if your skin is not oily, eyelids tend to get a little greasy throughout the day, and the matte finish will help absorb the grease and keep your makeup in place. [7] X Research source Since primer is a base to even out your skin tone, it should really be matte or transparent, rather than shimmery. [8] X Research source Devorah Kuperland. Makeup Artist. Personal interview. 7 May 2020. A satin or shimmery finish works when you are wearing no shadow over your primer or plan to use a sparkly eyeshadow. Keep in mind these don't have quite the staying power as a matte primer, and that you shouldn't use a matte eyeshadow over a shimmery primer or it will look off. If you have very dry skin, try a gel-based primer or one that illuminates skin. Matte primers work with both matte and shimmery eyeshadows--they allow you to add all the shine using the makeup, not the primer. Matte primers are especially effective in hot and humid weather, because it will keep the grease and shine under control."

      "content": "Choose the texture of your eye primer. Primers come in gel, cream, liquid, or stick form. The texture of your primer will influence how it feels on your lids and how long it will last. Gel primers usually last the longest and can be worn with all types of eyeshadow. They're great in hot weather and minimizing creasing. [9] X Research source Cream primers have a mousse texture and are the easiest to find. They work with most eyeshadows and can feel a little heavier on your lids. Liquid primers are very lightweight, but are prone to showing creases if applied too lightly. Make sure you thoroughly blend liquid primers into the creases of your eyelids when applying. Stick primers can be applied directly to your eyelid, instead of using your finger or a brush. They are very convenient for this reason, however it can be difficult to gauge how much primer you are applying."

      "content": "Make your own primer out of aloe vera and glycerin if you run out. Mix together 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of white kaolin clay, 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of aloe vera gel, and 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of vegetable glycerin. Combine your ingredients until theyâ€™re smooth, then dab the mixture onto your eyelids with a cotton swab. Try not to get any in your eyes, or it might sting a little. [10] X Research source Aloe vera and vegetable glycerin both absorb oil, so it makes them perfect for an eyelid primer to absorb shine."
