      "content": "Netflix taggers get paid to watch and categorize Netflix titles. Netflix taggers watch a variety of movies and TV shows on Netflix as editorial and content analysts. They tag titles with keywords that appear as categories when viewers search for content. These tags ensure viewers get the most relevant results based on the keywords they search. Tagging is a remote position, and most taggers watch about 20 hours of content per week. [1] X Research source Taggers look for similarities in content based on genre, theme, cast, language, and even profanity. They then categorize and rate titles to help Netflix enhance the use of metadata to promote their titles. This is how Netflix recommends shows they think viewers will like based on other content they’ve watched. Taggers also look for any culturally sensitive issues, prepare reports based on their findings, and collaborate with other team members to ensure the best tagging practices are followed."
