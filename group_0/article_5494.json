      "content": "If you know the area of the circle, divide the result by π and find its square root to get the radius; then multiply by 2 to get the diameter. This goes back to manipulating the formula for finding the area of a circle, A = πr 2 , to get the diameter. You can transform this into r = √(A/π) cm. [3] X Research source"
