      "content": "Attend class ready to learn each day. You should think of your role as a student similar to the way your parents and other adults approach work. In many ways, school is a sort of training ground for the work ethic and personal responsibilities that you'll need to develop in order to live successfully as an adult. You wouldn't last very long at a job if you were constantly unprepared, late, or calling in sick, so start taking school just as seriously. [1] X Research source Show up to every class on time and always come prepared. Make sure you've done the homework and reading assignments, and that you have everything you'll need for class that day. Sit in the front of the class room and be involved in class. Listen actively, respond to questions, and ask questions if there's any material you're confused or uncertain about."

      "content": "Take good notes that are organized and written out clearly. Your notes are the building blocks of your study sessions later in the semester. Without strong notes, you may end up doing very poorly on your exams. Start by doing the reading every night and coming to class with a working knowledge of the material you'll be discussing that day. [2] X Research source Start each day's notes on a fresh page in your notebook and write down the date and most recent reading assignment. This will help you track the material as you prepare for exams. Write anything that your instructor puts on the board. These notes are usually very important and often quoted verbatim on quizzes or tests. You don't have to write out every word your instructor says - this may not even be possible, depending on the class. Instead, write down the major points, like any important names, dates, events, relevant details, and results/implications. Try to develop a system of abbreviations that works for you. Writing your notes in short-hand can help you take notes faster and with greater efficiency.

In addition to rewriting your notes from class, it's important to review those notes and build off of them as you complete that class's reading assignments. Some studies suggest that reviewing your notes within 24 hours of class can significantly improve your retention of that information. [3] X Research source Try writing questions in your notes. Interrogating the material, rather than simply glossing over it, will help you commit that information to memory and develop stronger critical-thinking skills."

Time-management skills are highly valued by teachers and employers alike, and they can help ensure that you never miss a deadline or fail to prepare for an exam. [4] X Research source Use a calendar or planner to help you keep track of deadlines, appointments, and other obligations. Don't procrastinate. You won't actually buy yourself any time, and you'll just be even more stressed later on. Break your tasks down into smaller, more manageable parts. This can help make a big project much easier to accomplish. [5] X Research source Have a timeline for the things you need to accomplish and work on those tasks in a logical order. Decide which tasks are a priority and which tasks/projects need to be completed before the next can be started."

      "content": "Study for tests and exams ahead of time. Every instructor designs exams differently. If your teacher hasn't specified how he or she arranges tests/exams and which material will be covered, you'll need to ask your teacher outside of class. That way you'll be able to adequately prepare for the test more efficiently. [6] X Research source Start studying early. Avoid procrastinating and cramming right before a test/exam. Try to understand the material both broadly and precisely. Start out with the general concept and work towards understanding the details of each subject. Test yourself as you study to determine which subject areas need more work. Use flash cards to review terms/names/dates, then design a self-quiz to see if you have a firm grasp on the material."

Whether you missed an important class, have trouble with certain concepts, or are dealing with a stressful family emergency, there's a chance that your grades might slip at some point. If this happens, it's important to get help right away. Remember that you don't have to resign yourself to bad grades if you're proactive and dedicated to your studies. [7] X Research source Keep track of your grade in the course and recognize patterns of poor grades. Your instructor may not address your grades unless you bring them up. Start meeting with your teacher first to get some extra help. If you feel like you need more support, talk to your school counselor. Try working with a tutor if you're really struggling with an important concept. You may be able to find a tutor through your school, or you can find one in your area by searching online. Start studying for tests or quizzes two weeks in advance or as soon as you're notified. Start studying for midterms or finals at least six weeks ahead."

Accepting responsibility is a major mark of maturity, in part because owning your obligations can help you stay focused and committed to what needs to be done in the future. Give credit for any sources you use in your homework and assignments. Never plagiarize or steal intellectual/creative property from others. Finish your assignments on time, and give yourself a few extra days to review the final product and make any necessary revisions. Respect the ideas, beliefs, and opinions of others, even if you disagree with them. Everyone deserves respect as well as a support, welcoming environment where they can learn. Always conduct yourself in a respectful and appropriate manner, and never make excuses for your behavior. Taking responsibility involves both the good and the bad outcomes of your choices."

It requires a lot of time management and prioritization. However, it's ultimately a very rewarding experience that can teach you a lot of fiscal responsibility while giving you a little extra spending money to have fun with your friends. Even if you can't realistically work full time, having a part-time job can still teach you a lot and prepare you for future responsibilities. [8] X Research source Find a job that's willing to work with your school schedule. Not all employers are flexible, so let them know up front that your education is a priority. Manage your time. Make sure you don't put off homework or projects until after work, as you may be too tired to do homework after a long shift. Try to stay balanced. Make some time on weekends or after school on weekdays to do fun things you enjoy like spending time with friends. Figure out a realistic budget that balances your expenses against your income and stick to that budget. You can find budget planning help online, or by talking to a guidance counselor at your school.

Loans are a great way to pay for your education, but they often come with steep interest rates that can saddle you with debt for years to come. Before you take out any loans or renew your existing loans, think about the long-term costs and look for other options that might be more financially sound. [12] X Research source The general rule of thumb for students is that any loans you'll need to repay each month should not exceed eight percent of your anticipated gross monthly income. Think about what your anticipated career is, and look into what someone just entering that field can realistically expect to make each month in their first year of employment. If you're in college or planning on attending college, look into financial aid that you won't have to repay. For example, try to get any grants, scholarships, and work-study positions your school offers. If you won't be able to afford your loan repayment, think about other alternatives to taking out a loan. You can work a second job, try to pay off your finances in installments, or ask a trusted friend or relative to lend you the money."

Teenagers generally need 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night, though some may need even more sleep. Young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 generally need seven to nine hours of sleep each night, though some may need up to 11 hours of sleep. Listen to your body and adjust your schedule if you're chronically tired or easily fatigued. [17] X Research source Avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening to get a better night's sleep. Alcohol can also disrupt your sleep, so try to drink in moderation (if you're of legal drinking age) or avoid alcohol altogether. Turn off all electronic devices, including cellphones, tablets, computers, and televisions, at least 30 minutes before bed. The glow of electronic screens can disrupt your body's production of melatonin, making it harder to sleep at night. Find something relaxing to do before bed every night, such as reading, meditation, or exercise. Be aware, though, that exercise may wake some people up, and might be best reserved for the morning. Stick to the same sleep schedule every day, even on weekends and days off. That means going to bed at the same time each night and getting up at the same time every morning."
