      "content": "Send an email for an official response to help@ukplaystation.com. Open your email on a web browser or on your smartphone and write a message that explains your problem or issue in detail, including any steps you’ve already taken to try to fix or resolve it. Include your account information and contact information, and ask PlayStation support to contact you to discuss it. [3] X Research source If you use email in a business situation, you should follow the format of a formal written letter. You can start with a salutation and greetings and close with warm regards or best regards. If you send an attachment, check it is correct before sending. Even if you live outside of the UK, a representative at PlayStation will be able to redirect your email to the right department or location if it’s necessary. Email is the best way to receive an official response from PlayStation regarding a problem that you’re having if you need one for your records or for a lawsuit. Sending an email is also a good way to contact PlayStation if you haven’t been able to get in touch with them through other means. If you don’t receive a response after 48 hours, send a follow-up email asking them to contact you. Include your account information, name, and a short description of your message in the email subject line so PlayStation support can reference it easily. For instance, you could write, “Account #123456 - Jack Smith - Damaged Console.”"
