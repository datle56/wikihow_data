      "content": "Remove any clothes or shoes that may get soiled while changing the diaper. Taking off pants and shoes isn’t necessary for removing and putting on a pull-up style diaper, but it can make things a little easier, especially if you’re a caregiver."

      "title": "Pull, rip, or cut the diaper off.",
      "content": "Pull, rip, or cut the diaper off. Disposable pull-up adult diapers can be taken off in various ways, thanks to their stretchy and tearable waistband. If the clothes have been removed, consider pulling the diaper down the legs, so you or the patient can step out of it. A quicker method could be ripping the diaper’s side seams with your fingers or cutting them with scissors. [1] X Research source Tear or cut 1 of the side seams if you or the patient is sitting, and tear or cut 2 of the seams if you or the patient is standing. Hold the crotch or band of the diaper securely when ripping or cutting the diaper, as this can help lessen the risk of spills. No matter what removal method you choose, be careful not to touch or spill what’s inside the diaper. If you’re a caretaker, consider wearing disposable gloves for this step."

      "content": "Roll the soiled diaper up and throw it away. Fold the diaper's material in on itself, concealing and encasing any soilage. Toss the rolled-up diaper in a bagged and lidded trash can or a diaper pail . [2] X Research source Line the trash can with scented bags to reduce the diaper smell. Bring scented, biodegradable bags with you to dispose incontinence products in public. Wrap the soiled diaper in the bag, and place it in the bathroom trash can or sanitary bin. Never flush incontinence products down the toilet, as this can clog the pipes."

      "content": "Make sure everything is clean before putting on a new diaper. Use toilet paper and/or baby wipes to clean the area, and then apply any creams or powders if needed. [3] X Research source If you’re a caretaker, ask your patient what they prefer to use—diaper cream or baby powder."

      "content": "Make sure you clean your hands after handling a soiled diaper. Wash your hands by wetting your hands with water and lathering them with soap, rubbing the soap between your fingers and on the backs of your hands. Scrub your hands for 20 seconds (the duration of the song “Happy Birthday” sung or hummed twice), then rinse your hands.

      "content": "Put on the pull-up as you would regular underwear. Hold the diaper in front of you, making sure it’s facing the correct way. Step your right foot into the right hole and then the left foot into the left hole (or vice versa). Pull the diaper up by the band until it’s resting comfortably on your hips. If you’re assisting a patient or loved one with this task, crouch low to the floor and help guide their feet into the holes. Carefully bring the diaper up their legs as you stand, checking that the diaper doesn’t bunch up around their crotch. If you or your patient cannot stand, put the clean diaper on while sitting on the edge of a chair, toilet, or bed. You or the patient will need to be able to hover for a few moments while the diaper is pulled up to the waist."

      "content": "Try putting on a clean pull-up diaper without taking off your clothes. If you or your patient don’t want to remove their clothes, that’s okay because there’s a quick hack to help. Sit (or have the patient sit) on the edge of a chair, toilet, or bed. Slide yours or the patient’s pants to the floor. Put one foot through the corresponding diaper hole, and pull the diaper up and through the pant leg, so the diaper is now inside the pants. Feed the other diaper hole down and through your or your patient’s other pant leg, pulling it under and over your or their foot. Pull the diaper up, and you’re done! [5] X Research source Make sure not to twist any part of the diaper during this process, as that’ll make wearing the incontinence underwear uncomfortable."
