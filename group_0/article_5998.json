[3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Replace your toothbrush when it gets worn out. After about three months the bristles get permanently bent and they don't clean as well — in fact they get also sharpened and will hurt your gums making bleeding easier. A new toothbrush will keep your teeth clean and sparkling. If you use an electric toothbrush the head should also be replaced every three months. Children should start brushing as soon as they get their baby teeth. Baby teeth are also vulnerable to cavities and the brushing will teach them how to take care of their teeth for when they get their permanent teeth. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source You can also bring a toothbrush to work or school and give your teeth a quick brush after lunch. This will prevent bits of food from sticking in your teeth and giving you bad breath. But don't brush immediately after eating. Wait a half hour first. The food in your mouth produces acid which softens your enamel making the enamel vulnerable to being worn away."

      "content": "Use a fluoride toothpaste. [5] X Expert Source Tu Anh Vu, DMD Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 10 April 2020. Fluoride is important because it increases the strength of the enamel on your teeth. This helps protect your teeth from decay. Look for a toothpaste brand that has 1,350–1,500 ppm of fluoride in it. Children can brush with it, but an adult should supervise them to make sure they don't swallow it. Only use a pea-sized amount of toothpaste for children between two and six years old. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Children's toothpaste doesn't always contain enough fluoride to be effective in preventing tooth decay. It needs to have at least 1,000 ppm of fluoride. Put a small blob of toothpaste on the brush and then brush it over all surfaces of your teeth. Spit it out afterwards instead of swallowing it."

      "content": "Floss daily. [7] X Expert Source Tu Anh Vu, DMD Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 10 April 2020. Flossing removes food particles, plaque, and bacteria that build up between your teeth. When you start flossing, your gums may bleed a little bit, but after few days that should stop. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It is best to floss before you brush. The floss will then scrape the sides of your teeth clean, making it easier for the fluoride to get in and strengthen the enamel there. Use about 18 inches (46 cm) of floss. Wrap it around one finger on each hand, and then gently slide it between your teeth. Curve the floss around one of the teeth and move the floss up and down along the tooth. Don't press too hard when you go below the gum line. It shouldn't hurt; however, you can expect a slight bleeding which is absolutely normal. This also relieves the micro inflammation created in the papilla Some people find floss to be awkward. If this is the case for you, try using an interdental cleaner. This is a small brush, pick, or stick that lets you get between your teeth without dealing with long strings of floss."
