Most browsers will have incognito mode or private browsing mode, and some users have reported that using incognito to access ChatGPT is a workaround when the chatbot won't work.

First, make sure you're still connected to the internet. If your internet connection isn't stable, try another connection if you're able. Otherwise, try connecting an ethernet cable if you're using Wi-Fi. You may also want to reset your router or contact your ISP if your internet connection is unstable. While it is a bit more advanced, you can also try flushing your DNS cache . On Windows, run the command ipconfig /flushdns in Command Prompt.

This solution works best if you're getting errors about being IP banned from ChatGPT, though it may be worth a shot to see if it fixes other random errors or ChatGPT not working at all. Note that if you were IP banned by OpenAI, you can contact OpenAI to try and reverse the ban. There are a few ways you can get a different IP address: Use a VPN to access ChatGPT. There are many VPN options, but some popular options are NordVPN and ExpressVPN, and the Opera internet browser offers a free in-browser VPN you can try. Ensure you select a VPN server location where ChatGPT is available, or you may encounter more errors. If you already use a VPN, try switching it off and using your network without it—some users have reported this fixes some instances of ChatGPT not working properly. Connect to a different network. Try connecting to a public network like a coffee shop or library, or use your mobile hotspot if you have one. Try resetting your IP address . Before you begin, check your IP address by Googling What's my IP? . Then shut down your computer, unplug your modem and router (or combination device) from the wall, and wait for five minutes. After five minutes, plug your modem and router back in and restart your PC. Check your IP address via Google to see if it has changed. This may not work, depending on how your ISP assigns IP addresses, but it may be worth a try if you're running into IP-related errors."
