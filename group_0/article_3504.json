      "title": "Attend high school.",
      "content": "Attend high school. Your high school education lays the groundwork for a successful higher education experience, which is necessary for a career as a cruise ship captain. There are several factors to keep in mind for a successful high school experience: In the United States, many aspiring captains attend a Maritime High School, which are generally located on the coasts or Great Lakes. Maritime High Schools are competitive in admissions and follow a particular curriculum established by the U.S. Maritime Administration, emphasizing English, math, and science with additional courses in maritime skills, law, and career training. Because this is such a competitive line of work, a diploma from a Maritime High School is highly recommended to increase your chances of becoming a cruise ship captain."

      "title": "Focus your high school studies.",
      "content": "Focus your high school studies. Regardless of where you attend high school, focusing your studies in school can help you gain admission to a Maritime Academy and prepare you for the types of coursework you need. The US Government recommends three units of math (algebra, geometry, and trigonometry); three units of English; one unit of physics or chemistry; and eight additional units in additional math and/or science, foreign languages, economics, and social studies. If possible, look for part-time work (during evenings, weekends, and summer breaks) in a shipyard or on board a ship or sea-going vessel of any kind. You will learn about ship parts, worker roles, chain of command, and ship repair, as well as gaining experience on the sea, which will help you to know for sure that a career as a captain is ideal for you. If you do not live near the sea or large lakes, try to find summer work on board a ship."

      "content": "Receive your high school diploma. If you do not finish high school, you can get your General Educational Development (GED) certificate equivalent, or its equivalent in countries other than the United States. Be aware that a GED will make it harder, but not impossible, for you to obtain a career as a cruise ship captain. A diploma and an above-average grade point average in high school are necessary for admission to a Maritime Academy, and even if you do not choose to attend an academy or college, you must have a high school equivalency to gain additional career experience at the helm of a ship."

      "title": "Apply for and attend a Maritime Academy.",
      "content": "Apply for and attend a Maritime Academy. U.S. Merchant Marine Academies allow you to obtain four-year Bachelor of Science degrees. These degrees are monitored by the Coast Guard, and they teach engineering, maritime law and ship construction. Attending a Maritime Academy is the fastest track to move up the ladder on a maritime vessel. Maritime Academies in the United States include California, the Great Lakes, Maine, Massachusetts, Texas A&M, and the U.S. Merchant Academy. These are funded by the United States Maritime Administration to ensure that the government has a steady stream of properly trained merchant marine officers. [1] X Research source In the event that you cannot find a position as a cruise ship captain (which is unfortunately a high chance, given how competitive the industry is), a diploma from one of these schools can help you find employment with the US government or as a merchant marine captain. If you are based in another country, seek naval education or experience, according to the best path in your region."

      "title": "Find an internship on a vessel while you are in school.",
      "content": "Find an internship on a vessel while you are in school. Most maritime students are required to get practical experience before graduation, and Maritime Academies have working relationships with the government and local mariners in order to help you find an ideal internship for your interests. If possible, try to get an internship on a cruise ship. This will help you gain experience and determine that this is the right career choice for you. If you have the opportunity to do more than one internship while in college, try to get one on a cruise line and one on a commercial or government ship. This will help you to see the difference in these career paths."

      "content": "Apply for a job as a third mate or deck officer on a sea-faring vessel. Most maritime academies offer placement services to help you find your first job and develop qualifications along your career path. You can also apply for an officer position the U.S. Merchant Marine Reserve, Coast Guard Reserve or Naval Reserve. Although your career goal is captain, you have to start on the deck to gain needed experience. If you did not get a Bachelor's degree, you will have to spend thousands of hours -- and many years-- gaining experience as a deckhand before you can move up the ship hierarchy and become a deck officer or third mate, which qualifies you to take exams to become a captain. If you did get the Bachelor's degree, you can skip the deckhand stage altogether. [2] X Research source The exams test your knowledge and readiness and also entail a thorough background check, including a review of your criminal record and citizenship as well a physical exam and vision and hearing evaluations. There are fees associated with these credentials, ranging from $50 to $100 USD. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Get a Master's of Science degree in maritime engineering, maritime science, or a related field.",
      "content": "Get a Master's of Science degree in maritime engineering, maritime science, or a related field. Before applying for a program, make sure the school offers courses specifically about captaining a cruise ship. Achieve top grades during your studies, because many cruise ships only hire captains who are in the top 5 or 10 percent of their graduating class. A Master's degree is not always necessary to get a position, but because cruise ship positions are highly sought after, it might make a difference in your job search. Many cruise ship captains do not have a Master's degree. You will have to decide if your experience is enough or if you could benefit from a Master's degree on your resume; for instance, if you did not attend a maritime high school or Marine Academy, and/or if you have not had many years of experience on a vessel, you may need the additional education to be a viable candidate for a position on a cruise ship.

If you plan to work out of the United States, you will be required to earn a Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) and a Merchant Mariner Credential (MMC). Outside the United States, check with your local governing bodies to determine what certifications you will need. Certification exams require physicals, vision tests, drug screenings and written and practical exams. Merchant marine academies train their students in the topics that will be featured on these exams. People who gain their qualifications through experience may need to take exam prep courses to ensure they pass the exams.

There are several career paths that you can take while you wait for a job to open up as a cruise ship captain. Continue working as a merchant marine captain. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, jobs in this industry are growing with an expected rate of 14% growth between now and 2022, outpacing the number of new captains available, so the odds of finding a position in a freight ship are much higher than the odds of finding a position as a cruise ship captain. [8] X Research source Consider joining the U.S. Armed Forces or working for the U.S. government. Particularly if you attended a State Maritime Academy, the United States seeks capable and well trained captains who can meet its national security needs. [9] X Research source"
