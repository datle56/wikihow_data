      "content": "Nurturing. Cancer is the parent figure of the Zodiac. This sign wants to support you, love you, and mold you into the best version of yourself. Cancer’s superpowers are their gentle nature and powerful hearts—their arms were built for bear hugs. When everyone goes home or leaves you high and dry, Cancer waits patiently, with tissues in hand. This water sign will love you to the ends of the Earth."

      "content": "Intuitive. As a water sign, Cancer can read emotions flawlessly, even from the subtlest clues. If you’re upset, Cancer knows. If you’re walking on air, Cancer’s aware—and they share in your joy, too. Water signs are thought to be semi-psychic, so in Cancer’s company, you might notice uncanny behavior. They toss you the tissue box before you sniffle. They spot the bad guy 5 minutes into a movie. Sometimes, you wonder if they read your thoughts. Nah, couldn’t be…"

      "title": "Responsible.",
      "content": "Responsible. Cancer takes care of everyone. Friends, siblings, even just acquaintances—if you have a Cancer in your life, they’re thinking of you constantly. Cancer packs extra snacks for the hike, and they make the group’s dinner reservations every time. For some Cancers, this might be a subtle strength, as many prefer to work behind the scenes. But one thing’s for sure: Cancer loves you too much to let go of the reins. They need to know that you’re comfortable, happy, and having fun."

    {
      "title": "Tough.",
      "content": "Tough. Some Cancers get a rep for being soft—and they are. They’re gentle and kind in nature, because they want others to feel loved. But when the need arises, Cancer will go to battle for the people they love, because this sign is ruthlessly loyal. Cancer might speak in soft tones when you’ve had a bad day, but they’ll spit venom when someone disrespects you. Their sweetness is a Trojan horse—great strength hides under the surface."

      "title": "Feeling.",
      "content": "Feeling. Cancer believes that in life, you must feel things deeply. To hide, repress, or distract from your emotions? What a waste! This water sign experiences big feelings, major highs and lows. And though this can cause pain at times, it also allows Cancer to enjoy happiness like no one else can, and that’s a blessing. This also fuels a rich creative life—Cancer is likely to be talented in music, writing, art, or fashion."

      "title": "Romantic.",
      "content": "Romantic. Ruled by the moon, is it any surprise that Cancer’s a romantic? This sign sees beauty and meaning in everything. And this talent feeds their heart, day in and day out. Cancer believes that life is more lovely when you look for romance in everyday things: a sunset, a wildflower field, a friend, or a partner. If you’re in Cancer’s life, they probably see something unique and gorgeous in you."

      "content": "Moody, sensitive, easily hurt. Is it all smooth sailing with this water sign? Not quite. Cancer’s deeply feeling nature can lead to difficulties in love. They care so much for others—sometimes more than they should. Cancer might end up micromanaging their friends, only to feel upset when their efforts go unappreciated. Cancer would do well to remember that nobody’s perfect, and sometimes, lowering your sky-high standards is the kindest thing you can do for a friend."

Try these tips: Cook a delish meal at home. Make sure your place is clean and light some candles. Tell Cancer that you want them to feel taken care of. Ask about Cancer’s family. This is a sign with a close-knit circle—they’ll want to know that you’re interested: “What’s your sister like? Are you and your mom close?” Open up to them. Cancer doesn’t want extravagant gestures, they want to see that you’re in touch with your feelings. Get vulnerable, and they’ll be hooked. Be an active listener. This is a big one. Let Cancer talk for as long as they like and support them if they get emotional. This will go a long way. Get Cancer a homemade gift. A photo album, a bracelet, a baked good, you name it. Give Cancer a sweet present that comes from the heart, and they’ll love it.

Look out for these surefire signs to see whether or not they’re into you: They do you favors. Cancer loves to nurture the people they care about. If they’re driving your to airports and cooking big meals, they’re probably into you. They ask you how you’re doing constantly. If Cancer likes you, then they’ll worry about how you’re feeling. So to check in, they’ll ask you all the time. They never hang up first. Whether it’s an in-person hang, a text convo, or a call, Cancer never seems to get sick of you—you end every conversation. They want you to meet their family. If Cancer is dead set on you meeting mom, then it’s because they think that you’re super special. They give you the look. Cancer’s feelings live inside their eyes. If you notice them giving you longing, loving glances, they’ve got it bad for you."

      "content": "What it’s like to date Cancer Dating Cancer is a warm, other-worldly experience. Cuddles, compliments, and candlelit dinners should be expected. Imagine falling in love with someone who only thinks of you: your dreams, your wellbeing, and your feelings. A relationship with Cancer may have its emotional ups and downs, and it requires a careful touch. But one thing's for sure: this sign will love you like nobody else. Date night: At-home movie night paired with a sweet sleepover. Game night with friends. Painting and wine night. Downside: Cancer is always thinking of you, and they want you to think of them, too. If you're not ultra-sensitive and thoughtful, Cancer might resent it."

      "content": "Scorpio & Cancer. Scorpio and Cancer belong on the cover of a romance novel. Scorpio is the brooding, mysterious love interest, and Cancer, the hero with a heart of gold. These two fit like a hand in a glove—Cancer melts Scorpio’s defenses and Scorpio shows Cancer the true meaning of chivalry. The connection here is intense, and grand romance is inevitable. Scorpio and Cancer don’t need anyone else in the world but each other. Cancer and Scorpio lead with the heart, which will work in their favor. Still, they’ll have to hold their tongues during fights or risk hurting their partner’s feelings (and their relationship)."

      "content": "Pisces & Cancer. Cancer is careful with everyone’s heart, and in Pisces, they’ll find a partner who returns the same gentleness. These two are deeply kind, loving, and generous souls. Picture a home filled with fresh flowers, chocolate-chip cookies baking in the oven, and friends’ pictures on the wall: this is what a Pisces-Cancer romance feels like. No feeling is too sappy to share. Every small win is celebrated sweetly. This relationship is wholesome, healthy, and full of care. Pisces and Cancer will need to remember that honesty is kindness. For them to maintain an authentic connection, they can’t just share the nice feelings—they’ll have to address the tougher ones, too."

      "content": "Taurus & Cancer. If Taurus and Cancer won a superlative, it’d be Most Perfect Couple. These two check every box that their partner has. Taurus is solid, dependable, and romantic (AKA, Cancer’s dream). Cancer is a sweet, loyal homebody, which is all Taurus wants in the world. These two rule the domestic sphere, cooking complex meals, tackling fun projects, and creating a sweet oasis together. This love is stable, committed, and just lovely—Cancer and Taurus are a great match. In different ways, both of these signs are very sensitive. Important messages will have to be shared with tact, or else they’ll risk shattering their relationship. Careful communication will be key."

      "content": "Virgo & Cancer. In a world filled with flaky friends and players, Virgo and Cancer will find a partner they can truly count on. These are two of the most genuine and reliable signs in the zodiac, which makes them excellent partners. Virgo will drop everything to come to Cancer’s rescue, and when Virgo needs to break down, Cancer will be there to hold them close. These two take responsibility for everyone all the time—but in each other’s arms, they’ll finally find someone to protect them. Cancer is sensitive and Virgo can be, er, blunt. To keep things cool, Cancer will have to remember that Virgo has their best interest at heart. Virgo will need to bite their tongue on the regular."

      "title": "Cancer & Cancer.",
      "content": "Cancer & Cancer. What happens when Cancer falls for another Cancer? Sparks will fly, hearts will skip a beat, and, in all likelihood, a few tears will fall, too. Cancer feels things deeply, and this makes them special. Still, heavy emotions can leave this sign feeling misunderstood, too. That’s why a Cancer-Cancer romance can be great—Cancer knows how to accept other people completely, taking all their feelings in stride, even the tougher ones. Together, they’ll each feel truly accepted. Sometimes though, the best cure for emotional lows is stable ground. Cancers might be more likely to feed into each other than to steady each other. They’ll need to keep an eye out for this."

      "title": "Capricorn & Cancer.",
      "content": "Capricorn & Cancer. At first glance, these two are polar opposites. Cap is unemotional and focused on their career. Cancer is sensitive and they prioritize relationships. Look a little deeper though, and these two have more in common than you’d think. Both signs are loyal till the end, responsible, and set on building something great. It’s not enough to just be satisfied in love—you should be striving for something special. Plus, deep down, Capricorn is a softie (but don’t tell anyone, that’s a secret!). These two could be a dream team, but only if they prove to each other that they’re on the same team. With Cap so focused on their career, Cancer might feel cast aside (which will only annoy Capricorn). They’ll need to remember that they’re in this together!"

      "title": "Leo & Cancer.",
      "content": "Leo & Cancer. When it comes to Cancer’s compatibility lineup, Leo is definitely the dark horse. People rarely pair fire signs with water signs, but let’s look at the facts: Cancer and Leo both dream of devoted, divine romance. Cancer wants someone with a kind heart—Leo’s the zodiac’s most generous sign. Leo wants someone to obsess over them—Cancer could obsess in their sleep. Sure, there are challenges here, but for these two, the payoff is huge. They could be in it for the long haul, so long as they clear the hurdles. Cancer will have to remember to give Leo their freedom. The lion needs excitement and variety. If they spend every weekend cuddled up on the couch, they’ll end up feeling restless. Leo will have to let Cancer be themselves. This fire sign admires big personalities—and that’s not usually Cancer—but Cancer has a lot to offer. Leo should keep in mind that they’d rather Cancer be tender than have a great tight ten."

      "title": "Libra & Cancer.",
      "content": "Libra & Cancer. For these two, the connection will be instant. Cancer will love Libra’s elegance and refined charisma. Libra will admire Cancer’s intuitive conversational style. Friendship is inevitable, and that’s a great foundation for romance. And down the line, they share the same romantic vision: a fairytale romance that makes Cinderella look like Rumpelstiltskin. But will they make it that far? That’s the question. Then, someone will have to make a move. Libra will flirt, but not follow through. And if Cancer has a crush, they’ll pine quietly in the corner. Someone needs to step up! They’ll need to find a spark. There might not be much natural mystery or intrigue between these two, so they’ll need to rely on the rest of their charts for that, especially Venus. But if that’s in line, it’s smooth sailing."

      "title": "Aquarius & Cancer.",
      "content": "Aquarius & Cancer. In a way, these two signs feel out of step with their circle. Aquarius is an alien walking among us, and Cancer sometimes feels like their emotional intensity sets them apart. As the two most accepting signs in the zodiac, these two can finally find their home in each other. This is a really special dynamic that can nourish a happy relationship—but it’s only possible if they weather a few storms. Cancer is the most feeling sign, and Aquarius, the least expressive. Cancer will have to climb Aquarius’ walls and battle a few dragons to reach Aquarius’ heart. And that will be an epic (frustrating) journey. It could take years, or never happen. If Aquarius falls for Cancer, they’ll have to make sacrifices. Aquarius loves being off-leash, but Cancer can’t handle an unreliable partner. Aquarius will have to adjust."

      "title": "Aries & Cancer.",
      "content": "Aries & Cancer. When two of the biggest hearts in the zodiac pair up, you expect success. And though this isn’t a lost cause, it’s definitely a tumultuous pairing. Cancer and Aries are both Cardinal signs, which means that in some way or another, they expect to lead. But their ideas of what love should be are often very different—with Cancer craving softness and Aries, a wildfire. This could lead to fights and frustration, so compromise will be a must. But still, neither sign will ever doubt that their partner cares. That’s huge! These two shouldn’t give up, and instead, they should check the rest of their charts."

      "title": "Sagittarius & Cancer.",
      "content": "Sagittarius & Cancer. Sagittarius is a charmer, and if they turn Cancer’s head, it could turn into a fun little love affair. But what happens when the dust settles? Sag doesn’t usually like to settle down, and for Cancer, that’s a basic requirement. Cancer solves problems with long, heartfelt conversation, but Sag avoids those chats at all costs. These two will learn from each other and likely be attracted to each other, but they’re unlikely to stay together. But sun signs aren’t everything. If Sag has more committed and emotional signs in their chart (like Scorpio or Venus) and Cancer has more relaxed signs (like Libra or Gemini), that could solve all their issues."

      "title": "Gemini & Cancer.",
      "content": "Gemini & Cancer. This is a tough match. When Gemini zigs, Cancer will zag. To Cancer, Gemini will be a total mystery—and probably not in the fun, enticing way. From emotional compatibility to long-term goals, Cancer and Gemini have the odds stacked against them. As friends, they have a great shot, because they’re both caring, supportive individuals with a heart of gold, but to make it further, they’ll need some good luck. That said, if they have compatible Mercury and Venus signs, that could solve the issue. Before they throw in the towel, they should check out their charts!"
