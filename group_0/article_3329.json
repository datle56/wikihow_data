[1] X Research source Spin jumping (the A button) will destroy the mechakoopa. If you do this, you'll have to wait for Bowser to release more mechakoopas."

      "content": "Throw the mechakoopa up at Bowser. Pick up the stunned mechakoopa, aim upward while Bowser is approaching, and throw it. This will hurt Bowser only if the mechakoopa lands on him from above. Hitting the clown car is not good enough. [2] X Research source"

[4] X Research source Get out of the car's way when it turns over, and spin jump with A to leap over the ball. Use the same tactic to avoid the second bowling ball. You can jump over the ball with a regular jump, but spin jumping allows you to touch the top of the ball without getting damaged."

      "content": "Avoid Bowser. Bowser will now follow you around and stomp on the floor, trying to crush you. Since Bowser bounces off the edge of the stage, it's usually impossible for him to reach you if you run to the left edge and duck until he stops stomping. [5] X Research source This does not work in the Game Boy Advance version of the game, so you'll need to dodge his jumps instead. Bowser jumps in a steady rhythm, so it's not too hard to time it correctly. The moment after he starts an upward jump is a good time to run under him. Keep running after you're through, as Bowser changes direction quickly. Avoid the propeller of the clown car, which can damage you."

This time, Bowser will keep stomping on the ground while the mechakoopas are around. This is the toughest part of the fight, so it may take a few attempts. Bowser will destroy stunned mechakoopas if he bounces too near them. [6] X Research source If you can, grab a mechakoopa when you're at the opposite side of the screen from browser."

Collect the feather that pops out to get the cape. The cape win is usually used for speedruns or just for fun. Since you need to keep the cape power-up the whole time on your way to Bowser, the normal method above is usually easier."

To keep flying, hold the B button and alternate hitting the left and right arrows of the D-pad to rock Mario back and forth. [7] X Research source Press forward on the D-pad to make Mario dive and pick up speed, then press back to use this speed to ascend higher again. Practice this until you can stay in the air for any length of time without falling. You can also use these moves: [8] X Research source Use X or Y to spin around, knocking objects and enemies next to you with the cape. Spin jump with A while Mario is running at maximum speed to launch yourself very high. Glide down slowly by holding A or B."

Play through the first two screens as usual, until you enter the second pipe. If you lose the cape early on, you can get it back. Right after you enter the second screen, jump up the steps to your left and look for a hidden block up near the top left corner of the stage. [9] X Research source"

Once you beat this level, and the familiar fortress boss at the end (Reznors), you'll unlock the secret Back Door level. [11] X Research source You can get a cape here as well.

The fastest way to defeat Bowser using a cape involves jumping on him from above, timing it so you land on a mechakoopa right as he releases it. [13] X Research source This can take quite a bit of practice and precise timing."
