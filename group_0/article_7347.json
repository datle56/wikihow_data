Pick up whatever suits your mood, as long as the hat is in harmony with your outfit. Women with oval faces can top off any hat. The possibilities are limitless! It only depends on your personal preferences. Experiment with earrings, necklaces, and bracelets."

      "title": "Choose hats for a “round face.”",
      "content": "Choose hats for a “round face.” Add some asymmetry to your look. You can perfectly handle a fedora, a newsboy hat, or a baseball cap. This symmetrical face cries out for a new angle: asymmetry. The roundness requires a slimming treatment. [11] X Research source Steer clear of round crowns, which can emphasize the roundness of your face. It is wise to select a hat with a high crown and straight brim to give your face more angles. Your main goal is to choose a hat that helps distract people's attention from your facial curves. Slanting your hat forward draws out your face and gives a touch of definition."

    {
      "title": "Choose hats for an “oblong face.”",
      "content": "Choose hats for an “oblong face.” Try a hat with a flared brim and low crown, such as a sunhat, a cloche, or a fedora with a large brim. The large brim of a sunhat may well offset the length of a long face. Avoid any hats with tall crowns, which only elongate your face even more. A cloche worn low to your eyebrows can help conceal your high forehead, and, like sorcery, create an impression of the shortened face. The large brim of the fedora also counterbalances vertical curves."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose hats for a “heart-shaped face.”",
      "content": "Choose hats for a “heart-shaped face.” Go with a medium brimmed hat, such as a fedora with a medium-sized brim, a boater, a cloche, a homburg, a beanie, or a beret. These are all good choices! These hats balance out the width of your forehead. Slanting the hat to one side will slim your face and draw attention to the eyes. Actually, any type will work well on you except those with large brims. Avoid shapes that accentuate the shape. Stay away from wide brims that only accentuate your forehead and narrow your chin."

    {
      "title": "Choose hats for a “square face.”",
      "content": "Choose hats for a “square face.” Experiment with circular styles. Your defined and symmetrical face requires circular features to soften the edges of the face. Round crown and brim will do the trick, smoothing a boxy face and inducing the illusion of height and roundness. [12] X Research source Opt for a sunhat, a cowboy hat, a homburg, a cloche, or a toque, which gives you a feminine and flirty touch. A beret will elongate and cushion your facial contour. Tilting the hat off to one side breaks up the symmetry pattern of your square face. A sunhat with a pair of sunglasses and a flowing maxi dress adds boho-chic to your ensemble. It is a perfect combination for your beach vacation. Don't wear a hat with a short brim, no brim, or a square hat. These two types of hats will both emphasize your angular face shape."

    {
      "title": "Choose hats for a “triangle face.”",
      "content": "Choose hats for a “triangle face.” Feel free to try many hats. A triangle face is like an oval face shape that the options are virtually endless when it comes to a hat. Make sure your hat brings balance to your shoulder line, and accent to your garment. Never gets close to a crown that is narrower than the cheekbones."
