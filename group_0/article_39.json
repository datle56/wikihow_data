      "content": "Let go of the past and any negative energy that’s holding you back. Angel number 147 symbolizes new beginnings, but holding on to grudges, past hurts, or self-limiting beliefs about your abilities will hinder you on your spiritual journey. Do your best to let go of these negative, low vibrations to open yourself up to new opportunities and blessings. Forgive others who have wronged you in the past, and forgive yourself for any mistakes you can’t seem to forget about. No one is perfect, and accepting your shortcomings opens the door for growth and positive change. Try using daily positive affirmations to counter negative self-talk that makes you believe you can’t achieve. Target your specific insecurities. For example, if you struggle with confidence, use mantras like “I am a strong, capable person” or “I believe that I can tackle my challenges head-on.”"

      "content": "Embrace change. All change (even the positive kind) can be difficult or intimidating at first. Remember that the angels are guiding you toward a more fulfilling future, and that any challenges you face during your transformation serve to teach you a lesson, skill, or universal truth that will help you live your life to the fullest. Instead of resisting change and retreating inward, stay optimistic and approach new things with an open mind. Get out of your comfort zone and say “yes” to new things or opportunities you may have shied away from before. For example, now might be the time to finally let go and try singing at karaoke instead of sitting in the back while your friends perform. The confidence you feel from doing something you used to be afraid of will empower you to keep expanding and growing."
