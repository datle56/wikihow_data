These bears can fetch up to $5,000 on a regular basis, although especially pristine copies can sell for up to $25,000."

This cute little lamb is beloved for its adorable head tilt when it sits upright. Many Fleecie Beanie Babies were printed with an adorable asymmetrical mouth that make it look like the lamb is smirking. These misprints can fetch up to $15,000!"

This made the fish especially prone to misprints. The price for a misprinted Bubbles can vary a lot depending on the color and type of misprint, but some especially unique copies can sell for over $1000,000. [2] X Research source"

They vary in value, and most of them have had multiple print runs before retirement so the first editions are really the only high-priced versions, but they can fetch $20-100 on the low end and $35,000 on the high end.

      "content": "Use the tag or search online to find your Beanie Bay’s name. If you don’t have a protective cover on the tag, just look in the tag to find the Beanie Baby’s name. If the tag is protected, leave it be (it’s worth more if you don’t touch it) and search online. You might type something like “purple ostrich Beanie Baby” or “white bear with peace sign Beanie Baby” into the search engine of your choosing. Scan the photos until you find an image that matches your Beanie Baby to find its name. [4] X Research source If you don’t have any tag protectors and you do end up having some valuable Beanie Babies, pick up some tag protectors. With some exceptions, most Beanie Baby’s had multiple printings across several editions, so it’s not enough to just know the name in the tag. You also need to know the edition of the Beanie Baby, but you can’t do that without the name."

Compare the hang tag to the chart to confirm what edition your Beanie Baby is. A hang tag refers to the red heart-shaped tag hanging from the Beanie Baby. Missing a tag? If the hang tag is missing, the only way to determine the edition of the Beanie Baby is to have it inspected and authenticated by a professional."

Take a look at a tush tag chart and confirm the font, style, and composition are correct for the edition on the hang tag. [5] X Research source If the tags don’t match, you have a fake Beanie Baby. You’d be surprised, but there are actually a lot of counterfeits floating around out there. During the height of the Beanie Baby frenzy, there was a lot of money to be made by buying cheaper versions of a Beanie Baby and then swapping the tags out for the pricier editions."

Anyone can put an eBay listing out for a $5 Beanie Baby and price it at $100 hoping someone buys it, but that doesn’t give you a realistic sense of the actual market value. Look at the left side of the page and scroll down until you see the “show only” menu option. Click “sold items” and unclick every other option. Scroll those results. [7] X Research source If your item has no recently sold listings, look at the unsold listings to see what isn’t selling. You likely want to shoot a little lower than what’s currently out there."

If you see there are 3 recently sold copies of your Beanie Baby that went for $8, $9, and $11.50, that’s an average price of $9.50. Use the average price you find to establish the baseline value of your Beanie Baby. [8] X Research source If you’re a little disappointed by the pricing, consider holding on to the Beanie Baby for the future! Prices have been dropping for years, but they’ll eventually turn the other way if supply eventually slims down and interest in the product comes back."

Once you know what a reasonable average price for your Beanie Baby is, adjust your list price based on the quality of your Beanie Baby. Ask yourself the following questions: Is there any damage? If your Beanie Baby has any tears, rips, or stains, it’s not going to fetch a top price. The reverse is also true—if it’s damage-free, it’s worth a premium. Is the Beanie Baby in pristine condition? Are there any bent tags? Does the Beanie Baby have any frayed threads? If there’s nothing wrong with your Beanie Baby it’s worth top-shelf prices. Does the Beanie Baby have any key value adds? We break these down in detail in the next section, but if your Beanie Baby is uniquely rare, has misprints, or is certified, it’s worth listing at a higher price."

Without both the hang tag (the heart) and the tush tag (the white tag on the back), your Beanie Baby’s value likely drops by 80-90%. [9] X Research source Is your tag misprinted? Misprints and errors are actually worth more a lot of the time. The uniqueness of the item increases its rarity."

      "title": "The Beanie Baby was retired after a short run.",
      "content": "The Beanie Baby was retired after a short run. Beanie Babies were often “retired” after short printings, so the short print run Beanie Babies tend to fetch a premium. If your Beanie Baby was only printed for one edition or it was released for a special occasion, it’s probably going to sell for a pretty penny. [11] X Research source Most of the “special event” and “celebrity” Beanie Babies (like the Girl Power Bear, which came out for Ginger Spice from the Spice Girls to celebrate women, or the Princess Diana Beanie Baby) had extremely limited print runs."

Some Beanie Babies were given fresh or unique colors for certain print runs (for example, Patti the Platypus was purple for its standard editions, but there were some magenta versions that go for a premium). The tie-dyed bears often run a pretty penny compared to their non-tie-dyed peers as well, since the tie-dye pattern on each bear is 100% unique. [12] X Research source"

If you’re going to try selling a Beanie Baby for more than $20, set it in a protective case to keep it from getting dusty or dirty. If you’re selling a cheaper Beanie Baby (say $3-15), the case isn’t worth it. Warning: Do not attempt to clean the Beanie Baby before selling it. Any cleaning chemicals or brushes can damage the Beanie Baby, and it’s probably worth more money dirty than clean and damaged."
