      "content": "Obtain a pot with numerous moderately-sized holes in the bottom. This will be to grow your garden mums in. You can usually keep the plants in the pot they came in. Alternatively, you can repot your garden mums if the pot they came in is designed as temporary. If you need to add more soil, make sure to use potting soil. The holes will ensure the potting soil in the pot has direct contact with the wick (towel). Capillary action will move water from the water reservoir (bucket), through the wick, to the potting soil. [1] X Research source The holes are also necessary for the plant's roots to escape the pot. From there, they will grow into the large fabric wick (towel). The wick is an excellent environment for roots, with plenty of water and air. Enlarge the pre-existing holes with scissors or a utility knife if there aren’t enough, or if they are too small."

However, there is no need to move the plant and pot from their position at any time."
