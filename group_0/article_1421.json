      "content": "Apply curd by itself for a dose of hydration. Use 1 cup (240 mL) of curd on your hair whenever you want to deeply nourish the follicles. Be sure to stir up the curb before you put it on to avoid clumps. Curd packs your hair full of vitamins, making it soft, shiny, and hydrated. [1] X Research source While you can technically use curd by itself, mixing it with other ingredients helps nourish your hair. Although you can use your hands to apply the curd, it's better to comb it through your hair. This will help you evenly distribute the curd, and it makes less of a mess. Be sure to wash the comb afterwards."

      "content": "Use black pepper, vinegar, lemon, egg, fenugreek, or Besan for dandruff. Curd in general works great as a dandruff treatment because of the vitamin B5 and proteins. However, you can mix other ingredients into your mask for a more effective anti-dandruff treatment. Use 1 added ingredient for mild dandruff, or try 2 for severe dandruff. To use black pepper, mix 1 to 2 teaspoons (4.9 to 9.9 mL) of black pepper to 1 cup (240 mL) of curd, then apply it as a hair mask. If you want to use vinegar, stir 1 to 2 teaspoons (4.9 to 9.9 mL) of vinegar into 1 cup (240 mL) of curd to create a hair mask that will leave your hair shiny. Keep in mind that the mask may have a strong smell, but you can wash away the scent with shampoo once the treatment is over. When using lemon, add 1 to 2 teaspoons (4.9 to 9.9 mL) of lemon to 1 cup (240 mL) of curd. Use caution with lemon, however, as it can lighten your hair color, especially if you use it frequently. To use egg, simply mix 1 egg into 1 cup (240 mL) of curd to create a moisturizing mask. If you want to use fenugreek seeds, soak 2 teaspoons (9.9 mL) overnight, then grind them up. Mix them into 1 cup (240 mL) of curd to form a paste, which you can use as a mask. When using Besan flour, mix 2 teaspoons (9.9 mL) into 1 cup (240 mL) of curd to make a paste, then smooth it onto your hair."

To use curd on your hair, scoop up the mask with a spoon or your fingers, and rub it over your hair starting at the roots and working toward the ends. Cover the front, back, and sides with your mask so all of your hair is thoroughly saturated. [3] X Research source Be careful not to oversaturate your hair. While you want all of the follicles coated in the mask, using too much can make your hair greasy.
