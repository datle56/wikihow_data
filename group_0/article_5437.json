For example, instead of analyzing the population \"cost of every car in Germany,\" a statistician could find the cost of a random sample of a few thousand cars. He can use this sample to get a good estimate of German car costs, but it will likely not match the actual numbers exactly. [2] X Research source Example: Analyzing the number of muffins sold each day at a cafeteria, you sample six days at random and get these results: 17, 15, 23, 7, 9, 13. This is a sample, not a population, since you don't have data on every single day the cafeteria was open. If you have every data point in a population, skip down to the method below instead ."

Example: First, add your data points together: 17 + 15 + 23 + 7 + 9 + 13 = 84 Next, divide your answer by the number of data points, in this case six: 84 ÷ 6 = 14. Sample mean = x̅ = 14 . You can think of the mean as the \"center-point\" of the data. If the data clusters around the mean, variance is low. If it is spread out far from the mean, variance is high.

This gives you the average value of the squared deviation, which is a perfect match for the variance of that sample. But remember, a sample is just an estimate of a larger population. If you took another random sample and made the same calculation, you would get a different result. As it turns out, dividing by n - 1 instead of n gives you a better estimate of variance of the larger population, which is what you're really interested in. This correction is so common that it is now the accepted definition of a sample's variance. [12] X Research source Example: There are six data points in the sample, so n = 6. Variance of the sample = s 2 = 166 6 − 1 = {\\displaystyle s^{2}={\\frac {166}{6-1}}=} 33.2"

This can make it difficult to understand intuitively. Instead, it's often useful to use the standard deviation. You didn't waste your effort, though, as the standard deviation is defined as the square root of the variance. This is why the variance of a sample is written s 2 {\\displaystyle s^{2}} , and the standard deviation of a sample is s {\\displaystyle s} . For example, the standard deviation of the sample above = s = √33.2 = 5.76."
