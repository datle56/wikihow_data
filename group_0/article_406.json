      "content": "Listen more and speak less. As the saying goes, \"Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt.\" [1] X Research source If you want to viewed as reasonably smart, keep your mouth shut. Talk less and when you do talk, what you say will be valued that much more. [2] X Research source It helps that \"smart\" people are generally viewed as more introverted, as inaccurate as that is. Not only will you have the benefit of the doubt, but you'll have the stereotype on your side, too."

      "content": "Use proper grammar. \"Mama said I dun need none no book learnin'. Now gid off th' property!\" If you got that, you're probably picturing someone in overalls with a strand of wheat hanging from their upper lip, rifle in hand. Not exactly smart looking, huh? How about, \"Mother said I didn't need any book learning. Now get off the property.\" A little strange (why was mother so against formal education, anyway?), but definitely smarter. \"Proper\" here meaning by the standards of conventional American or British English (or whatever umbrella your dialect falls under). While saying \"y'all\" is totally acceptable and not technically incorrect in certain dialects , it's not okay in others. In order to be truly proper, speak the kind of English they teach you in school."

      "content": "Pronounce your words fully. It's totally natural to drop the \"g\" from -ing words and to say things like \"coulda\" or \"kinda,\" but if you're really looking to sound smart, those habits will have to be dropped. Slow your speech a bit, say the full words, and speak a bit more formally. People may wonder why you talk like that and the answer? Intelligence. [3] X Research source \"I dunno. I think I'm gonna go with 'em to the show fer 'bout an hour,\" is more intelligently said as \"I don't know. I think I'm going to go with them to the show for about an hour.\" And that doesn't take any mental work -- just talking."

      "content": "Avoid textspeak and mallspeak. OMG, like, really?! LOL. No. Just no. In your new smart-sounding communication, there is no IDK-ing, no inserting \"like,\" \"you know,\" or \"umm\" every third word. Don't do it. If you think you don't do it, spend an hour actually listening to yourself. [4] X Research source Seriously. Avoid the abbreviations and the acronyms (like \"totes\" or \"BRB\"). That's text speak and shouldn't even really be used on your phone (especially if you want to keep up the façade). Mallspeak is where, you, like, talk like this, and, umm, like, you fill the empty spaces, with, like, and, umm, rising intonation and it, like, always sounds like you're asking questions when you're, like, really not. Basically don't talk like you're in Clueless. The \"valley girl\" dialect isn't viewed as particularly intelligent, to say the least."

It doesn't matter how smart you are -- if you don't know anything about the topic matter, you won't sound intelligent. So stick to what you know! Don't put pressure on yourself to join in on a conversation about the Glass-Steagall Act if it's not your cup of tea. No one can add valuable input to every conversation. Try to steer the conversation at hand if you're really aching to show your stuff. Maybe you don't know anything about the Glass-Steagall Act, but you know a tidbit or two about Roosevelt. Get the conversation about him and jump on it! Find your opening (six degrees of Kevin Bacon style) and grab the wheel. That's how conversations progress, after all!"

For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.\" Who's the smarter one in this scenario? Quoting that doesn't mean Richard is smart, but it sure makes him look like it! In case you were curious, that's a Khalil Gibran quote. If you're going to choose things to quote, it's best to stick to poets, classic novelists, and prominent figures of the past -- not Dennis Rodman, Michael Scott, or Carrot Top. [5] X Research source"

Words like \"hence,\" \"sought,\" \"shall,\" \"divert,\" and \"inquire\" are good alternatives to other, more common words, but look them up to be sure when to use them. If you use them wrong, you'll come across as foolish. [6] X Research source In general, English has a lot of French and German words. Sometimes the French word is “smarter sounding\" than the German. Instead of saying \"to answer your question\" say \"in response to your question.\" Instead of \"begin,\" choose \"commence.\" \"Understand\" is \"comprehend,\" et cetera ad infinitum."

      "content": "Don't be a know-it-all. If you're jumping in every sentence and a half to prove just how smart you are, that's not smart. There's a reason Hermione Granger didn't have very many friends throughout Hogwarts. Most people know a bit about a few things and no one knows everything about everything. Be comfortable with your lack of knowledge! Just because you can't recite information about the structure of atoms doesn't mean you're not smart; it just means that's specific knowledge you don't have right now. It's something you can learn later. Ask some questions, but not too many. Smart people know a lot, but they don't know everything. They became smart by learning, so it's a good idea to occasionally say something like \"I'm not familiar with that, can you explain\" or \"I hadn't heard that, can you tell me more\"?"

They speak with conviction and passion and people don't question it. Confidence gets people go to give more weight to what you say. This does not work if what you're saying is obviously wrong, it will make you look like you're trying too hard. [8] X Research source Think about it. Two people have the same argument -- one person delivers it slow and with hesitation, fumbling with their words, and not making eye contact with you. The other argues with hand gestures, quickly and with clarity, and shows their undoubted belief in the concept through their passion. Who would you believe? Be aware of that nasty voice in your head -- the one that's trying to make you miserable and derail you from feeling smart. We all have one that's telling us we're wrong, beating down our confidence. That's normal. Just know that this voice shouldn't be paid any mind. It's just there to annoy you."

[9] X Research source You could be smart about nature, music, or even smart about how things move (not everyone can juggle). Maybe you're good with numbers, fixing cars, cooking, or gardening.

Those people you're worried about impressing aren't really all that smart -- they're just trying to impress you. Funny how the world works, huh? [10] X Research source You know what that means?

Why might people believe it if it weren't true? Is it good or bad? Just or unjust? Not only will you be smart, but you'll have your own opinions, too. We all get handed our cultures from birth. We get handed a political party, a religion, a belief system, manners, you name it, the adults in our lives shaped us from day one. Be open to the possibility that they were wrong.

[11] X Research source It's those people who were open-minded, that questioned the status quo, that have driven every culture forward. If people weren't, we'd still be in a very primitive society, content with where we are. Obviously nothing good about that. And it doesn't take much intelligence to simply be open minded."

Someone briefly mentions their trip to Antarctica testing theories on anthropogenic climate change? No one would be able to talk about that topic. Time to start asking a lot of questions to show your curiosity and desire to learn. Even if you don't have another person to bounce questions off of, you can get curious by yourself! Are you reading something online and run across a word you don't know? Look it up. A political concept that just is totally over your head? Look it up.

There's no right or wrong on all these hot-button topics (religion, politics, current events, etc.) -- all you have to do is a bit of research and soul searching. What or who do you align yourself with? When it comes to \"controversial celebrity\" topics like Kim Kardashian, a smart person is really not interested enough to have an opinion -- things of that caliber aren't really interesting (or at least you don't admit it). The talk around the watercooler is about the Bachelorette? Nope, sorry, you were watching a documentary on the Ebola crises last night or reading, you've never seen the show, sounds silly."

It's totally stereotypical, sure, but it may also help you get in the zone! When we feel pretty, we get more confident -- by the same token, if you feel smart, you may act smarter. If nothing else, it's worth a shot. Don't make it obvious that you are trying hard to look smart. This will be looked upon negatively."

Heck, the AOL homepage. Too much work? Okay, a particularly in-tune Facebook friend's feed. The news is everywhere -- read it, form an opinion, and talk about it!

Or just go for a word a day -- you're vocabulary will improve in no time. [13] X Research source English is so, so, so, so many words thanks to its history.

Here's a few to get you started: Je ne sais quoi - literally, \"I don't know what\"; means an unexplainable thing Ad nauseum - to the point of nausea Carpe diem - seize the day In vino veritas - In wine there is truth Ad hoc - something formed quickly and haphazardly to address a specific problem Au contraire - on the contrary"

[14] X Research source So when you spend that time on wikiHow, Wikipedia, or Khan Academy, write stuff down! Try to talk about it with someone that night.
