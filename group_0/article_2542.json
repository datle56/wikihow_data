Whether it's asking an acquaintance out for a drink, apologizing to a loved one after a long period of misunderstanding, or simply being friendly to a co-worker, stop thinking about acting and actually do something. According to life coach Sandra Possing, taking the first small step towards trying something new can give you the energy to keep going. [1] X Expert Source Sandra Possing Life Coach Expert Interview. 15 July 2020. Possing says, “Just take imperfect action, and especially inspired imperfect action. Let go of the need to have the perfect plan and instead just start trying to trust your own desires and intuition. Just getting into action creates some energy and gives you more information.” [2] X Expert Source Sandra Possing Life Coach Expert Interview. 15 July 2020. Remember, boldness is the opposite of hesitation. Whenever you're feeling hesitant in interactions with others (or in making a decision for yourself), swallow your pride and make the first move!"

Bold people aren't afraid of trying new things, and one of the reasons they're so exciting to be around is that they keep you guessing. This could be something new for you, like salsa dancing or learning to water ski. [3] X Research source Whatever you do, be sure to do it for yourself, not other people. Doing something new and unexpected might make you feel vulnerable or afraid. Don't give in to those feelings! Instead, accept the newness of the skill and don't be afraid to be yourself. [4] X Research source Remember, taking a risk isn’t the same as making impulsive decisions. To avoid regrets, life coach Guy Reichard recommends “making choices and taking actions in alignment with [your] values. [You] will feel more inner peace, alignment, clarity, confidence, and ultimately, fulfillment.” [5] X Expert Source Guy Reichard Executive Life Coach Expert Interview. 30 March 2021. For example, you may fail miserably at salsa dancing lessons, but if you value other cultures, music, and active hobbies, you’ll have no regret about trying it!"

Don't try to hide your problems or failures, but accept them as part of you. This will allow you to confidently move forward, appreciating your uniqueness . [6] X Research source Possing reminds us that it will be easier to find things you're passionate about if you stop worrying about the “right” thing to do: “Let go of that perfectionist need, that over-analyzer, over-thinker tendency, and challenge [yourself] to just say, ‘I'm a little bit curious about these things.’” [7] X Expert Source Sandra Possing Life Coach Expert Interview. 15 July 2020. You don't have to do random, uncharacteristic things to discover who you are. Avoid making any uncharacteristic changes just to shock people. Be honest with yourself. To further rediscover yourself, licensed family therapist Lia Huynh recommends “reflecting on the last year…Ask yourself what you were proud of. Ask yourself what you would have done differently. Ask yourself what kinds of people, activities, and work were life-giving and what kinds of people, activities, and work were life-sucking…What would your 60-year-old self like to have said about your life up to this point?” [8] X Expert Source Lia Huynh, LMFT Licensed Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 5 May 2022."

If you already know someone bold, imagine how they'd act. Studies show your mood can be affected by your behavior—the old saying “fake it until you make it” has some truth to it! [9] X Research source Your bold inspiration doesn't have to be real. You could even think of a character from a movie or book who's daring and brave. Then, imagine their boldness in your life. Huynh offers some clarification on where to find bold inspiration and feel empowered: “I would stop comparing yourself to everyone on social media and feeling like you have to do what everyone else is doing. If you don’t like traveling, don’t feel pressured to travel. If you don’t want to date, don’t pressure yourself to. If you do like those things, then take small steps to reach your goals.” [10] X Expert Source Lia Huynh, LMFT Licensed Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 5 May 2022."

These qualities are helpful for a flourishing personal, academic, or professional life. [14] X Research source If you agreed to do something you really don't wish to do, you should probably just follow through with it because you gave your word. Next time, remember to say no and assert yourself! Of course, your circumstances can change and prevent you from following through sometimes. In those cases, communicate clearly about what happened as soon as you know you can’t hold up your end of the bargain and do your best to follow through next time."

As Reichard explains, “We may be in the midst of a chaotic environment, but [it’s important to] keep a safe, open, trusting interior. The more we practice presence, the easier it becomes to not be so rattled and thrown off by events and situations outside our control… This doesn’t mean we won’t feel any fear or adversity, but at the same time, we’ll have an inner knowing that we can handle it and we will be OK.” [16] X Expert Source Guy Reichard Executive Life Coach Expert Interview. 30 March 2021. But how do you become more mindful ? Reichard continues, “We can develop our mindfulness with practices like meditation.

Qualities like patience, compassion, kindness, non-judgment, curiosity, and detachment.” [17] X Expert Source Guy Reichard Executive Life Coach Expert Interview. 30 March 2021."

This doesn't mean you should demand what you want or be aggressive. Instead, confidently and tactfully choose your words. Don't confuse being bold with being aggressive. Aggressiveness often involves imposing your viewpoints or actions on others. Boldness has nothing to do with the people around you. It's about overcoming your fears and taking action. According to Reichard, “Many people are assertive without even realizing it [while] some people may not be comfortable asking for anything they want or even need. To restore natural assertiveness, [ask] a safe, nonjudgmental partner to remind you that you’re as worthy as anybody else. In most cases, it’s safe to ask for what we want and need; no one is going to be responsible for us getting our needs met but us.” [19] X Expert Source Guy Reichard Executive Life Coach Expert Interview. 30 March 2021. He continues, “Some people may think it’s aggressive and rude and even harmful to others to be assertive. That is simply not the case.

      "content": "Learn to negotiate in order to get your needs met. The phrase \"What can you do for me?\" is an easy and powerful way to throw the onus of responsibility back on the person you're negotiating with. Even if the initial answer is “no,” keep the window of opportunity open as long as possible to give them an opportunity to change their mind. Plan out counter-offers before you start negotiating. If you think your boss will reject your request for time off because there's no one to fill your place, say you'll double-up a shift when you get back, or that you'll complete tasks remotely when you have free time. Negotiation and mediation coach Jessica Notini suggests “trying to figure out who this person is I’m negotiating with and what they care about. Are they a relationship person? Are they a status person? Are they a reward person? So, I often talk about getting on their channel and speaking their language.” [21] X Expert Source Jessica Notini, JD Negotiation & Mediation Coach Expert Interview. 27 March 2020."

      "content": "Offer two choices to increase your odds of getting what you want. One of the best ways to get what you want is to simplify the number of solutions to a given problem. Even if there are an unlimited number of possibilities for a given problem, limit them to the solutions that work for you. This will cut down on the amount of hassle that goes into the solution and ensure that the outcome is what you want. For example, if you really want either Italian or sushi for dinner, don’t just ask your friends, “What should we order tonight?” Instead, ask “Which sounds better—Italian or sushi?”"

      "content": "Take risks and create opportunities. There's a difference between being reckless and accepting risks. Reckless people don't accept risks because they don't even think about them. A bold person, on the other hand, has learned about the risks and decided to go through with the decision anyway, ready and willing to accept the consequences if things don't work out. [22] X Research source Inaction or hesitation is often a kind of risk because you're risking missing an opportunity. This is a risk to avoid, however. Your goal is to create your best chance of success, not whittle away at your window of opportunity. When you've made the choice to act, do it without fear."

It's not the opposite of success, it's a necessary component. Without the risk of failure, you don't have the opportunity for success. [24] X Research source Don't worry about rejection. This requires some emotional detachment from the outcome. Don't let a rejection destroy your self-confidence and ability to be bold. It’s OK to feel frustrated or down in the immediate aftermath of a failure. Take time to process your feelings, reflect on what went wrong, and make a plan for the future. Failure is only lasting if you let it knock you down for good. Keep pushing forward—eventually, your failure will just be a bump in the road on your way to success."

It can feel intimidating to speak your mind, but often, your thoughts will just simmer and frustrate you over time if you don’t express them. Trust that you know what you need to say to improve your circumstances (or those of others), then have the courage to say it sooner rather than later. You may fear “rocking the boat” with loved ones or colleagues, but if you wait too long, you might just explode (and the real meaning of your words may be lost).

For starters, take a wide stance, stand tall, and don’t be afraid to make eye contact with audience members while you speak. [26] X Research source Limit nervous fidgeting by keeping your hands within an imaginary box in front of you. It makes you seem more trustworthy and honest, whereas big and wild hand gestures can make people feel uneasy. [27] X Research source Try to eliminate filler words like “um” or “uh” and present your main points in concise, impactful sentences. “Carbon capture is necessary to combat climate change” sounds more bold and direct than “Some people believe that carbon capture is an important part of the battle against climate change.” Memorize the flow of your arguments, but not every single word. It’s OK to get off track for a moment (we all do), so use some key terms on your slides or notecards to guide you back on track."
