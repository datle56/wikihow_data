      "title": "“Birds of a Feather” is about being deeply and inextricably in love with someone.",
      "content": "“Birds of a Feather” is about being deeply and inextricably in love with someone. The title is based on the proverb, “birds of a feather flock together,” meaning that people with the same tastes or personalities are likely to find each other. [1] X Research source Billie co-opts this phrase to imply that she loves someone so much that she wants to “stick together” like “birds of a feather.” The lyrics of “Birds of a Feather” narrate the feelings of being deeply in love to the point that you want to be with them until the very end. [2] X Research source But while this idea of loving someone until you die is a common trope in songs, “Birds of a Feather” pushes it to greater intensity with lines like ‘Til I rot away, dead and buried and ‘Til I’m in the casket you carry . [3] X Research source “There’s a lot of songs about dying for somebody and loving them until they die,” says Finneas O’Connell, the song’s co-writer and producer, in a video produced by American Express. “I thought it was really fun to reverse it.” [4] X Research source “We were like, 'Oh, we'll make a love song for the first time that doesn't have some weird twist to it,' and then, we twisted it,” added Billie. [5] X Research source To this point, Billie revealed that she kept a journal with different variations of the song’s early lyrics, back when it was supposed to be a cut-and-dry love song: “I have all kinds of lyrics in here that are all kind of, just, loving,” explained Billie. “We were coming up with all these rhymes and ‘grave’ came up, so it was already this like happy sounding thing and we just always love the juxtaposition of that with the lyrics.” [6] X Research source However, Billie has no issue with listeners interpreting the track as a classic and romantic love song. “It doesn’t matter what I wrote it about or what Finneas wrote it about,” explains the singer-songwriter. “It really doesn’t matter, as long as you interpret it the way you need to.” [7] X Research source"

      "title": "“Birds of a Feather” isn’t confirmed to be about any particular person.",
      "content": "“Birds of a Feather” isn’t confirmed to be about any particular person. Some people have speculated that “Birds of a Feather” was inspired by Jesse Rutherford (lead singer of The Neighborhood), who was Billie’s last high-profile romantic interest. [8] X Research source However, neither Billie nor Finneas have suggested that Rutherford—or any other individual—directly inspire the song. Interestingly, Billie has said to Rolling Stone that the songs on Hit Me Hard and Soft are inspired by multiple people, rather than just one (which was the case on Happier Than Ever ). [9] X Research source When speaking about “Birds of a Feather,” Billie has actually implied that the song represents the opposite of what she’s felt in past relationships. “This is how I wished that I was feeling, but I wasn’t really, so I’m just gonna try to pretend,” explained the songstress. [10] X Research source When it comes to her dating life, Billie joked around the album’s release that she doesn’t plan on dating ever again. “That’s not true, obviously,” continued the singer, “But no, I don’t see myself being serious with anyone until I find someone that really feels right to me.” [11] X Research source When it comes to Rutherford, her ex-partner, Billie has maintained that the two of them are on good terms, saying, “That’s my guy. Truly one of my favorite people in the world.” [12] X Research source Ultimately, the magic of love songs (and music in general) is that the listener can interpret it how they choose and apply it to their own life in a way that resonates with them. So, it doesn’t really matter who in Billie’s life it was written about!"

      "title": "In the first verse, Billie sings about a person who she wants to be with forever.",
      "content": "In the first verse, Billie sings about a person who she wants to be with forever. With a melodramatic (and, in her own words, toxic ) tone, Billie sings I want you to stay / ‘Til I’m in the grave / Til I rot away, dead and buried / ‘Til I’m in the casket you carry . Basically, she’s taking the time-old idea of “‘til death do you part” to the extreme by literally describing how she wants her lover to be by her side until they’re literally carrying the casket at her funeral and her body decomposes in the earth. [13] X Research source This same theme of overwhelming love continues through the second part of the verse, where Billie professes, if you go, I’m going too and that there’s nothing left to lose without my baby. Billie even goes so far as to imply that she’d happily die if she’d already lost her partner, pleading: If I’m turning blue, please don’t save me / Nothin’ left to lose without my baby. Speaking on this verse specifically, Billie commented in a video produced by American Express that she “wanted the verse…to feel toxic and a little bit love-bomby.” [14] X Research source “It’s almost like someone slamming you into a wall and being like, ‘you look really pretty.’ And you’re like, ‘Wow, that’s kind of a lot.’ That’s what I wanted the verse to do.” [15] X Research source"

      "title": "In the refrain, pre-chorus, and chorus, Billie reiterates her undying wish to be with her lover.",
      "content": "In the refrain, pre-chorus, and chorus, Billie reiterates her undying wish to be with her lover. At the start of the refrain comes the title of the song, with Billie singing: Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know / I said I’d never think I wasn’t better alone / Can’t change the weather, might not be forever / But if it’s forever, it’s even better . [16] X Research source Billie employs the well-known idiom “birds of a feather flock together” to tell her partner that she never wants to be separated from them. This apparently comes in contrast to Billie’s earlier stance that she’d be better off single. And, despite the admission that their relationship may not last forever, Billie maintains that the ideal version of events would be for them to be together forever (specifically, until the day that one of them dies). Moving into the pre-chorus, Billie explains that she’s so in love that it inexplicably brings her to tears— I don’t know what I’m cryin’ for / I don’t think I could love you more . Billie then affirms that she’ll love her partner until “the day that [she] dies” before jumping into the explosive chorus, which essentially repeats this sentiment: I’ll love you ‘til the day that I die / ‘Til the day that I die / ‘Til the light leaves my eyes / ‘Til the day that I die ."

      "title": "In the second verse, Billie wishes her partner saw themselves the way she does.",
      "content": "In the second verse, Billie wishes her partner saw themselves the way she does. Speaking on the song in a video with American Express, Billie herself says that she especially loves the second verse as the lyrics are “different from the rest of the song.” [17] X Research source In other parts of the track, explains Billie, she was “writing what I wanted to feel.” In the second verse, however, she sings about what she actually feels about her partner. [18] X Research source Specifically, she says I want you to see / How you look to me / You wouldn’t believe if I told ya / You would keep the compliments I throw ya. In reference to this line, Billie touches on how “it’s not actually possible to see ourselves how someone else sees us. But if it was, you literally wouldn’t believe it. If I could give you my view of you, you would be so shocked and so stoked because it’s awesome.” [19] X Research source In the latter part of the verse, Billie sings: But you’re so full of sh*t / Tell me it’s a bit, oh / Say you don’t see it, your mind’s polluted / Say you wanna quit, don’t be stupid . While many fans have interpreted this line to mean that Billie is begging her partner not to walk away, the songwriter herself says otherwise. From her perspective, Tell me it’s a bit and the surrounding lines are her saying, “‘Tell me you’re joking. Like, tell me it’s a bit that you don’t see how amazing you are.’” [20] X Research source With the line “say you wanna quit, don’t be stupid,” Billie explains that she was referring to someone’s career “and job and someone who’s just really doubtful of themselves when they have so much talent.” [21] X Research source"

      "content": "The “Birds of a Feather” music video shows Billie being dragged through an empty building. The official music video for the track was directed by Aidan Zamiri and released on September 27, 2024. In the opening shot, Billie is shown sitting on a desk chair in what appears to be an abandoned office building. Then, Billie is shown being dragged around by the arm by a seemingly invisible force, flying out of her chair and crashing through walls. [22] X Research source The next portion of the video shows shots of Billie singing the lyrics of “Birds of a Feather” while seated or standing in various areas of the abandoned building. [23] X Research source Eventually, Billie is once again dragged upward and then along the ground by an unknown and unseen force. Throughout all of this, Billie keeps a smile and lovelorn look on her face. [24] X Research source According to Sarah Kearns of Hypebeast , the visuals may symbolize “the feeling of being pulled in different directions by someone who isn’t actually present.” [25] X Research source Other interpretations posit that the video represents the slightly toxic nature of the lyrics, or the way that an unhealthy obsession with someone can pull and drag you along, with you being happy to go where they lead."

Finneas O’Connell, who also performs under the stage name FINNEAS, is Billie’s brother and longtime collaborator. The two of them wrote and produced “Birds of a Feather” together, and the track was recorded at Finneas’ home studio in Los Angeles. When it comes to recording and production, Finneas has shared that he generally works in Logic Pro and focuses a lot of his work on Billie’s vocals, crafting intricate vocal arrangements to create a special sound on each track. [26] X Research source Billie commented in an interview with BBC Radio 1 that the track is “more poppy” but with a sense of sadness. “It’s giving happy, but it’s not actually,” the singer-songwriter explained.
