      "content": "Wash your face with a gentle cleanser. Adolescence is the perfect time to adopt a good skin care regimen , since breakouts are most likely to occur at this age. Skin care is also important when wearing makeup, since you want to start with soft, clean skin. Always wash your face before applying your makeup. Buy a cleanser that's made for your skin type , such as oily, dry, or combination skin. For example, cream cleansers are good for dry skin. If you have oily skin , try a cleanser with salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or another acne fighting ingredient. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply moisturizer",
      "content": "Apply moisturizer all over your face to hydrate your skin. Makeup goes on more easily and lasts longer when your skin is hydrated! Squeeze a nickel-sized amount of moisturizer onto your fingers and work the product into your face gently for about 30 seconds, concentrating on any areas that feel especially dry or flaky. Look for a moisturizer with SPF 15 or higher to protect your skin from sun damage. SPF is especially important if you have acne, since sun exposure can turn healing acne into dark spots that take a long time to fade. [2] X Research source Buy a moisturizer made for your skin type. For example, if you have dry skin, go for an intense, thick moisturizer. If you have oily skin, try a light, oil-free moisturizer. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply tinted moisturizer or foundation to even out your skin tone. Squeeze a nickel-sized amount of tinted moisturizer, BB cream, or liquid foundation onto the back of your hand. Use a foundation brush to dab a little bit of foundation on your nose, forehead, cheeks, jaws, and chin. Then, use a sponge or beauty blender to buff the foundation into your skin so that it looks natural and there are no hard lines. Tinted moisturizers and BB creams will give you light coverage for a natural look. Liquid foundations usually come in light, medium, or full coverage, so be sure to check the label! If you're using tinted moisturizer, you can skip the regular moisturizer first. If you have oily skin, choose an oil-free foundation. Use a foundation that matches your skin tone as closely as possible. If you're having trouble choosing a shade, go with one that matches the skin color of your neck."

      "title": "Use concealer",
      "content": "Use concealer to cover up blemishes and dark circles. Choose a concealer that matches your skin tone and dab it directly onto the red spot or under your eyes if you have dark circles. Use a beauty blender or your finger to pat the concealer into your skin until it looks blended and natural. Avoid wiping or rubbing the concealer into your skin, since this will take the concealer off. Use a yellow-based concealer to lighten dark circles under the eyes. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Use powder to set your foundation and concealer. Dust pressed or loose powder onto your face using a large makeup brush, concentrating on areas where your skin gets oily, like your forehead, nose, and chin. Also apply powder over your concealer to set it. You can use translucent powder if you want a sheer look, or a shade that matches your skin tone for a little more coverage. Never use the same brush for multiple makeup types. If you used a foundation brush with foundation, don't use the same brush to spread powder on your face."

This keeps them looking neat and growing the correct way. If you have thin or patchy brows, use a brow pencil or brow powder that matches your hair color to lightly fill them in.

      "content": "Apply a neutral eyeshadow for a natural look. Select a natural, shimmery shade like soft peach or beige for your everyday look. Apply the eyeshadow to the center of your eyelids, then blend the color out to the left and then to the right. If you want more definition, apply a slightly darker color, like soft brown, to your crease and blend out using the same technique. You can dab a little concealer on your eyelids first to give your eyeshadow more staying power. If you have brown or hazel eyes , try accentuating them with warm colors like copper and gold. For blue or green eyes, try gray or plum. You can also have fun with crazy colors, like blue. Just remember that these are generally not everyday colors, but for special occasions and nighttime looks."

      "title": "Apply eyeliner",
      "content": "Apply eyeliner to emphasize your eyes and lashes. Not everybody needs or uses eyeliner so you can skip this step. For everyday looks, go with a brown or black eyeliner pencil. Draw a thin line on your top lid, keeping close to the lash line. If you want a more subtle look, smudge the line a little with a cotton swab. You can apply the liner on the lower lash line and smudge with a cotton swab if you want to amp up your look, or skip it for a natural look. Avoid applying eyeliner to the waterline, since this can be difficult for beginners and can cause infections. Black liquid eyeliner is not for everybody and can be difficult to use when you're learning how to apply makeup. Master the eyeliner pencils first!"

Wiggle the brush outwards, coating the lashes with mascara all the way to the tips. Do the same to the inner lashes and, if you like, the bottom lashes. You can skip the bottom lashes if you're going for a natural look. If you want a more dramatic look, lightly brush the mascara wand over the bottom lashes one time. Watch out for clumping. Wiggling can help prevent this! You can also brush your lashes with an eyelash comb to prevent clumps. For natural looks, brown mascara works best on people that have blonde, light brown, or red hair. Go with black if you want to amp up your look. If you have black hair, black mascara will look perfectly natural!"

Smile to find the apples of your cheeks (the round parts) and brush on a light amount of blush using a large makeup brush. Go for a natural look when wearing blush and use bronzers or pink rosy colors. You just want to give your cheeks a touch of color! Never wear extremely dark blush colors, which tends to look very unnatural. Be sure to stick to the apples of your cheeks and avoid going up the cheekbone for a natural rosy glow."

If your lips are dry, apply a little lip balm first and try to avoid matte lipsticks, which are very drying."

If you really want to make a statement, try super dark shades that look nearly black, or go with an ultra bright neon color. [6] X Research source In general, it's best to keep the rest of your makeup fairly natural when doing a bold lip. However, no makeup rules are set in stone!"

Once everything looks even and on point, trace over the lines with liquid eyeliner!

Buy an oil-free makeup remover to remove your makeup at night. Soak a cotton ball in the remover and wipe it over your face to get all the day's product. Makeup remover is important to help prevent clogged pores and rashes. It is specifically designed to remove makeup and makeup residue, which your cleanser isn't. Always use makeup remover before you wash your face. Use a formula for face makeup, and a separate special formula for your eyes geared towards removing mascara and liner."

It's important to exfoliate, but don't go overboard—1-2 times weekly is perfect. Apply an exfoliating scrub to wet skin and rub using gentle circular motions, then rinse it off and pat your skin dry. Exfoliating too often or too vigorously can seriously irritate your skin, so be careful. If you're dealing with acne, try an exfoliating scrub that contains benzoyl peroxide. [12] X Research source"
