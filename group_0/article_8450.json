      "title": "Cut a cone shape into the top to remove the flower end.",
      "content": "Cut a cone shape into the top to remove the flower end. Hold a chef’s knife at a slight angle, right next to the flower end of the pomegranate. Cut around the flower in a circle to remove a cone-shaped piece of fruit, then set it aside. [1] X Research source The flower end of the pomegranate has a small blossom growing out of it is."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slice off the stem end at the bottom.",
      "content": "Slice off the stem end at the bottom. Turn the pomegranate over and locate the stem, which is small, brown, and circular. Hold the knife’s edge just to the side of the stem and slice it off in a thin, disc-like shape. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Slice the skin, but not the flesh of the fruit, along ridges on the sides.",
      "content": "Slice the skin, but not the flesh of the fruit, along ridges on the sides. Look at the pomegranate from the top and locate soft ridges or bulges on the side of the fruit, running from the flower end to the stem end. Skim your knife along each ridge, cutting through the hollowed-out cone at the flower end and running it down to the stem. Press down just hard enough to slice through the skin, but not the fruit itself. [3] X Research source There should be 4-6 ridges on your fruit. The pomegranate will naturally separate along these ridges, making it easier to cut and open the fruit."

      "title": "Pull apart the pomegranate pieces with your hands.",
      "content": "Pull apart the pomegranate pieces with your hands. Hold the pomegranate in both hands and push your thumbs into the cuts along one section. Gently pull it apart with your hands to loosen and remove the section, then repeat for the remainder of the fruit. [4] X Research source Pull the sections apart gently to avoid spilling any seeds. If a few do get loose, gather them up on your surface so you can clean them."

    {
      "title": "Place the pomegranate sections in a bowl of water.",
      "content": "Place the pomegranate sections in a bowl of water. Fill a large mixing bowl with warm water, enough to fully submerge your pomegranate pieces. Set them in the water, going 1 or 2 at a time if your bowl is smaller. [5] X Research source If any seeds fell out of your pomegranate while you were opening it, place those in the water as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Push the edges down to open up the fruit and release the seeds.",
      "content": "Push the edges down to open up the fruit and release the seeds. Keep the section submerged and use your hands to push down on the edges. Pull them away to expose the seeds and let them drop into the water. [6] X Research source Besides making it easier to open the fruit, the warm water will also wash the seeds."

    {
      "title": "Hit the back of the pomegranate to knock out more seeds.",
      "content": "Hit the back of the pomegranate to knock out more seeds. Take the section out of the water and turn it upside down, so the skin is facing out. Hold it over the water and hit it firmly with the back of a spoon to knock out any seeds still attached. Let the seeds fall into your hand or the water below. [7] X Research source Whack the section 3-4 times, or until most of the seeds have fallen out."

      "title": "Remove any last seeds with your hands and place them in the bowl.",
      "content": "Remove any last seeds with your hands and place them in the bowl. Turn the pomegranate over again and inspect it for any last seeds. Pull them out with your hands or use the spoon again to knock them loose, then place them into the water with the rest. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Scoop out the pieces of white pith with a slotted spoon.",
      "content": "Scoop out the pieces of white pith with a slotted spoon. The red pomegranate seeds should sink to the bottom of the bowl, leaving the white pith to float on top. Use a slotted spoon or sieve to remove these from the water. [9] X Research source If the pieces are large enough, you can also pick them out with your hands."

      "title": "Drain the water and eat or store your pomegranate seeds.",
      "content": "Drain the water and eat or store your pomegranate seeds. Drain the water from the pomegranates using a colander. If you don’t have a colander, place a flat surface like a cutting board or lid over the opening of the bowl, leaving a small slit open at the bottom, and drain the water through the opening into the sink. Your pomegranate seeds are now cleaned and ready to eat! [10] X Research source You can also store the seeds in an airtight container. Place them in the refrigerator for 5 days, or freeze them for up to 3 months."
