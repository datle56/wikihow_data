Setting small goals for yourself, that allow you to gradually break out of your shell, can help boost your popularity. [2] X Research source Set small goals for yourself at first. For example, you can promise to make small talk with a new person before class every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. As you begin to feel more comfortable socializing with others, try to set bigger goals. You can promise you'll go to the birthday party you were invited to and try to talk to at least 3 new people. If you're persistent with following up on your goals, you'll eventually feel much more comfortable socializing. This can allow you to meet new people and make a great number of new friends."

      "content": "Invite people to hang out. If you want to make more friends, you have to focus on socializing outside the classroom.

      "title": "Be active on social media.",
      "content": "Be active on social media. Social media can help you be popular, especially in high school. Many teenagers have accounts like Snapchat, Instagram, Tik Tok, and Twitter that are a major aspect of socialization. A lot of invitations to events, as well as conversation and bonding, happen online. [4] X Research source Find out what kind of social media accounts are popular in your school. If the popular girls are really interested in Snapchat, sign up for an account. You may want to check with your parents before opening certain social media accounts, however, just to make sure that it's okay in your home. Focus on meaningful interactions online. People tend to respond better to personalized messages over vague status updates. Congratulate one of the popular girls about winning a spelling bee or getting accepted into a summer internship program. Keep in mind virtual friends cannot make up for real friends. While socializing online can enhance existing relationships, avoid talking to strangers on the internet. Not only will this not increase your overall popularity, it can be a safety issue as well."

If a popular girl declines your invitation to get coffee, she may genuinely be busy. Don't use this setback as a reason to retreat back into your shell. Remember, there is a lot you do not know about other people. Anyone you talk to has a litany of obligations and issues you do not know about. If someone says \"No,\" that person may be shy or busy. Take rejection as a minor setback. You can try asking someone to hang out in a few weeks if they say \"No\" the first time. Remember that you don't have to be popular with every single person to really stand out."

Maybe start a club if one doesn't exist already in what interests you. This is a brave, bold and risky move that will get you noticed for all the right reasons, as you're doing something different and enthusing others to join in.

Giving yourself a new haircut and changing up your wardrobe and makeup can help you feel better about yourself.
