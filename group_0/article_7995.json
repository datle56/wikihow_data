      "content": "Choose a pipe cleaner or brush that fits into your straw. Many reusable straws come with little brushes that are specifically designed to clean them out. If you have one of those, great! If not, you can easily use pipe cleaners to get the job done. Make sure the brush or pipe cleaner is long enough to clean out the entire straw. [1] X Research source If you are using a pipe cleaner that isn’t long enough, try twisting 2 or 3 together to get the desired length. Make sure to twist them tightly, so they don’t fall off inside the straw. [2] X Research source Always use clean pipe cleaners."

      "title": "Add dish soap to your pipe cleaner or cleaning brush.",
      "content": "Add dish soap to your pipe cleaner or cleaning brush. Squirt a few drops of dish soap onto the pipe cleaner or cleaning brush. You can use whatever dish soap you have on hand, or buy any brand you prefer. [3] X Research source Try a dish soap that contains natural ingredients if you are worried about ingesting soap residue. If the straw is grotty, soak it in a mix of equal parts water and vinegar overnight. If you don't have vinegar, you can replace it with lemon juice. You can also add vinegar to the pipe cleaner before inserting it into the straw."

      "content": "Insert the pipe cleaner or brush into the straw and scrub vigorously. If you’re using a pipe cleaner, insert the pipe cleaner entirely through the straw until it comes out the other end. Pull it back and forth a few times to clean out any hidden material in the straw. When using a brush, insert it into the straw and vigorously scrub the brush against the inside of the straw to remove buildup. You may have to work on each end individually, especially if you're cleaning a twisty straw or an L-shaped metal straw. If this is the case, do your best to scrub each section of the straw, working on one end at a time. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Scrub the outside of the straw with a sponge.",
      "content": "Scrub the outside of the straw with a sponge. While the main reason you want to clean out your straw is to deal with hidden residue inside the straw, don’t forget to give the outside a quick scrub as well. [5] X Research source Use dish soap and a sponge to scrub the outside of the straw. If you don’t have a sponge available, just soap up your hands and scrub the outside of the straw with your fingers."

      "title": "Rinse the inside of the straw under warm water to remove the soap.",
      "content": "Rinse the inside of the straw under warm water to remove the soap. Once you’ve scrubbed the inside and outside of your straw thoroughly, rinse it under warm water until you have removed all the soap residue – you wouldn't want to accidentally drink soap the next time you use the straw!

    {
      "title": "Place the straw in an upright position so it can dry completely.",
      "content": "Place the straw in an upright position so it can dry completely. Standing your straw in an upright position will allow excess water to drain out, letting the straw dry completely. Avoid mildew by letting your straw dry before putting it away. Use a drying rack to help your straw stay upright by leaning it against the metal frame."

    {
      "title": "Run hot water through the straw as soon as you are done using it.",
      "content": "Run hot water through the straw as soon as you are done using it. If you don’t have a pipe cleaner or brush, it is best to rinse out your reusable straw immediately after use. If the straw sits for too long, the liquid you were drinking will dry and cake onto the inside of the straw, making it much harder to clean. Rushing hot water through the straw immediately after use will clean it out nicely. If you can't immediately rinse your straw, stick it into a water bottle and take a few sips of water. While this is not as effective as hot water, it is better than nothing."

      "title": "Soak the straw in warm soapy water, then rinse it completely.",
      "content": "Soak the straw in warm soapy water, then rinse it completely. Soaking your straw in warm soapy water will break up any material stuck inside the straw. You can soak the straw for anywhere from a few minutes to several hours. Once you're done, run hot water through and over the outside of the straw to rinse our any loosened residue that might still be stuck in the straw. Try filling a large mason jar with warm soapy water and add the straw. Cap the jar and shake it thoroughly to help dislodge material. Then, rinse out the straw until all of the soap is removed. When cleaning bamboo straws, this is the best method to use. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Run the straw through the dishwasher.",
      "content": "Run the straw through the dishwasher. Most straws are dishwasher safe, but it is best to check the manufacturer instructions for the straw you are trying to clean. Once you’re confident your straw is dishwasher safe, place the straw in the bulk utensil section and run the dishwasher. [8] X Research source When clean, make sure the straw stands upright long enough for it to dry out completely. Stainless steel straws and glass straws do well in the dishwasher. Bamboo straws, on the other hand, should just be soaked and rinsed."
