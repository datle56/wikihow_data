      "title": "Evaluate the insult.",
      "content": "Evaluate the insult. Take a moment to think critically about what the person said. Is there any truth to it? Is there a reason, such as previous conflict, why this person might want to try to intentionally hurt your feelings? [2] X Expert Source Nicolette Tura, MA Confidence Coach Expert Interview. 23 January 2020. For those parts of the insult you find to be true, acknowledge that it is ok to be imperfect.

      "title": "Avoid returning insults.",
      "content": "Avoid returning insults. It can be tempting to match insult for insult. Ultimately, though, whatever your goal is, be it to get through a presentation or simply to keep enjoying time with friends or family, it is best served by refusing to engage whomever insulted you. Remind yourself that it ultimately does no good for you to insult someone in return. Tell yourself, “The best way to upset this person is not to insult them in return, but to let them know their words have no impact on me.” Try to beat them with kindness. Returning kindness for insults would make them realise their mistakes sometimes."

      "content": "Laugh it off. Laughter causes the release of endorphins, a group of hormones that can stimulate happy or euphoric sensations. Take a moment to laugh at yourself, and allow the endorphins to replace that sense of panic with better feelings. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Remind yourself that no one is immune from insults or criticism.

      "title": "Learn to accept insults.",
      "content": "Learn to accept insults. You do not have to agree with what a person says, but learning to accept an insult takes more confidence than near any other response. It shows that if the insult comes from someone you care about, you are willing to consider their point. If it comes from someone you don’t care about, it shows that they don’t impact you. [5] X Research source Practice accepting insults by going over past criticisms you have received. Say to yourself something like, “You’re not that great.” Then, practice accepting by saying, “You are right, I am not that great.” Repeat this exercise until you feel the sting of the insult wear off. It may or may not go away completely, but taking away the initial shock will give you the presence of mind to be able to respond when someone does insult you. Remember that this exercise is not about conceding their point. Instead, you are building up the confidence to acknowledge their opinion yet be strong enough so as to not let it dominate you."

Make a list of goals and actions to help you address those weaknesses. For example, if you think you aren’t a great public speaker, your practices might include engaging in more casual conversations, practicing in front of a mirror, or even taking a public speaking class.

      "title": "Choose to move on.",
      "content": "Choose to move on. This is easier said than done, but one of the best ways to build confidence long-term when you are faced with insults is to remind yourself that an insult is only effective if you let it hurt you. If you choose to move past the insult quickly and focus self-improvement or already positive aspects about your personality, the insult loses its power. [7] X Expert Source Nicolette Tura, MA Confidence Coach Expert Interview. 23 January 2020. Practice filling in statements such as, “That doesn’t matter because I’m ______.” Give yourself a reason, based in your positive traits, to dismiss the insult. For example, if someone insults you by saying, “That was a really bad presentation,” let yourself know, “That doesn’t matter, because I turned in a great report for this project.” Understand that moving on may take time. View being able to quickly dismiss insults in favor of your own positive traits as a goal rather than an immediate solution."

I am being physically attacked.”"
