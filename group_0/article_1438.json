      "content": "Wash your face with a gentle cleanser and pat your skin dry. A glowing, clean complexion helps your makeup apply better and look more natural. Start your look off right by washing your face with a gentle cleanser. Since your skin gets drier as you mature, a hydrating cleanser with ingredients like hyaluronic acid, which is a key component to youthful skin, is likely your best choice. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source After you wash your face, use a soft towel to blot your face dry. Don't rub your face—this can stretch out your skin, especially in delicate areas like the skin around your eyes."

      "title": "Apply a thin layer of moisturizer.",
      "content": "Apply a thin layer of moisturizer. Hydrated skin looks healthier, so use a lightweight face cream after you wash your face. This is especially important to apply under your eyes, as if your skin is dry, it will emphasize any lines in the area. Use your ring finger to gently spread the moisturizer until it’s fully absorbed. [2] X Research source Using a moisturizer that contains sun protection is a great way to hydrate and protect your skin from sun damage at the same time—it’s a win-win! Opt for a product with at least SPF 30 . You may also want to use a lifting or firming eye cream at night to make eyeshadow application easier come morning."

      "title": "Apply a thin coat of eyeshadow base or primer onto your eyelids.",
      "content": "Apply a thin coat of eyeshadow base or primer onto your eyelids. Regardless of your primer type, you only need to use a small amount. Be sure to apply the primer or to your eyelids just above your lashes, then blend it upward above your crease. This will give your eyeshadow something to adhere to. [3] X Research source The skin on your eyelids thins as you age, which can make them more translucent. That means they'll appear slightly purple, blue, or red. An eyeshadow primer or base will help cover that, creating a smooth canvas for your makeup while making you look more bright-eyed and refreshed. Make sure to apply the product lightly to ensure it doesn't crease."

      "title": "Wait to put on your face makeup until after you do your eyes.",
      "content": "Wait to put on your face makeup until after you do your eyes. Small pigment particles from eyeshadow application tend to fall onto your cheeks and under your eyes. This is called eyeshadow fallout, and if you've already applied foundation and concealer, the fallout will be more difficult to remove. If you do your eyeshadow first, you can brush away the fallout before applying the rest of your makeup . [4] X Research source Eyeshadow fallout can emphasize any dark circles under your eyes, making you look tired or ill."

      "title": "Opt for natural, warm eyeshadow tones.",
      "content": "Opt for natural, warm eyeshadow tones. Since dark circles and discoloration on your eyelids often have a cool tone, you'll look more lively using warmer-toned eyeshadows. Look for shades like bronze or gold to help bring a healthy glow to your eyes. Avoid purple eyeshadow tones, which can make dark circles look worse. The tone and undertones of your skin will affect which eye colors look best on you, so you may have to experiment to find your best colors."

    {
      "title": "Apply your eyeshadow to your lid, crease, and browbone.",
      "content": "Apply your eyeshadow to your lid, crease, and browbone. Start by swiping a medium-toned shade like gold across your lid with a fluffy makeup brush. Then, blend a deeper shade like bronze or a warm brown into your crease using windshield wiper motions. Finish the look off by placing a light cream shade on your browbone and the inner creases of your eyes with your fluffy brush for a lively pop of brightness. If you already have sagging or wrinkled skin, a lot of eyeshadow will only emphasize these areas. This blending technique works whether you're going for a subtle, natural look, a dramatic smokey eye, or anything in between."

      "title": "Stick to matte eyeshadows for the most part.",
      "content": "Stick to matte eyeshadows for the most part. If you have any fine lines, creases, or texture, shimmery or glittery eyeshadows will draw attention to these areas. Instead, opt for eyeshadow with little to no shimmer at all. That way, the attention will stay right where you want it—on your gorgeous eyes! Although you should avoid anything with glitter, you can make your eyes look brighter by applying the slightest bit of a pale eyeshadow , like white or cream, right on the center of your lid."

      "title": "Try using a medium-dark shade to create a natural, flattering look.",
      "content": "Try using a medium-dark shade to create a natural, flattering look. Swipe an eyeshadow brush across a medium-dark eyeshadow like caramel , sage , or bronze . Then, apply it to the outer corner of your eye, right at your lash line. Sweep and swirl your eyeshadow brush inward and upward to blend the eyeshadow up and over your crease. Continue adding light layers until you're happy with the look. [5] X Research source As the skin around your eyes starts to lose elasticity, it's common to notice some sagging. As this occurs, the crease on your eyelids will likely become more pronounced. Doing traditional eyeshadow, with a lighter color on the lids and a darker color on the crease can emphasize this effect even more. A single eyeshadow color will help lift your eyes and make them look bigger. It will also create the illusion of a new crease."

      "title": "Opt for cream eyeshadow for a softer finish.",
      "content": "Opt for cream eyeshadow for a softer finish. Cream eyeshadow goes on silky smooth, resulting in a natural, soft look. Keep in mind that a little goes a long way—simply swipe an eyeshadow brush into the container, then brush the shadow across your lids. Blend it out with your brush, a damp beauty sponge , or even your fingers, keeping the color darker at the outer corner of your eye and lighter at the lid. [6] X Research source Powder eyeshadow can settle into your creases and make your eyes look dry. Eye primer helps with that, but if you're still noticing a problem, cream eyeshadow can be a good solution."

      "title": "Shape and fill in your brows.",
      "content": "Shape and fill in your brows. Your eyebrows naturally thin with age, and they may not grow back in after you tweeze or wax them. Make them look fuller by brushing on a brow powder , pencil , or tinted gel . Fill in any sparse spots, paying special attention to the area near the tail of your brows, where they tend to thin the most. [7] X Research source Opt for a color 1-2 shades lighter than your natural hair or brow color. Avoid dark colors, and don't fill in your brows too thickly, or they'll look unnatural and cartoonish."

      "title": "Curl your lashes to make your eyes look wider.",
      "content": "Curl your lashes to make your eyes look wider. Clamp an eyelash curler at the base of your lashes and hold it there for around 10 seconds. Then, repeat on the other eye. If you'd like, you can even curl your lashes a second time for a more dramatic look. [8] X Research source If you curl your lashes, you won't need to use as much mascara, which will help you avoid the spider-lashes look. For even more lift, try using a heated eyelash curler ."

      "title": "Swipe on a single coat of lengthening mascara to show off your lashes.",
      "content": "Swipe on a single coat of lengthening mascara to show off your lashes. Since your eyelashes become more sparse with age, a volumizing, lengthening mascara is a great way to help them look fuller and longer. Press the mascara wand into the base of your lashes, then sweep it upward to coat each lash all the way to the tip. [9] X Research source Mascara opens your eyes, making you look well-rested and refreshed. Avoid applying multiple thick layers of mascara, which can result in a clumpy finish."

      "title": "Dot on your eyeliner pencil, then smudge it with a cotton swab.",
      "content": "Dot on your eyeliner pencil, then smudge it with a cotton swab. Trying to draw a perfectly straight line can be difficult on mature skin, as the skin on your eyelids softens and wrinkles over time. Instead, use a sharp, soft eyeliner pencil and apply dots of color all the way down your eyelid, closest to your lash line. Then, use a cotton swab or an angled eyeliner brush to smudge the liner, resulting in a soft, even line. [10] X Research source You can also use black or dark brown eyeshadow for this. You can apply liner to your top and bottom lashes."

      "title": "Line your waterline with a nude shadow or liner.",
      "content": "Line your waterline with a nude shadow or liner. Lightly apply a cream-colored eyeliner to your waterline or the thin line just above your bottom lashes. This will make your whole face look more refreshed and alert. [11] X Research source Work quickly to ensure your eyes don't water; otherwise, the liner will be washed away. Apply the liner lightly—the look should be subtle rather than harsh."

      "title": "Pat on concealer in a V-shape under your eyes to cover dark circles.",
      "content": "Pat on concealer in a V-shape under your eyes to cover dark circles . Use a concealer 1-2 shades lighter than your skin and apply it in the shape of a V from just under your eyes down to the tops of your cheeks. Then, pat the concealer in with your fingers or a damp beauty sponge until it's completely blended into your skin. This will give you a bright, rested appearance while camouflaging any darkness. [12] X Research source If you plan to wear foundation on the rest of your face, you can apply it at this time as well."

    {
      "title": "Set your concealer with a light dusting of pressed powder.",
      "content": "Set your concealer with a light dusting of pressed powder. Pat a powder brush onto the surface of a pressed powder compact. Then, lightly tap the powder onto the area under your eyes where you applied concealer. This will help lock in the look so it stays in place, and it will also help prevent eyeshadow, mascara, or eyeliner from smudging throughout the day. [13] X Research source Avoid using loose powder, which can look cakey and may emphasize lines. Similarly, use a light hand when you're applying the pressed powder. You can also apply the powder over any other areas of your face where you used concealer or foundation."
