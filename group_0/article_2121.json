If you wish to set Chrome to do this automatically when it starts up, open the menu like described above, but click \"Settings\" from the menu instead of \"About Google Chrome\". After the page loads, find the \"On startup\" section (you may need to scroll up/down the page to find it). Once it is found, make sure you have selected the \"Open a specific page or set of pages\" option. Click the \"Add a new page\" button and it will ask for a URL. Use the address for the \"About Google Chrome\" page as the URL (chrome://settings/help) and then click the \"Add\" button. Doing this will set Chrome to automatically check for updates on when launched."
