      "content": "Choose a food formulated for your dog's age. Depending on their age, dogs require different levels of protein, calories and other nutrients. There are different types of dog food formulated for puppies, adult dogs and senior dogs. Puppies : Puppies need higher levels of protein for their muscles, calories for growth, and calcium for healthy bones. If your toy poodle is a puppy under 12 months of age, feed it dog food that is specially designed for puppies. These are usually labelled as \"puppy food\" or \"growth\" foods. [2] X Research source Canine Nutrition. Case, Daristotle et al. Mosby. 3rd edition. Choose a puppy food designed for toy dogs. This is because the kibble size is smaller and easier for your puppy's tiny teeth to deal with. Adult dogs : When your dog reaches about 12 months of age, feed it food formulated for adult dogs. Keep them on this food until they are about 7 years old. These foods are nutritionally balanced to provide an adult dog's dietary needs. Senior dogs : When your adult toy poodle is 7 years and older, switch to a senior food. These contain reduced level of minerals such as phosphate that the kidney finds more difficult to process. By switching to a senior food, you can help protect your pet's renal function. [3] X Research source Canine Nutrition. Case, Daristotle et al. Mosby. 3rd edition."

      "title": "Choose a completely dry food diet.",
      "content": "Choose a completely dry food diet. The options for feeding are a complete dry diet (often known as kibble) or a wet diet of canned food with the addition of mixer biscuits. Dry foods are healthier for the dog's teeth, because chewing on the biscuit helps keep them clean. Wet foods can be more appealing to toy breeds, but the sticky canned or pouched food does stick to teeth and encourage plaque formation. If possible, start your toy poodle pup on a complete dry diet to help promote dental health. Look for a food designed for toy breeds, which will make chewing on the kibble less troublesome."

      "title": "Schedule the frequency of feedings depending on your dog's age.",
      "content": "Schedule the frequency of feedings depending on your dog's age. When your dog is a puppy, it has a smaller stomach and needs to be fed more frequently than when it is an adult. Puppies : Feed your toy poodle puppy small meals frequently. The general rule is 4 meals a day up to 3 months of age; 3 meals a day up to 6 months of age; 2 meals a day from 6 months through adulthood. Adult and senior dogs : Feed your adult or senior dog 2 meals per day. Two meals is recommended because a toy poodle's small stomach capacity means he prefers to eat smaller meals more often.

      "content": "Keep your dog’s coat free from snags. Poodles have a curly wiry coat that grows continually. Poodles do not shed hair in the same way as other breeds. Their hair does fall out, but it gets tangled with the rest of the coat. This means poodles are very liable to getting knots and tangles. [5] X Research source The Dog Groomer's Manual. Gould. Publisher: Crowood. Puppies have a soft coat, which starts to be replaced by adult fur from about 6-9 months of age. A full changeover to the adult coat can take until the pet is 18 months old."

Depending on how long or short you’d like to keep your dog’s coat, aim to get the hair clipped every 3-8 weeks. This is usually done at a dog grooming parlor, but with access to good dog clippers, some practice, and plenty of time, you can learn to clip a dog yourself."

      "title": "Consider plucking out your dog’s ear hair.",
      "content": "Consider plucking out your dog’s ear hair. Toy poodles have a tendency to have very hairy canals. The hair on their body extends down into the ear canal and can plug it - a bit like wearing furry ear plugs all the time. Check with your vet to determine an appropriate schedule for plucking hair. Some experts' opinions vary about whether or not to pluck this hair. The argument for hair plucking is that is allows better air circulation and thus reduces the chances of ear infections, and that it removes hair that can trap earwax. Some argue, however, that hair plucking can leave your dog's ears sore and inflamed. [6] X Research source Canine Internal Medicine Secrets. Ruben. Publisher: Hanley and Belfus."

To brush his teeth, use a soft child's toothbrush. You can also use a finger brush, which is available from your vet or a major pet retailer). You can reduce dental tartar buildup by feeding dry food to your dog. Eating wet food can create more dental problems. If your dog eats wet food, get into the habit of brushing your dog's teeth every day. [7] X Research source Veterinary Dentistry: A Team Approach. Holmstrom. Publisher Saunders. 2nd edition."

Vaccination is essential even if you carry your toy poodle everywhere, or he rarely goes outside. This is because some infections such as parvovirus are caused by particularly hardy viruses that can attach to your shoes. Therefore, they can still pose a risk to even the most pampered of poodles. Talk with your vet about implanting a microchip in your dog. A microchip will help you track the dog if he gets lost."

      "title": "Spay a female toy poodle.",
      "content": "Spay a female toy poodle. One of the health problems that toy poodles are prone to in later life is diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes). The hormones associated with estrous (heat) in the female can trigger diabetes. Therefore, it is wise to get your female toy poodle spayed. If spaying is done before the female’s second heat, this also has a beneficial effect in vastly reducing her risk of developing mammary cancer in later life. Toy poodles often live into their teens. Each time a bitch has a season, it weakens the lining of her womb and makes her more likely to develop a pyometra, which is a potentially life-threatening womb infection. Thus, spaying whilst she is fit and strong removes the possibility of needing emergency surgery in later life when anesthesia can pose a higher risk.

Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell. 2nd edition Neutering a male toy poodle does not give the same compelling health benefits. Neutering a male is mainly done to prevent unwanted breeding and to control behavioral issues such as aggression or dominance. Talk with your vet to learn more. Discussing your dog’s health with your vet will give you a good idea about which direction to take."
