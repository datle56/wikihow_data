      "content": "Consider the other person’s perspective. If you’re in a workplace, then take a look at your company’s dress code, in case your colleague simply doesn't know the standards. If you’re dealing with a friend or family member, think of ways that you can present the situation that will reflect their personal values or beliefs. [2] X Research source Know your company's dress code, if you’re speaking with a colleague or employee. It’s possible that the person simply doesn’t know that they have a problem, as they may have a decreased ability to smell or are unaware of how to care for their hygiene. [3] X Research source Some people may view hygiene as a community obligation, rather than a simply personal one, so be aware of potential cultural values that you can point to as support for improving the situation.

Some health conditions or mental illnesses can contribute to difficulties in managing personal hygiene, so it’s important to be aware that discussing this topic may bring up other issues. Depression can cause anxiety, a sense of helplessness, and deep sadness that may interfere with a sufferer’s ability or desire to maintain good hygiene. [5] X Research source Certain illnesses of and damage to the brain or nervous system may affect a sufferer’s physical ability to care for themself, and so add to a lack of good hygiene. [6] X Research source Drug or alcohol abuse can cause confusion, fatigue, memory loss, and lack of attention, which may all contribute to less attention to personal hygiene."

You may be concerned about the other person’s feelings, or you may have difficulty bringing up challenging issues with others. If you mentally prepare yourself by focusing on the goal and eliminating any extra emotions, you’ll feel more confident in the conversation. [7] X Research source Make a list of all outside issues and emotions that are causing you anxiety and plan to leave them out of the conversation. Remember that this discussion will be painful, but it will definitely help your friend or colleague in the long run.

Although you don’t want to “gossip” about the situation, it’s important to be sure that you’re focused on the goals of the conversation and that you can feel more confident about your approach.

[9] X Research source Include a mentor or another friend as a support system to help you prepare and to be present during the difficult conversation.

Rushing through between appointments or when you have other plans may lead to confusion and hurt feelings. [16] X Research source Meeting at the end of the workday is the best option for a co-worker or employee, so that they don’t feel self-conscious all day long.

A phone meeting might be acceptable, but it may lead to more awkwardness, since you can’t see each other’s expressions or body language. Email isn’t really useful, as the conversation is delayed and broken up, and you can’t see one another’s body language or hear tones of voice. Additionally email poses privacy concerns.

Choose a safe, neutral space, like a conference room, outdoor park, or a study area, so neither party has too much dominance in the conversation. If one person feels less powerful in the room, they may feel even more nervous or defensive about the situation. [20] X Research source Avoid crowded public places, like coffee shops or restaurants, that might lead to greater embarrassment and a more emotional response. Your office may feel like the principal’s office to your colleague, and there may be more interruptions. These interruptions will hurt your chances of having a calm and thoughtful conversation.

I've noticed some odors that seem to follow you from place to place.\" Leave the cause open-ended so that the person can explain if they feel comfortable doing so. Hygiene is a personal issue, so they may not want to offer details about their habits or problems. \"You don't need to explain your situation to me, although I'll be willing to listen if you want to.\" Try to explain that body odor issues may be a “violation of employee dress code.

It’s important to let the person have a chance to respond to the situation, especially since learning that other people are bothered by one’s poor personal hygiene can be distressing. [32] X Research source Let the person express the emotions they need to, even if that means they are visibly upset and this is uncomfortable for you. Don’t interrupt unless they ask you a question. While interrupting is sometimes a useful strategy, in this case, you don’t need to assert control over this part of the conversation. Pay attention to both what the person says and how they say it. Note verbal and non-verbal cues, and be ready to summarize and reflect on their response before you continue."

[33] X Research source Let them know you understand their feelings, but you need to keep on track: \"Thank you for being honest with me about your feelings. Let's talk about how we can solve this problem together.\" If the person becomes defensive, remember to reaffirm the relationship and their value as a friend or employee, but be clear that personal hygiene is an important aspect of their success, both personally and professionally. Be ready to redirect the conversation back to personal hygiene and the ways you can help, especially if the person now seems to think that they are worthless as a friend or employee. If an employee shares that their poor hygiene is related to depression, then show genuine compassion and urge them to seek counseling. You should still express that employees should practice good hygiene when coming to work. [34] X Research source"

Our relationship/your work is important, so let's talk about how we can move forward.\" [35] X Research source Young college students, for instance, may not know how to do their own laundry , so offer them suggestions for detergents and methods for washing clothes. If the person insists that they bathe frequently, suggest new soaps or deodorants to help to combat odors, and be willing to explain how to apply deodorant. Discuss alternative options for solving the problem, paying attention to the person’s needs as well as your own; ask \"What can I do to help you?\""
