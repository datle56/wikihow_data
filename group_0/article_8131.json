An old electric toothbrush can be a great alternative to a regular toothbrush, since it requires minimal effort from you! Rinse and repeat until the canvas is clean. Once you are satisfied with the cleanliness of the shoe, rinse it well with more cold water to remove any traces of soap. You'll want to do this carefully because dried soap residue can leave their own stains on your shoes. Then do the other shoe. When rinsing, try your best to not get any water inside of the shoe."
