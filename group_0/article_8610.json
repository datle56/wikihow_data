Stir the mixture until it forms a paste that can be easily spread. Adjust the amount of water used if 3 tablespoons does not create a spreadable paste. [3] X Research source"

If that doesn’t work for you, you can also spread the paste with a clean spatula. Coat the interior of the oven with the paste. Do not apply the paste to the heating elements.
