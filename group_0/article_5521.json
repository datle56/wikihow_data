      "title": "Understand when your monitor needs calibration.",
      "content": "Understand when your monitor needs calibration. Typically speaking, high-resolution monitors that you connect to a desktop unit (e.g., a 4K display) require some calibration before they'll display correctly the colors and items on your screen. Failing to calibrate such monitors can result in washed-out or blurry textures. Lower-quality monitors (e.g., 720p ones)—especially ones used for gaming or other casual activities—don't need to be calibrated, though calibration won't hurt them. Built-in monitors such as the ones included in laptops rarely need calibration, though you're more than welcome to calibrate built-in monitors using the same process you'd follow for a separate one. Color calibration is especially important for graphics professionals, since they want to get everything to match as closely as possible to what the output product might look like. If you do professional photo or video editing, you can also calibrate your monitor using a colorimeter for greater accuracy."
