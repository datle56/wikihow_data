      "title": "Choose a set of computer speakers.",
      "content": "Choose a set of computer speakers. As long as your laptop has a USB or speaker/headphone jack, you should be able to use most wired computer speakers. Most computer speakers have a 3.5mm (1/8\") audio input connector, which is the small plug that will fit into a typical headphone jack. These speakers will also need to be plugged into a power source. Some USB speakers, especially more powerful ones and those with subwoofers, also need to be plugged into a power source. Smaller USB speakers are usually powered by your computer, so they won’t need to be plugged into the wall. If you have available USB ports, USB speakers might be more convenient."

      "content": "Arrange the speakers in your workspace. Most speakers are clearly marked as Left (L) or Right (R) on the back or bottom of the unit. If your speakers come with a subwoofer, you may want to put it behind your system or on the floor. Make sure that wherever you choose to place your speakers, the connector cable will reach its corresponding input on your computer, and the power cable (if you have one) can safely reach an outlet."

If you’re using a 3.5mm (1/8\") connector, look on the sides of your laptop for a small jack that has a drawing of headphones or a speaker. Don’t plug it into the jack with the drawing of a microphone. If you’re using USB, plugging in your speakers may trigger the system to start installing drivers. If you are asked to insert a disk, insert the one that came with your speakers and follow any instructions that came in the packaging."

Here’s how to check: If you’re using a MacBook, you can rest assured your laptop has Bluetooth capabilities. Nearly all Windows PCs in operation should have Bluetooth, but if your computer is very old, you can check by pressing ⊞ Win + X and selecting Device Manager. If you see a category called \"Bluetooth, “Bluetooth Radios,” or similar, click it to expand a list of Bluetooth devices. If anything appears in this list, you have Bluetooth.

Some things to keep in mind: The speakers will need to be plugged into a power source. Having a wall between the laptop and the speaker shouldn’t affect the connection too much, but it can potentially decrease sound quality. If you want to be able to turn the speakers on and off easily, you may not want to mount them in a difficult-to-reach location. Check your speaker manual to find out how close your laptop must be to your speakers. Typically, these speakers can be up to 30 feet away, but some devices may have lower ranges."
