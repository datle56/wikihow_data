For instance, if you have a function that describes how fast a car is going from point A to point B, its derivative will tell you the car's acceleration from point A to point B—how fast or slow the speed of the car changes."

Subtract your result in Step 2 from your result in Step 1. Be careful, order matters! Divide your result in Step 3 with the square of the bottom variable. Check out this example: ((x^7)/x)' = (7x^6*x – 1*x^7)/(x^2) = (7x^7 - x^7)/(x^2) = 6x^7/x^2 = 6x^5 This is perhaps the hardest of the tricks to do, but it's well worth the effort. Make sure to do the steps in order and subtract in the correct order, and this will go smoothly."
