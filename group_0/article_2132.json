    {
      "title": "Use AI as a support tool instead of using it for actual writing.",
      "content": "Use AI as a support tool instead of using it for actual writing. Instead of using AI to create text that you’ll pass off as your own, use AI to answer questions, generate inspiration, or find a new perspective on whatever topic you’re writing about. Not only will your writing be fresher and more interesting, but you’ll avoid AI detection entirely. [2] X Research source If you’re in any kind of academic setting, you’re cheating yourself by relying on AI anyway. It’s okay to use it for inspiration, tips, or ideas, but do not use AI to write your school papers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Edit AI text to give it a more human feel.",
      "content": "Edit AI text to give it a more human feel. If you are going to use any kind of AI writing, edit the text line by line and make liberal changes to the wording. This will minimize the odds that your work is detected as AI, and it’s the only way to ensure that the content actually reflects the content you’re trying to create. [3] X Research source For example, if you ask ChatGPT, “When did the Civil War start?” it will reply with “The American Civil War started on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces fired on Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina.” You might revise this as “The US Civil War started on April 12, 1861, when a Confederate force opened fire on the Union-occupied base of Fort Sumter.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Vary your sentence structures, vocab, and tone.",
      "content": "Vary your sentence structures, vocab, and tone. See how we used the word “vocab” there instead of “vocabulary?” Yeah, that’s something AI would never do. Throw a little razzle-dazzle in your writing to keep everything fresh. Switch up your sentence structures, avoid using a fixed, bland tone, and express your ideas with enough personality to get past AI detectors. [4] X Research source There are four types of sentence structure , and mixing up how often you use each sentence type goes a long way towards getting away with some AI use. Simple sentences. One subject, one verb, and one clause. (“He went to the store.”) Compound sentences. Two independent clauses. (“He went to the store where he ran into his coworker”) Complex sentences. One independent and one dependent clause (“He went to the store but forgot his wallet.”) Compound-complex sentences. At least two independent clauses and one dependent clause. (“Although he was tired, he went to the store where he ran into his coworker.”) AI writing tools tend to over-rely on complex and compound-complex sentences. Typically, the sentences don’t have more than one dependent clause. If you use way too many complex or compound-complex sentences, you may get flagged as AI. Throw in some simple sentences. Like this paragraph!"

      "title": "Rely on a human editor and proofreader.",
      "content": "Rely on a human editor and proofreader. If you aren’t able to write at all, at least have a human editor and proofreader give the work a look. Encourage them to make changes as liberally as possible. This will at least give you a shot at getting around an AI detector. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Rewrite AI content entirely in your own voice.",
      "content": "Rewrite AI content entirely in your own voice. If you are determined to use AI content, another way around a detector is to just rewrite the material using your own voice. Redo every single sentence so that it actually is entirely your words. [6] X Research source For example, if you ask Claude, “How did the US civil war impact US geography?” it opens with a line, “The most immediate geographic impact was the reunification of the United States after the Confederate states' attempted secession.” You might rewrite this to simply be, “Obviously, the biggest impact on the geography of the country was the fact that it became twice as big overnight as the Confederate states were forced to rejoin the union.”"

    {
      "title": "Make minor punctuation changes.",
      "content": "Make minor punctuation changes. You don’t have to make major changes to get around AI detectors. In fact, one of the most consistent and straightforward ways to beat AI detectors is to make minor adjustments to the punctuation. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For example, take this sentence generated by Rytr: “Over the centuries, cheese-making techniques have evolved and spread across the globe, resulting in the wide variety of cheeses we know and love today.” You might revise the sentence to be, “Cheese-making techniques have evolved and spread across the globe over the centuries, resulting in the wide variety of cheeses we know and love today.” Try using more semicolons and em-dashes instead of commas—AI writing tools almost never use these punctuation marks."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix up the AI tools you’re using.",
      "content": "Mix up the AI tools you’re using. For example, instead of just relying on ChatGPT alone, you might use ChatGPT to help with one paragraph, swap to Claude for the second paragraph, and then use Rytr for the third paragraph. By mixing up which tools you use, you’ll avoid creating a ton of repetitive patterns that an AI detector would notice. It’s essential to edit your work for flow when you do this, since each AI tool has its own distinct voice. If you don’t make any manual changes, it will read like different people wrote each section."

    {
      "title": "Avoid using the most common AI words.",
      "content": "Avoid using the most common AI words. As we’ve mentioned before, AI is just not very good at writing. Part of why it’s not particularly adept is that it tends to reuse the same exact words over and over again. By avoiding the most frequently-used words, you’ll avoid getting your content flagged as AI—especially if you didn’t use it to write any “original” work. [8] X Research source The most common AI words are the most important to avoid: Elevate, hello, leverage, tapestry, journey, headache, resonate, testament, explore, binary, evoke, delve, enrich, seamless, multifaceted, foster, convey, beacon, interplay, and “sorry!” (with the exclamation point)."

      "title": "Sneak in a few Cyrillic letters.",
      "content": "Sneak in a few Cyrillic letters. For reasons not entirely understood, a single Cyrillic letter will cause many AI detectors to completely fry. For some AI detectors, the text will be undetectable, and it won’t report it as written by a human or an AI tool. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The Cyrillic alphabet is used in Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, and a bunch of non-Slavic Eastern European languages, like Mongolian, Uzbek, and Tajik. You can find a full Cyrillic alphabet for copy-and-paste purposes here ."

      "title": "Try using an AI bypass tool to check your work.",
      "content": "Try using an AI bypass tool to check your work. AI bypass tools (sometimes called “humanizers”) are basically as accurate as AI detectors, which aren’t very accurate to begin with, but they can give you a sense for where you need to revise your work to avoid detection. We’d only use the free trials or free versions of these apps given their spottiness, but there’s no harm in seeing what they highlight with your text for editing. [10] X Research source The most popular AI bypass tools are StealthGPT, HumanizeAI, Quillbot, BypassGPT, and AI Humanize."

      "title": "AI detectors rely on pattern recognition to detect fake content.",
      "content": "AI detectors rely on pattern recognition to detect fake content. To put it plainly, AI is not very good at writing. It’s typically very stiff as an authorial voice, and it relies on so many patterns in its sentence structures that reading long-form AI content gets dull very quickly. AI detectors are LLMs (language learning models) that use examples of AI writing to spot other types of AI writing. [11] X Research source The most popular AI detectors out there right now include GPTZero, ZeroGPT, Copyleaks, Writer, Crossplag, Sapling, Corrector, and Originality.ai, with Originality.ai being touted by users as being the most accurate. [12] X Research source Most academic submission programs, like TurnItIn and Blackboard , have built-in AI detectors built on one of the previously listed programs. If you haven’t noticed why this is funny yet, AI detectors work by relying on AI."

      "content": "No, AI detectors are worse than a random coin flip. There has yet to be an AI detection tool that can accurately detect content created by AI. [13] X Research source That said, AI detectors do seem to be okay at catching blatantly obvious AI, so you are much more likely to get caught red-handed if you make zero effort to avoid AI detection. [14] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source There have been a few studies on AI detection tools. One found that out of 449 articles, only 2 were detected as having a 0% probability of being written by AI. The problem is that all 449 articles were human-written, leading to a hit rate of 0.4%. [15] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The same study also submitted 47 articles written entirely by AI. The AI detector only found a “high probability” of AI-generated content 43.5% of the time. [16] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Another study found that when you get regular AI hits by AI detectors when you submit work that was published before the advent of the computer.
