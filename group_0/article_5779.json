      "content": "In person Go to your home studio location, or the location that you originally signed up in, and ask the front desk staff to cancel your membership. Most locations will give you a cancellation form to complete, so fill out your name, address, phone number, email, membership ID number, and the last 4 digits of the credit card you use to make membership payments. Then, ask the front desk staff to copy the cancellation form before you turn it in. The Orangetheory staff member might ask you your reason for canceling or try to get you to stay. Just be honest, polite, and firm about wanting to cancel. If the studio manager is working on the day you go in, the front desk staff might ask you to complete the cancellation with them. Copying your completed form protects you against paying for a continued membership in case something happens to the original form."
