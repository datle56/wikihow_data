[1] X Research source If you are over 18 and hold a job, check with your employer about dress codes. Also, if you go to a private school, you’ll want to find out if face piercings are acceptable."

      "content": "Research a quality piercer. Don’t go looking for a bargain. You don’t want to risk anything going wrong. Instead, ask around. Word of mouth is a great way to find a reputable piercer. If no one knows of anyone, start looking some up online. Go into the shop and get to know your piercer before you decide. Ask them about previous piercings that they've done, if there were every any issues, and how long they've been doing them. Sometimes, they’ll even have a photo album for you to look through. Ask to see certificates that their Autoclave has passed spore tests. If they do not have an autoclave, leave immediately. The shop should be clean and sanitary. Some piercers are registered with the APP. Whilst this ensures they should be sanitary in their work, it does not mean that they do good piercings. Always check feedback of their customers and do not assume that an APP certificate means that they are a good piercer."

      "title": "Watch your piercer.",
      "content": "Watch your piercer. If they take you into a room without sufficient lighting, question it. They should be able to see what they are piercing. Also, watch them wash their hands and put on sterile gloves. If they already have gloves on, you are completely justified in asking them to re-wash their hands and replace the gloves with new ones."

    {
      "title": "Sit still.",
      "content": "Sit still. While you’re getting your nose pierced, try to stay as still as possible for your piercer. It is a small pinch just like any other piercing, and you’ll only feel it for a second."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use implant grade material.",
      "content": "Use implant grade material. Titanium and surgical steel are good substitutes, but most piercers include the price of a surgical steel piece of jewellery in the price of the piercing. If you ask for gold, titanium, and niobium (niobium is the material least likely to irritate your skin) the piercer may add an additional cost."

    {
      "title": "Use new needles.",
      "content": "Use new needles. The needles that they use should be brand new and in sterilized sealed pouches. You should see them open the sealed packages. If you get into the room and the needles are already open, you are once again justified in asking for new ones."
    },
    {
      "title": "Throw away the needles.",
      "content": "Throw away the needles. Your piercer should throw away the needles in a biohazard container after using them. They should also provide after-care instructions at this point. [3] X Research source Most piercing salons will carry the cleaner that they are going to recommend to you."

      "title": "Wash your hands.",
      "content": "Wash your hands. You should be cleaning your piercing twice a day for the first three months. Before touching it, it is essential that you use antibacterial soap to wash your hands thoroughly. Skipping this step is often the cause of infection."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use saline solution.",
      "content": "Use saline solution. A saline solution is a mixture of warm water and non-iodized sea salt. Your piercer can either sell you some from the studio, or he can tell you where to buy it. When you use it, it should be the temperature of a drinkable hot beverage. Place it in a microwaveable cup and heat it in 10 second increments. Once it is the correct temperature, take a sterile tissue and dip it into your solution with clean hands. Generously wipe down your piercing with the solution. [4] X Research source The optimum time for your saline solution is right after you shower. Do not reuse the same cup of solution."

    {
      "title": "Don’t play with the piercing.",
      "content": "Don’t play with the piercing. Throughout the day, resist the opportunity to play with your nose ring. Your hands are constantly covered in bacteria and this is a great way to get an infection. If you notice any build-up around the ring and you don’t have your cleaning solution with you, wash your hands and soak the piercing for a few seconds in warm distilled water until the build up easily comes away. Do not move the jewellery in and out, as this may cause hypertrophic scarring."

      "content": "Watch for green and yellow. If the painful inflammation continues, watch for discharge from the piercing. If it the discharge is green or yellow and smelly in nature, seek medical attention. This combination could mean infection. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for a red raised bump.",
      "content": "Look for a red raised bump. This bump can occur within a few days or months after the piercing. Not all bumps are infected but if they’re red and resemble a pimple with pus inside, they likely are. Pus is not always a sign of infection, but get it checked with a doctor just in case. DO NOT remove the piercing if it is suspected to be infected, as this traps the infection and will likely have to be drained. Always ask your doctor before removing jewellery of an infected piercing.

      "title": "Use clean jewelry.",
      "content": "Use clean jewelry. Three months after your piercing, it should be healed and you will be able to put a different nose-ring in. It is best to get jewellery that has been autoclaved (sterilised with a combination of gas and pressure) and sealed in a pouch. If it has been touched by other people before being inserted, put it in boiling water and wait for the water to cool before removing the jewellery and inserting it into your nose."

      "content": "Continue to clean regularly. Now that your piercing has healed, you don’t need to clean it twice a day. You can gradually work your way down to cleaning it a couple times a week. Instead of your saline solution, make sure you’re washing it in the shower. Do so with a face cloth (cleaned regularly) and antibacterial soap."
