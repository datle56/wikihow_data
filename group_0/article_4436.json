      "content": "Check the label for the brand and size information. The first thing you look for when finding items to sell is the label—if the brand name is misspelled or the size information is missing, it may be fake. To make sure, search up the item online and compare the tags—if anything is out-of-place, it may be better to skip this one. [20] X Research source For example, if an item is labeled “one size fits all” but looks like a vintage (pre-1980s) piece, it’s probably not original to the time. However, some brands have logos that change over time, so it may be worth it to look up the history of the label to make sure the misspelling isn’t intentional."

If you see a piece that’s labeled as a designer or high-quality brand but has wonky or loose stitching, it’s probably a fake. [21] X Research source If you’re not sure whether the item is authentic, compare the item to a close-up picture from the manufacturer’s website. [22] X Research source Real holes in leather will have slightly uneven or rough edges, while fake leather stitching holes are usually uniform and perfectly punched. [23] X Research source"

[24] X Research source To use it, upload a picture of an item and get verification from professional authenticators in 1 to 24 hours. You may ask the checkout person to hold an item for you while you wait, or check in with the store to see if they have a return policy so you can get your money back if it’s fake."

      "title": "Take lots of pictures of your piece before sending it.",
      "content": "Take lots of pictures of your piece before sending it. One of the most common scams on eBay and similar sites is where a buyer claims that you sent them a damaged item so they can get their money back. They may even provide fake photo evidence using a replica of the piece. To avoid this, take tons of photos of the item and the packaging before you send it. [25] X Research source You can also file an insurance claim with the shipping provider and tell the buyer to hold onto the item until the agent can come inspect it. Even if you don’t actually file the claim, the scammer might stop asking for a refund because they’re afraid of being exposed."

If you send the item before the check goes through, you’re out of luck. To avoid this, make sure the money is in your account before shipping off the item.

If you only accept the other person’s money through the original site, this ensures that the company will compensate you if you do fall victim to a scam. [27] X Research source Try not to agree to exchange texts or emails with your buyer so the reselling site has a paper trail of all the communication between you two. [28] X Research source"

Thrift stores tend to have sales on certain days of the week—they might have whole-store discounts, or they might attach colored tags to items that tell you how much they’ll take off.

      "content": "Find pieces that are cheap but may fit current clothing trends. Reselling is all about calculating the cost of the item versus its demand. The more likely your item is going to be super popular online, the more likely it’s going to sell—and on sites like eBay, where sales are auction-based, this may increase its price, too. [30] X Research source However, timeless brands like Chanel or Patagonia might be worth a little extra money out-of-pocket because you know that they’ll probably sell."

      "content": "Check for any tears, stains, or defects in your pieces. Minor issues, like a little wear and tear, might not make a difference, but large holes or irreversible stains may make your pieces less valuable to buyers. [31] X Research source Before you head to the checkout line, look over all of your items to make sure there are no super obvious flaws that may make them difficult to sell. In some cases, a defect may be worth it. For example, if you found a handbag that’s typically worth $100 online but has a tear in the handle, you may take the risk for a bigger payoff."

      "title": "Take clear, well-lit photos of the pieces you’re selling.",
      "content": "Take clear, well-lit photos of the pieces you’re selling. Try to get a selection of photos with different angles and take close-up pictures of the fabric and the tag so users can verify that the piece is authentic. You can take pictures with the item hanging up in front of a neutral background, or snap a photo of you wearing it, if you’re comfortable doing so. [32] X Research source Make sure there is enough light in the room to see the details in your pieces. On eBay, you can use the background removal tool to edit out the backdrop and create a more pleasing image."

      "content": "Begin your title with relevant keywords. When you’re ready to put your item online, start by listing the brand or category (men’s, women’s, children’s, etc.) in the title. That way, customers can find the luxury pieces they want right away. Then, list the type of item, its size, and a short description of the piece. [33] X Research source For example, you might write “Karen Millen Puffer Jacket XXL Detachable Fur Hood.” If they apply, add keywords like “vintage” or “retro” to the end of your title. Try not to use words in all caps, characters like asterisks, or acronyms that users might not understand."

You might update the photo, change the keywords in the title or description, or lower the price to compete with other resellers. [34] X Research source You can also share your piece on a social media site like Pinterest to generate some interest in your item."
