The first thing you have to do when you want to give a toast is to get everyone to stop talking and listen to what you have to say. Stand up and lift your glass to about your shoulder level.

[3] X Research source If you’re at a birthday party, you may need to work a little harder to get everyone’s attention. Do not clang silverware against your glass. It’s rude, and you might break the glass. Instead, say something like, “I’d like to propose a toast,” in a loud, clear voice."

Don’t worry about being funny. Just be honest and sincere. [4] X Research source Here are a few examples of how to start a toast: “I’m Jenna Conrad. Eleanor is my grandmother, so I don’t remember when I first met her. But one of my first memories is sitting in the dirt as she taught me how to plant peas.” “My name is Peter Williams.
