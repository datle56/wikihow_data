[3] X Research source You can also be considered a Jew according to this law if you converted to Judaism and are not a member of another religion. If you converted to Judaism, you’ll need a letter from an Orthodox rabbi that you can bring to the rabbinical court. This group is part of the Israeli justice system and they determine who is considered Jewish or not. [4] X Research source"

This means that you should avoid any involvement in extremist groups, especially those who are antisemitic. You should also ensure that you have no criminal record and that you aren’t infected with a contagious disease."
