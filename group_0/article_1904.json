      "title": "Be cool and confident.",
      "content": "Be cool and confident. There is no need to pretend you're there for any other reason than to ask for his number. He'll respect your confidence and chutzpah if you make it clear you made a beeline for him just for this purpose. [2] X Research source Some people advise pretending to go up for some other reason, such as wanting help with a forgotten homework question or wanting to know something. That might work if you're feeling really timid but it can also backfire in that that's the only thing you'll end up asking, as your courage fails you. Moreover, it'll soon become clear to the guy that asking for his help was just a ruse, which can show you're able to lie. Not a great start."

      "title": "Ask the guy for his phone number.",
      "content": "Ask the guy for his phone number. Avoid beating around the bush, seeming coy or making a joke about it. All you need to do is get to the point. Guys are taught to get to the point early on, without resort to wiles and in the twenty-first century, it's somewhat odd that some gals feel they still have to play the game of coyness. So you can do this too, it's not unreasonable to get to the point."

    {
      "title": "Be casual in asking.",
      "content": "Be casual in asking. You don't need to be blunt but you do need to be clear, and by being casual, you can achieve a smooth request. [3] X Research source Say something casual on the lines of \"Hey, can I have your number to text you sometimes?\" Simple. Then say thanks, and walk away. At this point, he'll anticipate your text, and you'll have his number. You don't need to explain the request but if you want to, keep it simple, such as \"it'd be super helpful if I could reach you by text\"; or \"I'd just like to be able to reach you easily to ask you to some of the dorm parties we'll be throwing soon\". If he asks you why you want his number, keep it simple. For example, say something like \"I'd like to keep in contact with you, I think you're really cool\" or \"You give me good advice\" or \"You're good fun\" ."

    {
      "title": "Be a chicken.",
      "content": "Be a chicken. If it is really, really hard for you to be open about getting his number, use studies or work or something to get the number. Ask if you can review test subjects with him and he will most likely give you his number. Or, approach the guy casually and show him your phone. Show him your contacts and then say: I really want to beat my friend and see who has the most contacts by the end of the day so.. can I get your number? (Don't sound pushy or greedy or excited, act as if you're telling this to your parents.) The problem with using any ruse is that this is all he'll probably expect you to text about, unless he has made it openly clear he fancies you. If you start texting constantly about anything unrelated, he's likely to be unimpressed."

      "title": "Don't be devastated if he says no to giving you his number.",
      "content": "Don't be devastated if he says no to giving you his number. There are lots of possible reasons, from wondering why you're asking out of the blue to not being allowed to give his number to people. Or he might not know you that well and feels that this is awkward. [4] X Research source Get to know him before you ask for his phone number again. There is another chance! Say thanks for his consideration. End politely with something like: \"No worries, just thought I'd ask. I can understand if you feel it's a bit much from someone you don't really know yet. Maybe another time.\""

      "title": "Have a friend pass the number to you.",
      "content": "Have a friend pass the number to you. This is fraught with the potential annoyance this guy might feel towards his friend or even a sense of betrayal but if you work with it carefully, and don't abuse having the number, it might be okay sometimes. Don't dump the friend in it; be vague and say that \"someone\" offered his number to you without specifying exactly who. Or, if there is a plausible reason for seeing his number, such as on a phone tree for sports practice, or something, you have a legitimate out for saying you saw it that way. Although, little white lies aren't a good start to anything."

      "title": "Use the phone number sparingly once you have it.",
      "content": "Use the phone number sparingly once you have it. You don't want to end up in the situation where he so regrets that you got hold of his number that he goes and changes it just to be rid of your texting and calls! The phone number is just a small step in growing your relationship, so spend a lot of time on all the other important aspects, such as getting to know him face-to-face and hanging out together. Use the phone as a tool to make meet-ups, not an excuse to pour out your heart. Don't text him too much. Good job if you get his number, but don't annoy him and make him regret his decision. Be mature with what you say, and have fun! It's okay to use emojis here and there, but don't overuse themâ€”you don't want to come off as too eager.
