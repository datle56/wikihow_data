      "content": "Set up a safe area to burn your charcoal and copal. The whole charcoal disc will get hot, so you need a heat-safe plate or bowl underneath it. You can also use a stone or a small stone slate. Keep tongs or a metal spoon and some water nearby just in case. [1] X Research source Some people put sand in a bowl to sink the disc into.

      "content": "Light the charcoal disc. It's best to hold the charcoal with tongs if you can. If not, just hold it by one edge and light the other side. [3] X Research source Use a match or lighter to catch the edge on fire. You should see a light spark. Set it down on the heat-safe surface. [4] X Research source You can also use a burner to catch the charcoal on fire."

      "content": "Wait for the charcoal to turn white. The charcoal will be black when you set it on fire. Leave it to burn for 5 to 10 minutes, and it will turn white and ashy all over. Don't touch the disc with your fingers at this point! [5] X Research source At this point, some people pour a small pile of salt in the indention on top of the disc. The salt acts as a buffer between the heat of the charcoal and the resin, so it doesn't burn quite as hot. You won't get as much smoke this way, but you can experiment to see what works best for you.

You can always add more later if the charcoal hasn't burned out. [7] X Research source This method of burning copal will produce a lot of smoke, so you can use it for smudging your house. However, if you get too much smoke, use tongs or a spoon to knock the resin off for a while. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Try a resin burner for ease of use. Put a small amount of copal into the cup of the resin burner. Next, find a socket for the plug and connect it to an electrical outlet. If the burner has a temperature setting, turn it to 235 °F (113 °C), and place the lid on top. Let the burner heat the resin. Watch out, though, as the lid will get very warm, so use tongs to move it once the burner gets hot. [11] X Research source If your chunks are too large to heat easily, crush them a bit with a mortar and pestle. To keep the bowl inside clean, try adding a foil cup before putting in the resin.

Turn the stove burner on to medium-high, and then set a piece of resin on the foil. Make sure to keep an eye on it the whole time it's burning.

      "content": "Use a pan to burn the copal on your stove for another quick solution. Pick a small pan that you don't mind dedicating to resin burning, though you can line it with foil if you'd like. Turn the stove burner to medium-high, and put the pan on top. Set a small amount of copal resin in the pan, and let it start burning. Leave it on until the copal burns out. You can always add more copal as needed. [14] X Research source Don't use a pan that has a nonstick coating, as those can put off chemicals if you don't have much in them."

      "title": "Use an oil warmer for less smoke.",
      "content": "Use an oil warmer for less smoke. Place a small piece of resin in the top of the oil warmer. Turn the warmer on, or if it has a candle instead, light the candle and set it underneath the warmer. Let the resin warm up, and it will produce fragrance. [15] X Research source These warmers can be electric or have a small candle underneath, and they're typically used for aromatherapy oils. Because you're not burning the copal directly, you won't get much smoke. However, you can warm the same resin over several days. Just leave it in the warmer to cool, then turn the warmer back on when you want to heat it up again."
