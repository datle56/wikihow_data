      "title": "Buy fragrance oil.",
      "content": "Buy fragrance oil. Fragrance oils are simply a synthetically created smell. Many perfumes are created using fragrance oils because the scent options are plentiful. It is also an inexpensive way to add scent to candles. [1] X Research source Oils can be purchased at most major retailers that sell home décor or candle products."

      "title": "Light the candle.",
      "content": "Light the candle. Let it burn for several minutes or until about an inch-deep pool of melted wax has accumulated around the wick. Once this happens, blow the candle out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add fragrance oil.",
      "content": "Add fragrance oil. Use an eye-dropper to add a few drops of fragrance oil into the hot pool of melted wax. About 3-4 drops should be enough to create a nice, light scent. However, if you want a richer scent, add several more drops. Every bottle of fragrance oil is a little different so read the instructions for best results. The bottle will offer insights into how concentrated your particular oil is."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stir the wax.",
      "content": "Stir the wax. Use a toothpick or other small instrument to mix the wax and oil. Start with small circles close to the wick and work your way to the outer edges. Be as thorough as you can to create an even distribution of oil. Mix slowly to avoid making a mess or splattering hot wax onto your hands. You can create a unique scent by adding two oils. Consider combinations like vanilla and rose or lavender and pine."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the wax cool.",
      "content": "Let the wax cool. Wait for the wax to cool and harden completely. This will take several minutes. Doing this will allow the oil to settle into the wax and really absorb, which will further enhance the scent."

    {
      "title": "Light the candle.",
      "content": "Light the candle. When ready, relight your candle. Within seconds, you will be able to smell the scent you’ve added. After several minutes, the smell will fill the room. If you are unhappy with the potency of the scent, make note of how many drops you added and increase the number for the next time. If you can’t smell anything at all, blow the candle out again and repeat the steps of adding drops to the wax, mixing, allowing it to cool and relighting."

    {
      "title": "Make a mess-free candle.",
      "content": "Make a mess-free candle. You will need wax beads which are tiny wax balls, slightly larger than sand. These are available in a myriad of colors. You will also need a glass jar, wick and an essential oil of your choosing. The glass jar can be any size and any shape, based on your preferences. You can even use something you have at home like a mason jar or small glass bowl. Wax beads and wicks can be purchased at the local craft store, along with an essential oil."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour beads into container.",
      "content": "Pour beads into container. With one hand, hold the wick in the center of the desired container and pour your wax beads around it. Do not fill the container completely. Leave about an inch of room at the top. The wick should also stand slightly above the beads. Use a spoon to flatten and smooth the top of the beads so they are evenly distributed in the container. [2] X Research source If the wick is too long, simply cut it to size and save the remaining piece for a future project. Avoid wicks with metal in them like lead, as this is a toxin. Instead, choose one made of soy or bees wax."

    {
      "title": "Add essential oil.",
      "content": "Add essential oil. An essential oil is a highly-concentrated scent produced using plants, leaves and flowers. The aromatherapy benefits are plentiful as they promote health, positivity, joy and more. Use a dropper to add a few drops of oil onto the beads. About 3-4 drops should be enough to create a nice, light scent. [3] X Research source However, if you want a richer scent, add several more drops. Using a toothpick, slowly stir the beads to allow the oil to penetrate the entire container. Every bottle of essential oil is a little different so read the instructions for best results. The bottle will offer insights into how concentrated your particular oil is. Keep in mind that because essential oils are natural, they are more potent than fragrance oils so a little goes a long way."

      "title": "Let the beads rest.",
      "content": "Let the beads rest. While you can light your candle immediately, for best results, allow the scent to absorb throughout the container and settle. Waiting 24-48 hours is best. If the container has a lid, cover it during this time."

      "title": "Purchase scented cubes.",
      "content": "Purchase scented cubes. Scented cubes are small wax cubes with a powerful scent. Most large retailers carry scented cubes and there are hundreds to choose from. While most people place them on a warmer, causing them to melt and emit a smell, they can be used alongside candles."

    {
      "title": "Light the candle.",
      "content": "Light the candle. Using a candle of your choosing, let it burn for several minutes or until about an inch-deep pool of melted wax has accumulated around the wick. Once this happens, place the scented wax cube into the melted wax. The flame will help the scented wax continue to melt down and emit a strong smell that will fill up the room. Sense the wax cubes are so strong, consider cutting them in half using a butter knife."

      "title": "Continue to enjoy.",
      "content": "Continue to enjoy. The scented wax will melt to form a layer of wax. Every time you light this candle, the scented wax layer will continue to emit a smell for quite some time."

      "title": "Gather materials.",
      "content": "Gather materials. To make your own candle, you will need a bag of soy wax flakes, one wick (more if making several candles), a glass container for the candle, a scented oil of your choosing, skewers and a glass measuring cup. You will be able to find these items at a craft store. Consider using palm or beeswax flakes as an alternative."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set the wick.",
      "content": "Set the wick. Grab the container of your choice. This could be a glass bowl or a mason jar. Lay the metal end of the wick flat along the bottom of the container. Tape the top end of the wick to a skewer so that the wick is pulled completely straight. Lay the skewer on top of the container with the wick outstretched. If the wick is really long, simply cut it with scissors. It should reach slightly above the rim of the container. If a skewer isn't available, just about anything will work. Try using a kitchen utensil instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Measure your wax flakes.",
      "content": "Measure your wax flakes. Use a glass measuring cup for this. You will need twice the amount of wax flakes as the size of your container. For example, if your container measures one cup, pour two cups of wax flakes. If you're unsure about the size of your container, simply fill the container with water. Pour the water from the container into a measuring cup to have an exact measurement."

    {
      "title": "Melt the wax.",
      "content": "Melt the wax. Fill a saucepan halfway with water. Then, set your glass measuring cup with wax flakes in the water. Make sure water isn't getting into the container. If it is, you will need to pour a little water out. [4] X Research source Turn your heat to medium-high and stir the wax with a metal spoon or spatula. Once completely melted, turn the heat off. This will only take a few minutes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add scent.",
      "content": "Add scent. Using an essential oil, add about 10 drops into the melted wax. This will create a moderately scented candle. For a stronger scent, add more drops. Stir the wax and scent slowly using a toothpick or metal spoon. Remember that you can replace the essential oil with a fragrance oil or scented cube, if that's more readily available. Each bottle of oil will have specific instructions regarding number of drops, follow these guidelines for best results."

    {
      "title": "Pour the wax into the container.",
      "content": "Pour the wax into the container. Use an oven mitt to hold the glass measuring cup. Hold the skewer so the wick doesn't shift while pouring. Slowly pour the scented wax into the container. Let the wax sit and cool for 3-4 hours."

      "title": "Burn the candle.",
      "content": "Burn the candle. After the candle is completely solidified, remove the skewer. Feel free to burn your scented candle and enjoy. These make excellent, inexpensive gifts as well."
