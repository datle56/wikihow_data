    {
      "title": "Choose a bottle that you'd like to bedazzle.",
      "content": "Choose a bottle that you'd like to bedazzle. The bottle can be full or it can be empty. A plain bottle with straight walls might be easier to work with, but you can use a fancy bottle instead. For example, if the bottle has a molded or fluted design, you can incorporate that into your final design. If you plan on selling the bottle, check with your country's laws; in some countries, it is illegal to sell full bottles of alcohol."

    {
      "title": "Remove the label",
      "content": "Remove the label , if desired. You don't have to remove the label at all, but removing it will give you a smoother surface to work on. If you'd like to incorporate the label into your final design, leave the label on. [1] X Research source For regular glass or plastic bottles, fill the sink with warm water, add a bit of dish soap, and let them soak for about 20 minutes to loosen the labels before scraping them off. Some labels leave behind residue. Be sure to remove this residue with soap and water."

    {
      "title": "Wipe the bottle down with rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Wipe the bottle down with rubbing alcohol. Soak a paper towel or tissue with rubbing alcohol, then wipe the bottle down with it. This will remove any grease or oil that may prevent the glue from sticking. Take care to avoid the label if you left it on. [2] X Research source If you accidentally got rubbing alcohol on the label, don't worry; just let it dry."

      "title": "Cover any areas you don't want painted, if you'll be painting the bottle.",
      "content": "Cover any areas you don't want painted, if you'll be painting the bottle. When you bedazzle a bottle, some of the glass may show through between the gemstones. This won't be as noticeable with clear glass, but it will be noticeable with colored glass. [3] X Research source Use painter's tape on labels. Do not use masking tape, or you'll rip the paper. Champagne bottles have foil on the top. Wrap paper around this, then secure the paper with tape. Don't get any tape on the foil."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spray paint the bottle, if desired.",
      "content": "Spray paint the bottle, if desired. Take the bottle outside or into a well-ventilated area. Stand it upright on a sheet of paper and shake a can of spray paint. Hold the can 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) from the bottle, then apply 1 coat of spray paint. Wait 15 to 20 minutes, then apply a second coat. Match the color of the spray paint to the gemstones that you'll be using. Silver spray paint works best for white or silver gemstones. Gold spray paint works the best for yellow or gold gemstones."

    {
      "title": "Let the paint dry completely, then remove any masking material.",
      "content": "Let the paint dry completely, then remove any masking material. After 20 minutes or so, the paint should be dry. Different brands of paint have different drying times, so double-check the label. Once the paint is dry, carefully peel the tissue or painter's tape off. If the foil cover peels off, gently press it back down."

    {
      "title": "Plan out your design.",
      "content": "Plan out your design. You can bedazzle the entire bottle or just a small part of it. You can even apply more gemstones in 1 area and fewer in another for a gradient effect. If your bottle has a molded design, such as a tufted diamond pattern, you could apply tiny rhinestones to just the creases. Here are some more design ideas: Create a centerpiece on the bottle with a large, ornate jewel, then add smaller jewels around it. Leave the rest of the bottle blank. Create rings of rhinestones for a striped effect. How much space you leave between the rings is up to you. Glue tiny rhinestones randomly or in a grid-like pattern for a subtle effect. This would look great on frosted glass!"

      "title": "Purchase a rhinestone trim or a variety of individual rhinestones.",
      "content": "Purchase a rhinestone trim or a variety of individual rhinestones. A rhinestone trim is a bunch of rhinestones strung on thread; you can find it in the ribbon, lace, and trim section of a fabric store. It is great for bedazzling an entire bottle or outlining labels. Individual rhinestones are better if you need a specific look. The rhinestones don't have to look like crystals. Consider flat-backed pearls or beads! Get a variety pack of rhinestones if you want more texture. Make sure that the pack includes different shapes, sizes, and colors. Use rhinestones that are all the same shape, size, and color for a uniform look. Get a few extra rhinestones that are a little smaller/larger to fill in gaps."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a rhinestone glue or industrial-strength glue to adhere the gems.",
      "content": "Use a rhinestone glue or industrial-strength glue to adhere the gems. You can find both in the glue aisle of a craft store. Apply the glue to the bottle in small patches before adding the rhinestones. If the glue does not have a nozzle, then squeeze out a small amount, and apply it with a toothpick or craft stick. Rhinestone glue, such as Gem Tac, is great for individual rhinestones. It is difficult to peel off. Industrial-strength glue, such as E6000, is better for larger rhinestones. It offers a strong bond, but it can peel off."

      "title": "Apply individual gemstones in off-set rows.",
      "content": "Apply individual gemstones in off-set rows. Apply the first row in a ring around the bottle's bottom edge; this will ensure that everything is straight. Add the second row right above the first row. Place these rhinestones right between the ones from the previous row, like laying down bricks. A pair of tweezers may come in handy here. [4] X Research source Switch to smaller rhinestones for narrow areas, such as bottle necks or curves. You may get a gap at the end of a row. Fill this gap in with a rhinestone that's a little smaller or larger, if needed."

      "title": "Wrap and glue rhinestone trims around the bottle if you want to save time.",
      "content": "Wrap and glue rhinestone trims around the bottle if you want to save time. Apply a thin of glue around the base of the bottle. Press the end of your trim into the glue, then wrap it around the bottle. Apply another line of glue right above the first row, and wrap the trim around the bottle again. Keep going until you get the coverage you want. [5] X Research source You can start from the top of the bottle instead, but make sure that your ring is straight. If your bottle has a foil top, finish the trim just below the foil. Use a pearl trim for a more elegant touch. Make sure that the pearls have a flat back; they will be easier to glue on than spherical pearls."

    {
      "title": "Use a variety of rhinestones if you want more texture.",
      "content": "Use a variety of rhinestones if you want more texture. Apply the glue to a small patch on the bottle. Lay down the bigger rhinestones first, then fill in the gaps with small and medium-sized ones. Finish each patch before starting on the next. Avoid placing 2 rhinestones of the same color, shape, and size next to each other. [6] X Research source You don't have to let the glue dry and cure completely before moving onto the next patch. About 10 to 15 minutes should be enough. The size of the patches doesn't really matter. Plan on working on 5 to 7 rhinestones at a time, however. Use some non-rhinestone gems for even more texture, such as pearls."

      "title": "Let the bottle dry before adding details or gifting it.",
      "content": "Let the bottle dry before adding details or gifting it. How long the bottle takes to dry depends on the type of glue you used. Some glues will have a curing time in addition to a drying time, so check the label on your bottle or tube of glue. In most cases, expect to wait 1 to 2 days for the glue to set."

      "content": "Outline labels with rhinestone trim for a fancier touch. Apply the glue and trim to 1 side of the label at a time. If you are decorating the front label, consider doing 3 rows of rhinestone trim. Use a thin trim for the first and third rows, and a larger trim for the middle row. Use a thin, simple trim for the back label. [7] X Research source You don't have to use rhinestones for the middle row. Try pearls or even studs!"

      "content": "Glue large, fancy rhinestones over round stamps or seals. Some bottles have a round stamp or seal near the top, right between the neck and label. Choose a large rhinestone, then glue it right over the stamp or seal. Glue 1 to 2 rows of tiny rhinestones around the larger one for a fancier look. [8] X Research source The large rhinestone should be large enough to cover the stamp or seal. For more variation, use tiny pearls for the first row, and silver rhinestones for the second row."

      "title": "Break up monotony and add texture with glitter.",
      "content": "Break up monotony and add texture with glitter. If all of your rhinestones are the same shape, size, and color, your bottle may look monotonous. Give the bottle a quick coat of a clear-drying glue or spray sealer, then shake some glitter onto it. This works especially well over smooth, pearl trims. [9] X Research source If you are using spray sealer, it must be glossy, or you will dull down the rhinestones. Use glitter that is the same color as your rhinestones to help blend it in some more. Extra-fine glitter will look pretty, but you can use chunky glitter instead, or even a combination of both!"

      "content": "Layer larger gems and rhinestones over tiny ones. If you covered your entire bottle with rhinestones, it may look a little monotonous. Let the bottle dry first, then add larger rhinestones, gemstones, or flat-backed pearls on top. Use these sparingly; do not cover the entire bottle with these. [10] X Research source This works especially well over a pearl trim. The rhinestones will help add some texture."
