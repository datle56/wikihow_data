      "title": "Practice good posture.",
      "content": "Practice good posture. Stand up straight whether you’re walking, standing or sitting. Pull your shoulders back slightly to expand your chest and hold your chin up high. Good posture alone can speak volumes for confidence, and you’ll be putting off the appearance of coolness whether people consciously notice or not. Posture is one of the core elements of body language, and it’s one that stands out the most. Your posture is a reflection of the way you feel about yourself, and can betray a lack of confidence, even if you’re well dressed and smiling."

      "title": "Smile.",
      "content": "Smile. No matter what you’re doing, smile. Smiling not only shows that you’re comfortable doing what you’re doing, it sends the message to others that you’re comfortable around them and that they should be comfortable with you in turn. Don’t ham it up. A small, pleasant angling of the mouth and a brightening of the eyes is all it takes to announce to people that you’re a nice guy who knows how to have a good time… and maybe even has a little mystery about him. [1] X Research source Smiling has also been linked to heightened levels of physical attraction, so you’ll be doing yourself an added favor by displaying a friendly exterior. [2] X Research source To show interest in a crush, you definitely want to be on the playful side of communication and personal interactions. Show that you are a friendly person!"

      "title": "Move with purpose.",
      "content": "Move with purpose. This is a physical extension of being comfortable with yourself and has to do with the way you move around and deal with your environment. Keep your movements smooth and deliberate, and avoid any wasted motion. You should strive to always be composed and carry yourself with ease. This tells people that you’re in complete control over yourself and your surroundings. [3] X Research source If you don’t learn to move economically, your movements will look clumsy and uncoordinated, which can act as a sign of incompetence. Don’t gesture wildly when talking to people, as this can be off-putting during conversation. At the same time, don’t stand there inanimate like you’re too timid to move. Try to strike the right balance."

      "title": "Open yourself up to people.",
      "content": "Open yourself up to people. When standing or talking with someone, “open” yourself to them physically by keeping your body facing them directly. Look at who you’re speaking to and maintain eye contact. You’ll be much more approachable and inviting than you would appear if you were unwittingly closing the people around you off by having your body turned away from them, diverting your eyeline when they’re talking, etc. [4] X Research source Try not to cross your arms, fidget or tug at your clothing absent-mindedly. In addition to being examples of “closed” body language, it make look like you don’t know what to do with them. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Make yourself the most important person in the room.",
      "content": "Make yourself the most important person in the room. Without boasting or acting like an egotistical jerk, take possession of the room and everyone in it. Whether you’re talking or listening, you want to give the impression that you’re a person of importance. Do this by employing assertive body language (standing tall, remaining open, moving about easily) that encourages those around you to pay attention to you and being staying engaged but considerate. Behave as though everything you say and do has as weight that impacts others. [6] X Research source Give the “fake it ‘til you make it” approach a shot—assume that all eyes are on you and that people look to you to serve as an example of what “cool” is. Take a moment to think about what you’re going to say before you say it. You’ll come across as thoughtful, and you’ll also be less likely to stutter or make mistakes while talking."

      "title": "Show enthusiasm around people.",
      "content": "Show enthusiasm around people. Display interest when talking to people and be enthused about whatever you’re doing. You should make it a goal to become the kind of person that can talk to anyone. That kind of magnetism will pay off once it’s time to really start drawing attention; if the girl you’re trying to impress happens to be watching, this will convey to her that you’re friendly and show a genuine interest in others. [7] X Research source Be an active listener. Use verbal cues like “yeah,” “mhmm,” and “I agree” when conversing to demonstrate that you’re paying attention. [8] X Research source Encourage equal input in discussion with the person you're talking to and thereby establish rapport. After they say something about themselves, agree or mention something about yourself that you can use to relate to them, then give them the floor again."

      "title": "Stay humble.",
      "content": "Stay humble. It won’t matter how cool you look if you constantly put others down or hog all the attention for yourself. Rather than using your time to show off or brag about your accomplishments, maintain a modest attitude toward yourself. Accept compliments graciously, and break yourself of the need to talk about yourself all the time. The fact is, no wants to be around someone who thinks they’re better than everyone else, so be sure to give praise and attention where it’s due, not just take it. [9] X Research source Those who are truly cool don't feel the need to prove it to others because they are sure of themselves. Being able to recognize the qualities of others is a sign of self-confidence, as confident people know it and don’t always need the spotlight on them."

      "content": "Act self-assured. Above all, you should respect yourself and let people see who you are without the fear of judgment or ridicule. Self-consciousness is almost impossible to hide, and the reality is that it’s unwarranted in most situations. If you’re not worried about what pretty girls or anyone else will think, you won’t have anything holding you back. You’ll have a better time, and your personality will shine through. [10] X Research source [11] X Research source Focus on enjoying yourself. Don’t let looking good in front of girls turn into a joyless mission. Cool people always manage to have a good time no matter the environment they’re in."

      "content": "Keep your cool. Don't let yourself get flustered if things don't go your way in social interactions. If you want to show people that you're cool, it's important to be in control of your emotions. Keep a level head, and try not to appear indignant when you get uncomfortable. When you find yourself getting agitated, take a few deep breaths until the feeling wears off, and remember to keep smiling. Whatever the situation, stay relaxed and make sure that your personable demeanor doesn't miss a beat. Don't take offhand remarks personally. When someone criticizes you or says something you don't agree with, just remember that they're only voicing a single opinion. Your own peace of mind should remain unfazed. If you simply can't help but become anxious or upset, put on a poker face. Even if you're unable to shake it off, you can at least maintain a cool persona by keeping other people from seeing it on you. [12] X Research source"

If you’ve taken all the steps necessary to look good but appear uncomfortable in your own skin, you’ll just end up signaling that you’re trying too hard. [19] X Research source If you tend to be tense in public places or when meeting new people, take a few moments to prepare yourself mentally before you go out. Plan your activities in advance so that there will be no surprises. Practice things you might say when making an introduction. Be able to laugh at yourself when you goof up. It indicates a positive attitude and a sense of humor, both traits that people are drawn to. [20] X Research source"
