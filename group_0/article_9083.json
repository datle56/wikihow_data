      "content": "Make sure that your second hard drive is attached. Before you can determine which hard drive is the \"Master\" and which is the \"Slave\", you'll need to have both drives attached to your computer. While the \"Master\" drive is usually your computer's built-in hard drive, the second one must be attached manually to your computer's motherboard. If you haven't yet done so, you'll need to install the hard drive before proceeding."

You may receive a prompt at the bottom of the screen right before the startup screen that says \"Press [key] to enter setup\" or something similar. If you miss the BIOS window, you'll need to restart your computer and try again. Consult your computer's manual or online documentation to determine the BIOS key for your model of computer."
