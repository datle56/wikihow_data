      "title": "Buy cotton swabs.",
      "content": "Buy cotton swabs. Cotton swabs are easy to find in any store where health and beauty products are sold. Try to get swabs that don't look very fluffy so the cotton isn't left behind in the jack or port. Swabs with thinner tips work better because they are easier to fit inside the jack. Make sure your device is powered off before you continue."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove some cotton from the swab's tip.",
      "content": "Remove some cotton from the swab's tip. On one end of the swab, begin tearing or cutting off cotton from the tip. Make the tip as close to the width of the swab's middle portion as possible. Once the swab tip is this size, it should fit comfortably inside the jack."
    },
    {
      "title": "Gently brush the jack.",
      "content": "Gently brush the jack. Don't jam the swab into the jack. Slowly push it in until it rests inside the hole. Spin the swab to brush off all sides of the jack. Remove the swab and most debris will fall out. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Swab with rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Swab with rubbing alcohol. For difficult debris, you can dip the swab in some rubbing alcohol. Make sure the swab is lightly coated, not soaked or dripping. Squeeze out excess moisture with a tissue or cloth first. Put the swab back inside the jack and spin it again. Rubbing alcohol can corrode the metal, so use it sparingly. You may want to let it sit and dry for a few minutes before putting it back in the jack."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dry out the jack with a clean swab.",
      "content": "Dry out the jack with a clean swab. The rubbing alcohol should dry quickly on its own. However, you can remove excess moisture to minimize the jack's exposure. Stick a clean swab into the jack. Leave it in there for a moment and spin it around to collect the alcohol. Wait at least an hour before powering your device back on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Buy a can of compressed air.",
      "content": "Buy a can of compressed air. Compressed air, which can be found at electronics, office supplies, or computer stores, is used for clearing debris from computer parts and keyboards . Air is least likely to damage your jack since you don't have to put anything inside the hole other than the air."
    },
    {
      "title": "Point the nozzle at the headphone jack.",
      "content": "Point the nozzle at the headphone jack. Get the air dispensing opening right up next to the jack. Some bottles come with thin straws that stick out from the can. These may be easier for you to use since you can point the tube directly at the jack and focus the air into the small opening."
    },
    {
      "title": "Release the air.",
      "content": "Release the air. Press the button on the top of the can to start dispensing air. You should only need a blast or two to loosen most debris inside the jack. Make sure all it comes out of the hole. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Unfold a paperclip.",
      "content": "Unfold a paperclip. Open up a paper clip so that one end is straight. Once straight, the paper clip can be used to scrape out debris. But since the metal can scratch the inside of the jack, you should never simply insert it into the port. A toothpick can also be used, but the pointed ends can also scratch the jack's interior. Needles are useful for reaching lint and large debris but can easily scratch the jack. Only use a needle as a last resort."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap tape around the clip's end.",
      "content": "Wrap tape around the clip's end. Use standard office tape (like Scotch or Sellotape). Tightly wrap the tape sticky side up around the straightened end of the paperclip. Before use, check to see that the tape is secure and won't come off. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Gently insert the taped end of the paperclip into the jack.",
      "content": "Gently insert the taped end of the paperclip into the jack. Slowly move the tape into position. Don't jam it in there. Reach for any debris you see. The tape forms a lint roller and will remove stuck debris and lint. After cleaning out the headphone jack with a taped paperclip, you may want to clean it out with a cotton swab, just for good measure."

    {
      "title": "Purchase an interdental brush.",
      "content": "Purchase an interdental brush. These are small dental brushes with bristles on all sides of the tip which are typically used for cleaning braces . You can buy them at any drug store or health and beauty supply store. This can be useful for removing any corroded metal or rust that has accumulated on the inside of your headphone jack. Make sure your device is turned off before inserting a brush or anything dipped in alcohol."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lightly soak the brush in rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Lightly soak the brush in rubbing alcohol. To do so, dip the brush in some rubbing alcohol and then tap it a few times to remove excess alcohol. It should be damp but not soaking wet. If it is too wet, ring it out with a cloth or tissue."

    {
      "title": "Insert the brush into the headphone jack.",
      "content": "Insert the brush into the headphone jack. Don't ram it in. Make sure you insert it gently as far as it will go. Then rotate it to loosen any debris left on the inside."

    {
      "title": "Repeat two or three times.",
      "content": "Repeat two or three times. Go ahead and reinsert the brush into the headphone jack and twist it a few times to make sure all the debris is cleaned out. Be sure to wait at least an hour before powering your device back on."
