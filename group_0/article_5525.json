      "content": "Inspect the oven sensor. Open your oven and look for a straight narrow rod extending from the back—this is the oven sensor rod that detects the temperature inside the oven. Check that it's not touching the sides or top of the oven because this could throw the temperature reading off. [1] X Research source If the oven sensor is touching the oven walls, tighten the screws that hold the rod in place. If you can't move the sensor rod away from the walls, call an appliance repair person before you calibrate your oven."

You don't need expensive tools or equipment to check the oven temperature—an inexpensive oven thermometer will do! Hang it or set it on the middle rack of the oven and turn the oven on to 350 °F (177 °C). [2] X Research source Remove pots, pans, or sheets so the thermometer and oven racks are the only things in the oven."

Set a timer for 20 minutes and then write down the temperature again. [4] X Research source For the most accuracy, repeat this for a full hour. This gives you a lot of data for determining if your oven temperature is off."

      "content": "Average the readings to determine your oven's offset. Add up all of the temperatures and divide the number by the number of readings you took. The result should be within 10 degrees of 350 °F (177 °C). If it's off by more than 10 degrees, you'll need to calibrate your oven. [5] X Research source For example, if your 3 oven readings were 378 °F (192 °C), 362 °F (183 °C), and 355 °F (179 °C), the average temperature is 365 °F (185 °C). Your oven's temperature is off by 15 degrees—this is the offset number."

[7] X Research source On a GE oven , push the \"Bake\" and \"Broil\" buttons for 3 seconds to access the special features (SF) menu. On a Whirlpool oven , press the \"Settings\" button and keep pushing until the screen shows \"Temperature Calibration.\" To calibrate a Kenmore oven , press and hold the \"Bake\" button until you see 00 on the display screen. On older Whirlpool and Frigidaire ovens , press and hold the \"Bake\" button until the display says \"Calibration.\""

Once you're in the calibration menu for your model, push the arrow or +/- button by the amount you want to offset. For instance, if your oven is 20 degrees too hot, decrease the temperature by pressing the \"-\" or down arrow button until it reads \"20.\" [8] X Research source For a GE oven, press the \"Save\" button to lock in the new calibration settings and exit out of the menu. Some models, like a newer Kenmore, might have you use the number pad to enter the amount you want to offset the temperature. Then, press \"Save\" to exit. To save and exit on an older Whirlpool, press the \"Enter\" button. Sometimes this button is also labeled the \"Save\" button."

Turn the shaft a few degrees to the right to raise the temperature or turn it a few degrees to the left to decrease the temperature. It can be hard to see how much you're offsetting the temperature.

Take your screwdriver and turn each screw to the left a few times to loosen them. Then, follow the directions on the dial to raise or lower the temperature by turning the knob slightly. [10] X Research source The dial might say \"Make hotter\" on one side and \"Make cooler\" on the other side so you know which direction to turn the knob."

It should still point at 350 °F (177 °C) since this is the temperature you tested and calibrated your oven to. If you put the knob back on and it's pointing to a totally different temperature, adjust the dial or shaft and try again. If you loosened the screws to adjust the dial, tighten the screws before you return the knob to its place."
