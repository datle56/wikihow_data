[5] X Research source This can be done by adding together the separate molar masses of each element found in the solution. Find the molar mass of each element using the periodic table of elements. Make sure that you count the atoms for each element and calculate the molar mass of each of the atoms. Example problem: Molar mass of K = 39.1 g Molar mass of Mn = 54.9 g Molar mass of O = 16.0 g (The solute contains 4 O atoms, so count the 16g 4 times.) Total molar mass = K + Mn + O + O + O + O = 39.1 + 54.9 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 158.0 g"
