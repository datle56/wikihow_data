      "content": "Consider the Taurus's nature. It's important to sit down and be a tad bit realistic. A Taurus is very protective and is often jealous, like his opposite, Scorpio. If your sign happens to be Aries , Leo, Sagittarius, Aquarius, Libra, or Gemini, you may have to forget about getting along with a Taurus, much less attracting him. His overbearing nature will be too stuffy for you. Make sure your sign meshes well with his! If he can handle his bull-headedness, his need for routine, and his need to lead, by all means! This could be a relationship that lasts a very, very long time. But if these are factors that you can't see yourself tolerating long-term, try not to get your heart twisted in a bunch. He can make for a good fling, but little else."

      "content": "Develop a routine together. Taurus likes his routine and his woman will need to be a part of it. So carve out a space for yourself! Make him part of your routine and vice versa. The deeper ingrained you two become in each other, the harder it'll be to break. This does not, by any stretch of the imagination, mean that you two have to be involved in every aspect of each others' lives. No, no, no. It simply means to have routine hobbies and activities that you two do together that you can depend on. Stir Friday. Bowling league. Saturday morning mimosas. You each still need your own life! But each other has their definite, solid part."

      "content": "Practice nonviolent communication and work with his ego. Sometimes men can get pretty defensive when it comes to their manhood, and Taurus is no different -- in fact, he may be the cause for this gender stereotype. His pride and ego dominate a large facet of his nature -- if you attack this, he will not be happy. Make sure allow him to lead you on occasion -- he'll love it and love you for it. There are delicate ways to do everything. If you two are fighting, this does not mean backing down and saying, \"You're right, honey. I'm sorry.\" (Unless he is right, of course.) It means saying, \"I don't understand what this has to do with that. Can you explain it to me?\" With Taurus, a certain amount of tact will get you a long, long way."

      "content": "Know you may need to draw him out. If you're looking for a man that will shower you with adoration, Taurus isn't it. Sure, he's very capable of being affectionate, but he may take his precious time. If you can muster it, be patient. Show him you're comfortable being caring and demonstrative and he will echo you back. Don't be discouraged if he's not as caring as you'd like him to be. If it's an issue, address it! He'll value your honesty and straightforwardness. Give him a while to come around to the idea. He's worth the wait, you know?"

      "title": "Work on trusting each other.",
      "content": "Work on trusting each other. Along with being aloof and slow to make his move, Taurus can be a bit untrusting. He's very much so of the mantra \"If you want something done right, you do it yourself.\" This leaks into his romantic relationships too, where he's used to doing his own thing. However, over time, if you show him you're trustworthy and responsible, he'll see it makes sense to let his guard down. That's when you know you've won Taurus's heart. If you're all these things: honest, practical, diplomatic , and patientâ€”there will be no issue. Trust will just fall into place! Make it clear that your loyalty lies with him and only him; if he trusts you, he'll show it back. That means he's in it to win it!"
