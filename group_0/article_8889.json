Before brushing long hair, you should check for major knots. If you use your brush through large knots, you can cause damage to the hair. Run your fingers downwards through your hair starting a few inches from the tips of the hair, and gradually work your way up the hair a few inches at a time. [2] X Research source Work through the more manageable knots. If you encounter a knot you can’t run your fingers through, don’t force your fingers through the hair."

      "content": "Apply a detangling product. If you’ve encountered a large knot that you can’t get out using your fingers, use a product that will help ease out the knot. Apply the product to the knot according to the instructions on the label. [3] X Research source For fine hair, use a spray. For medium thickness hair, try a lotion. For thick and coarse hair, or kinky hair, use a cream."

Be gentle, using small strokes to work at the knot. You should be able to get most of it out. [4] X Research source If you don’t have a wide toothed comb, you can also use a paddle brush."

      "content": "Use your fingers to finish untangling the knot. By this time, most of the knot should be untangled.

      "content": "Use the right brush. If you are brushing straight hair, you may want to use a different brush depending on whether the hair is wet or dry. Your hair is most fragile when it’s wet. [6] X Research source Many experts advise using a comb when hair is wet rather than using a brush, which is more aggressive on wet hair. When long hair is dry, you can use either a comb or a brush. Try to use a paddle brush with soft bristles at least a few times a week. This brush stimulates the scalp and spreads healthy oils down from the scalp through the hair. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Brush from the ends and work your way up.",
      "content": "Brush from the ends and work your way up. Using your brush or comb, start brushing down the hair about one inch from the roots. This ensures that all the knots are gone, and it is much more gentle. As you are done with a section of hair, keep going up until you have reached the roots. [9] X Research source If you start at the roots, you will end up tugging at your hair, which will cause breakage and split ends."

      "title": "Brush from the roots to the bottom.",
      "content": "Brush from the roots to the bottom. Once you have worked your way up to the roots, brush a couple strokes down from the roots to the tips of the hair shaft. Doing this will distribute the healthy oils from the scalp to all of the hair, and it will make long hair stronger."

      "title": "Use a comb.",

Products meant specifically for curly hair deliver this moisture to curly hair for more defined curls.

      "content": "Comb from the ends and work your way up. Just like with straight hair, you want to start brushing near the tips of the hair and work your way up. Curly hair is especially prone to tangling, so it’s important to not start from the roots. [12] X Research source If you encounter tangles, do not yank the comb through them. Even if it untangles the knot, using too much force can mess up the pattern of the curl and make curly hair look frizzier."

      "content": "Brush from the roots to the bottom. Once you have worked your way up to the roots, brush a couple strokes down from the roots to the tips of the hair shaft. Because the hair is wet, you won’t distribute as much healthy oil from the scalp as you would if it were dry, but it is still an important step in making curly hair healthy."

      "content": "Clean the hair out of your brush or comb at least once a week. An important part of caring for long hair is making sure that your brush or comb is clean.

      "content": "Deep clean your brush at least once a month. You also will want to do a full cleaning of your brush at least once a month. Clean your brush by dousing the brush into a mixture of warm water and a teaspoon of shampoo. Dunk the brush in several times, then scrub the brush and rinse it off. Do not soak your brush, as this can damage the bristles."

      "content": "Clean your comb every other month. Deep cleaning is more important for brushes, because there is more space for dirt and bacteria to settle. However, it is still a good idea to clean your comb about every other month. Follow the same procedure as cleaning a brush."

      "title": "Replace old brushes or combs.",
      "content": "Replace old brushes or combs. You do not need to replace your comb or brush very often. However especially for brushes, if you notice that bristles are falling out of your brush, or that the round balls at the top of your bristles are coming off, you should invest in a new brush. Old brushes and combs can cause damage to hair if their bristles or teeth are crooked or broken."
