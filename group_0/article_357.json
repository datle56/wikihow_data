      "content": "Be yourself. As much as you want to gain the approval of a girl, altering your personality to do so isn’t the way to go! Even if it works in the short-term, you’ll feel fake and happy, and chances are she’ll eventually find out who you really are. Know who you are. Own up to your thoughts and feelings in life. Being genuine and self-assured is appealing to girls and will make you feel good about yourself, too. [1] X Research source Avoid becoming overly generous or aggressive in an attempt to win her over.

      "title": "Be honest with your intentions.",
      "content": "Be honest with your intentions. Starting out befriending a girl you’re interested in is a good idea, but if you have feelings for her, don’t hide them. Work towards starting a relationship, paying attention to her. If you hide your feelings, she won’t know how you feel and can feel betrayed or in a bad position when she does find out. Conversely, don’t lead on a girl if you only want to be friends. Remember the tried and true (if somewhat cheesy) saying: Honesty is the best policy! Remember to respect her boundaries. Don’t push your feelings upon her if she doesn’t return your interest. She’ll be grateful and will be more likely to want to be friends, even if she doesn’t return your feelings."

[9] X Research source A good question, for example, is to ask her what kind of music she likes. If she likes the same music, you can share that interest. Even if you have different tastes, you can say, “I’ve never really listened to that genre. Can you give any recommendations to a newbie?”"

In return, don’t speak negatively about girls or share their secrets with your friends. This information may get back to them and give you a bad reputation. Show them your trustworthiness and they’ll soon consider you a loyal friend."
