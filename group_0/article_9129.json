      "title": "You most likely cannot use only an HDMI cable to connect multiple laptops.",
      "content": "You most likely cannot use only an HDMI cable to connect multiple laptops. Most laptops only have an HDMI OUT port, so the HDMI port only sends information instead of receiving information. More expensive laptops, like gaming-specific laptops, have an HDMI port that works both ways, IN and OUT, so you could use that kind of laptop as a secondary screen. Check your user manual to see what kind of HDMI port your laptop has built-in. If your laptop has an HDMI OUT port, continue reading to learn how to use an adapter (with a capture card) to connect more than one laptop. If you have a laptop with an HDMI IN/OUT port, you can simply attach an HDMI cable."
