Good housekeeping is a must when it comes to being neat and tidy, and the kitchen is one of the places that should be kept clean to keep out bugs and maintain a clean food prep area. Bacteria grows on counters when they are not kept clean, which can make you sick if you prepare meals on them. [1] X Research source Put things back where they belong. If you have bags of chips by the microwave, put the bag of chips in the pantry. If you have spices laying around your counters, put them up in the shelf along with the sugars and starches. Wipe off the counters and sweep the floors to clean up any crumbs. You don't want bugs crawling around. [2] X Research source Wash the dishes. Dishes piled in the sink instantly makes the room look messy and it's also unsanitary. [3] X Research source Take out the trash and recycling. Again, you don't want stinky smells or unsightly creatures crawling around your kitchen area. Wipe down the stove and refrigerator. Organize your fridge by putting the butter, bread, and eggs on a shelf. Place the yogurts and leftovers on the top shelf, and put the milk and juice on the middle shelf. That way, you can find things easily because it's in the proper place. [4] X Research source"

Even if you're just wearing socks, you can still track dirt attached to your socks through the house. [5] X Research source Vacuuming and sweeping also give you a chance to move any obstructions in the halls and make you notice how many misplaced items are on the floor. [6] X Research source Vacuum or sweep room by room. Pick up any items on the floor and place them in a basket or container. Once you're done, walk around each room of the house with the basket and put the items back where they belong. For instance, any cups or plates in the basket should go back to the kitchen. Any shoes in the basket, should be put back in the closet."

Spray your bathroom toilets, tile and bathtub with your favorite bathroom cleaner. Then, get a scrub brush and clean away and the dirt and grime. [7] X Research source Wipe down the counters and place items back in the medicine cabinet or in the drawers. Attempt to group things by category as you put them away. For instance, group all the curling irons together and put them in one place. Put all of the toothpaste and toothbrushes in an area. [8] X Research source"

For instance, put clean clothes back in their drawers or hang them up. Make sure dirty clothes end up in a hamper. Toss out broken or badly worn items. Go through your closets and remove clothes that no longer fit. Any clothes with stains, rips or tears should be put in a bag as well. Old toys, games, broken items and unwanted items should be set aside to be given away or sold. Seek obvious clutter -- clutter on the floors and counters. For instance, if you have two knife blocks, you can probably give one away to make more counter space. Once you have set aside the items you don't want, separate them into a sell pile and give away pile. You may need separate bags or boxes for each category of item. List the gently used items on Craigslist or give them away to charity, a family member or friend"

Yet, once you open the closet door, items come tumbling out, or you're unable to find anything in the messy closet. So, if you have drawers that you can barely close, then it's time to go through them and sort them. [9] X Research source Empty out the drawers completely and toss out anything broken. Set aside items that you may need like keys, and place stray items, such as batteries, that have been rolling around in the drawer in a basket for organization later. [10] X Research source Once you have it sorted, neatly place the items back in the drawer. Note if you need an organizer to help keep everything together neatly. [11] X Research source"

Stacks of mail piled up on your counters or inside desk drawers creates a mess -- both hidden and unhidden. Go through the stacks of mail, newspapers and coupons while sorting out recent mail you need to keep from expired coupons and tattered newspapers. Toss out or recycle the old stuff. Like a pile of dishes in the sink, stacks of mail make a room look untidy and unkempt. Utility bills and paycheck stubs don't need to be kept longer than a year. ATM receipts can be tossed out after a few days. [12] X Research source Set aside the coupons and mail that you need to keep. Throw away the rest.

Baskets with lids are great for storage and hiding clutter. You can store items inside of them without having to look at everything you own. If you don't have a lot of floor space, then make use of your wall space. You can put up more shelves or bookcases, and this will help to free up some space to help keep everything organized.

Assess the items by asking yourself a few questions: Have you used it in the past year? Would you buy the item again? Am I only keeping it because I don't want to waste money? Am I keeping it for sentimental value? [16] X Research source Items that should not be kept are broken items and outdated items that have been collecting dust. If you haven't used the item in many many years, it is time to dispose of it unless it is for sentimental value. Keep the items you use frequently. Get rid of stained, torn and dusty unused items. Don't keep items simply because you think you might use it again even though you haven't used it in years. (Don't be a hoarder.) Unused sentimental items can be stored away for safe keeping. Old t-shirts, pictures, books and stuffed animals that are purely for sentimental value can be stored away in a large storage chest.

Some websites are better than others for selling your goods. [17] X Research source Craigslist is best for selling furniture, appliances and electronics to local buyers in your area.

Restack the books on the shelves. Unfold and refold items in the linen closet that make it look messy. Take all the shoes out of the closet and then line them up in the closet again. Assess what you may need to store everything properly. Consider boxes, baskets, shelves and underbed boxes. Utilize your wall space to create more living space in your home.

Baskets, which usually don't have lids, are good for storing items you don't mind displaying like magazines or extra throw blankets. For closet organizers, look for hanging shoe racks and clothes racks. Grab some extra- hangers and hooks if you need them. Underbed boxes are good for overflow -- stuff that doesn't have any other place to go. Use them to store seasonal clothes like sweaters. [23] X Research source Ottomans with interior storage areas can help you hide clutter. Also, think about bookshelves, boxes with lids and baskets to organize items like magazines that otherwise might be left laying around on the floor. [24] X Research source If you have any messy drawers or cabinets, think about purchasing some drawer organizers. These are good options to store loose items like tacks, coins and batteries. Hooks and small dishes are good decorative options to store keys and loose items. Zip ties and charging stations can help you make your area look neater by making your charging cords more organized.
