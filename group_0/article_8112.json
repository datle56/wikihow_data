You should be able to easily slide the VHS tape in. Close the cleaner and press the clean button. Allow the cleaner to fully rewind the tape, cleaning the film as it goes.

      "title": "Use a screwdriver to open the casings.",
      "content": "Use a screwdriver to open the casings. Once the tape has run one cleaning cycle, remove the tape from the machine. Use a Phillips head screwdriver to remove the screws from the casing that houses the film. After removing all the screws, separate the casings so you can reach the reels and film found inside. Sometimes, tapes will have a sticker or seal on the side to keep the casing together. If your tape is sealed, use a small knife to gently slice open the seal to open the tape. The majority of tapes can be opened with a Phillips head screwdriver. However, if a Phillips screwdriver does not work, use a flathead screwdriver instead. Store the screws in a safe place as you'll need them later to reassemble your tape."

Dampen it with isopropyl alcohol, then swab the sides of the casing and around the empty reel to remove mold, dirt, and debris. Avoid cleaning near the reel that the film is currently wrapped around. Only use your tape cleaner to remove mold from the film itself. You can purchase isopropyl alcohol at most drug stores. Get the highest concentration as you can (90% or above is preferred). Do not use cotton or any cloth that leaves lint (such as a facial tissue or paper towel). Cotton fibers or lint can damage the inside of your VCR."

Very dirty or damaged tapes may not come completely clean. You may need to consult a professional if your tape remains dirty or will not play after using a tape cleaner."

The vacuum and mold cleaner are separate. You can use your own vacuum instead of the desktop vacuum, but VHS is Life recommends their vacuum, as it's designed to work best with the cleaner and to not damage your tapes. [3] X Research source"

This is to ensure that the tape won't snap when it's being moved from one spool to the other. If you are sensitive to mold, you may want to put on a face mask or respirator mask once you start spooling the tape. The vacuum will suck up most of the mold, but a face mask will add a layer of extra protection. After running the mold cleaner for a bit, you can turn the speed up. However keep an eye on the spooling process, and slow the spindles down if it looks like your VHS tape is being strained."

If you have sentimental VHS tapes, it's best to get them digitized so you can keep them for a longer period."
