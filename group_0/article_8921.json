      "content": "Catch them off-guard with this snappy reply. If they’re just kidding, it could make them laugh. And if they’re being mean, it’ll show them you won’t be silenced so easily. For added effect, say “You first” with a completely straight face. Deadpanning is a subtle way to push back when someone is trying to intimidate you."

      "title": "Use this on friends, older siblings, and people who are supposedly more mature than you.",
      "content": "Use this on friends, older siblings, and people who are supposedly more mature than you. Not only is it a snappy comeback, but it disarms them by mocking their so-called “maturity.” Bonus points if it makes other people around you laugh. If they keep saying mean things, you can put your hand up and say, sarcastically, “Thanks for the example, you’ve done a great job.”"

      "title": "Remind them that “shut up” is a pretty immature thing to say.",
      "content": "Remind them that “shut up” is a pretty immature thing to say. Is “Shut up!” all they could think of? Do they not know any bigger words? Follow up with these questions to really get under their skin. This one could really drive someone nuts, especially if they’re your sibling or close family member. Use it with caution!"

      "title": "Surprise them with this deadpan, one-word comeback.",
      "content": "Surprise them with this deadpan, one-word comeback. It’s perfect for bullies and other people who are just plain mean. Seriously, what are they gonna do? Ask you again, politely? Avoid using this on adult family members or people in positions of authority. In those situations, it’s better to be funny than blunt."

      "title": "Call their bluff and tease them while you’re doing it.",
      "content": "Call their bluff and tease them while you’re doing it. Think about it: what were they planning to do if you said no? Chances are, they don’t have a plan because they weren’t expecting your comeback. Be careful if you think someone could act out dangerously. While you’re never responsible for someone else’s behavior, you should always look out for your own safety. Talk to a responsible person—like a trusted adult or authority figure—if somebody’s behavior makes you uncomfortable."

      "title": "Use this on your friends—or your crush.",
      "content": "Use this on your friends—or your crush. If someone is kidding around or being flirty, saying “make me” can jokingly escalate things and make them laugh. It could even lead to a witty back-and-forth, which is a great way to flirt and make friends. [1] X Research source You can also use this on bullies if you think they’ll back down, but don’t do it if you’re worried they’ll act out. In those situations, try a different comeback. As always, talk to a responsible adult or authority figure if someone’s behavior makes you uncomfortable."

      "content": "Remind them that they’re not so special. This one is great if someone is being rude or has a reputation for trash-talking. It shows them that they can’t disrespect people and get away with it. Not around you, at least. [2] X Research source Standing up to a trash-talker empowers other people to stand up for themselves too. Chances are, you’re not the only person whose feelings have been hurt by this person."

      "content": "Be blunt and show them they can’t push you around. Bullies love to be controlling, so nothing gets under a bully’s skin like having someone talk back to them. They might try to laugh it off, but they can’t fool anyone. You have every right to stand up to them. You can also say “You can’t talk to me like that” or something similar. The goal is to show them that they can’t say whatever they want."

[4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source It’s best not to say “ha ha ha” if someone is genuinely upset with you, since it can seem dismissive.

True, you might still feel angry or hurt, but you don’t have to admit it—especially to someone who is being mean. Ignoring someone works better if they’re trying to get your attention."
