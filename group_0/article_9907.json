Turn the sausages ideally 2 or 3 times while they cook, or at least be sure to turn them halfway through the cook time. Doing so will ensure a thorough cook, and add a light, golden brown color to the outside of the sausage.

Scrunch a foot of aluminum foil together to make a rope. Round the foil so that it turns into an S-shape and place the sausages on top. [9] X Research source"
