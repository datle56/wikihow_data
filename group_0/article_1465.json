      "title": "Gather your materials.",
      "content": "Gather your materials. There are a number of different adhesive products that you can use to apply glitter. You can either use glue, spray adhesive, paint, or decoupage. You can either use a foam wedge or an inexpensive paintbrush to apply the glitter. You can purchase these materials at a craft store or a large retailer. You can sprinkle the glitter on the wood using your hands or a shaker that has large holes."

      "title": "Make a glitter station.",
      "content": "Make a glitter station. Glitter has a reputation for making a mess so you’ll want to make a glitter station that is easy to clean. Ideally, you could work outside so you don’t have to worry about cleaning glitter from carpet or your furniture. For your glitter station, you’ll need to select the products that you want to use for your project. Use a cardboard box if you are working with larger pieces of wood. You can use a paper plate for smaller projects. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Prepare the wood.",
      "content": "Prepare the wood. The wooden item that you want to add glitter to can be in a variety of shapes in sizes. Sanded and smooth wood will allow the glitter to adhere evenly, though you can use non-sanded wood to create a more rugged design. You can sand the wood using a piece of fine-grained sand paper if you desire."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create your design area.",
      "content": "Create your design area. You can section off areas of the wooden object to create glitter designs. If you intend to add glitter to the entirety of the wooden object, there is no need to do this. You will use clear tape to section off areas of the object that you do not want to glitter. You can use adhesive stencils to create designs with the glitter. You could use stickers to leave certain shapes un-glittered, like a heart or a star."
    },
    {
      "title": "Purchase spray adhesive.",
      "content": "Purchase spray adhesive. For this method, you will need to purchase a spray adhesive. Make sure to find a spray adhesive that dries clear. You will want to work with spray adhesive outdoors, since it can contain chemicals that are harmful to breathe. You can find spray adhesive at any craft store or major retailer. If you are unable to work outside, work in a well-ventilated area."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spray the surface of the wooden object.",
      "content": "Spray the surface of the wooden object. Be sure to follow any special directions from the manufacturer, if applicable. Hold the spray adhesive can a few inches away from the wood and press down on the top of the can to spray the wood."

    {
      "title": "Apply glitter to the wet adhesive.",
      "content": "Apply glitter to the wet adhesive. While the adhesive spray is still wet on the wood, sprinkle your glitter over the area. The amount of glitter that you use will determine how sparkly the wood is. You can either sprinkle the glitter onto the area with your hands, or use a foam wedge or paintbrush to apply the glitter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait for the adhesive to dry.",
      "content": "Wait for the adhesive to dry. The drying time will depend upon the specific adhesive spray that you use, but it should only take a few minutes for the area to completely dry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Seal the glitter in.",
      "content": "Seal the glitter in. If you’d like, you can apply a sealant, like decoupage, to the area. The sealant will add smoothness and will help to prevent the glitter from falling off. Choose a sealant that has a glossy finish, not matte, so your glitter doesn’t lose any of its sparkle. Once the adhesive spray is dry, you can shake off any excess glitter into your cardboard box."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use white glue to attach glitter.",
      "content": "Use white glue to attach glitter. You can also use basic white glue to apply glitter. You can use either a glue stick or a glue bottle. White glue is typically washable, meaning that it is water-soluble. Do not use white glue if you think that the wooden object will get wet, like if you intend to leave it outdoors."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply a thin layer of glue.",
      "content": "Apply a thin layer of glue. You can either use the squeeze bottle to directly apply the glue to the wood, or you can paint it on using a foam wedge or paintbrush. With a glue stick, you can apply the glue directly to the wood. Thicker layers of glue will appear raised when they dry. This might look best for your project, or you might prefer a flatter glittered area."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dust glitter onto the glue.",
      "content": "Dust glitter onto the glue. You can dust the wet glue with glitter, covering as much or as little of the wood as you'd like."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let dry.",
      "content": "Let dry. The glue will dry clear so only the glitter will remain. The actual time it takes for the glue to dry will depend upon how thick of a glue layer you’ve applied. Apply a sealant, if desired. Like with the spray adhesive method, you can use a spray sealant to smooth your dried glitter. This will help to prevent glitter from falling off, and eliminates some of the rough texture."

      "title": "Use decoupage gloss sealer.",
      "content": "Use decoupage gloss sealer. Decoupage gloss sealer is a crafting product that is used to seal small pieces, like glitter or a piece of fabric, under a clear and durable gloss. You can find decoupage gloss sealer, which you may find packaged as ‘gloss sealer’, at craft stores. [2] X Research source Choose a decoupage gloss sealer that is acrylic if you need a more heavy-duty seal. Be sure to purchase a glossy finish sealer; matte sealers will dull your glitter’s shine on the finished product."

      "content": "Paint a layer of decoupage gloss sealer. While working in your glitter station, use an inexpensive paintbrush to paint a layer of decoupage gloss sealer to the wood. Be sure to only paint the areas that you want glitter to adhere to. Make sure that the paintbrush doesn’t leave streaks while you are painting. You want the layer of gloss sealer to be evenly applied on the wood. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Sprinkle glitter over the wet gloss.",
      "content": "Sprinkle glitter over the wet gloss. While the gloss is still wet, sprinkle glitter onto the wood. You can use as much, or as little, glitter as you’d like.

      "content": "Use Mod Podge. Mod Podge is one of the most recognizable crafting supplies on the market. It is similar to glue, but it also seals and adds a finish. There are a number of different finishes that you can choose. For a glitter project, you should use either the Classic Gloss or the Hard Coat finish. [4] X Research source Hard Coat finish is best for objects that are going to be handled frequently and is the most durable. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Let dry. Mod Podge has to ‘cure’ to dry. This means that while it might feel dry to the touch after an hour, it still needs several more hours before you should handle the wood. Hard Coat Mod Podge takes 72 hours to cure, so leave your newly glittered item in a safe place while it is curing."

    {
      "title": "Use a craft paint.",
      "content": "Use a craft paint. Acrylic paint is a good choice but many paints will work, just as long as they have a thicker consistency. Thin paints like watercolors should not be used, since they are not thick enough to adhere glitter."

      "title": "Paint the wood.",
      "content": "Paint the wood. Using a paintbrush, add a layer of paint to the area of wood you want to glitter. If the wooden item is large, it's a good idea to paint it in sections and then apply glitter to each section. This helps to avoid the possibility that the paint dries before you have a chance to add glitter. Sprinkle the glitter onto the wet paint."

      "title": "Let the paint dry.",
      "content": "Let the paint dry. The glitter will set in place with the paint. You can either leave the project as is or add another coat of paint and glitter. This method can either add a subtle sparkle, or you can apply a thick layer of glitter for a more striking effect."

      "content": "Use spray-on glitter. You can also use a can of spray-on glitter to add shine and sparkle to your wooden projects.

You can add as many layers as you'd like, but let the adhesive dry in between applications. The more layers you apply, the thicker the application will be and your project will be more glittery."
