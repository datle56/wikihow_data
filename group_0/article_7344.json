      "content": "Know the importance of fit. Just like clothes, lingerie needs to fit your body perfectly to look the best. If you have ill-fitting lingerie, it may be poking or pinching you, or it might be causing unsightly lumps and wrinkles. If you've been wearing the wrong size bra (like lots of women do), you'll be amazed what a difference properly fitting lingerie will make. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Determine your band size.",
      "content": "Determine your band size. To find out what band size you should be wearing, wrap a soft tape measure around your body, placing the measure directly beneath your breasts. Round up to the nearest whole number. [2] X Research source If you get an even number, this is your band size. For example, if you measured 32 inches (81.3 cm) across, you have a band size of 32. If you get an odd number, add one to your measurement to find your band size. For example, if you measured 31 inches (78.7 cm) across, you have a band size of 32."

      "title": "Calculate your cup size.",
      "content": "Calculate your cup size. Once you have both of your measurements, use some simple math to calculate your cup size. Simply subtract your band size from the measurement around the fullest part of your breasts. For example, if your band size is 36 and your breasts measured 38 inches (96.5 cm) around, your number would be 2. A difference of 0 is an AA cup. A difference of 1 is an A cup. A difference of 2 is a B cup. A difference of 3 is a C cup. A difference of 4 is a D cup."

      "content": "Pick a flattering neckline. When shopping for bras and camis, choose pieces with necklines that will show off some skin and flatter your smaller bust, like scoop necks and v-necks. If you really want a really sexy look, opt for a super deep v-neck. A low-cut cami looks great if you want to emphasize your chest while covering up your stomach. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Add extra cleavage. If you want to enhance the size of your bust a bit, choose a push-up bra or a cami with a built-in push-up. Try it on and look at yourself in the mirror to make sure that it gives you the look you want. Some women feel that push-up bra lingerie makes them appear too unnatural, while others love it. [4] X Research source You can buy bras with padding to give yourself a little extra volume, but only if you want! Make sure to keep it natural by not going overboard with padding."

      "content": "Opt for less coverage. The more of your chest and neck you show, the bigger your bust will look. Avoid full-coverage bra cups and choose styles that show a little more skin.
