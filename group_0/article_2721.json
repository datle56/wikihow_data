You should floss at least once a day, but flossing morning and night is ideal. Floss gently so that you don't cause your gums to bleed. If your gums do bleed excessively, consult a dentist. Bleeding gums could be a sign of gingivitis."

You can also carry a travel-size mouthwash with you for a quick way to maintain fresh breath on the go."
