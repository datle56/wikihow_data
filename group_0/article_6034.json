      "content": "Use a crate that's large enough for your dog to stretch out. Your dog will be living in this crate 24/7 for the next month, so you want to make sure it's comfortable. Your dog should be able to stretch out, change positions, and lick or chew at toys. [2] X Expert Source Ray Spragley, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 31 March 2021. [3] X Research source If your dog is too large to fit in a crate and have enough space to turn around and stretch out, you might consider confining it to a small room (or even a closet) rather than a crate. The ideal crate is meant for use during long-term recovery from an injury. If you already have a crate for your dog for travel or for short periods of time, it's likely not large enough to keep your dog comfortable while recovering from a broken or fractured pelvis.

      "content": "Pad the bottom of the crate with blankets and towels. Your dog won't be very mobile for at least the first few weeks of crate rest due to its injuries. Make sure the bottom of the crate is soft and comfortable. Pillows and cushions can also help. If you put a dog bed in the bottom of the crate, use one without raised sides so you can easily move it and check its condition when you need to."

      "content": "Provide toys and bones to engage your dog. While on crate rest, your dog may get bored and restless without toys and bones to distract it and help it occupy the time. Many dogs particularly enjoy toys that allow you to hide treats inside for your dog to extract. [5] X Research source Dogs often chew for stress relief, so include sturdy toys and chewy bones that your dog can gnaw on."

      "content": "Rest your pet for at least 6 weeks total. In most cases, it takes at least 6 weeks for a broken or fractured pelvis to heal – assuming your dog did not have surgery. While the level of permitted activity gradually increases during this time, your dog should remain confined for the entire period. Your veterinarian will let you know how long your dog should be on crate rest. As difficult as it may be to keep your dog in the crate, particularly if it whines or seems upset, try not to deviate from the veterinarian's instructions."

Smaller dogs may begin to stand within 1 week or less, while larger dogs may take a little more time. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If your dog doesn't stand voluntarily after 2 weeks, use a sling to support the dog's weight and encourage it to stand.

If you have a smaller dog, carry it outside to relieve itself, then carry it back to the crate. If your dog is too large for you to carry, leave an indoor training pad in the crate or room where your dog is confined. Once your dog can walk and stand, try using an abdomen sling to help support your dog's weight as it walks outside. [7] X Expert Source Ray Spragley, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 31 March 2021.

Talk to your veterinarian about going for walks and follow their instructions regarding the length of the walk and the locations you take your dog. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source When you take your dog outside, you may need to support its weight with a sling. This is more important with larger dogs, who may take longer to heal. A harness is better than a collar while your dog is recovering from its injuries. Walk very slowly, keeping your dog close to you. Don't take your dog to dog parks or other areas where it might encounter other dogs. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Return your dog to physical activity slowly.",
      "content": "Return your dog to physical activity slowly. As your dog recovers, it will likely be stiff and have more limited mobility. Even after crate rest is over, vigorous activity could cause re-injury. Wait at least a month before you allow your dog to run or play with other dogs. If you have access to a dog park, you may re-introduce your dog gradually by taking it to the dog park when there are few, if any, other dogs there. However, keep your dog on a leash at all times until your veterinarian says it's okay to let it off the leash."

If your dog is highly nervous or restless, your veterinarian may also prescribe sedatives. Depending on your dog's condition and any other injuries, your dog may have additional medications. Medicate your dog according to the prescription instructions. Keep track of when you've given your dog medications so you don't accidentally overdose your pet. If the medications don't seem to be working or your dog still seems to be in pain, contact your veterinarian. Ask your vet how to measure your dog’s pain using a pain scale. This will allow you to assess how uncomfortable your dog is so you can consult your vet about additional pain relief if necessary."

[10] X Expert Source Ray Spragley, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 31 March 2021. Particularly in the first 2 weeks of crate rest, check your dog for bed sores, which can develop when a dog lies in the same position for a long period of time. During your dog’s recovery, use puppy pads or VetBed as your dog’s main bedding materials. These wick away urine and will help keep your dog dry if it wets the bed. Change any soiled or wet bedding as soon as possible. Laying on damp bedding can damage your pet's skin and cause a rash to develop. If your dog does develop sores that seem painful or inflamed, have your veterinarian take a look. They can determine whether the sores are infected and prescribe antibiotics to relieve the infection."

An appointment for follow-up x-rays 4 to 6 weeks after the injury is common. In between appointments, keep in contact with your veterinarian's office to provide updates on your dog's condition. Your veterinarian may alter your dog's care plan based on its condition and how well the pelvis fracture is healing."

These passive range-of-motion exercises help your dog retain mobility while confined, and keep it from losing too much muscle mass. Your veterinarian may give you a demonstration of exercises for your dog. It's a good idea to do the exercises yourself while the vet looks on, so they can correct anything you're not doing properly. Generally, your movements should be slow and gentle. Don't attempt to flex and extend your dog's joints if it appears to cause your dog pain."

Leave the heating pad on your dog for a maximum of 15 minutes at a time, or until your dog's skin feels warm to the touch. [14] X Research source The heating pad itself should be warm, not hot. If your dog shows any signs of pain or discomfort, remove the heating pad immediately and talk to your veterinarian. Placing a heating pad on your dog's haunches or rear legs can increase blood flow and reduce inflammation in your dog's muscles."
