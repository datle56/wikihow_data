      "content": "Perform a web search for your question. Before you start asking others about your question, try a Google search to see what kind of results you get. You can even formulate your search in the form of a question, or you can just search for the keywords. Searching on your own before asking is very important. If the solution to your question is easily searchable, you will receive scorn from the people that you ask the question to. If you want to search a particular site for information, add \"site:example.com\" to the end of your search phrase. Google will only return results from the site you specify."

      "content": "Assume that the question has been asked before. The internet is a huge place, and chances are you're not the first person to have the problem that you're experiencing.

      "title": "Examine your question.",
      "content": "Examine your question. Determine what the general field of knowledge you will require to get it answered.

      "title": "Break down the general field into a specific niche.",
      "content": "Break down the general field into a specific niche. Once you know the general field, look at your question and figure out what niche you fit into. In every general category, there are a variety of sub-fields. For example, if your tech question is about using Windows, you'll want to focus on Windows experts. If your question is about a specific program in Windows, such as Photoshop, you'll want to find Photoshop experts as opposed to Windows experts."

Popular sites include: Stack Exchange Ask.com Quora Answers.com"

      "content": "Make your title a succinct version of your question. When making a forum post for your question, try to make the title of the post as specific and clear as possible. You can use the post body to add details, but readers should be able to understand your question just from looking at the title. [2] X Research source For example, \"Windows won't start\" is not a good title. Instead, get a little more specific with your problem: \"Windows 7 will not start, computer turns on fine but I receive the following error message: <insert error snippet>\"."

Note any resources you have already looked at. The more specific you are, the more useful the replies to your question will be. If you are asking technical questions, be sure to give proper information about what you are using. For example, for computer-related questions, list your operating system, system specs , and any error messages you are getting. For car questions, make sure to note the make and model, as well as what part of the car you are working on."

      "content": "Write politely and clearly. You will get far more responses if your post is written with good grammar and clear writing. Avoid overusing exclamation points, and try not to swear (even if you're really frustrated!). If the language of the board is not your first language, let the readers know and apologize for any spelling and grammar errors. Avoid internet shorthand and slang. For example, don't replace \"you\" with \"u\", and don't type IN ALL CAPS, as this is perceived as shouting."

      "content": "Don't give up. If you don't receive any responses, or the responses are not satisfactory, take some time to examine your question. Was it specific enough? Did you ask too many questions? Was the answer easily obtained through a web search? Is the question even answerable? Rework your question and ask it again, either in the same place or a new one. Never believe that you are entitled to an answer. Responders volunteer their time to help out other users. No one owes you an answer, so you should avoid acting like they do. [3] X Research source"
