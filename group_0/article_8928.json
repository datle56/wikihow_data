At the end of the day, remember that you aren't there to make things magically better, you're there to support her. Telling her \"it's no big deal\" or that \"you went through the same thing\" will make her feel like you don't take her seriously. Things not to say include: \"You were too good for that job anyway. They're not even worth your time.\" Clearly, since she's upset, she thinks it was worth her time. \"I know exactly how you feel.\" Everyone's problems are unique -- you don't know exactly how she feels, and she'll sense it. \"You're so strong -- you'll be fine.\" Sometimes people need some time not to be strong. Don't make her feel like she can't be vulnerable unless she looks \"weak.\" \"I know this is terrible. Did I tell you about the time I......\" This isn't about your past problems, so don't try and change the subject."
