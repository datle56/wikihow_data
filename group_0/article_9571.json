In Arabic, say A'oodhu billahi minash shaytaannir rajeem . Have a drink of water, and relax; don't get tense or stressed out. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, \"If a man gets angry and says, ‘I seek refuge with Allaah,’ [and] his anger will go away.\" [2] X Research source Sulayman ibn Sard said: \"I was sitting with the Prophet (peace be upon him), and two men were slandering one another. One of them was red in the face, and the veins on his neck were standing out. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, ‘I know a word which, if he were to say it, what he feels would go away. If he said \"I seek refuge with Allaah from the Shaytaan,\" what he feels (i.e., his anger) would go away.\" [3] X Research source"

Try to think of positive thoughts , instead of dwelling on thoughts that make you angry. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth, and try to get peace of mind. If you're standing, you may, again, out of anger, do something you regret, such as hitting someone. The Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) said: \"If any of you becomes angry and he is standing, let him sit down, so his anger will go away; if it does not go away, let him lie down.\" [5] X Research source If the anger still does not go away, make wudu ."
