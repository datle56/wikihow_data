      "content": "Beekeeping age comes from an episode of Rick and Morty . In the episode, a teenage girl watches another character’s father (Jerry) take care of his beekeeping boxes in the backyard. As the girl talks about how cute it is, she realizes and rationalizes her attraction to Jerry. At one point, she asks her friend how old Jerry is, saying that he’s “obviously beekeeping age.” [2] X Research source At the end of the girl’s monologue, she says to the daughter, “Summer, I want to f*ck your dad” and the daughter replies, “Oh, really?” [3] X Research source After the episode aired on May 11, 2020, the phrase was mostly only shared as an inside joke between Rick and Morty fans. The term became popular in 2023 because of a trend on TikTok where creators lip-synched to the scene or talked about attractive older men as being “beekeeping age.” Jerry, the father in Rick and Morty , is actually only 35 years old, but the phrase is often used to describe people in their 40s and 50s."

      "content": "Beekeeping age doesn’t imply that there’s a wealth or power imbalance. In age-gap relationships, people often worry that the younger partner is being exploited or that one partner is only dating the other to gain money or social status. [5] X Research source However, beekeeping age can be applied to anyone, and just implies that they have enough time and money to keep bees in their off-time. According to professional matchmaker Julia McCurley, age-gap relationships might be considered less socially acceptable if the gap is over 10 years. Those in a relationship with a gap over 10 years tend to be given derogatory labels like “sugar daddy,” “trophy wife/husband,” “gold digger,” or “boy toy.” [6] X Research source However, “beekeeping age” doesn’t come with the same stigma. Beekeeping age describes people in all tax brackets and social circles—famous or not."

      "content": "Beekeeping age is a gender-neutral alternative to DILF. Unlike “DILF” or other similar slang terms, “beekeeping age” doesn’t imply a certain gender. Although you typically see people commenting that men are beekeeping age, there’s nothing stopping women from being described as beekeeping age, too. Some people worry that “beekeeping age,” which often describes men, discourages women from becoming beekeepers. Although beekeeping is considered a male-dominated industry, about ⅓ of people in the beekeeping industry identify as women. [7] X Research source"

[8] X Research source A DILF can be called beekeeping age, but a person who is beekeeping age doesn’t always fit into the DILF category. “Don’t look now, but there’s a hot DILF who’s totally checking you out over there.” “This singer is a total DILF—he’s beekeeping age, for sure. What do you think?” A female version of a DILF is a MILF (“Mom I’d Like to F*ck”)."
