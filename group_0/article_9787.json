      "content": "Research boarding schools. Have you already talked to your parents about boarding school? What were their major concerns about letting you attend boarding school? Did they have any questions? Before you talk to your parents again (or for the first time), take time to research several boarding schools. As you research, write down facts and statistics that will answer their questions and find solutions to their concerns. Write down facts about class sizes, teaching methods, number of student borders, extracurricular opportunities, sports teams, tuition, and location."

      "content": "Prepare for the entrance tests. In order to apply to boarding school, you must take the Secondary School Admission Test (SSAT) or the Independent School Entrance Exam (ISEE). To perform well on these challenging tests, you must study and prepare for the evaluations. Studying for these exams before your parents agree to let you take them will show them that you are serious about commitment to attending boarding. The SSAT tests students in grades 3 through 12. It costs approximately $120.00. [1] X Research source The ISEE tests students in grades 2 through 12. It costs between $105.00 to $185.00. There are fee waivers available. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Think about the cost of boarding school.",
      "content": "Think about the cost of boarding school. Boarding schools are expensive. The cost of private education causes many parents say \"no\" to boarding school. In addition to paying tuition, students and their families must cover the cost of room and board and travel expenses. Before you talk to your parents, spend time brainstorming how you could help fund your private education. Coming up with a creative solution may help convince them to let you attend boarding school. Do the schools you are interested in offer scholarships and financial aid packages? Do you qualify for need or merit based aid? Are there independent scholarships you can apply for and receive? Are you able to work while you attend school? Will the cost of your current extracurricular activities (private music lessons, sports clubs, dance classes) offset the cost of boarding school?

      "content": "Emphasize the school’s impressive sports programs. Many boarding schools have outstanding athletic programs. Since their teams can afford to compete around the nation and world, their student athletes are more likely to play in front of recruiters from high ranking college programs. They also offer a variety of sports that are not available at every public school, such as squash and equestrian. As you talk with your parents, mention that: You want to train and compete at a high level. Playing for this school will help you get recruited by a Division I college or university.
