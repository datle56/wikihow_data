      "content": "Leave the tuna steak in the packaging to thaw. Fish is normally sold in plastic bags or another type of plastic wrapping.

      "title": "Place the tuna steak in the fridge.",
      "content": "Place the tuna steak in the fridge. It's very important that you don't leave the tuna steaks out at room temperature in the kitchen or elsewhere in the house. Fish spoils easily and the fridge will thaw the tuna steak while also keeping it cool at the same time. Room temperature defrosting will thaw the outside layers of the tuna steak while the inside layers go bad. Use a thermometer to make sure your fridge is 5 °C (41 °F) or cooler. This is the right temperature for defrosting fish."

      "title": "Leave the tuna steak in the fridge overnight.",
      "content": "Leave the tuna steak in the fridge overnight. While it might only take the tuna steak a few hours to thaw in the fridge, you want to be sure that it's completely defrosted before using it. By leaving it overnight, you give the tuna steak enough time to properly defrost. [1] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Don't leave the tuna steak in the fridge for longer than 24 hours. The longer the fish is in the fridge, the higher the chances of it going bad."

      "content": "Remove the tuna steak from the fridge the next day. Now that you gave your tuna steak the entire night in the fridge to defrost, you can remove it from the fridge. Take the tuna steak from the plastic bag and inspect it to make sure there's no signs of frost or ice."

      "content": "Weight the tuna steak on a weighing scales. Most microwave manuals have instructions on how to defrost different types of frozen food. Generally, the first step is to weigh your tuna steak. Place the tuna steak on your kitchen weighing scales or on a paper towel on top of your household weighing scales.

      "content": "Put the microwave on the defrost setting and enter the tuna steak weight. If your microwave doesn't ask for the tuna steak's weight, you can just defrost the fish in 5-minute intervals. If it does ask, it'll tell you how long the fish will need to defrost."

      "title": "Check the tuna steak every 5 minutes to see if you can bend it.",
      "content": "Check the tuna steak every 5 minutes to see if you can bend it. After 5 minutes, take the fish out of the microwave and use some light pressure to see if you're able to bend the tuna steak. If it's still too rigid or tough, place it back in the microwave for another 5 minutes. Flip the fish over after the first 5 minutes have passed. You want the fish to be evenly thawed, which will also make cooking easier. Don't be worried if you can bend the fish but it still looks icy or cold. Once you can easily bend it, the fish is defrosted."
