      "content": "Offer to help your parents with their chores and duties. If you see your mom cleaning the house, ask if you can help her with anything.

      "content": "Keep a positive and considerate attitude. Your parents won’t want to give you extra privileges if you’re grumpy and mean to them. Be nice to your parents. Complete any tasks they give you happily and to the best of your ability. By being pleasant to be around, you can make it easier for your parents to agree with what you want. [3] X Research source Spend more quality time with your parents. Watch a movie with them, join them in one of their hobbies, or simply ask them how their day has been going. Spending extra time with your parents shows you care about them and will make them more receptive towards you. Be more polite. Greet your parents “good morning” at the start of every day, and wish them “goodnight” before you go to bed. Say “please” and “thank you” when you ask them for things. Being courteous will make them feel better about giving you extra privileges. [4] X Research source Do your best to get along with your siblings. All siblings fight from time to time, but not every disagreement has to be an argument. Handle your disagreements maturely; this will show your parents how responsible you are. [5] X Research source"

If you struggle to wake up and get ready every morning, your parents will notice and not allow you to go to bed later. [6] X Research source Set an alarm to make sure you wake up on time each morning. Be sure to set it early enough so you have plenty of time to get ready each morning. If you struggle to wake up in the morning, consider placing your alarm out of reach so you’re forced to get out of bed to shut it off. You could place it on your desk or on the windowsill, provided that these areas aren’t too close to your bed."

      "content": "Decide how much longer you’d like to stay up. Picking a specific length of time to extend your bedtime shows how much thought you’ve put into it, which could sway your parents into saying “yes.” It’s best to ask for a shorter amount of time to start off with, such as a half hour. Your parents are more likely to agree to 30 minutes of extra time than 2 hours. You can always ask for another extension later. [7] X Research source"

Here is how you could approach the conversation: ”Hey, Mom? Dad? Could I talk to you, please? I’ve been thinking about this for a while, so I wanted to ask: is it okay if I stay up a half hour later tonight? I’ve been getting way more homework than usual, and those extra 30 minutes would really help me get everything done.” If you can, try and offer time for your parents to step back and think about what you’re asking. You could say, “It’s okay if you need time to think on it. I don’t mind waiting for you to decide.” [11] X Research source Once the conversation is over, say something like, “Okay. Thanks for listening to me. Goodnight!”"

You can always wait and ask again later on. Try asking your parents to let you stay up again at least a few months later. There’s always the chance you asking the first time has given your parents the idea to think about your privileges. [13] X Research source"
