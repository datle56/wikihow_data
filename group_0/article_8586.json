      "title": "Remove the air stone from your aquarium.",
      "content": "Remove the air stone from your aquarium. Turn off and unplug all air stone and filtration devices in your tank. If your air stone is underneath gravel in your aquarium, carefully move the gravel to the side off of your air stone with a long fish net, or your hands if you prefer. [2] X Research source Lift the air stone out of the tank and disconnect it from any tubes it is connected to."

      "title": "Take off the rubber end pieces.",
      "content": "Take off the rubber end pieces. The black rubber pieces at the end of your air stone will need to come off so that your cleaning solution gets inside the air stone. Carefully remove these pieces with your fingers and set them aside. [3] X Research source The end pieces may seem stuck at first. Gently twist them back and forth to loosen them as you pull them off the tube."

      "title": "Make a mild bleach solution of 9 parts water and 1 part bleach.",
      "content": "Make a mild bleach solution of 9 parts water and 1 part bleach. Measure 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) of bleach in a glass measuring jar and dump it into the jar you’re using for cleaning. Next measure 9 fluid ounces (270 mL) of water in your measuring jar and dump that into your cleaning jar with the bleach. [4] X Research source Continue doing this until you have enough solution to cover all the pieces of air stone you intend to clean."

    {
      "title": "Soak your air stone pieces in the bleach for 2-3 hours.",
      "content": "Soak your air stone pieces in the bleach for 2-3 hours. Gently drop all your pieces – the air stones themselves, the rubber end pieces, and any dirty connecting tubes into your bleach solution. Wait 2-3 hours, then gently swirl the air stones in the solution to remove any loosened gunk before you take them out of the solution. [5] X Research source Wear rubber cleaning gloves when dipping your fingers into the bleach solution to remove your air stone pieces."

    {
      "title": "Rinse and allow your pieces to air dry for 2-3 hours.",
      "content": "Rinse and allow your pieces to air dry for 2-3 hours. Use warm running water to rinse your pieces, then set them on a towel or paper towels near a sunny window until they're completely dry. [6] X Research source Avoid drying your air stone with a towel, which can break your brittle pieces. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Place small silicone beads on the edge of the air stone tube.",
      "content": "Place small silicone beads on the edge of the air stone tube. Your rubber end pieces will need to be securely replaced on the ends of your air stone so the air is forced to go through the stone, instead of the ends of the tube, when it is reinstalled. Gently squeeze the silicone to get 2-3 tiny beads onto the edge of your air stone tube where a rubber piece was attached. [8] X Research source Obtain some silicone from your local hardware store."

    {
      "title": "Place the rubber end piece back on the tube and wipe it clean.",
      "content": "Place the rubber end piece back on the tube and wipe it clean. When you do this, some silicone will squeeze out of the sides; use a damp, clean cloth to wipe this extra silicone off the sides of the tube. [9] X Research source Allow the silicone to dry for the amount of time listed on the silicone package instructions. Repeat these previous steps for the other side and any other tubes."

    {
      "title": "Reinstall the air stone back into your tank.",
      "content": "Reinstall the air stone back into your tank. Reconnect your air stone to all its tubing in the same way that you did when you originally installed it. Place your air stone back into the tank and cover it with gravel using your hands or a long fish net. [10] X Research source When everything is back in place, plug in and turn on your air filtration and air stone devices."

      "title": "Check your air stone for dirt in 2-3 months.",
      "content": "Check your air stone for dirt in 2-3 months. A clean air stone releases tiny bubbles from its entire length. A dirty air stone will start to release larger bubbles just from the ends of the stone. In 2-3 months you may start to notice a difference in the quality of bubbles coming from your air stone. [11] X Research source For best results, clean your entire aquarium at the same time that you clean your air stones."
