      "content": "Contact local utility companies before you dig holes. If you’re building your pergola in your yard, you’ll have to dig deep holes which can damage pipes or power lines under the ground. Look at your utility bills to find the phone numbers for your utility companies. Call them and ask about any pipes or lines that may be running underground. [4] X Research source If you live in the United States, you can dial 811 to contact your local utilities. In Australia you’d dial 1100 to contact local utility companies."

Measure and mark a different sized square if you want a larger or smaller pergola. This is an average size for a pergola. [5] X Research source If you measure a space that's larger or smaller than 8 by 8 feet (2.4 m × 2.4 m), you'll have to adjust the size of your wooden posts accordingly. If you are installing the pergola on a patio, use chalk instead of spray paint to mark your measurements."

These holes will hold your posts in place and ensure that your pergola stays together. Make each corner hole 8 by 8 inches (20 cm × 20 cm) so that they are large enough to fit your pergola’s posts. [6] X Research source Make each hole the same depth. If you are placing your pergola over a patio, you have to screw metal post anchors into the patio instead of digging holes. [7] X Research source"

Work on each post one at a time until it's secured to the ground. Put one end of the post into a hole and make sure that it rests flat on the gravel. Hold the post in place as you move onto the next steps. Posts shouldn't go straight into the ground, because you want to minimize wood rot. Pour them in with rapid set quickcrete, or if you're on a flagstone or paved patio, use brackets that create a gap between the surface and the post. Then the brackets are poured into the concrete, and the posts are bolted into the brackets. [9] X Expert Source Benjamin Hansen Licensed Landscape Contractor Expert Interview. 6 October 2020."

Then, drive a nail through the brace and into the post to hold it in place. Place the other posts into the holes and brace them all.
