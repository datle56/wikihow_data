      "content": "Invest in a quality Rubik’s cube. A quality cube's parts will move with ease, and they come in a variety of sizes, such as 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5. Most people start off with a 3x3 cube. Go with options like Moyu, YJ, Dayan, Shengshou, GAN, or Fangshi (Funs puzzle).For speed-cubing stay away from the actual Rubik's brand. These cubes were not build for speed-cubing and are far worse than any speed cube. You can purchase them online or in stores. A good cube used to set past records only cost $9, though typically quality Rubik’s cubes cost around $15 and up (€4-20). A quality speed cube is helpful because turning takes very little force. Even if the layers aren’t perfectly aligned, the cube will still turn. You don't need to be completely accurate with every turn. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Disassemble your cube in order to lubricate it. Disassemble your cube by rotating the top face 45 degrees and popping out an upper edge piece. You can do this with your fingers, or use a screwdriver if you are having trouble. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply a silicone-based spray or gel to the inside parts to lubricate your cube.",
      "content": "Apply a silicone-based spray or gel to the inside parts to lubricate your cube. Ensure you apply a light, even coat across all surfaces of your cube. Let your parts dry for about 10 minutes. You can also use petroleum jelly. Lubricating your cube can give you a move rate of 3 or 4 moves per second. Some heavy lubricants like cubicle weight 5, Traxxas, and Lubix will make your cube slow at first, though as you break in your cube, it will move faster and smoother. It may take a little while to get used to a Rubik’s cube moving this quickly. Practice solving your cube, and you’ll quickly notice how much faster you can solve the cube. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Reassemble your cube and test out how fast the parts move.",
      "content": "Reassemble your cube and test out how fast the parts move. Start with the edge pieces, popping in the pieces on one side. You can fit four pieces on the core of your cube, and then place the completed face in the down position. Slide in the four corners, then slide in the edges of the middle layer from the top. Repeat this until you have all pieces assembled, and your cube will now move really fast. To help insert the last layer, start with an edge piece slightly turned to the side. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Solve a cube from many different sides rather than just one color. When learning how to solve a Rubik’s cube, it is helpful to start on the white side. Though, this isn’t always the easiest to solve. Be flexible and try different sides. The more you can maneuver your cube, the faster you can solve it. [5] X Research source"

To understand how to move the Rubik’s cube, speed solvers mark every face of the cube with a letter: F- Front, U- Up, R- Right, B- Back, L- Left, and D- Down. Algorithms are codes made up of different movement combinations, and many different algorithms can be used to speed up the time it takes to solve. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Plan ahead to reduce delays between your moves.",
      "content": "Plan ahead to reduce delays between your moves. Scramble the cube, and then take a second to notice the details before you start trying to solve. Think about your first few moves before you solve it. A little planning can help increase your speed by cutting down on the seconds spend deciding where to move next. For example, if you're using the Fridrich Method, practice your F2L. While you're solving one pair, look ahead to find your next pair. This eliminates any pauses in between your moves.
