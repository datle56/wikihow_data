      "content": "Do the penny test every month to make sure your tires are safe. Your tread wears down as you drive, so checking it every month is key to staying safe on the road. This test involves sliding a penny in between the tread on your tires to measure how worn down your tires are. By holding Abraham Lincoln’s portrait towards the hubcap and checking how high the rubber reaches on the coin, you can tell if your tires need to be replaced. Monitor the tread using the penny test to make sure your tread doesn’t get dangerously low. The ideal tread for most tires is around 10 ⁄ 32 inch (0.79 cm), which is roughly the distance from the top edge of a penny to Abraham Lincoln’s eyes when he’s right-side up. The distance between the top of Lincoln’s hair and the top edge of the coin is 2 ⁄ 32 in (0.16 cm), which is when you need to replace your tires. In the United States, tire tread is typically measured in 32nds of an inch."

      "content": "Rotate the penny so Abe’s head is pointing at the tire. You can start on any tire you’d like. Turn the penny in your hand so that Abraham Lincoln’s portrait is facing you and his hair is pointing down at the center of the tire. [3] X Research source If you’re using a quarter, do the same thing with George Washington’s face."

      "title": "Slide the penny in between the tread to measure it.",
      "content": "Slide the penny in between the tread to measure it. The tread is the widest groove in the middle of your tire. It wraps around your tire, parallel to the sides of the rubber, and your vehicle likely has multiple treads. Choose any tread to start with and slide the penny in between it so the edge of the coin rests directly against the space between the tread. [4] X Research source Keep Abe Lincoln’s hair pointing towards the center of the tire. It doesn’t matter if you do this on the side or top of the tire. Just choose an area where you’ll be able to see the penny."

      "title": "See how high the rubber gets on Abraham Lincoln’s portrait.",
      "content": "See how high the rubber gets on Abraham Lincoln’s portrait. Note the location where the rubber that sticks up past the side of the penny sits in relation to Abe’s portrait. This will give you a general estimate of how worn down your tread is."

      "title": "Check the tread on other portions of the same tire.",
      "content": "Check the tread on other portions of the same tire. Once you’ve noted where the rubber meets the coin, pull the coin out of the tread. Then, repeat this process on 2-3 other lengths of tread on the same tire. Finish the tire by repeating this process 2-3 times on the other sides of the same tire to find any inconsistencies. Each time you check another portion of the tire, rotate the coin so that Abraham Lincoln’s hair is always pointing towards the center of the rim."

      "title": "Repeat the penny test on your other tires to make sure they’re safe.",
      "content": "Repeat the penny test on your other tires to make sure they’re safe. Once you’ve finished checking your first tire, work your way around the vehicle and check the other 3 tires. Repeat the entire process by sliding the penny in between the tread on different portions of the rubber. [5] X Research source If you’ve never had a tire replaced, the tread should be identical on all 4 of your tires. However, if you’ve had your rear tires replaced or you had a single tire replaced after a blowout, the tread may be different."

      "content": "Purchase new tires if you can see the top of Lincoln’s head. If at point during your inspection you can see the top of Abraham Lincoln’s hair when the penny is in the tread, your tires need to be replaced. Drive your vehicle to the mechanic or auto shop on a day when there’s no rain and at a time when there’s very little traffic. Drive slowly and take it easy. At the shop, pay to have your tires replaced. [6] X Research source For uniformity reasons, it’s best to replace all of your tires at the same time if you can. This will avoid uneven wear and tear on your vehicle. If you’re using a quarter, get your tires replaced when you can see the top of George Washington’s hair. This is roughly 4 ⁄ 32 in (0.32 cm), but the goal of using a quarter is to replace the tires before the tread becomes dangerously low."

      "title": "Continue driving on your tires if Lincoln’s hair is completely obscured.",
      "content": "Continue driving on your tires if Lincoln’s hair is completely obscured. If your penny goes deep enough into the tread that the rubber meets Lincoln’s eyes and his hair is covered by the rubber, you’re good to go. Your tires still have life in them and you can continue driving safely. [7] X Research source When the penny is right-side up, Lincoln’s eyes are roughly 10 ⁄ 32 in (0.79 cm) from the top edge of the coin. For the quarter test, so long as the rubber meets George Washington’s forehead, you’re good. This is roughly 12 ⁄ 32 in (0.95 cm)."

      "content": "Get an alignment if the tread is different on one or more of the tires. If you noticed that Lincoln’s portrait was meeting the rubber at different locations on one or more of your tires, it means that your tires aren’t wearing out evenly. This is usually a sign of an alignment issue, but you must have a mechanic take a closer look. Drive your vehicle over to your mechanic and explain the problem. [8] X Research source If your vehicle needs a realignment, it’s no big deal. This often costs $50-100 and can be done in under 2 hours if the mechanic isn’t busy. Unfortunately, this isn’t a repair you can make from home since it requires an alignment rack."

While the tread is generally a good indicator of your tire’s health, the rubber breaks down over time on its own. Read your vehicle’s instruction manual to see how often you need to replace the tires. On most vehicles, it’s either every 6 or 10 years.
