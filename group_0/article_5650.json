The best way to keep a male dog calm is to keep him far away from a female dog in heat. Your pup is biologically wired to reproduce, so he won’t be able to control his reactions to her. Putting your male dog indoors or in a kennel prevents him from smelling a female’s scent and getting worked up. Female dogs go into heat about every 6 months, which generally lasts for 2 to 4 weeks. They go into heat throughout their entire lives until they’ve been spayed.

This reduces your male dog’s ability to smell and sense the female. [3] X Expert Source Lauren Baker, DVM, PhD Veterinarian Expert Interview. 29 May 2019. If possible, keep them in separate rooms at the opposite ends of your home. Then, make sure to leave the doors shut and only let 1 dog out at a time so they don’t cross paths.

Smelling the item can excite your dog, making him whine, moan, and scratch at the door."

If you’re tight on space and can’t comfortably keep your dogs in separate rooms, keep your male dog outside until the female’s heat is over. Make sure the outdoor area has a fence to prevent your dog from venturing out of your yard. [5] X Research source Make sure your dog is comfortable outdoors by giving him a cozy shelter, lots of toys, and playing with him often. If it’s extremely hot or cold, keep him inside. Check your city’s laws to make sure you’re allowed to keep your dog outside. Don’t leave a female dog outdoors while she is in heat, as she may try to escape to find a mate. She may also attract male dogs in the area with her scent."

[6] X Research source Prepare your dog for boarding in a kennel by having him stay for short visits. This helps get him used to the environment. Then, pre-book the kennel for your dog so he’s there while the female is in heat. If you can’t board your dog in a kennel, ask your friends or family if they will care for your dog.

      "content": "Mask the female dog’s smell by spraying menthol on her tail. A menthol spray, such as Vick’s vapor rub, helps overpower the female dog’s scent during heat. Just apply the spray several times a day to the female’s tail so your male dog can’t smell her as well. When you apply the spray, distract your dog with toys or a treat to stop her from licking the spray before it dries. [8] X Research source Talk to your vet before using a menthol spray on your dog. Menthol can be harmful to dogs if they ingest a large amount, sometimes resulting in diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Do not spray menthol on your dog’s sensitive areas, as it can irritate her skin. Putting a dog diaper on your female dog is another great way to mask her smell. Dog diapers also reduce the clean-up of any discharge while she’s in heat. If she does leave behind discharge, clean it up quickly and neutralize the smell with a pet deodorizer. Washing your female dog with mild dog shampoo every 1 to 2 weeks also helps to reduce her smell and keep your male dog calm. If she isn’t up for a full bath, spot-clean by wiping between her legs with a wet, clean cloth. [10] X Research source"

Keeping both dogs entertained with lots of toys and exercise helps distract them from the smells and hormones of being in heat.

      "content": "Walk your male dog regularly, at least 15 minutes each day. Your male dog is feeling a lot when a female is in heat, so he needs to get out his energy. Walking him regularly gets him away from the female dog and gives him lots of stimulation, helping him feel more calm and relaxed when you get home. Just stick to a regular walking schedule, taking a long enough walk based on his breed and size. [12] X Research source Avoid walking your female dog while she is in heat, as she can agitate other male dogs in the area. Give her outdoor time in your fenced-in yard, or keep her on a leash if your yard isn’t fenced. Supervise her the whole time so she doesn’t try to escape or run after any passing male dogs."

      "content": "Speak to your vet about getting both animals fixed. The best, most permanent way to calm a male dog when a female is in heat is to get both animals fixed. Most vets recommend getting a male dog neutered when he’s around 6 months old. This prevents him from impregnating a female dog while lowering his sex drive and testosterone levels. Spaying a female dog prevents her from going into heat and getting pregnant. Many vets recommend spaying a dog before her first heat, though it can be done once she's already started.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Neutering and spaying dogs also reduces their risk of developing certain diseases and cancers. Female dogs often get their first estrus, or heat, when they’re about 6 months old. Smaller breeds might get it when they’re as young as 5 months old, while larger breeds might not get it until they’re 18 to 24 months old.

Go to source A neutered male dog will often still react to a female in heat, though he can no longer get her pregnant. It’s best to keep him away from her as a precaution. It’s common for both male and female dogs to mount and display sexual behaviors even when they’re spayed or neutered. If this is a problem with your dog, ignore and redirect their attention with treats and toys to stop them from humping ."

      "content": "Do not feed your dog 8 hours before the surgery. Your veterinary clinic will give pre-surgical instructions to follow for your dog, which usually includes giving them no food or water for at least 8 hours prior to surgery. This is because anesthesia often makes dogs nauseous, so it’s better for them and the veterinarians that they have an empty stomach. [15] X Research source Some water is usually okay to keep your dog hydrated, but consult your vet for specific instructions. Follow all of your vet's recommendations to ensure your pet has a smooth surgery and recovery."

Many dogs are nauseous, lethargic, and have very little appetite 1 to 2 days after surgery, which is normal. Just give your dog a comfortable bed to lie on and let him rest. Make sure he doesn't do lots of walking or running for 1-3 days after surgery, as this can irritate the incision. If your vet prescribed pain medication, give it to your dog according to their instructions. [17] X Trustworthy Source Animal Humane Society Leading animal welfare nonprofit organization providing medical care, training education, and resources for animal owners Go to source Your dog's scrotum may appear swollen for the first several days, but the swelling should go down once the stitches are removed. If your dog keeps licking his incision, get an Elizabethan collar, or pet cone, to prevent him from irritating his stitches. If discharge comes out of the incision, or if your dog appears to be in a lot of pain, bring him to the vet right away. Your vet will likely ask you to come back to the office 7-10 days after surgery to remove the stitches at the incision. If your vet uses dissolvable stitches, you won’t have to go back."
