      "title": "Turn off your device while charging.",
      "content": "Turn off your device while charging. This is the best solution to making your phone, tablet, or computer charge faster. It allows 100% of power to go to charging your battery, and none is wasted on whatever you're using the device for."

    {
      "title": "Do not use your device while it's charging.",
      "content": "Do not use your device while it's charging. If you don't need to use it, don't use it! The things you do on your device consume power. If you want your phone or other device to charge more quickly, set it down while it's charging and leave it alone."

      "content": "Plug your device into a wall instead of a computer. If you're charging a cell phone, tablet , e-reader, or other device via a USB port, switch to a wall charger. Wall chargers typically put out more amperage than a computer USB port. Many wall chargers have fast-charging technology built in. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a high-speed charging cable.",
      "content": "Use a high-speed charging cable. Not all USB cables are created equally. Some can't handle the power needed for fast charging. If your device uses a USB-C charging port, use a USB-C-to-C cable. If you don't have a USB-C charger, check the package on the cable to make sure your USB charging cable is rated for high-speed charging, or purchase a cable from your device's manufacturer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a faster charger.",
      "content": "Use a faster charger. Have a look at the 'Amperes rating' that's written somewhere on your current charger, and try to buy one that's higher to get more power into your device faster. Look up the highest ampere rating your device can handle to ensure you're not wasting money. While using a more powerful charger won't hurt your device, there's no point paying for more power if you're not going to use it."

      "title": "Enable battery optimization.",
      "content": "Enable battery optimization. Most newer devices have battery optimization features in the Settings menu that can help prolong the life of your battery as well as help it to charge faster. Often, this will limit the charging of your battery past 80%. Use one of the following steps to enable battery optimization: iPhone & iPad: Open the Settings menu and tap Battery . Tap Charging and tap the toggle switch next to \"Optimized Battery Charging.\" [2] X Research source Samsung Galaxy: Swipe down from the top of the screen and tap the Gear icon to open the Settings menu. Tap Device care followed by Battery . Enable Power Saving and Battery protection . [3] X Research source Stock Android: Swipe down from the top of the screen and tap the Gear icon to open the Settings menu. Tap Battery followed by Charging Optmization . Turn on \"Use charging optimization.\" You can also turn on \"Limit to 80%\" or \"Adaptive sharing.\" [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Use airplane mode while charging.",
      "content": "Use airplane mode while charging. While airplane mode doesn't make your device charge faster, it restricts what the device is doing, which may cut down on energy-intensive processes. For example, airplane mode turns off your internet connection, so your device is no longer constantly searching for connections or communicating with the internet. This means less power is wasted, and more can be used for charging."

    {
      "title": "Close tabs and background apps.",
      "content": "Close tabs and background apps. If your device is slow to charge or running out of battery quickly, Oppido suggests closing any apps running in the background. Closing applications stops them from running in the background of your device, which saves resources and electricity. Remember, the less power you use, the more goes into charging! If you know you're going to be using these apps in the near future, avoid closing them. It can actually be more efficient to leave them operating in the background than forcing your device to boot them up again."

      "title": "Turn on 'Do Not Disturb'.",
      "content": "Turn on 'Do Not Disturb'. Similar to airplane mode, this setting will reduce notifications on your device, allowing less energy to be wasted. Sounds and vibrations can be quite energy-intensive, so it's best to limit these when you need a fast charge."

      "title": "Why doesn't my battery hold a charge for as long as it used to?",
      "content": "Why doesn't my battery hold a charge for as long as it used to? There are several reasons why your battery may be draining more quickly than it used to: You may be using more apps or apps that consume more power. 3D games, video apps, and video editing apps tend to use a lot of power and drain your device more quickly. You may need to update your device. Updates help your device run more smoothly and keep your device secure. Keeping your device up to date also ensures it runs more efficiently. Your battery may be degrading. Unfortunately, all batteries chemically age. As your device gets older, the battery charge will degrade, and it won't hold a charge for as long as it used to."

    {
      "title": "How long should a battery last?",
      "content": "How long should a battery last? Your battery should be able to perform at 80% efficiency and above for at least two to three years under normal circumstances. After that, your battery may start to degrade and not hold a charge for as long as it used to."
    },
    {
      "title": "Does leaving your device plugged in degrade battery life?",
      "content": "Does leaving your device plugged in degrade battery life? Yes, leaving your device plugged in when it is fully charged can degrade your battery life. Most newer devices stop charging once the battery reaches 100%. However, there may be some energy trickling in when the battery drops below 100%. It's best to unplug your device when it reaches 100%."

    {
      "title": "Does frequent charging shorten your battery's life span?",
      "content": "Does frequent charging shorten your battery's life span? Most devices use Lithium-ion batteries, which last longer when charged frequently. Allowing them to drop to near 0% and charging them to full often can shorten the life span. Samsung recommends keeping your battery charge above 50% and unplugging it when it gets to 100%. [5] X Research source Generally, it's best not to allow your battery to drop below 20%."

      "title": "How can I tell if my battery is dying?",
      "content": "How can I tell if my battery is dying? There are a few ways you can tell if your battery is dying: You need to charge your device multiple times a day. The battery doesn't fully charge. Your device crashes randomly. Your device's performance is slower than usual."

    {
      "title": "Can I replace my battery?",
      "content": "Can I replace my battery? It depends on the device. Most older devices have removable batteries that can easily be replaced, but a lot of newer phones and laptops do not have easily removable batteries. Even if your device doesn't have a removable battery, you may be able to take it to a repair shop to replace it. Just be aware that this will usually void any warranties you have."
