      "content": "Place your thumb on the seam of the ball. A worn cricket ball will have a rough side and a smooth side, separated by a seam. Depending on velocity and rotation, this difference in surface texture will cause the ball to \"swing\" through the air from one side to the other. If bowled at velocities over 70 miles (110 km)-per-hour, the ball will swing toward the smooth side of the ball. If bowled below 70 miles (110 km)-per-hour, the ball will swing toward the rough side of the ball."

      "title": "Place your index finger on the seam, opposite your thumb.",
      "content": "Place your index finger on the seam, opposite your thumb. Bowled with this grip, the seam will force the ball to bounce in a certain direction. When bowled from the right hand, the ball will bounce to the bowlers left. To the right, when thrown from the left hand. Cricket balls that are new may have very little difference between the smooth and rough sides. This makes them less prone to \"swing\" through the air when bowled."

      "content": "Hold the ball so that the seam is parallel to your index finger. When bowled from the right hand, the ball will strike the ground on the left side of the seam and will bounce away from a right-handed batter's \"off side.\""

      "title": "Place your middle finger to the right of the seam, approximately a quarter of the way down the ball.",
      "content": "Place your middle finger to the right of the seam, approximately a quarter of the way down the ball. If you keep your middle finger closer to your index finger you will be able to bowl with more velocity, however, it will be more difficult to bowl with control. Depending on your release, you may benefit from a different middle finger position. Experiment to see what your prefer."

      "title": "Wrap your ring finger and pinky into a loose fist.",
      "content": "Wrap your ring finger and pinky into a loose fist. When you do so, there should be very little, if any, contact between the ball and these fingers. [1] X Research source To throw a leg cutter, place your middle finger on the seam and allow your index finger to rest on the right side of the ball. This slight variation in angle will cause the ball to hit the ground on the opposite side of the seam, forcing it to bounce the other direction (toward the \"off side\" of a right-handed batter)."

[2] X Research source Be sure to keep your weight back once your twist your body. You will generate more energy and velocity the better you can learn to shift your weight. If you shift too early it will affect the speed of your \"run-up.\""

If you bend your arm and lead with the elbow it will count as a throw. The shoulder must be the body part through which power is generated. Umpires will call a \"no ball\" when a player throws or \"chucks.\""

[3] X Research source This will not only add a little more velocity to the bowl, but will also create the proper angle of release. Snapping your wrist also prevents you from releasing the ball too late, which is often times the result of a player compensating for an improper angle of release. Overtime, a late release can result in excessive stress and/or injury to the bowling shoulder."

Because of its weight, a cricket ball can cause injury to the elbow if it is \"thrown\" or bowled incorrectly."
