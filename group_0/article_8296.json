      "content": "Rinse your derma roller under warm water for 2-3 seconds. Turn on your faucet and hold your derma roller under the water for a few seconds to get rid of any superficial debris, like dead skin or blood. Note that this does not sterilize the derma roller, but simply gets rid of surface-level residue. “Clean your derma roller before and after each use to minimize any buildup of dead skin cells and bacteria,” says Dr. Tareen."

      "content": "Pour 70% isopropyl alcohol into a small dish. Fill up a clean bowl or cup with 70% isopropyl alcohol (or a higher concentration) so the roller can be completely submerged in the solution. If you use less than 70% isopropyl alcohol, it will not sanitize your derma roller. [1] X Research source Unfortunately, you can’t disinfect a derma roller without alcohol. Rubbing alcohol is isopropyl alcohol and water. You can use 70% rubbing alcohol."

      "title": "Soak your derma roller for 10-15 minutes to thoroughly sanitize it.",
      "content": "Soak your derma roller for 10-15 minutes to thoroughly sanitize it. Place your derma roller tool upside down in your container. Dr. Tareen advises letting it soak in the isopropyl alcohol for at least 4 to 5 minutes, but aim for 10 to 15 minutes to ensure your roller is completely disinfected. Set a timer on your phone or kitchen clock so you can keep track of how long the roller soaks."

      "content": "Lay your roller upside down on a paper towel to air dry for 10 minutes. Air-drying is the best method to dry your derma roller. Towel fibers can get caught in and damage the tool’s microneedles. Flip your roller’s handle so the roller is upside down, and put it on a clean paper towel. Dr. Tareen suggests letting the roller air-dry for 10 minutes."

      "title": "Put your derma roller back in its protective container once it’s dry.",
      "content": "Put your derma roller back in its protective container once it’s dry. After your roller is finished air-drying, place it inside its original container and fasten the lid. This way, your derma roller stays mostly clean and disinfected. You’ll still have to disinfect it again before your next use, but proper storage prevents the tool from collecting excess bacteria, dust, and other debris. [3] X Research source Store your derma roller in a moisture-free environment to prevent mold. Keep it away from the room where you shower so moisture doesn’t work its way into the container."

Alcohol is necessary to thoroughly sanitize your derma roller since alcohol has antimicrobial properties, meaning it kills bacteria. [4] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Alternative cleaning methods like dish soap, dental tablets, dettol, hand sanitizer, or hot water are insufficient to disinfect a derma roller, either because they aren’t antibacterial or because they’re harmful for your skin.

      "content": "Use your derma roller once a week. The only exception is if you’re using a derma roller with very small needles, such as 0.50 mm or 0.25mm size, in which case you can do it twice or three times per week. If you’re using larger needles, such as 0.75mm, only apply your derma roller to your face once a week. When applying, only use your derma roller for 2 minutes per session. Any more could irritate your skin. [6] X Research source If you’re using your derma roller on your scalp or face to stimulate hair or beard growth, the same applies. You can use smaller needles twice or three times a week, and larger needles (over 0.50mm) once a week.

      "title": "What size derma roller is best?",
      "content": "What size derma roller is best? Longer derma roller needles (0.50mm to 1.0mm) provide deeper skin penetration, which can yield more benefits but also might feel more painful. Needles 0.50mm and shorter can be used more frequently because they’re less invasive. Needles 0.50mm to 1.0mm in length treat deeper skin issues like acne scarring. [10] X Research source The most common home derma roller needle sizes are 0.25mm, .50mm, and .75mm. 1.0mm derma roller tools are used on the scalp to stimulate hair growth. Anything with a needle longer than 1.0mm is reserved for professional use."

      "content": "What’s the difference between using a derma roller and microneedling? Derma rollers are at-home tools that use shorter needles than a professional microneedling treatment. Microneedling treatments, which are performed by a licensed dermatologist, use longer needles that penetrate deeper into the skin. [11] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source These longer needles are more effective than derma rollers for rejuvenating skin and stimulating hair growth.

      "content": "How do you care for your skin after derma rolling? Protect your skin by applying sunscreen and avoiding the sun when you can in the 24 hours following treatment. Your skin may be more sensitive to sun damage as the wounds created by the microneedles take 24 hours or longer to heal. [14] X Research source Additionally, hydrate your skin immediately after treatment with a serum or moisturizer . Avoid harsh skincare products like glycolic acid or tretinoin for 24-48 hours after derma rolling so your skin has time to heal. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Can you use a derma roller for hair regrowth?",
      "content": "Can you use a derma roller for hair regrowth? Yes, derma rolling is used to treat hair loss as well as for facial rejuvenation. Studies have found that microneedling therapy combined with topical hair growth treatments like minoxidil works better than either treatment alone. [16] X Research source However, most studies involve professional dermarolling treatments, which use longer needles than at-home derma rollers. Microneedling can help minoxidil and similar medications work better because the small holes the derma roller makes in your scalp allow the medication to better penetrate the skin.

[18] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source These side effects typically fade away a few days or weeks after treatment. It’s best to consult with a dermatologist before you start using a derma roller to see if it’s an advisable treatment for you. If you’re worried about potential side effects or have a history of sensitive skin, start by using the smallest needle size for derma rollers available (0.20 or 0.25mm) to see how your skin reacts."
