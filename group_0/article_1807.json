      "title": "Check with your company regarding asking for donations.",
      "content": "Check with your company regarding asking for donations. Your human resources representative is the best person to ask, but your boss can also be a good resource. Some companies do not allow employees to ask for donations, while others may restrict how it’s done. It’s best to know these rules before you get started. [1] X Research source For example, many companies restrict raising funds for political causes. Additionally, companies often require you to get permission before you start collecting funds. [2] X Research source You could say, “Next month I’m doing a walk to raise money for cancer and would like to ask for pledges. Are there any policies about asking for donations that I need to know about?” You may find that your HR rep or boss is willing to help you spread the word about your cause, which could help you collect more money!"

      "title": "Ask if your company matches contributions.",
      "content": "Ask if your company matches contributions. Some companies encourage employee giving by matching donated funds. This could help you gain more money for your cause and build a better relationship with your company. Check your company to find out what you need to do to qualify for matching funds, if they’re available. [3] X Research source Ask your HR rep or supervisor, “Does the company ever match employee donations? What kind of giving program do we have here?” If you’ve noticed materials in your office related to company matching, bring them up directly. Say, “There’s a flyer in the breakroom about a company matching program. Would that apply to my fundraiser for autism research?”"

      "title": "Share your campaign’s success with your workplace.",
      "content": "Share your campaign’s success with your workplace. Make your campaign a joint effort so that your coworkers and employer feel involved. Give them credit for helping you raise funds, and let your company promote the effort to show that they, and their employees, value a culture of giving. [4] X Research source For example, you could put up a poster to track how much money you're raising. If you're raising funds under your name, you could instead list your company name on the form. If your coworkers do something to help raise more funds, such as attend a walk, collect canned goods, or help you distribute items sold through a fundraiser, take photos and ask to post them in the break room. While you don’t want to give credit when it isn’t due, inviting others to share in your success could help you raise additional funds and make a bigger impact for your cause."

      "title": "Practice asking before going to your coworkers.",
      "content": "Practice asking before going to your coworkers. Preparing a quick pitch ahead of time will make it easier to ask when the time comes. Write out the key points you want to make, including the amount you’re trying to raise. Then recite your pitch a few times out loud. Try standing in front of your mirror or filming yourself giving the pitch. This will help you solidify what you want to say and feel more confident."

      "content": "Be direct and specific about what you want. It’s normal to feel awkward when asking for donations, but being vague makes it harder to get a “yes.” [5] X Expert Source Rob Wu Digital Fundraising & Crowdfunding Expert Expert Interview. 1 October 2019. It also makes things more awkward for the person you’re asking because they don’t know what it is you need. Instead, tell them what the cause is, that you’re collecting donations, and how much you need. You could say, “My aunt just passed away from cancer, so I’m raising funds for the American Cancer Society. I’m seeking donations of $5, but anything will help.”"

[6] X Expert Source Rob Wu Digital Fundraising & Crowdfunding Expert Expert Interview. 1 October 2019. While not everyone will have the same experiences, it’s still possible to make them feel like part of your effort. [7] X Research source Relate the cause to something you know they’ve experienced. Say, \"How is your dog, Toby? I know you got him from the shelter two years ago and wanted to see if you'd like to donate to help the shelter repair the dog run.\" Explain how donations are used, giving them credit for making those things happen. You could say, \"Your donation will be used to buy coats for the children at Girl's Haven. With your help, a child will stay warm this winter.\" If it’s possible, give those who donate something that’s connected to the cause, like a sticker, magnet, or photo."

      "content": "Share why the cause is important to you. If you can, tell them a personal story that helps them understand your motives. Showing your personal connection to the cause can help motivate your coworkers to give. [8] X Research source Say, “My nephew was diagnosed with autism at 2 years old, and thanks to this nonprofit, he’s been able to attend mainstream classes at a public school. He’s made friends and even participates on a Little League team. I’m raising funds so that other kids can get the same resources that helped him achieve so much. Would you be interested in helping?”"

      "content": "Ask people you’ve donated to in the past. People who you’ve supported in the past are likely to support you. For example, you may have bought baseball candy from a coworker, which may prompt them to buy Girl Scout cookies from you. Talk with these people first. [9] X Research source You could say, “I’m collecting donations to help my daughter’s all-star team travel to the state championship, and I knew that you’d understand since last year you collected funds for your son’s soccer team. Would you be interested in buying a candy bar to help the team?” If they say \"no,\" don't press the issue further. Say, \"I understand, just let me know if you change your mind. The fundraiser ends on March 21st.\""

It’s easier to solicit funds from people you have a prior relationship with rather than those you barely know. It’s not a good idea to make a pitch for donations during the first meeting you have with a coworker. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Select people you know share an interest in the cause. If you know someone supports your cause, pitching to them will be easier. They may even be willing to help you raise money. For example, you may know that a few people in your office are cancer survivors, who may help support the American Cancer Society."

      "title": "Choose the right time and place to ask for donations.",
      "content": "Choose the right time and place to ask for donations. Don't disturb your coworkers during a work task or inject your donation pitch into an important meeting. People will be more open to donating if you talk to them during a down moment of the day, such as in the break room, over lunch, or around the water cooler. If you do need to ask people during the actual work day, watch for times that are less busy or when your coworker is preparing to shift between tasks. Watch for cues that they are busy, such as typing, speaking to someone else, reading documents, engaging in a task, or carrying their briefcase out to a meeting. Ask the person if they have a moment. Say, \"I wanted to check in with you about something, but it isn't urgent. Are you free right now, or would later be better?\" While a large work meeting might seem like a great time to get your message to everyone, don't distract from company business with your pitch."

      "title": "Help your coworkers understand why they should choose your cause.",
      "content": "Help your coworkers understand why they should choose your cause. It’s unlikely that you’re the only one asking for donations, so it’s important to set your cause apart. Although you shouldn’t disparage other causes, give a few reasons why yours is a good choice. You could point out the services your organization provides, their service record, or the need for additional support for your cause. You could say, “Every year, more children are diagnosed with autism, but there is only one local nonprofit to serve them. If you donate today, all of it will go to help the children.” Alternatively, “95% of donations to this nonprofit are spent directly on research. With your help, we’ll be closer to the cure.”"

      "title": "Tell them what their donation will provide.",
      "content": "Tell them what their donation will provide. For example, will the funds go toward research, programs, or directly to individuals? This can help your coworkers view making a donation as providing a specific good or service. [11] X Expert Source Rob Wu Digital Fundraising & Crowdfunding Expert Expert Interview. 1 October 2019. Since society is built on give-and-take, people are more likely to give if they feel like they’re getting something in return, even if it’s indirect. Say, “Your donation will help provide feminine care products to women in a domestic violence shelter,” “These funds will help researchers pursue a cure for cancer,” or “Any money you donate today will go directly toward the cost of playground equipment for special needs children.”"

      "title": "Set up an event to encourage donations.",
      "content": "Set up an event to encourage donations. You could provide treats to promote your cause in the office breakroom, along with information about your cause. You could also invite coworkers to a special lunch or dinner event. If your company participates in the collection, they may let you have a special office meeting. For example, you could give out heart shaped cookies along with a pamphlet from the American Heart Association. The goal of the event is to get coworkers to come to you, which allows you to deliver your pitch."

    {
      "title": "Pass an envelope around the office for anonymous donations.",
      "content": "Pass an envelope around the office for anonymous donations. If asking for donations in your office is too stressful or causes conflict, you could instead pass around an envelope. Simply affix a list with everyone’s name to the front of the envelope, then encourage everyone to pass it around. When a person gets the envelope, they check themselves off the list, whether or not they put money in. [12] X Research source This gives everyone a chance to contribute money but doesn’t make people feel obligated to give. However, you should only try this if you trust your coworkers not to take the donations given by those before them."

    {
      "title": "Thank the people who contribute to your cause.",
      "content": "Thank the people who contribute to your cause. At the minimum, you should give a verbal “thank you” to those who give. It’s also a good idea to give out thank you notes. [13] X Research source You could say, \"Thank you so much for giving last week. In total, we raised $2,000 for new park equipment.\" Make sure that you don’t shame people who could not give. For example, don't send out an email to the entire workplace thanking those who gave. Keep the messages private."

      "content": "Give your coworkers a way to say “no” without feeling bad. There are many reasons why people will not be able to give. They may be low on funds, they could have upcoming obligations, or they may just have different values than you do. To maintain a pleasant working environment, it’s important to give these people a way to say “no” without things becoming awkward. [14] X Research source Always end your pitch with a question that allows the person to give a clear \"yes\" or \"no,\" such \"Would you be interested in donating today?\" Be prepared to graciously accept a \"no\" response. For example, say, \"Thanks so much for hearing me out today.\" If the person doesn't immediately answer, step in and shift the conversation back to work topics. Say, \"Don't worry about giving an answer right now. I totally understand if you can't give. If you come by my office later, I'll give you those numbers for new account.\""

      "content": "Respect that some coworkers cannot afford to give to every cause. No matter how important the cause, you are likely to get several \"no\"s. This is normal and okay. Don’t take it personally if some people can’t give, even if they’ve given to others. [15] X Research source Remember that it’s not personal. Don’t bring up prior collections in an effort to shame the person into giving."

      "title": "Avoid keeping records of who donated whenever possible.",
      "content": "Avoid keeping records of who donated whenever possible. This can make people feel very uncomfortable, especially if they can’t afford to give. For example, some people solicit donations via email, which allows them to see who responds and who doesn’t. Instead, try to talk to people in person. [16] X Research source In some cases, you’ll need to track donations because the nonprofit you’re contributing to requires it. For example, you may need to track donations for an AIDS walk. If this is the case, keep the records as private as possible so that people don’t feel on the spot. You could cover people's names with post-it notes or another sheet of paper. It's also a good idea to keep the sheet in a folder or envelope."
