A sporty style incorporates items such as sneakers, athletic wear, baseball hats, sweatshirts and sports-themed t-shirts. An edgy style can incorporate pieces with dark colors, leather jackets, boots, and scarves. Classic style is more business-y and involves button-down shirts, slim dress pants, dress shoes, and suit jackets or blazers. Hipster style is defined by flannel shirts, graphic t-shirts, slim-fitting pants, retro-style canvas sneakers, and beanie-style hats. However, you don’t have to define yourself by just one style! There are many articles of clothing that fit into many different styles that can create a core wardrobe for you to choose from."
