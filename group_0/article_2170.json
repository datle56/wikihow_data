      "title": "Both tight and loose leggings can lead to camel toeing.",
      "content": "Both tight and loose leggings can lead to camel toeing . A pair of perfect-fitting leggings or yoga pants feel snug, comfortably sit around your waist, and are opaque when you bend and move. Too tight leggings stretch the material over your pelvic area while too loose ones leave excess material, both of which can cause camel toe. [1] X Research source Well-fitting leggings are also more comfortable, breathable, and can prevent chafing and irritation."

      "title": "Thick fabrics create a larger barrier between your skin and pants.",
      "content": "Thick fabrics create a larger barrier between your skin and pants. When you’re shopping for new leggings or yoga pants, opt for ones made with thicker, blended fabrics like lycra, rayon, spandex, nylon, or bamboo. Wearing bottoms with more material helps prevent your camel toe from making an unwanted appearance. [2] X Research source In general, stay away from thinner fabrics like linen, polyester, and 100% spandex. Sit, bend down, and walk around when you try on leggings and other bottoms. The fabric is likely too thin if you can see your skin through the leggings when you move."

      "title": "Seamless leggings",
      "content": "Seamless leggings prevent camel toe, unlike ones with a center seam. Leggings with a vertical seam running down the center tend to pull upwards on your crotch, giving you a frontal wedgie. So, look for leggings with a flat front panel to prevent camel toe from showing. [3] X Research source Seamless leggings tend to be more expensive than ones with front seams, as they are typically made with thicker, higher-quality materials."

    {
      "title": "Leggings with large gussets",
      "content": "Leggings with large gussets help prevent bunching and creasing. Gussets are wide, rectangle or diamond-shaped strips of material sewn into the crotch area of leggings and other bottoms. [4] X Research source Wearing leggings with a gusset adds more material around your pelvic area, allowing you to move and exercise without developing camel toe. Leggings and yoga pants with gussets are a great choice for working out, as the extra fabric reduces chafing and improves moisture wicking."

    {
      "title": "Lower waistlines prevent pulling that can lead to camel toe.",
      "content": "Lower waistlines prevent pulling that can lead to camel toe. High-rise leggings and yoga pants can create tension around your waist and pelvic area, causing the fabric to bunch up around your crotch. When you wear lower-rise leggings , there’s less fabric pulling upwards around your pelvic area, which reduces your chances of developing camel toe. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Seamless underwear",
      "content": "Seamless underwear adds material between your skin and leggings. While you might prefer to go commando when wearing leggings, yoga pants, or other athletic bottoms, not wearing underwear can cause the fabric to crease around your pelvic area. So, opt for seamless panties to add a smoothing barrier between your crotch and leggings. [6] X Research source Wearing underwear with a vertical front seam can create or emphasize camel toe."

      "title": "Thick, built-in underwear can prevent panty lines and camel toe.",
      "content": "Thick, built-in underwear can prevent panty lines and camel toe. If you don’t want to worry about choosing the right underwear to get rid of camel toe or panty lines, opt for leggings with built-in underwear or shapewear. The added material around your pelvic area prevents the fabric from bunching up around your crotch while improving sweat absorption and moisture wicking."

      "title": "The thicker fabric of period panties stops camel toeing.",
      "content": "The thicker fabric of period panties stops camel toeing. Leakproof underwear are made with several layers of absorbent fabric to keep your bikini area dry while you’re menstruating. [7] X Research source The extra material makes these panties thicker, helping them smooth out your crotch when you wear leggings, regardless if you’re on your period or not. Wear period underwear when you exercise, too. The absorbent materials make them great at wicking away sweat."

      "title": "Cycling underwear",
      "content": "Cycling underwear are made of thick material that prevents camel toe. Cycling underwear have sewn-in chamois, which are cushiony foam pads designed to reduce friction and soreness when you ride a bike. [8] X Research source The extra padding prevents leggings, bike shorts, and other bottoms from pulling at your crotch and giving you camel toe. If you cycle or prefer wearing bike shorts instead of leggings, look for bike shorts with built-in chamois ."

    {
      "title": "Panty liners",
      "content": "Panty liners create a thick barrier to get rid of camel toeing. If you find yourself rocking a frontal wedgie while you’re out or at the gym, just stick a panty liner inside your underwear to conceal any creasing. The thick material of the panty liner prevents your leggings or bottoms from bunching up around your pelvic area. [9] X Research source If you prefer to wear thongs, wear thong panty liners . These are made with less material to fit inside your underwear while still covering up camel toe. For extra camel toe protection, wrap the panty liner horizontally around your underwear instead of sticking it on vertically."

      "title": "Toilet paper adds a barrier between your skin if you’re in a pinch.",
      "content": "Toilet paper adds a barrier between your skin if you’re in a pinch. If you don’t have a panty liner on you to smooth out your camel toe, don’t worry. Just head into the nearest bathroom and fold up several sheets of toilet paper. Then, place them in your underwear to prevent your leggings from pulling at your crotch. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Camel toe concealers",
      "content": "Camel toe concealers completely hide creasing and bunching. If you want a reusable alternative to panty liners or toilet paper, opt for a camel toe concealer. This is a silicone pad specifically designed to cover your bikini area and prevent your leggings or yoga pants from riding up. You simply insert it inside your underwear and go about your day. [11] X Research source Or, wear camel toe-proof underwear . These are made with built-in silicone pads."

      "content": "Cut an old bra pad insert to make your own camel toe concealer. Get out an unused pad insert from a bra, workout top, or bathing suit and trace the crotch of your underwear onto the insert. Then, cut out the outline and slip the DIY camel toe concealer inside the pocket on your underwear. [12] X Research source Simply wash the bra pad insert in your washing machine and let it air dry to wear it again. If your underwear doesn’t have a gusset pocket inside the crotch, just place the pad insert on top."

      "title": "Dark colors and patterns hide camel toe.",
      "content": "Dark colors and patterns hide camel toe. If you tend to have camel toe no matter which leggings you wear, wear dark or patterned ones. Dark colors like black, gray, and navy obscure any frontal wedgie action while patterned leggings in bold paisley, abstract, and animal prints draw the eye away from your pelvic area. [13] X Research source Light-colored leggings and other athletic bottoms in colors like white and blush pink tend to draw more attention to your pelvic area."

      "title": "Cover up camel toe by wearing a long shirt or sweater.",
      "content": "Cover up camel toe by wearing a long shirt or sweater. The quickest way to hide camel toe is to throw on a top that falls below your crotch and booty, like a long button-down, a stylish sweater, or a cozy sweatshirt. Alternatively, style your leggings with a pair of shorts or a skirt. Or, wear your leggings under a dress for a cute, put-together look. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "A bare bikini area can emphasize camel toeing.",
      "content": "A bare bikini area can emphasize camel toeing. Waxing off all of your hair removes the natural barrier between your skin and leggings, which can cause the fabric to ride up and give you a frontal wedgie. While your grooming choices are personal and entirely up to your comfort level, letting your hair grow out can help reduce the likelihood of getting camel toe."
