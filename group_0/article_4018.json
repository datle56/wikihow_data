You can find Parlus on the Marine Fortress island, which is located behind the Marine starter island. To find this NPC, go to the island and head to the docks near the boat dealer NPC. Turn right from the boat dealer NPC to a watch tower. Climb the watchtower (you need high jumping abilities since the steps are long). Fruits like the Rocket and Bomb Fruits let you jump high with explosive abilities. Once on top of the tower, jump into the tunnel on the floor to get inside, where you'll see Parlus, who sells the Black Cape."
