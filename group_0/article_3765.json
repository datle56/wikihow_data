      "title": "Buy a Nerf gun,",
      "content": "Buy a Nerf gun, preferably a Spectrum, because they work well, and are balanced and light. The Super Drum/Villainator works well in intimidation, and is easy to load and shoot. Or, the Tomahawk, or Savage Spin works well. Choose anything that is handy."

It is important to be able to work the gun, as well as the ability to use it properly, and to your advantage! You can use just about anything as a target, such as chalk on fence, or using old archery or rifle targets!"

      "content": "Assemble your full weapon arsenal. You will at least need a pistol (a Blitzfire, Reflex 6, or Kronos, etc.), a rifle or two (Villainator, Saturn, Hypnos, Artemis, Hades, etc.), and a machine gun (Spectrum, Destructor, DartStorm, V-Twin, Perses, Hera, Nemesis, Khaos, etc.) If you don't have a lot of nerf guns, practice with what you do have."

      "title": "Stay fit.",
      "content": "Stay fit. Start by eating a healthy diet, with lots of vegetables and fruits. Sugars will make you crash and burn within 15 minutes, and you'll likely to get a headache . Avoid eating too much of them. After you've gotten your diet working, concentrate on exercise. When in battle, you may need to sprint or run for a long period of time, such as 10–20 minutes! Practice on a treadmill, and doing as many push-ups and sit-ups and jumping-jacks as possible."

Begin with jumping over PVC Pipe hurtles, climbing trees, rolling, etc., and progress into walking silently and stealthily. Once mastered, try doing some of these while holding, and, if possible, firing the gun!"

      "title": "Decide upon your role.",
      "content": "Decide upon your role. There are several different roles, including : Melee Warriors, who use swords and axes in favor of blasters. They can take down enemies easily, but a well aimed shot is their downfall. They might carry a small sidearm. Snipers , who use long-range rifles to shoot down enemies from behind cover. Infantry, a warrior armed with a rifle and sidearm. These are the most numerous, and are well adapted to any situation. Assassins, or spies. These can infiltrate the enemies base and quickly and silently take down an enemy or eavesdrop on their plans."

      "title": "Construct a base.",
      "content": "Construct a base. This is an important place because you will store your Weaponry and Ammunition here. Make sure it is well defended, because if the enemy team gets to it, they will have a bounty of items to use. One idea is, to have a reliable easy security system. During a Nerf War, have at least one person who guards the fort. Another good plan is to have other little bases in the area, so if you main base is captured by the enemy, you can retreat to a smaller base to regroup your team and nerf guns"

      "content": "Build a Nerf capitol! This will be the main station for organizing campaigns, creating alliances, etc. If this falls to the enemy, you must have a secondary capitol, as well! Start with large cardboard boxes for indoors, and wood for outdoors! Also, cover cardboard with duct-tape to make it somewhat waterproof! Add a flag with a voted on sign, and a couple of windows with covers for rain and for ambushes! Add 2-4 cardboard boxes for turrets, with flags and holes for shooting."

You may want to also add little turrets (outposts.) in areas to secure, either keeping them empty and camouflaged for emergency use, or stationing units in them! Most outposts should be small, inexpensive, and pretty easy for the enemy to overcome. They are mostly used as warnings, and as emergency posts for the wounded/for cover."

It's important to have supplies on hand in just about every station (including outposts.), because in the event of a siege, you can hold out for a longer period of time, with ammo, food, drinks, etc. Having communication devices are handy, as well, so you can call for back-up, or supplies, instantly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Assemble a team.",
      "content": "Assemble a team. An ideal team should consist of a strategist, multiple soldiers, medic, assassin, machine gunner with an ammo carrier, and a sniper. Assign these roles to people based on their weapons. You can have more than one of each, because some battles require more people, and you may need to change out overworked warriors."

      "title": "Ensure that the team is reliable and that each member knows their roles and what they are good at.",
      "content": "Ensure that the team is reliable and that each member knows their roles and what they are good at. You can train them yourself to fit your style of fighting, but at least consider their thoughts when they come to you. They may not be happy with their role or guns, so you have to listen to them. Your standard team should consist of as many people you can. This listing is assuming you have around ten people. Have two-three Infantry. They are the backbone of your team. Their primary weapon should be either the Spectrum or Hera. They should preferably have the Kronos as their sidearm. Have two Snipers. They should be armed with a Nexus Pro and a bi-pod and perhaps a scope, and should be sniping from some sort of cover. Have two Scouts. They should be armed with two handguns, preferably Blitzfires for their power and easy prime. Scouts will go ahead on the battlefield to see what the enemy is doing. You only need one Melee Warrior. They should be armed with the Nerf Warlock (a Battleaxe), the Nerf Marauder (a long sword), or Shadow Fury and Thunder Fury (twin swords). They might have a Storm Squad as their sidearm. A tank is good as a battle opener or backup. You only need one Tank, but they should be equipped with heavy armor and at least three weapons. They will need a backpack or holster to carry it in. Good weapons are the V-Twin, Tomahawk, Savage Spin, Nemesis, Prometheus, Matrixfire, Commandfire, or Destructor. The Assassin is the ultimate weapon in terms of hit-and-runs. They are good at stealth, and can spy, or infiltrate the enemy's base to silently take down an enemy warrior."

      "content": "Form a strategy. Make plans on how you will attack the enemy. Try to take them off-guard, and use the environment to your advantage. For instance, if you are fighting in a meadow, it would not be a good idea to try a Pincher movement since you would be in plain sight fairly quickly. Think about the possibilities, the outcomes, and the consequences, but don't overthink; you need to be able to act quickly, even if it could end badly."

      "content": "Create camouflage for your squad, with uniforms and I.D. passes and other stuff for your squad! When using camouflage, try to use certain types for certain terrain; this will increase your invisibility. Uniforms are mostly used for meetings (without battling.), formations, and flat field battles (where there is no places to hide.). Uniforms are good because they act as identification of teammates and enemies. It's also pretty cool when all your friends are dressed in the same outfits; it's pretty intimidating, as well. I.D.'s are useful for basically just the fun of it."
