There are 2 parts to all fractions: the numerator, which is the number above the line, and the denominator, which is the number below the line. While the denominator tells you how many parts a whole has been broken into, the numerator tells you how many pieces of that whole there are. [1] X Research source For example : In the fraction 1/2, the numerator is 1 and the denominator is 2. In the fraction 2/5, the numerator is 2 and the denominator is 5. In the fractions 3/8, the numerator is 3 and the denominator is 8."

Jia says “whenever you're adding…fractions, you have to have a common denominator,” which means the “bottom number has to be the same.” Ensure the fractions in the problem you’re working on share a common denominator. It’s easy to add like fractions together, as the resulting fraction has the same denominator as the original fractions. For example : The fractions 3/5 and 2/5 have a common denominator of 5. The fractions 3/8, 5/8, and 17/8 have a common denominator of 8. If the fractions don’t have a common denominator , don’t worry—we explain how to find common denominators below! When 2 or more fractions have common denominators, it means they have the same number in the denominator. In other words, the fractions all represent wholes that are broken into the same number of pieces. [2] X Research source"

In the example of 3/5 + 2/5, add the numerators 3 and 2, which equals 5. 5 is your new numerator. [3] X Research source For example : Add 2/7 + 4/7. 2 + 4 = 6, so the numerator is 6. Add 3/8 + 5/8 + 17/8. 3 + 5 + 17 = 25, so the numerator is 25."

Remember to use the same common denominator in your answer, since the number of parts that the whole is divided into remains the same. When adding fractions with like denominators, you only add the numerators (the number of individual pieces).

      "title": "Simplify the fraction, if you can.",
      "content": "Simplify the fraction, if you can. A fraction is in its simplest form when both the numerator and the denominator don’t have any common factors they can be divided by. Jia says you simplify a fraction by “dividing the top and the bottom by whatever their common factors are.” For example , if your answer is 3/6, both the numerator and denominator have a common factor of 3. This means they can both be divided by 3 to produce a whole number. So, divide both the numerator and denominator by 3: 3 ÷ 3 = 1 and 6 ÷ 3 = 2, so the simplified fraction is 1/2."

      "title": "Solve the fraction if the problem asks you to.",
      "content": "Solve the fraction if the problem asks you to. Sometimes a fraction can be put into simpler terms, including dividing it to get a whole number or decimal. In the example 3/5 + 2/5, the answer of 5/5 is easy to solve because any fraction where the numerator and denominator are the same is equal to 1. [5] X Research source Think about it like a pie that’s been cut into 3 pieces. If you eat all 3 pieces of the pie, then you’ve eaten 1 whole pie. Jia says “fractions [are] just a form of division,” so any fraction can be converted from a fraction by dividing the numerator by the denominator, which often gives you a decimal number as the answer. For instance, 5/8 can also be written as 5 ÷ 8, which equals 0.625."

      "title": "Convert improper fractions to mixed numbers if the problem asks.",
      "content": "Convert improper fractions to mixed numbers if the problem asks. When a fraction has a numerator that’s bigger than the denominator, such as 25/8, it is called an improper fraction (the reverse, which is when the numerator is smaller than the denominator, is called a proper fraction). Improper fractions can be converted into a mixed number, which is a number that has a whole number plus a proper fraction. [6] X Research source To convert an improper fraction , like 25/8, to a mixed number: Divide the fraction’s numerator by its denominator. This tells you how many times 8 can go into 25 as a whole number. 8 can go into 25 3 times (8 x 3 = 24). Determine what’s left over. 8 doesn’t divide into 25 perfectly, meaning there’s a remainder left over. Simply subtract 8 x 3 = 24 from the original numerator: 25 – 24 = 1. The remainder is 1 and it becomes your new numerator. Rewrite the mixed number. The denominator is the same as the denominator in the original improper fraction. So, you can rewrite 25/8 as 3 and 1/8."

The numerators are 12, 4, and 1."

So, simply find the difference between the numerators to solve your problem.

Similar to adding fractions, Jia says subtracting fractions can leave you with an answer you can simplify by finding a common denominator, solve through division, or convert from an improper fraction to a mixed number. For example : 8/12 - 2/12 = 6/12. 6 and 12 both have a common factor of 6. So, divide the numerator and denominator by 6 to simplify your answer as 1/2. 15/16 - 3/16 = 12/16. 12 ÷ 16 = 0.75. 22/9 - 11/9 = 11/9. Divide 11 by 9. 9 can go into 11 one whole time and has a remainder of 2 (11 - 9 = 2). So, you can rewrite 11/9 as 1 2/9."

This is the smallest positive number that’s a multiple (the product of any number and an integer) of both denominators. To find the least common multiple of the denominators, list the multiples of each number by multiplying them by 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. [10] X Research source For example : The multiples of 8 are: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72 , 80, 88, 96, 104, etc. The multiples of 9 are: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72 , 81, 90, 99, 108, etc. So, the least common multiple of 8 and 9 is 72."

The least common multiple of 8 and 9 is 72. So, 72 is your new denominator. For the fraction 5/8, multiply 8 x 9 to get 72. Then, multiply the numerator by 9, which gives you 5 x 9 = 45. For the fraction 6/9: multiply 9 x 8 to get 72. Then, multiply the numerator by 8, which gives you 6 x 8 = 48."

Your fractions now have the new common denominator that you found and the new numerators that you multiplied by the same values to get the denominator. Simply add or subtract the fractions like you normally would. [12] X Research source For example , add 5/8 + 6/9. The fraction 5/8 becomes 45/72 and the fraction 6/9 becomes 48/72. Add the numerators. 45 + 48 = 93. Rewrite your answer. 45/72 + 48/72 = 93/72. Don’t forget to reduce, solve, or convert improper fractions to mixed numbers when applicable and necessary. In the above example, 93/72 is an improper fraction. You can rewrite it as the mixed number 1 and 21/72 (72 goes into 93 one time and has a remainder of 21)."
