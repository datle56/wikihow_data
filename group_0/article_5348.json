[2] X Research source Whenever you read a word problem about work, stop and think where the force is being applied. If you lift a box, you're pushing upward, and the box is moving up — so the distance is however much it rises. But if you then walk forward holding the box, there's no work happening at all. You're pushing upward still, to keep the box from falling, but the box isn't moving up. [3] X Research source"

The problem may ask you to calculate the force required to overcome friction instead.

Calculate cos(θ). cos(30º) = (√3)/2 = about 0.866. You can use a calculator to find this value, but make sure your calculator is set to the same unit as your angle measurement (degrees or radians).

Ignore any turns the bicyclist makes and pretend all distance traveled is one straight line. [16] X Research source If the bicyclist moved at a constant rate (didn't accelerate), measure the distance the bicyclist traveled in meters, and divide it by the number of seconds it took to move that distance. This will give you the average speed, which in this scenario is the same as the speed at any given moment. If the bicyclist is accelerating at constant acceleration and doesn't change direction, calculate his speed at time t with the formula \"speed at time t = (acceleration)( t ) + initial speed. Use seconds to measure time, meters/second to measure speed, and m/s 2 to measure acceleration."

[19] X Research source Specific heat capacity actually varies slightly based on temperature and pressure. Different organizations and textbooks use different \"standard temperatures,\" so you may see the specific heat capacity of water listed as 4.179 instead. You can use Kelvin instead of Celsius, since a difference in temperature is the same in both units (heating something by 3ºC is the same as heating by 3 Kelvin).

Heat is more commonly expressed in the metric system in terms of either calories or kilocalories. A calorie is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water 1 degree Celsius, while a Kilocalorie (or Calorie) is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram of water 1 degree Celsius.

One watt equals 1 joule per second, or 1 joule equals 1 watt-second; a kilowatt equals 1 kilojoules per second and a kilojoule equals 1 kilowatt-second.
