      "content": "1113 is a reminder of the importance of independence in relationships. Relationships are wonderful things, but it’s important not to lose yourself in another person, even if you believe you’ve found your soulmate . If you’re in a relationship, practice spending time on your own, apart from your beloved. See friends, and try dating yourself once in a while to maintain some separation and promote interdependence over codependence. If you’re single, take advantage of this time on your own to pursue your passions and explore new hobbies and interests. Talk to new people, join clubs, and spend lots of time with friends."
