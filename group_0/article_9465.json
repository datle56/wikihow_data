      "content": "Understand the music industry. You need to know a lot about the industry before you start submitting music to record labels. It is intensely competitive, and record labels are interested only in new artists who have the potential to generate revenue. Most musicians never land a record deal. Learn to accept lots of rejection without giving up or letting it break your spirit. Your only hope of being signed is having the potential to make money for the label. Being a great artist is not enough; you need a new sound, an attractive style, a fan base, and a celebrity persona."

      "content": "Research various record labels to explore your options. Getting a label to sign you to a contract is every musician's dream, but it's actually a rare event, and you have to do everything you can to increase your chances. That means you want to find a label that matches your style. There are comprehensive record-label lists online. Search for the \"record label directory\" for your country. This should help you narrow the search. Look for labels that have signed artists similar to you. A record company won't want to sign anyone who's exactly like someone else they've signed, but you want to work with a company you know is receptive to your sound."

You can also include a list of big gigs you've played, awards you've won, or other recognition you've received as an artist. Every document in the press kit should incorporate a band or artist logo to create a sense of unity among the various documents (and to prevent their getting lost). Your press kit should create a good first impression. It should be eye-catching and professionally designed and edited. If you don't have professional-level skills, pay someone to create a kit for you. Check out this helpful wikiHow article for more tips on putting together a press kit."

      "content": "Build a strong \"live\" show. When a record label considers an aspiring artist or band, they consider what kind of potential they have for selling out stadiums in live shows and making a profit in the long term, rather than just what they'll sound like on an album. [5] X Research source You may have to play free shows at first in order to get publicity for your band. You may need a \"day job\" to support yourself financially during this time.

That means you'll have to pay to record it in a real studio, and then either mix and master it yourself or pay an audio engineer to do it for you. The importance of sound quality cannot be overstated when it comes to getting the attention of a label. The first 10 to 30 seconds of your demo track are vital. Most record-label representatives have hundreds of demos to hear, so they won't listen to a mediocre one past the first 30 seconds. Yours needs to showcase your skill immediately.
