      "content": "Cultivate optimism. Mood swings are often associated with persistent expectations for bad things to happen or, in other words, negative thinking. For example, you might be waiting to hear back from a job and assume you didn't get it after only a day has passed. Or maybe your mother has informed you that she has something to tell you and you immediately assume that she's deathly ill. Not only is this kind of negative thinking often inaccurate, but it can also dramatically affect your mood and lead you to feel very angry and upset, typically for little to no \"real\" reason. [1] X Research source Melemis, S. M. (2010). I Want to Change My Life: How to Overcome Anxiety, Depression, and Addiction. Toronto: Modern Therapies. There are two different tricks you can try for dealing with such unhealthy automatic thinking: Take a step back and relax. Instead of assuming the worst that can happen, think about all of the other possible scenarios. This will help you realize that the worst is not likely to happen and that there's no point in getting all upset until you know more information. Alternately, you could consider the worst possible scenario and prepare for it, just in case. By ensuring that you are well prepared for even the worst case scenario you can imagine, you might be able to focus your attention on something else instead of dwelling on the unpredictable consequences that could result from it."

So what? You may think this means that you'll never find love or that you're going to be fired, but you shouldn't let this one situation or conversation make you feel like it's indicative or determinant of other trends in your life. This kind of generalizing is bound to make you moody and upset, but there is a way to counteract it. Remind yourself that what happened was an isolated incident. Instead of assuming one incident (such as a disagreement with a coworker or date) is reflective of your entire relationship with this person, consider it as a one-off and something that doesn't happen very often. Remind yourself of all of the success you have had in this realm, whether it's your work life or your romantic life, and you'll be able to calm down a bit and realize that there's no need to get all worked up about it."

There are many different outcomes other than just being a complete success or a total failure. For example, maybe your latest business deal fell through. Does this make you a failure in the business world? Absolutely not. You've had plenty of successes and a few setbacks. This in fact just makes you a real and well-rounded human being.

People who are prone to mood swings often take themselves pretty seriously, which makes it difficult to be able to poke fun at yourself, make a joke at your own expense, or even be able to laugh at a debacle you've found yourself in. [5] X Research source Bell, J.-P. (2010). Laughter is the best medicine. Sydney: Hachette Australia.

Sometimes, you may feel a mood coming on because you have to spend 15 minutes circling around the supermarket's parking lot to look for a spot. Though you may feel like it's the end of the world right then and there, take a moment to think about what is really upsetting you. Is it really that crazy that the supermarket is full right before the weekday dinner hour? Are you crazy about something silly like having to find a parking spot or because of a rude coworker's pointless comment earlier in the day? Ask yourself if it's really a big deal in the grand scheme of things. Maybe it is, but it's likely that you're letting something small blow out of proportion. We can often let moods come over us without thinking about their source. Though knowing that there's no logic in your current mood may not help you change it, it can allow you to calm down a bit and realize that things aren't as bad as they may feel to you. Think about your situation as if you were someone else. What would you tell yourself to do? Would you think that the situation you're in is really that big of a deal?"

One important thing to keep in mind when it comes to controlling your mood swings is to know when your emotions are taking over so much that your best move is to exit the situation. If you're getting heated, incredibly angry, or filled with resentment or another negative emotion and you feel like you don't have control over what you're doing or saying, then you should excuse yourself and walk away. You could also just leave the situation without saying anything. Though this may not give you the resolution you want, this will keep you from saying or doing something you might regret later. If you're in the middle of an argument, and things are getting intense, try saying something like, \"Excuse me, but I need a few minutes to gather my thoughts.\" Then, go somewhere quiet and try to think about what happened. When you walk away and your breathing and thinking return to normal, you'll be able to have a more rational perspective on the situation.

Remember that there's no shame in taking a break and returning to a situation with a calmer mind. Try counting to 10 and breathing during your break. This long-practiced technique of counting to 10 before taking action works because it gives you a distraction and breaks between the incident and your response, which in turn ensures that your emotions don't take you over.

Find whatever makes you feel the calmest and the most in control of your emotions, and find a way to go to your \"happy place\" whenever you're in one of your moods. When you feel a mood coming on, try to complete your calming routine, or do as much of it as you can. Unfortunately, you may not always have access to the things that make you feel calm or happy, but you should try to do your best.

If a certain coworker drives you nuts, learn to avoid this person or keep your interactions with him to a minimum. As with physical exercise, it’s all about learning more about your own personal boundaries and not pushing yourself too hard. If you cannot avoid encountering your trigger -- if it’s your boss, for instance -- take it one interaction at a time. Try to put each interaction in context by reminding yourself of what you can and cannot actually control. If your boss is persistently rude or puts you in uncomfortable situations, you should explore options that will enable you to alleviate that situation, such as finding a new job, talking to his superior, or simply giving him feedback directly.

Some herbs, vitamins, and supplements can improve or enhance your mood, although it is important to note that experts are not in complete agreement over the potential beneficial effects of these herbs and other supplements.

St. John's wort is one of the most popular herbs prescribed for enhancing mood. It is a yellow-flowered plant that has many chemical compounds that can have medicinal benefits. Keep in mind that you must consult your doctor before taking this herb as it can have negative interactions with other medications you may be taking, including birth control pills, antidepressants, blood thinners, and HIV medications. St. John’s wort is available in a range of forms, including capsules, tablets, liquid extracts, and teas. A typical dose of St. John’s wort ranges from 900 to 1,200 milligrams a day, and it should be taken for at least 1-3 months to see the best effect. Consult your physician or homeopath for their specific dosage recommendations. [23] X Research source Take SAMe (S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine), derived from an amino acid and also available from protein food sources, is another widely studied mood-enhancing substance commonly used in Europe. [24] X Research source SAMe supplements are usually taken in tablet form and the dose most often used for depression in clinical studies is 800 to 1,600 milligrams daily for up to 6 weeks. Although SAMe has few side effects, you should use caution if you have a pre-existing medical or psychiatric condition, such as diabetes, low blood sugar, or an anxiety disorder. There are also other potential vitamins and herbs that may help you better control your moods, although the evidence for these is less solid than for the two above. Lavender, for example, has been widely used in aromatherapy, essential oils, and teas to promote relaxation and relieve anxiety. Some people have also reported success in taking Valerian root to help with sleeping and to manage anxiety. You could also consider taking a multivitamin to ensure plenty of B vitamins in your system, which can help stabilize the membranes of your nerve cells.
