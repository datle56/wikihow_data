      "content": "Yes, all relationships take some work. Relationships require emotional intimacy, vulnerability, communication, and compromise, which are all a little difficult for everyone sometimes. In a healthy relationship , both partners contribute equally and make an honest effort to trust, respect, and support each other. Though there might be some mistakes along the way, a healthy relationship will ultimately leave both partners feeling happy and fulfilled. [1] X Research source Emotional intimacy and vulnerability can be a struggle since both require each partner to confront their true feelings and past experiences. Communication and compromise encourage both partners to confront their flaws, work through conflict, and practice forgiveness. This requires a lot of emotional maturity and can be tough for everyone sometimes."

      "content": "Long-term relationships may take a little more work. During the honeymoon phase , you and your partner were probably excited to be by each other's side 100% of the time. As you get to know each other, you may start to notice your differences and even run into conflict. Though challenging at first, getting past the infatuation phase and working through things can help the two of you get to know each other on a deeper level.

Go to source Over time, it's very common for long-term couples to fall into a routine, and it may take more work to keep the relationship fresh. To keep the spark alive, try showing gratitude for your partner and trying new things together. If you've been dating a long time, it's normal for you and your partner to change as the relationship progresses. To make things work, try supporting your partner and taking an interest in their new hobbies, interests, and goals."

      "content": "You're making more of an effort than your partner. All relationships have their ups and downs, but it's important that both partners contribute equally to making things work. If you're always the one to initiate plans, communicate about your relationship, and address conflicts, your relationship might be requiring an unequal amount of effort from you. [4] X Research source Figure out what you want and need out of your relationship so you can communicate that to your partner. Try expressing how you feel to your partner. Say something like, \"I really care about you, but it makes me feel a little hurt that I'm the only one that plans our dates. It'd mean a lot to me if things were a little more equal in our relationship.\" If your partner doesn't respond empathetically or make an effort to change, this may not be a healthy relationship for you. As hard as it may be, there are people out there who will be able to give you the effort you're looking for!"

You might say, \"My schedule is a little busy this week. Do you think we could pick a date for when we're going to the movies this week?\" If your partner responds negatively to a reasonable request like this, that's a sign that the two of you aren't super compatible."

This may be a sign that you and your partner are working too hard to make an incompatible match work. It's important that your partner makes you feel comfortable sharing who you really are. [6] X Research source Otherwise, the two of you can't share a genuine, vulnerable connection. Try pushing yourself to be open about your interests, hobbies, and past experiences with your partner. You may find that your partner loves these things about you. If being true to yourself creates more distance between you and your partner, you may not be in the right relationship."

A healthy relationship can motivate people to be the best version of themselves, but that's different than completely changing who they are. If you frequently ask your partner to make serious changes in their behavior and lifestyle, the relationship may not be a healthy match for you. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try to accept your partner for who they are and where they're at right now. If you aren't happy with the person they are currently, that's a sign that you may not be compatible.

Repeatedly reminding them or asking them to change is not only a lot of work, but it can also be very painful for both of you."
