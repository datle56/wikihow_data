      "content": "The formula for fuel consumption is Distance Driven ÷ Fuel Used. A car's fuel consumption is a measure of the miles or kilometers driven per gallon or liter of fuel. If you know the distance you drove and how much fuel fits in your tank, simply divide the distance you drove by the amount of fuel you used to get your miles per gallon, or kilometers per liter. [1] X Research source The best time to record your fuel consumption is right after you fill your car with gas."

      "content": "Fill up your tank to full, then reset your trip odometer. Most cars have a trip odometer that measures the distance you travel on a single trip. To reset it to 0 and measure your distance traveled, just press and hold the small trip button on your car’s dashboard or center console. Set it to 0 when you fill up your car with gas and check it when you need to fill up again—this gives you your distance traveled since you last bought gas. [2] X Research source Your trip odometer will say \"0 miles\" or “0 kilometers.” If you don't have a trip odometer, record the number of miles or kilometers on your car as your \"Starting Distance.\" For example, if your car has 10,000 miles or kilometers on it when you fill your tank, write \"10,000.\""

Then, note how many gallons or liters filled your gas tank back up.

This is your \"Distance Driven.\" [5] X Research source If you do not have a trip odometer, subtract your \"Starting Distance\" from your current odometer reading to find out how far you traveled. If your “Starting Distance” was 10,000 and your odometer now says 10,250, subtract 10,000. So, you drove 250 miles or kilometers on that tank of gas."

For example, if you drove 335 miles before refueling, and you filled your car up with 12 gallons of gas, your fuel consumption was 27.9 miles per gallon, or mpg (335 miles / 12 gallons = 27.9 mpg). [6] X Research source If you use kilometers and liters, divide the fuel you used by the kilometers you traveled. Then, multiply the result by 100 to get \"liters per 100 kilometers\". You have to start with a full tank and fill your gas tank all the way back up to know exactly how much gas your car consumed."
