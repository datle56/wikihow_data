      "content": "Separate out all white clothing and linens. Go through your laundry and place all of the white clothing items into a stack. Only clothing pieces that are completely white should be separated out. Only include pieces of clothing with colored stripes or designs if you are using color-safe bleach."

      "title": "Check your clothing tags.",
      "content": "Check your clothing tags. Read each item’s tag to ensure that they all can be safely washed in a machine on the “hot” water setting. Some all-white clothing items, like a delicate lace shirt, may need to be hand-washed. Some cotton items may need to be hand-washed or spot-treated to avoid shrinking."

      "title": "Set the wash cycle temperature to “hot.”",
      "content": "Set the wash cycle temperature to “hot.” Move the other settings to “regular” wash. This will ensure that the heat activates the bleach and actually whitens your clothing."

      "content": "Pour detergent into the machine. Use the same amount of detergent that you would normally use for a load of this size. The detergent will help to remove any dirt or grime from your clothing. Pour the detergent directly into the center barrel of the machine."

      "title": "Measure out 3⁄4 cup (180 ml) of bleach.",
      "content": "Measure out 3 ⁄ 4 cup (180 ml) of bleach. You can pour the bleach directly into the cap of the bleach bottle to measure it. Or, you can get a measuring cup used just for cleaning purposes. Go slowly to make sure that you don’t spill. If the load fills over ½ of the machine, then add a bit more bleach. If the load is under ¼ of the machine, then you can put a little bit less in. There are a number of different types of bleach that you can use. Chlorine bleach can disinfect your laundry, but may hurt delicate fabrics. Oxygen bleach is also called color-safe or all-fabric and can be used more widely. [1] X Research source You can also make your own bleach solution by creating a 50-50 mixture of water and lemon juice or vinegar."

      "title": "Pour bleach into the washing machine dispenser.",
      "content": "Pour bleach into the washing machine dispenser. This is usually a small, enclosed space located on the upper lip of the machine. After you’ve added the bleach, the machine will release it into the wash cycle as the water heats up. If your machine does not have a built-in bleach dispenser, simply pour the bleach directly into the wash water after the cycle has begun before adding your clothes. Wait a few minutes to let the bleach soak into the water and then put your clothes inside."

Some machines may have a simple button that you can push to start the cycle. The machine will start filling with water right away. If you have a side-load washing machine, wait to start the cycle until you’ve loaded the clothes in as well."

      "content": "Separate out your delicate clothing. Look at your garment care labels and set aside clothing pieces that are labeled “hand wash” or “delicate. If your clothes are a bit dirty, then you might want to give them a quick soak in a sink or basin with a bit of detergent before bleaching. This will make sure that the bleaching is equal across the fabric."

It’s best to use warm or hot water, but go ahead and use cold or cool instead if your garment’s care tag suggests it. Make sure that it’s okay to use bleach on the surface of your sink, if that’s where you plan to bleach the clothes. Some sink surfaces, such as certain types of marble, can be damaged by contact with bleach."

You can also slowly swirl the clothes around a bit with your gloved hand, if you like. Leave the clothes to soak for at least 15 minutes.

While wearing gloves, pull the drain on the sink or carefully transfer each piece of clothing from the basin to a sink for rinsing. Turn on the cold water tap and hold each item under it. This helps to rinse the chemicals away."

      "content": "Make sure the stain isn’t oil-based. To do a bleach spot treatment, the clothing must be white. The stain must also be a certain type, such as coffee or grass. Bleach doesn’t effectively lift out stains that are oil-based, like mechanic’s grease. In fact, you may worsen the stain by applying bleach to it. [2] X Research source If you are dealing with an oil-based stain, you may want to take the clothing piece to a professional dry cleaner. They will have chemicals that may be more effective than bleach."
