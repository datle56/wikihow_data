      "content": "Use the \"Write Nick\" page. The quickest and easiest way to get in touch with Nick is usually through its website. For ordinary, everyday questions (like, for example, if you want to know when you can catch your favorite shows), use the site's \"Write Nick\" feature. With this, all you need to do is provide your first name and write your question or comment — it's super easy! To get to the \"Write Nick\" page, simply search for \"Write to Nick\" on your favorite search engine or use the \"Write Nick\" option from the MyNick page on the main Nickelodeon website ( https://www.nick.tv/ )."

      "content": "For press inquiries, use Nickelodeon press contacts. If you're a journalist or a member of the press contacting Nickelodeon for serious reasons, instead of using Nick's ordinary online contact resources, use an official press or PR contact. These contacts will ensure your question or concern is addressed by a Nick representative in a timely manner — if you use one of the online forms above, it may take time for your serious inquiry to be filtered from thousands of unimportant ones. [4] X Research source There are many official Nickelodeon press contacts — too many, in fact, to list here. For a complete list, visit the press page for the Nickelodeon section of Viacom's website."

      "content": "For serious/business concerns, use Viacom's email address. For serious matters like legal issues, business inquiries, and so on, it's usually best to contact Viacom, Nickelodeon's parent company, which has direct control over Nickelodeon's business operations. There are several ways to do this online, which are described below: Use the official contact form at Viacom.com. Contact the official corporate blog at blog@viacom.com. Contact Viacom through its social media accounts (Twitter: @viacom, Facebook: \"Viacom\")"

      "content": "Use 1-212-846-2543 for the corporate offices in New York. Calling Nickelodeon directly isn't a matter of using one single telephone number — the network has regional offices all over the world, each with its own number. However, Nickelodeon's corporate headquarters are in New York City, so the number for this office is suitable for a wide variety of global questions and concerns. [5] X Research source If you're calling from outside the United States, don't forget to add your country's exit code before dialing the phone number. For instance, people in Australia should dial \"0011\" before proceeding \"1-212...\""

      "content": "Use regional offices' numbers for local concerns. As noted above, Nickelodeon has a number of smaller regional offices besides its New York headquarters. These may be more suitable for local questions and concerns than the New York headquarters, so you may want to use these numbers instead, especially if you live near one of these offices. Three of Nickelodeon's most important regional offices' numbers are listed below: Florida: 1-407-363-8500 California: 1-818-736-3000 [6] X Research source London: 1-732-779-8353"

      "content": "Use press contacts' numbers for press inquiries. If you're a journalist or a member of the press, rather than calling Nickelodeon's offices, use the company's press and PR contacts. These professionals' jobs are to help ensure that your question or concern is answered as quickly as possible, so they're usually a much better choice for fact-checking questions, company information, and so on than any single office. [7] X Research source As noted above, Nickelodeon has too many press contacts to list here. For a complete list of phone numbers, use the same Press page as referenced above for online press inquiries."

      "content": "Use the New York corporate office's address. As with contacting Nickelodeon via phone, there is no single address for mailing Nickelodeon — every office around the world has a different physical address, making matters a little complicated. Once again, however, the New York Nickelodeon Headquarters is a great place to start for general inquiries. The NYC office is located at: New York Office 1515 Broadway, 44th Floor New York, NY 10036"

      "content": "Use the Burbank studios' address. Nickelodeon's cartoons aren't written, shot, or animated at the corporate offices in New York. In fact, most of the work that goes into making a great Nick show happens at Nickelodeon Studios in California. For this reason, if you have specific questions about how shows are developed and produced for the network, it's a smart idea to send your mail here. Nickelodeon Studios are located at: Nickelodeon Studios 231 W Olive Ave Burbank, CA 91502"

      "content": "Use regional offices' addresses all over the world. As noted above, Nickelodeon has multiple regional offices throughout the world. Viacom, its parent company, has even more offices. Contacting any of these offices by mail is a viable option for having your inquiries answered, though it's worth noting that each regional office may not be able to answer questions that have to do with things outside its regional \"jurisdiction\". Below are just a few important regional offices' locations: UK : Nickelodeon UK Limited 17 - 29 Hawley Crescent, Camden London NW1 8TT.
