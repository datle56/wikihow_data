      "title": "Position your guitar.",
      "content": "Position your guitar. Free up your hands to do work by resting your guitar on its back. You can use a table, a box, your guitar case, even your own lap. Alternatively, if your guitar has a neck strap, wear the neck strap and turn the guitar face up. Make sure the guitar's head is not touching anything to ensure that your tuning pegs don't get messed with in the process, and ideally place it on a block to stabilize it."

      "title": "Select a rag and cleaning solution.",
      "content": "Select a rag and cleaning solution. Some people prefer to use a paper towel, microfiber cloth, or dry dish towel that they fold into eighths; other people prefer to use a clean cotton diaper. Any number of cloth or paper products will work, you just want to make sure that it's clean, dry, and relatively soft. Instead of applying the cleaning solution directly to the strings, which will also result in your guitar being sprayed, spray the solution onto your rag first. This will prevent any excess cleaning solution from gathering and being difficult to remove. [1] X Research source For a guitar with nylon strings, a non-dampened towel or one slightly dampened with water will suffice. For guitars with steel strings, there are guitar string cleaners that are manufactured for use like Fast-Fret String Cleaner, Dunlop Ultraglide, Dr.Stringfellow, and the like. However, you do not have to use these products if you cannot afford them. 70-90% rubbing alcohol can also be effective, as can pre-shaving gel."

      "title": "Position the rag.",
      "content": "Position the rag. With your rag now wet and ready to clean your strings, slide half of the sheet underneath the guitar strings near the bridge or bottommost portion for the strings. Then fold the remaining half of the cloth over so that the entire cloth covers both sides of the strings."

      "title": "Slide the folded rag along the strings.",
      "content": "Slide the folded rag along the strings. You want to make sure that you go all the way from the bridge/saddle area up to the nut of your guitar. Pay special attention to the portions of string located on the fingerboard as you most assuredly touch these every time, and, if you finger pick your instrument, the portions over the soundhole. Apply downward pressure to clean the top portion, and pull upward some to be sure that you get the underside as well. It is important to clean both sides of the strings just as it is important to clean both sides of your teeth. Don't worry if the head gets lifted off its mount; even if the tuning pegs get a little messed up you can always retune your guitar . You will probably notice that your guitar strings change color a little, or that the cloth comes away with grey streaks. [2] X Research source This is a sign that your efforts are working."

      "title": "Determine what your strings are made of.",
      "content": "Determine what your strings are made of. For guitars that use nylon strings, lubricating your strings is unnecessary. Nylon strings are already corrosion resistant. [3] X Research source If you have a guitar that has steel strings, however, you'll want to use some lubricant to keep them from getting sticky, dirty, and corroded. [4] X Research source You can check the product packaging for the strings you have to find out what they're made of. If you do not have the product packaging anymore, a good rule of thumb to follow is to consider the kind of guitar you have and the genres it's made to play. Acoustic and flamenco guitars that focus on classical and folk music usually possess nylon strings; electric and bass guitars associated with blues, country, and rock and pop music are more likely to have steel strings.

      "title": "Spread some lubricant onto a rag.",
      "content": "Spread some lubricant onto a rag. You can use the same rag that you used to clean the grime off from before by flipping it over and using the clean side. If you feel it's too dirty and the oils from your hands have sunk into the \"clean\" side, then you can use an entirely new rag for this portion of the cleaning process. You will want to select a lubricant that doesn't contain a petroleum base when treating your guitar; these can have penetrating properties which may cause damage to your guitar over time. [6] X Research source Dunlop Lemon Oil, Tone Finger-Ease String Lubricant, or GHS Fast Fret are all commercial oiling products you can buy that are made specifically for guitars. If you need something cheap and readily available, you can try olive oil, baby oil, or petroleum jelly. [7] X Research source You never want to apply the lubricant directly to the strings as there is a good chance you'll get excess grease on the fretboard which will be difficult to clean up."

      "title": "Run the rag across the strings.",
      "content": "Run the rag across the strings. Position and fold the rag the same way you did when removing the grime and run the cloth or towel from the bridge and saddle area to the nut. Apply pressure to both sides of the strings using your fingers. When done properly, the strings should end looking noticeably shinier. They should also be oily and smooth to the touch."
