According to ancient architectural traditions like vastu shastra, the optimal direction to sleep in is with your head facing south and your feet facing north. [1] X Research source Vastu shastra draws from the Hindu belief that the human body has its own north and south poles that interact and are affected by the poles of the earth. Your head, or the “north pole” of your body, faces the earth’s south pole so that opposite magnetic forces attract to each other. If you live in the southern hemisphere, vastu practitioners advise sleeping with your head to the north."

Sleeping with your head facing east is believed to improve your memory and increase your concentration, which makes this position especially beneficial for students. [7] X Research source According to vastu shastra, this is the second best direction to sleep in if you can’t sleep with your head to the south.

In Hindu tradition, it’s believed that north is the route that the soul takes when exiting the body after you die, which might contribute to the belief that sleeping to the north can lead to bad health.
