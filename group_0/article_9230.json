Refer to your router or modem's instructions in order to properly set up your network. If you can connect to your network with other wireless devices, then you should have no issues connecting your Wii. No special adjustments need to be made to the wireless network to accommodate it. If you don't have a wireless router, you can attach the Nintendo USB Wi-Fi adapter to your computer to make a specialized access point. You will need to install the software that comes with the adapter onto your computer, and then plug the Nintendo USB Wi-Fi Adapter in."

If error code 51330 or 52130 pops up on your Wii, this means the password you entered for your wireless network is incorrect."
