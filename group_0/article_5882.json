      "content": "Make sure that the room has adequate ventilation. Open all of the windows and doors in the room. You should never use dry ice in a closed room. The buildup of carbon dioxide that results from dry ice can be dangerous, so it's important that the room you're in is well ventilated."

      "content": "Drill 2-3 holes in the cap of a 3.8 L (1.0 US gal) plastic bottle. This creates a vent for some of the CO2 to escape so that the pressure in the plastic bottle does not build up. You will also need another cap that fits the plastic bottle securely. Do not drill holes into the second cap. [1] X Research source Alternatively, you can use a push on/off beverage container lid if you have one."

      "content": "Place 1.5 L (0.40 US gal) of the beverage into the plastic bottle. Make sure that there is plenty of space left in the bottle. Don’t replace the cap yet. You can carbonate a variety of different beverages including water, juice, tonic, and homemade soda."

      "content": "Add 454 g (1.001 lb) of dry ice to the plastic bottle. Use kitchen tongs to transfer the dry ice into the beverage. Wear oven mitts if you are going to be touching the dry ice so that it doesn’t damage your skin. If the dry ice is in large chunks and cannot fit into the bottle, use a meat hammer to break it into smaller pieces first."

      "content": "Let the beverage sit for 10 minutes until all of the dry ice dissolves. Screw the cap with the holes in it onto the plastic bottle. This is so that the pressure can escape while the beverage is carbonating. If the dry ice starts to stick to the plastic bottle, gently mix the beverage to help free the dry ice."

      "title": "Serve the carbonated beverage or store it in the refrigerator.",
      "content": "Serve the carbonated beverage or store it in the refrigerator. Once all of the dry ice has dissolved, you can serve the beverage immediately as it will be both fizzy and cold. Alternatively, place a closed cap on the plastic bottle and store it overnight in the refrigerator. It is essential to make sure that all of the dry ice has dissolved before the beverage is served. This is because the dry ice can cause severe burns due to its low temperature. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour the beverage into a 1 L (34 fl oz) plastic bottle. Leave approximately 5 cm (2.0 in) of space at the top of the bottle. Make sure that the bottle has a cap that can tightly screw on. [3] X Research source You can use any beverage that you like. For example, you could mix flavored syrup with tap water at a ratio of 1:2 or you could carbonate fruit juice. Just ensure that you carbonate the beverage in the recommended amounts, as smaller volumes of liquid could develop a bad taste due to the yeast not being diluted enough. [4] X Research source The bottle needs to be plastic because this is less dangerous than glass if the beverage accidentally over-carbonates and causes the bottle to shatter. Also, with a plastic bottle, you will be able to easily tell when the beverage has been carbonated. You can transfer the carbonated beverage to a glass bottle for serving if you prefer."

      "content": "Leave the beverage to ferment for 12-48 hours at room temperature. Keep the bottle in a cool, dark place and out of direct sunlight. Gently squeeze the bottle from time to time to check when it feels very solid and has little give. This means that the beverage has been carbonated. [6] X Research source This time is just an estimate, as the actual time that it takes for the beverage to carbonate depends on the temperature in your home."

      "content": "Refrigerate the beverage for up to 2 weeks. When the beverage has reached the right amount of carbonation, store it in the refrigerator until it is served. The cooler temperature in the refrigerator will prevent it from carbonating further. [7] X Research source When you open the bottle to serve the beverage, open it very slowly to gradually release the pressure. It may be helpful to do this over a sink."

      "content": "Gather a CO2 tank, regulator, keg coupler, carbonation cap, and a plastic bottle. Prepare all of the necessary equipment before you begin. The keg coupler needs to be a gas-in ball lock type and the carbonation cap can be either plastic or stainless steel depending on what you prefer. Carbonation caps fit standard 1 or 2 L (34 or 68 fl oz) plastic bottles. [8] X Research source You can purchase the supplies to make your own carbonation system from a brewing supply store or online. CO2 tanks can be filled at sporting or welding supply stores. Always use a plastic bottle when you are carbonating your own beverage rather than glass. This is because there is always the potential for the bottle to shatter if too much pressure is supplied and plastic is a much safer material in this scenario. [9] X Research source"

Use the dial on the CO2 regulator to change the pressure. 35-50 psi is a good place to start for any carbonated beverage, as it depends on what kind of beverage you are working with and how fizzy you want it to be. [13] X Research source Make sure that the CO2 regulator valve remains closed while you are opening the CO2 tank valve and changing the pressure. [14] X Research source Drinks that are made with mostly fruit are generally carbonated best at around 35 psi. Mixer drinks such as tonics require higher pressure, so try 40-45 psi for these. [15] X Research source Use 50 psi for wine and cocktails, as alcoholic beverages require higher pressures to be carbonated properly. [16] X Research source"

Make sure that you leave some space at the top of the bottle, as the beverage will expand when you add the CO2. [17] X Research source It’s important that the beverage is cold as CO2 dissolves more easily in cold liquid. Store the beverage in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours prior to carbonating it. [18] X Research source For example, if you wanted to use a 1 L (34 fl oz) plastic bottle, the maximum volume of the beverage that you carbonate will be 750 ml (25 fl oz)."

Otherwise, all of the CO2 will remain at the top of the bottle. [23] X Research source Don’t turn the bottle upside down as you are shaking it. This is because it may cause the liquid to backflow up into the gas line and regulator. [24] X Research source Each time you shake the bottle, you will hear the CO2 regulator release slightly more gas. This means that you have correctly carbonated the beverage. [25] X Research source"
