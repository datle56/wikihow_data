This is where Writesonic differs from other AI writing apps—Writesonic allows you to select between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for your content creation, as long as you're on a Business plan. GPT-4 tends to be more accurate and writes more sensible copy, which might not be important if you're using an AI writing tool for drafting but might be a huge draw if you're looking to generate long-form content. As far as features go, Writesonic offers similar tools as other AI content generators, but one standout is a custom AI-powered chatbot generator.
