      "content": "Examine products for “BPA-free” labeling or the numbers 1, 2, 4, and 5. Many plastic products contain a number label that tells you if they contain BPA. Check the bottom of the product for a number from 1 to 7 surrounded by a triangle made of 3 arrows (commonly known as the “recycling symbol”). [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Items with numbers 3, 6, and 7 most likely contain BPA. Items with 1, 2, 4, or 5 generally do not contain BPA. A “BPA-free” label (the phrase surrounded by a circular stem and leaf) on the product or packaging, in combination with one of the “safer” recycling numbers, is your safest bet for avoiding BPA. This label doesn’t necessarily mean the product never came into contact with BPA; however, it does mean it isn’t made from it. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Identify BPA products by seeing if they bend or are labeled with the number 7.",
      "content": "Identify BPA products by seeing if they bend or are labeled with the number 7. BPA provides some “give” to rigid plastics (also known as polycarbonates) to reduce cracking and breaking. If the product doesn’t move or bend in your grip, it’s likely BPA-free. Similarly, if the plastic item has a recycling number 7 and/or has the marking “PC,” it’s a polycarbonate and more likely to contain BPA. [3] X Research source If a plastic product is rigid and transparent—like a reusable food storage container—it’s probably a polycarbonate that may contain BPA. Softer, flexible, and opaque plastics are usually not polycarbonates and are less likely to contain BPA."

      "title": "Discard plastic products that were made before 2012.",
      "content": "Discard plastic products that were made before 2012. BPA has been in use since the late 1950s, so there’s a distinct possibility that your childhood “sippy cup” or your grandma’s vintage plastic storage containers contain BPA. BPA was banned in most products (specifically baby bottles and kids’ sippy cups) by the FDA in the U.S. in 2012 and earlier in Europe. To be safe, throw out or recycle any plastic products that date earlier than 2012. [4] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Older plastic products are also less likely to have identifying labeling, making it harder to determine what they’re made of. Scratches, general wear and tear, and repeated heat exposure cause a greater release of BPA in plastic products. This is another reason to consider discarding older, well-used products that may contain BPA.

      "content": "Choose non-plastic food and beverage containers. The less plastic you use, the less at risk you are of BPA. Before the widespread adoption of plastic, everything from baby bottles to mixing bowls was typically made of materials like glass, ceramic, and stainless steel. So, revert to these methods and choose alternative containers to plastic. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If even BPA-free baby bottles concern you, for instance, there are newer glass options that include a silicone sleeve on the outside to limit the chance of shattering. Be aware, however, that many metal cans used for foods and beverages (like beans and beer) contain a lining resin that contains BPA. Regular consumption of food from such containers could possibly temporarily increase blood BPA levels. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Limit the use of high heat and harsh cleaning methods when using plastic. Even if your plastic products are advertised as “microwave-safe” or “dishwasher-safe,” high temperatures can weaken plastic and release chemicals like BPA. Similarly, harsh chemicals (such as bleach or chlorine) or scouring and scrubbing can cause the same issue. To avoid this, follow these simple safety tips: [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Use microwave-safe glass or ceramic dishes to reheat foods in the microwave. Don’t put hot foods or beverages directly into plastic containers. Wash plastic items by hand with gentle soap, warm water, and non-abrasive brushes or rags. Discard scratched, discolored, faded, or misshapen plastics that have been used for long periods."

      "content": "Find plastic alternatives for products that make mouth contact. Food and beverage containers aren’t the only plastics that can make mouth contact, especially if you have small children around. Sucking, chewing, or swallowing plastic items (such as teethers and toys) can cause possible BPA exposure. Avoid this by choosing products made of traditional, non-plastic materials, like untreated wood, cotton, or wool."

      "content": "BPA is an industrial chemical additive that may harm your health. Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a synthetic chemical that’s been used since the 1950s to “soften” plastics. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source In other words, it adds flexible strength to a wide range of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. When ingested in sufficient quantities, BPA has been shown to be a “hormone disruptor” that mimics estrogen and can impact brain, behavioral, and reproductive development, especially in fetuses, infants, and small children.

[11] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Pro-BPA campaigners argue that BPA is fundamental to society because it creates shatter-resistant, lightweight materials used every day at a low cost(such as eyewear, automobiles, incubators, and food storage containers). [12] X Research source Despite the debate, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is clear on the issue: “current approved uses of BPA in food containers and packaging are safe.” [13] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source The FDA (and plastics manufacturers) contend that while BPA can cause health problems, the amount you can ingest from products is far below the threshold for concern."
