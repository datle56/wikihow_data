      "content": "Place frozen prawns in a container in the refrigerator to thaw overnight. This method takes a while, but it's also the easiest and safest, since the prawns will remain cold enough to prevent bacteria growth. Simply take the prawns out of their freezer bag and put them in a covered dish or container. Set them in the refrigerator overnight or for about 8 hours. They’ll be defrosted the next day. [1] X Research source The prawns are thawed when they’re soft and easily bendable. [2] X Research source Once the prawns are defrosted, they're ready to cook! Refrigerator-thawed prawns (and other raw proteins) are safe to refreeze without cooking since they never sat in unsafe, warm temperatures while thawing. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Soak the prawns in cold salt water for about 20 minutes for a faster thaw. For a rapid defrost, add 2 tbsp (34 g) of salt (for flavor) to 4 c (0.95 L) of cold water in a large bowl. Take the frozen prawns out of their bag and add them to the water, making sure they’re completely submerged. Leave them for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to break up frozen clumps. [4] X Research source Alternatively, place the prawns in a plastic bag or polybag , then put the bag in the water. This method may take longer (about 30 minutes). Afterward, lay the prawns on paper towels or a clean cloth for several minutes to drain the water off. They should feel squishy and bendable rather than solid. Do not refreeze prawns that were defrosted with cold water without cooking them first, as this can lead to bacteria growth and unwanted texture or flavor changes. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Thaw prawns under cold, running water for 5-10 minutes. Put the frozen prawns in a colander, then place them under cold, running water in your kitchen sink. As the water runs, move the prawns around to make sure each piece is equally exposed to the water. [6] X Research source Make sure your water is cool or cold. Warm water can begin to cook the prawns, leading to uneven or overcooking later."

      "title": "Steer clear of the microwave for defrosting frozen prawns.",
      "content": "Steer clear of the microwave for defrosting frozen prawns. When you use the microwave to quickly thaw prawns, you end up partially cooking them on the outside. This makes you more likely to accidentally overcook them later, leading to chewy, rubbery prawns. [7] X Research source It’s not unsafe to defrost prawns this way, but the taste and quality of your meal won’t be as good as with other defrosting methods."

      "content": "Boil prawns in salt water for 3-6 minutes. Add 2 tbsp (34 g) of salt to about 8 c (1.9 L) of water in a pot (this should be enough water for about 1 lb (0.45 kg) of prawns). Bring the water to a boil, then pour in the prawns with the shells on. Once the water comes back to a boil, turn the heat down and cook the prawns for 3-6 minutes. Look for a pink and opaque color to tell if they’re cooked . [8] X Research source The prawns will also float to the top when they're done. To stop the cooking process and avoid overcooking, place the prawns in a separate pot of ice water to blanch them as soon as they're done."

If it's a gas grill, set it to medium heat. If you have a charcoal grill, light it and then let the initial heat die down some before you grill the prawns. While the grill heats up, butterfly cut the prawns along the back, creating an opening. Pull the prawn open in the back, making a wide, flat prawn. Place the prawns on the grill, and cook them until they're pink and opaque, which usually takes just 3-5 minutes. [10] X Research source If the prawns still have their shells, leave them on, but trim off the legs. You can still butterfly the prawns with their shells on. Optionally, coat the prawns in a little butter or oil before grilling them to add extra flavor."

      "content": "Sauté prawns in a pan for 3-5 minutes. Place a pan over high heat and add a pat or 2 of butter and a spoonful of olive oil. Once the oil is hot and the butter is melted, add 1-2 cloves of minced garlic and let it cook by itself for 30-60 seconds. Pat your prawns dry and pour them in the pan with a sprinkle of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook for 3-5 minutes, stirring often. Try to leave some space between the prawns in the pan to avoid overcrowding and ensure they all cook evenly. Take the prawns off the heat when they turn pink and firm. [11] X Expert Source Randall Chambers Personal Chef Expert Interview. 26 October 2021. For the best result, peel and devein the prawns before sautéing them. It’s OK if you leave the shells on, but it will take longer."

      "content": "Rinse the prawns to remove ice crystals before roasting or sautéing. Place the prawns in a colander and run them under cool water for about a minute to break up clumps of frozen prawns and remove excess ice. This keeps unwanted water from diluting or soaking your main dish. Use shelled or unshelled prawns for these cooking methods."

Turn the broiler on high (500–550 °F (260–288 °C)) and set a rimmed baking sheet on the rack to heat up for 10 minutes. Toss the frozen, rinsed prawns in a seasoning mix of your choice, then add them to the heated baking sheet. Cook for 5-8 minutes. [12] X Research source Play with whatever spices you enjoy! Try simple salt and pepper, a Cajun spice blend, taco seasoning, or a sprinkle of rosemary, basil, and garlic. If the prawns clump up together as you pour them onto the baking sheet, use tongs to spread them out. The prawns are done when they curl slightly and turn pink and firm."

Add 1-2 tbsp (15-30 mL) of olive oil to a pan over high heat, then cook 1-2 cloves of minced garlic in the pan for about 1 minute. Pat your rinsed, frozen prawns dry and add them directly to the oil. Sprinkle on some salt and pepper and cook them for 5-7 minutes, stirring frequently, until they’re pink and firm. [13] X Research source Try not to crowd the prawns in the pan, as they won't sear as well. For different flavors, try swapping out the minced garlic for chopped shallots, parsley, or coriander leaves."

For 1 pound (0.45 kg) of prawns, fill a pot with about 8 to 9 cups (1.9 to 2.1 L) of water and at least ½ tsp (2.5 g) of salt over high heat. Stir in any other spices or flavors you'd like, like lemon juice or garlic cloves. Bring the pot to a boil, then remove it from the heat. Stir in the prawns and cover the pot to let them cook for 5-6 minutes. [14] X Research source For poaching (or any “wet” cooking method), bang the bag of frozen prawns on the counter to break up clumps (no need to rinse). Try adding half a lemon with the juice squeezed in, 3-4 garlic cloves, ¼ of an onion, a handful of parsley, and/or 12-15 peppercorns. The amounts do not need to be precise, as you’re just adding flavor. Be as heavy-handed as you'd like!"
