      "content": "Take responsibility for your actions. When you distance yourself from your actions by justifying them as vengeance or deserved, you allow yourself to be unkind for selfish reasons. Instead of telling yourself that the way you act towards others is deserved with it's negative, take responsibility for the way you treat others. Don't convince yourself that negative things you do or say are acceptable because you feel slighted. You can't control the actions of others, but you can control how you react to them. Being kind is a choice."

Are you kind to yourself? Do you show yourself compassion? Or do you refuse to acknowledge when you are struggling or suffering? If you treat yourself harshly, then consider the reasons why. What might change if you were kind to yourself? [6] X Research source"
