      "content": "Celebrities Set up the Celebrities game by writing down the names of 5-10 famous celebrities on small pieces of paper. Put the papers into a hat or bowl and mix them well. Split up the group into two teams, then give one person from each time a minute to describe as many of the celebrity names to their team as possible. However, they’re only allowed to use 3 words to describe each celebrity they pick out of the hat. [1] X Research source Players are also not allowed to gesture or make noises, and they can only “pass” on a celebrity once per turn. Keep track of every correctly-guessed name and set aside the slips of paper so they can’t be used again in this round. Once every player on each team has had a turn as the “describer,” put all the papers back into the hat and start the second round. In Round 2, everyone gets to go again with the same celeb names—however, in this round, the describer is only allowed to use 1 word to hint at each celebrity. Repeat this process again before the third and final round, where describers can now use gestures but can’t use any words at all."

If you’re creating your own Charades prompts, aim for a mix of play titles, book titles, songs, TV shows, movies, celebrities, and general actions. You can divide your group into teams or play collaboratively as a group. Select one person from the group or one of the teams to be the first “performer.” Have them choose a prompt then act it out without speaking or making any noises. [2] X Research source The group or the performer’s team then tries to guess what is being acted out. You can also choose to play with a timer to up the ante, but that’s up to you and your group! Some people play Charades so that certain hand signs can be used to indicate the category of or number of words in the clue (like unfolding your hands for “book” or cranking a film camera for “movie”). Check out this list for a full guide to Charades hand gestures. You can also play an even more giggle-inducing variation called Puppet Master Charades . In this version, one person stands still while another person acts out the clue by manipulating the other person’s arms, legs, or body position (like a puppet master!)."

For instance, they might say “Fortunately, I woke up to a beautiful and sunny day this morning.” The next player then continues the story with an unfortunate or negative statement, like “Unfortunately, I soon realized I’d slept through my alarm and was late for school.” The third player then adds another positive statement, like “Fortunately, I then remembered that today was a school holiday.” The next player then adds another unfortunate statement, and play continues in this alternating way until the story comes to a natural end."

      "content": "Heads Up, Seven Up You can repurpose this classic classroom game for the great outdoors by choosing three people to be pickers and having the rest of your players sit around the campfire in their camping chairs. Ask everyone who’s seated to close their eyes and hold their arms outstretched with their thumbs up in the air. Then, have each picker walk around the circle and select one person’s thumb to tap. When someone’s thumb is tapped, they must put their thumb down so the other pickers know they’ve already been chosen. Pickers should be as stealthy as possible while tapping the thumbs—their goal is to not have the tapped individual know that it was them who tapped their fingers. Once all of the picking is completed, the pickers all say “heads up, seven up” in unison. Players that were tapped can then stand up and guess who pickles them. After each person has made their guess, the pickers will reveal who they really selected. If the person guessed correctly, they’ll switch places with their picker. If they guess wrong, then the picker stays in their role for the next round."

If a player moves their hand to the wrong place, then they’re out of the game and have to sit on their hands for the remaining rounds until only one player (the winner!) is left standing.

In its most simple form, write down the names of a bunch of popular songs on little scraps of paper. Place them in a bowl, hat, or other container. On each turn, pass the container around the campfire circle and have the player whose turn it is pick out a paper. The player then hums or whistles the melody to the tune and the rest of the group tries to guess the name of the song! [4] X Research source If you have an instrument on hand, however, you can ask a player to play the riff, intro, or melody of a famous song. The rest of the group then tries to guess the song name as quickly as possible. This game can be played in teams with scorekeeping, or simply played as a fun and collaborative game."

However, there can be no pointing, gesturing, or pre-assigning of who is saying which numbers or who will be the next person to speak. If two people say a number at the same time, you have to start over from 1. Try setting a goal of what number your group wants to reach. 15? 30? 50? 100?"

This starting player must then whisper their phrase into the ear of the person sitting next to them, and they can only say the phrase one time (no repeating!). Whatever the listener heard must be whispered into the ear of the next person into the circle. [6] X Research source Repeat this process until the “phrase” makes it all the way around the circle. When it reaches the last person, have them announce what they heard out loud to the group. Did the phrase manage to stay unchanged? You can also play a variation known as Crazy Telephone , where the first person starts with a single word. Instead of the next person repeating what they heard, they say the first associated word that pops into their head. If the first person whispers “cat,” for example, the next person might say “hat,” the next “fedora,” and so on."

The person whose vegetable name was just said must then say their own name twice, then the name of another person’s vegetable twice. This pattern repeats throughout the game. [7] X Research source However, no one is allowed to show their teeth while speaking. If someone shows their teeth on their turn, then they must sit out the game. Play continues until everyone is bored or only one person is left standing. Keep in mind that there’s no specified order to this game, so you don’t have to say the veggie name of the person next to you. Players can choose whoever they want for the next turn! For example, a given round may look like: Player 1 (Avocado): “Avocado, avocado, bok choy, bok choy.” Player 2 (Bok Choy): “Bok choy, bok choy, carrot, carrot.” Player 3 (Carrot): “Carrot, carrot, brussel sprout, brussel sprout.” Player 4 (Brussel Sprout): “Brussel sprout, brussel sprout, eggplant, eggplant.”"

[8] X Research source At their own leisure, the murderer may then “kill” other members of the group by winking at them. If the victim sees the murderer winking at them, they must pretend to die. Meanwhile, the detective should be working to figure out who the murderer is. If the detective is able to guess the murderer, then they win and a new detective is chosen. If everyone dies before the detective figures it out, then the murderer wins and becomes the next detective.

The players’ goal is to stump the guesser and prevent them from guessing the secret word. Once everyone has given their responses (e.g., “smelly,” “bony,” “tanned,” “dirty,” for secret word “feet”), the guesser must try to figure out the secret word.

The “wordmaster” (the person with the secret word) starts by sharing the first letter of their secret word. Each guesser then silently thinks of a word that begins with that letter and asks a question relevant to the word they’re thinking of. The goal of the guesser is to ask a question obscure enough that the wordmaster won’t know what they’re thinking of, but helpful enough that another guesser can guess what word they’re thinking of. [10] X Research source If the wordmaster knows the answer to the question , they can say “No, it’s not ____.” If they’re right, a new guesser can ask a question. If they’re wrong, the original guesser can give another clue to the word they’re thinking of. If another guesser knows the answer to the question , they can say “Contact!” Then, the initial question-asker and the guesser will simultaneously count down from 5 then say the word they’re thinking of. If they say the same word, this is a successful “contact.” Due to this contact, the wordmaster must then reveal the second letter of their word. Play continues until the target word is completely revealed or guessed by one of the players. An example start to Contact might go something like this: Wordmaster (W): The first letter is S. Guesser 1 (G1): Is this something that swims in a river? Guesser 2 (G2): Contact! G1 & G2: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, salmon! W: The second letter is W, so S-W… Guesser 3 (G3): Is this something that has a long neck? W: No, it’s not a swan. G2: Is this something that you wear around your house? W: No, it’s not a sweater.

      "title": "Mafia",
      "content": "Mafia Mafia is a pretty complex game that’s best played by adults and young adults—we’ll give you an overview, but you can see the complete rules, strategies, and variations here . First, designate a narrator—this individual will run the game but does not count as a “player.” If you’re the narrator, start the set up by writing the following roles on small slips of paper: “Mafia” (2 slips), “Doctor” (1), “Police” (1), “Villagers” (number of players minus 4). Randomly hand out these papers to the players, and remind them not to reveal what role they’ve been given. [11] X Research source The game begins with the night cycle, which begins with everyone closing their eyes. The narrator then says “Mafia, wake up.” The mafia players will open their eyes and silently agree on a victim through pointing and gesturing. The narrator then tells the mafia to go back to sleep and says “Doctor, wake up.” The doctor then silently points to someone they want to save (which could be themselves). If the doctor chose to save the same person that the mafia killed, that person will survive the night. Otherwise, nothing will happen to the person saved and the mafia’s victim will die. The narrator then tells the doctor to go back to sleep and says “Detective, wake up.” The detective silently points to someone they suspect to be mafia. The narrator will give a head nod or shake to indicate whether that person is or isn’t a mafia member. If the detective receives a yes, then they must try to convince the townspeople (the next day) that that person is a mafia member. The narrator then tells the detective to go to sleep and says “Everyone, wake up,” starting the day cycle. During the day cycle, the narrator dramatically tells the story of who was killed (or saved) during the night. Any killed players must stay silent for the remainder of the game. Players can then hold discussions about who they suspect to be mafia and begin to make accusations. If an accusation has been made against a player, then it must be seconded before being taken to a vote. If the majority of players vote guilty, the accused states whether they were mafia and is removed from the game. If the majority of players vote not guilty, accusations restart until one person is voted out and the night round begins again."

      "content": "Rob Whitehouse’s Alphabet Game Best played by three or more people, this game starts out by having two players simultaneously shout out a category and a letter. Then, all of the other players must try to quickly think of an item from the category with a starting letter as close to the shouted letter as possible—but that doesn’t start with the shouted letter itself. However, anything that comes earlier in the alphabet than the starting letter is considered “farther” away by two additional “spaces.” For instance, let’s say that the two starting players shouted out “European countries” and “C.” In this case, “Estonia” would be considered “closer” to the starting letter than someone who said “Bulgaria,” since “B” comes before “C” in the alphabet. Basically, you’re tacking on an extra space to any letters preceding the shouted letter. Let’s say that “Estonia” is counted as two spaces away from “C,” since “E” comes two spaces after “C” in the alphabet. “Bulgaria” is only one space away from “C” in the alphabet. But, since “B” comes before “C,” you must add on two spaces, making it three spaces away in the game—so “Estonia” is a better guess! “Cyprus” would also be a bad choice, since it starts with “C” and the goal is to choose a word that starts with the letter closest to “C” in the alphabet. Once one person has declared a word, they start to slowly count down (out loud) from 10-0. Everyone else has the time of this countdown to declare a letter that’s alphabetically closer—play continues until someone’s word can’t be beat."

The third player would say a new associated word (e.g., “carriage”). Play continues around the circle in this way—if a player repeats a word, hesitates, or says something that the group deems unrelated, they’re out of the game.
