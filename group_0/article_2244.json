      "content": "Ditch the athletic shoes. White athletic shoes (otherwise referred to as tennis shoes or sneakers) are stereotypically American. Any shoes that don't look like they were meant for exercise will suffice. If you do wear socks, make sure they're dark or match the color of your pants. Flip-flops are also very noticeable as American attire, unless you're in a country like Brazil where Havaianas reign, or Australia or New Zealand where the Brazilian flip-flops are also ubiquitous. In most countries, open-toed sandals (Chacos, Tevas and Keens) are borderline at best, and may be totally unacceptable. Shoes are always the safest bet in urban areas. However, these are quite acceptable for hiking and active outdoor pursuits, just as they are here. Also, Crocs, the popular foam clogs, may be ubiquitous in the US, but in most of the world are regarded as ridiculous in the extreme and are worn mostly by gardeners and the very young, if at all. Sneakers like K-Swiss, Vans or Adidas in a dark color with no or very subtle logos are much less conspicuous and are a good compromise if you are planning to do a lot of walking.

      "content": "Buy accessories at local stores, especially ones that you see the locals wearing, like scarves. Sometimes not wearing something could signal that you are a tourist. For example, in some countries, hats or scarves are worn by the majority, or most people wear neck scarves during the winter. Head scarves or coverings are required in some religious establishments. It would be wise to research this in advance and be prepared to take something with you if you plan to visit religious places. Wearing a headscarf incorrectly will signal that you are a tourist, and local people may be offended and feel that you are appropriating their customs. If you do not normally wear a headscarf, it may be better to only wear one when it is required. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid US brand name clothing with easily readable names (e.g. , Nike, Gap, Abercrombie, etc.). In fact, don't wear any slogans (like \"Virginia is for lovers\") as that will tie you to a specific place. Notoriously American brands are becoming more popular outside of the US due to globalization. However, it's still a good idea to stick to non-slogan clothing."

      "title": "Dress a little nicer than usual.",
      "content": "Dress a little nicer than usual. Casual dress is not as common outside the USA. You will fit in better in most places if you wear long pants or skirts and buttoned shirts or blouses rather than sneakers, sweatshirts, t-shirts, jeans, or shorts -- especially athletic shorts. Blue jeans are not acceptable in all situations. Instead, pack versatile \"casual Friday\" business attire. Shorts are best avoided by all adults, especially women, except for hiking and similar activities. In many countries, adults wearing shorts are seen as silly, uncouth, half-naked, or worse. Use your eyes to adapt yourself to the finer points of personal appearance and grooming. Look around and see whether people tuck their shirts in or leave them hanging out. Sometimes this differs for men and women in the same country. In hot weather where you're tempted to wear shorts, consider a lightweight long sleeve shirt and linen pants instead. They may be more appropriate and will help limit sun exposure."

      "title": "Dress appropriately for the local weather.",
      "content": "Dress appropriately for the local weather. Shorts and a t-shirt in cool climates (or wintertime) are a clear sign that you are not in touch with the local weather. Many Americans also tend to wear technical outdoor gear, such as down jackets and ski jackets, as casual winter outerwear. This is not common in most countries, even very cold ones. More formal coats of wool, fur, or leather are de rigueur. If you have one or are willing to buy one, bring it."

      "content": "Camouflage. What colors do the locals wear? Mostly black and other neutral shades, like in London, or bright, bold colors like in the Caribbean? Wear colors that you see the locals wearing. Folks in Paris, London, and other European capitals tend to wear lots of black, and as a tourist, you tend to blend in if youâ€™re wearing it, too. Your hot pink sweater vest or bright blue collared shirt might be fashionable in Minneapolis, but it won't fly in Budapest. In tropical climes, keep in mind that local modes of dress may still be less casual than you expect - so a t-shirt and loud board shorts may still look silly. Check travel forums and photos online to get a feel for what the locals wear. In SE Asia any shirt with a collar is preferable to a T shirt. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Leave your baseball hats, backpack, fanny pack and water bottles at home. Baseball caps and fanny packs scream \"American!\" Besides,\"fanny\" means something entirely different in some places, not to mention how unsafe these packs are. It's best to not carry bags of any kind, with your personal effects concealed about your person in pockets and on lanyards. A purse or tote bag, bought locally, may also work. If you are worried about getting sun in your eyes then wear sunglasses instead of a baseball cap."

And most important, they don't pull the socks up to their knees like football players. In many countries, socks are never worn with shorts at all. If you plan to walk a lot where it's warm (like Spain) and want to wear shorts and socks, choose short socks that aren't visible above the tops of your shoes. [5] X Research source"

While they may dry quickly and offer appealing functionality, avoid these unless you're trekking, rafting, or otherwise truly out in the wilderness. If you're simply sightseeing in a developed area with plenty of residents, it's almost guaranteed that the residents will find you comical at best and be offended at worst. Nothing will set you apart faster. Thankfully, it is possible to obtain clothing that offers the technical advantages of quick-dry nylon in styles that are unobtrusive."

Use the typical condiments in your host country, and if you don't like them or can't bear to eat without your American condiments, bring your own. Take small packets with you to use rather than insisting that the restaurant supply you with it."

Of course, if you want ice in your drink because that's how you prefer it and you're paying for it, you're perfectly entitled to ask for it, but the point of this article is to help you avoid being labeled as an American, and requesting ice is a definite giveaway. What's more, be warned the tap water of some other countries isn't as safe as the water back home. Your beverage may be made with filtered or sterilized water, but often the ice is not. You can get a bad case of food poisoning from drinking safe bottled beverages with unsafe ice. [7] X Research source"

Many American tourists visit US chain restaurants for every meal, afraid to dabble in the local cuisine, but becoming a regular at the local McDonald's and Pizza Hut will tip everyone off that you're an American really quickly. You'll also deprive yourself of a fantastic window into the local culture. Don't be scared: if your host is eating it, it won't harm you. Let your host or waitress advise you about local specialties.

If you are right-handed, eat with the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right. Europeans cut each bite individually with the knife in the right hand and the fork in the left hand, and rest their arms midway between wrist and elbow. The elbow should stay off the table. Also, don't rest your arm in between yourself and your plate. This is considered as rude in some countries. In some Asian nations chopsticks . It might be more appropriate than a knife and fork."

      "content": "Keep the map out of sight. Pulling out and looking at your map in a public space is a no-no. Study it before you leave your hotel, and if you do need to consult your map, step into a store or any other less public place. Have the maps pre-folded so they may be easily accessed and read. The same goes for other items: If you must use a dictionary to translate a sign or menu, be discreet. For example, copy down the words of the sign and move aside to a less public place to work out the translation. Or copy some basic words in a notebook which you can easily pull out at dinner. If you must consult a guidebook, keep it wrapped in a newspaper or novel. You may want to wrap the cover in brown paper before leaving home. You may wish to remove the pages detailing the day's destinations from your guidebook ahead of time, staple or paperclip them, and simply carry them as a sheaf of pages. Don't carry US newspapers, magazines or books in plain view. Pick up a local/regional magazine or the local newspaper. Just like in the US, most tourist friendly museums have literature in multiple languages. Look for the UK flag on them instead of an American flag."

Be careful about physical contact. Get an idea of what is acceptable, and mind local customs, such as not touching the head or feet in most of South Asia. Don't get freaked out by the person in line behind you being very close, and if you leave too much room between you and the person in front of you, expect someone to step in to the space."

Nobody will mind if your accent is not perfect; the fact that you've been willing to speak their language, even when you could well have spoken yours, is a thing that many people appreciate in tourists. While you are at it, learn the words for some foods that you like, and the ones that you don't like. It makes eating out much less scary."

In India the handshake is becoming common, but you must greet the eldest or most important person present first and work your way down, and shaking a woman's hand may be unacceptable.
