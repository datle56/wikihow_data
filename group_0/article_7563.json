      "content": "Omit a Works Cited entry for the Declaration of Independence. Because the Declaration of Independence is a well-known work, MLA does not require a Works Cited entry. You only have to use an in-text citation. [1] X Research source If you are comparing drafts of the Declaration of Independence, on the other hand, you would include a Works Cited entry for each document you compared. In that case, you would use the format for an unpublished document or a manuscript."

      "content": "Use the institutional author and year after your first mention. Even though technically Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, MLA style considers the United States to be the author. In your first mention of the Declaration in your paper, use the abbreviation \"US\" along with the year the Declaration was published. Place this information in a parenthetical at the end of the first sentence in which you paraphrase or quote from the Declaration. Place the sentence's closing punctuation outside the closing parenthesis. [2] X Research source For example, you might write \"The Declaration of Independence asserted that the British monarch was unfit to govern the American people (US 1776).\""

      "content": "Leave out the parenthetical citation for subsequent mentions. MLA style only requires a parenthetical citation the first time you quote or paraphrase the Declaration of Independence. If you continue to quote or paraphrase it later on in your paper, no citation is required at all. However, you want to make sure you're letting your readers know that you're quoting or paraphrasing from the Declaration. [3] X Research source Always enclose any quoted material in quotation marks and mention the name of the Declaration in any sentence where you quote or paraphrase from it."
