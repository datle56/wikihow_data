[1] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Ask open-ended questions that give you more detail—along with more questions to ask. Ask questions that seek an answer out in the greater unknown (the \"whys\" and the \"what ifs\") rather than ones that simply consolidate basic information (the \"whos\" and the \"whats\"). [2] X Research source For example, if someone says \"The Great Gatsby is the Great American Novel,\" you might ask them why they believe that. Since it's considered so fundamentally American, you might also ask what if it were set in another country. On a personal level, asking questions is essential for building relationships because it tells people that you value them and are interested in what they have to say. [3] X Research source Asking questions can help you encourage children to be more curious as well. When a child asks you something, ask them what they think first—then tell them the answer.

Increase your curiosity by seeking out people who seem very different from you and asking them about their experiences. Through polite, open-minded conversation you can learn a lot about how other people think and feel about the world around them. [5] X Research source You can also expose yourself to different ideas and perspectives by reading books, watching films or videos, and listening to music. All art gives you access to the way someone else sees and understands the world. Challenge yourself to change your own perspective as well. This can be as simple as sitting somewhere different and observing how your perspective on your surroundings shift. Reader Poll: We asked 695 wikiHow readers and 55% of them said that their preferred way to expand their knowledge is by reading books and articles on new subjects . [Take Poll]"

When you listen actively , you'll find that you can more easily identify holes where you're lacking information so you know what questions to ask. And the questions you ask will open new pathways of discovery.

[7] X Research source Start with things that you're already interested in, then follow the rabbit hole wherever it leads, letting only your curiosity be your guide. Being interested in something acts as something like a neurological signal in your brain that can take you to some amazing places if you're willing to simply let go and follow your interest.

[10] X Research source Keep a small notebook with you at all times to jot down questions and thoughts you have. Within these notes, you'll find all sorts of paths to engage your curiosity. For example, while on a walk, you might be inspired by the connection that you seem to feel with the birds in the trees above you. Writing a note about it could inspire a story, a poem, or a song. It could also spur you to research communication between people and birds. Writing by hand also activates your whole brain, so it can help prevent cognitive decline—just like curiosity does.

Even places you visit frequently can become more interesting if you look at them from a different angle or focus on small details you haven't really paid attention to before.

Looking up things all the time is really inefficient and doesn't allow you to progress. But if you already have that information memorized, it can serve as a jumping-off point for you to go in all sorts of different directions. [12] X Research source Having lots of facts and information memorized also boosts your curiosity because it allows you to draw more connections between things and think of different ways of looking at problems."

[13] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source Another aspect of this is admitting when you don't know something. You might feel ashamed or embarrassed that you don't know something you think you should, but just remember that everybody has to learn everything at some point. Being curious requires you to be flexible and open-minded—but before that you have to be willing to admit that you don't know everything and you aren't right about everything."

If you're staying well within your comfort zone, you're not exploring anything new or imagining any other ways of doing things. It's easy for the comfort zone to become an entrenched rut if you don't make a concerted effort to break out of it on a regular basis. [17] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For example, if you've always avoided leading your book club because you have a fear of public speaking, you might volunteer to lead the session about one of your favorite books. Your confidence in the material will make it easier to overcome your fear. This also means changing up your routine. For example, you might take a different route to work, get your morning coffee at a different café, or brush your teeth with your non-dominant hand.

That's why, if you want to be curious, it's important to venture widely, exposing yourself to everything and following up on anything that piques your interest. [23] X Research source \"Without judgment\" means that you don't tell yourself that something is \"out of your wheelhouse\" or \"not your area.\" You also don't tell yourself that it's silly or pointless to research something you're interested in.

Curiosity is something that sort of lights your neural network up and activates your whole brain to get involved. This does wonderful things for the health of your brain and could even possibly delay the onset of diseases that deteriorate the brain, such as dementia. [29] X Research source Boosting your brain health can in turn benefit your overall physical health because you're more inclined to take care of yourself and seek medical assistance when something seems off. For example, if you feel a pain in your leg, you might get curious as to what's causing it. Internet research leads you to see a doctor who confirms the problem and gets you treatment. If you weren't curious, though, you might just shrug it off as nothing and ignore it until it got so bad that you couldn't."

In the example, complacency causes a lack of curiosity that keeps you from studying more and potentially making a much better grade in the course.
