      "title": "Park your car in a well-ventilated area.",
      "content": "Park your car in a well-ventilated area. When you work on a car battery, it’s important to do so outside or in a well-ventilated carport. Car batteries release hydrogen gas, which can cause an explosion if it comes into contact with a spark in an enclosed space. Never smoke while working on a car battery. Make sure the ignition is off, since having your car on can also increase the risk of sparks or explosions."

      "title": "Open the hood of the car",
      "content": "Open the hood of the car to access the battery. Open the driver’s side door of your car and find the hood latch or button. It may be located on or under the dashboard of your car. Pull the latch or press the button to pop the hood. Use the metal bar located inside the engine compartment to prop open your hood. Car batteries are typically easy to spot. They are rectangular boxes, often black, and usually with a red cap over one of the terminals. Many of them feature prominent yellow or white warning labels. While most car batteries are located under the hood, some models have them in other locations, such as in the trunk or under the back seat. If you can’t find your battery easily, consult the owner’s manual for your car. It's a good idea to let your vehicle cool down before you do this—if the engine's been running recently, you could burn yourself if you touch something hot. Also, if the battery is hot, there could be a buildup of gas, and that could potentially cause an explosion.

      "title": "Disconnect",
      "content": "Disconnect the negative battery terminal. Locate the negative terminal on your battery, which typically has a black cap and a “-” or “NEG” written on it. Lift the plastic cap to expose the terminal. Use a wrench to loosen the nut on the cable clamp and a terminal spreader to open up the cable terminals, if necessary. Terminal spreaders are particularly helpful for overly tightened or stubborn terminal clamps. [5] X Research source If there’s a lot of corrosive buildup, it might take some effort to work the cable connecter loose after you loosen the bolt. It can be helpful to pry it loose with a flathead screwdriver or prying tool. [6] X Research source Always disconnect the negative cable, or ground clamp, first. This will prevent a dangerous short circuit. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour half of your baking soda solution over the battery posts. When you’ve poured about half the mixture onto the posts, set the rest aside so you can use it to clean the terminals. [11] X Research source If there’s a lot of corrosive buildup, let the mixture sit for at least 5 minutes before you try to scrub it off. Some automotive experts recommend dipping a brush into the baking soda mixture and using that to scrub the battery, rather than pouring the mixture directly onto the battery. [12] X Expert Source Duston Maynes Automotive Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 10 June 2021. Alternatively, you can remove the battery before cleaning it. This will allow you to clean up any corrosion that’s gotten onto other parts of the battery or into the battery box.
