      "content": "Skinwalkers are evil shapeshifters who can transform into animals. According to Native American folklore and mythology, skinwalkers are able to disguise themselves as animals, such as coyotes, wolves, bears, and foxes. When they assume the forms of these animals, they also take on the animal's physical abilities, which allows them to travel quickly from place to place or overpower victims. Because these supernatural beings commit their malevolent acts in their disguised animal form, their human identity can avoid suspicion and hide in plain sight. [1] X Research source It was thought that skinwalkers carried animal pelts around with them, which is what allowed them to take the animal’s shape (i.e. wear their skin). [2] X Research source Skinwalkers featured in the folklore of multiple western Native American tribes, but they were especially prominent in Navajo culture and mythology. [3] X Research source According to Navajo folklore, people gained the supernatural power to become a skinwalker after doing something heinous, like murdering a close relative or robbing a grave. After acquiring their abilities, skinwalkers were considered practitioners of witchcraft. In Native culture, witches were more commonly male, not female. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "The existence of skinwalkers has not been definitively proven. However, many Native and non-Native people believe that skinwalkers are real, and some people have even reported sightings of these supernatural creatures. As a result, the existence or non-existence of skinwalkers has become a hot topic of debate among believers and skeptics, similar to debates over the existence of things like aliens or UFOs."

      "title": "Skinwalker Ranch is said to be a center of supernatural activity.",
      "content": "Skinwalker Ranch is said to be a center of supernatural activity. Located in northeastern Utah on the border of the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation, Skinwalker Ranch is a property where many people have reported strange and chilling occurrences, such as crop circles, UFOs, unexplained mutilation of cattle, and skinwalker sightings. [5] X Research source Although these claims have not been definitively or scientifically verified, they have occurred on the property so frequently that many authors, researchers, and scientists have traveled to the ranch to investigate them. In one famous instance in 1997, biochemist Colm Kelleher reported seeing a large humanoid creature (allegedly a skinwalker) spying on his research team from a tree. The incident was recorded in the book Hunt for the Skinwalker , which was based on the research team’s surveillance of the ranch. Investigations into the paranormal occurrences at Skinwalker Ranch have led to several pieces of media, such as the popular History Channel documentary, The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch.

      "content": "Skinwalkers are a common topic in popular media. From the 2002 movie Skinwalkers (based on the 1986 novel of the same name) to the History Channel documentary The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch , it’s clear that skinwalkers have captured the public’s imagination. [7] X Research source In 2021, skinwalkers even became a popular topic on TikTok, with users posting viral videos about the mysterious supernatural figure. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "When depicting skinwalkers, it’s important to center Native voices.",
      "content": "When depicting skinwalkers, it’s important to center Native voices. Skinwalkers aren’t magical, supernatural beings from a fantasy book or movie—they’re actually significant figures in Navajo history and culture. Because of this, it’s important to prioritize Native perspectives and do adequate research when discussing or depicting them. When non-Native people misunderstand the history of skinwalkers or engage with the legend in a disrespectful way, this would fall into the category of cultural appropriation, rather than cultural appreciation. [9] X Research source For example, when author J.K. Rowling wrote about skinwalkers in a piece called “Magic in North America” for her Pottermore website, many criticized her for taking the legend of skinwalkers and editing it to fit her needs, with little regard for their cultural importance. After the piece was published, some members of Native communities commented on Rowling’s lack of research and understanding of the topic, as well as her refusal to respond after she was called out by critics on social media.

      "content": "The existence of skinwalkers can’t be proven, but many people believe in them. Skinwalkers play an important role in Navajo culture, history, and folklore, and in this way, they’re very much real. However, there is no definitive scientific evidence of a shape-shifting figure like the skinwalker existing. As a result, the existence or non-existence of skinwalkers is essentially a matter of cultural belief and personal opinion."
