      "content": "Ignore media depictions of happy couples. Part of the reason some single people may feel unhappy is the constant media depictions reinforcing the idea that we need to be in a relationship to be happy. Try your best to remind yourself that this isn't true. It’s absolutely possible to feel fulfilled as a single person. The decision of whether or not to be in a relationship is a deeply personal one, and some people actually feel happier when they’re single. [18] X Research source Avoid any social media posts, romantic comedies, or magazines that reinforce the idea that being single is bleak and being in a relationship is bliss. Instead, focus on how you’re actually feeling. Do you enjoy the freedom of the single life? Are you happy to have extra time to follow your own interests? Remind yourself that media depictions of singleness are not always relatable or accurate either. For example, depictions of single women may be troubling because they are often idealized (a superwoman who has it all) or villainous (a sad lonely woman who has nothing). Neither of these depictions are realistic, so do your best to recognize them as false representations of what it’s like to be single. [19] X Research source"
