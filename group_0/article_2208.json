      "title": "Don't use bad words or words similar to bad words, such as mince oaths or abbreviated forms of curse words.",
      "content": "Don't use bad words or words similar to bad words, such as mince oaths or abbreviated forms of curse words. Many Roblox players use cuss words, but keep in mind that children as young as three or four play Roblox. The children that can read might be able to pick up on the words you use and can register them in their minds. If you find yourself about to curse, quickly delete the curse words so that you don't get in trouble."

    {
      "title": "Don't be inappropriate.",
      "content": "Don't be inappropriate. Don't talk about drugs, immoral actions, gangs, cursing, inappropriate songs, and any other topics that are crude. If you do so, some players can find out and can report you for this talk. Remember that Roblox can read the chat log for proof."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't tell other people you're an admin (administrator).",
      "content": "Don't tell other people you're an admin (administrator). If you tell everyone that you're an admin, they will probably not believe you. If you have read Roblox's safety rules, they say that if anyone claims to say they're the administrator when they aren't, players will have to report them and Roblox will check the bad behavior out. However, it may not apply to anyone with admin scripts used for a specific game."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do not hack the game.",
      "content": "Do not hack the game. Similarly, do not exploit bugs on the website that give you unfair advantages on purpose and claiming you're the game's admin. Nobody wants to be on the server with a hacker, especially if you're disrupting everyone's game by having players constantly resetting against their will."

    {
      "title": "Don't ask for passwords or give false hope to other players about getting Robux.",
      "content": "Don't ask for passwords or give false hope to other players about getting Robux. Some players might say things such as, \"Builderman gave me a hack to give me 9999999 robux, copy and paste this on 8 hats, log in and log out and you'll get the robux.\" It's not true, though; how could you get Robux just for copying, pasting, logging in, and then logging out? If you do that, you'll make yourself look like a complete fool!"

    {
      "title": "Don't online date.",
      "content": "Don't online date. While this may seem harmless, it really isn't. For starters, remember that kids can be reading your conversations on the main chat and might think that online dating is okay to do. Another thing to consider is that people you might try to online date with can really be someone else. You might be online dating with a forty-year-old man whose Roblox character is dressed as a teenage girl. The Roblox rules also prohibit online dating; so you really don't want to be violating those rules."

    {
      "title": "Don't spam in games.",
      "content": "Don't spam in games. It can be funny to repeat something silly or random over and over in the chat, but this becomes annoying over time."

    {
      "title": "Don't create games that are inappropriate or encourage vile actions, such as murder, drugs, or immoral actions.",
      "content": "Don't create games that are inappropriate or encourage vile actions, such as murder, drugs, or immoral actions. You need to constantly remember that children play Roblox, and they don't need to be clicking on games that they think are fine to play when their parents aren't around. Some kids who can't even read yet play Roblox, and they might try out games that seem appealing to them but are actually completely wrong for them to be trying out. If you make a game about inappropriate actions, you will have a 98% chance that your game will be taken down and you will be either warned or banned once the Roblox staff receives a complaint from a user about your game and has been reviewed by them. Remember, kids play Roblox which they think it’s okay to play the game because they think it’s appealing to them, but actually, it’s appalling that some like 4 or 3 year olds might play."

      "content": "Don't be unkind in a game. Even if someone else starts a fight, don't pick it up. Doing so might encourage other players to report the other player and you for arguing. If this person keeps arguing with you even if you've made it clear that you're not wanting to fight with them, simply report the player and put in a command to mute the player (/mute [insert player's username])."
