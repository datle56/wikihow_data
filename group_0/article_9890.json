      "title": "Rinse the fish roe in a bowl of fresh water.",
      "content": "Rinse the fish roe in a bowl of fresh water. Fill a clean bowl with cool water and place the fish roe in it. Use your fingers to move the water around the roe, cleaning it super thoroughly. [1] X Research source Use white perch roe for a great taste in this recipe. Wash your hands before and after handling the roe. Set the roe aside on a plate once it's clean."

      "title": "Combine the milk, salt, and pepper together in a dish.",
      "content": "Combine the milk, salt, and pepper together in a dish. Use a shallow bowl or baking dish to hold the ingredients. Pour 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of milk into the dish as well as a few sprinkles of salt and pepper, depending on your tastes. Stir the ingredients together with a spoon so they’re well combined. [2] X Research source If you're not sure how much salt and pepper you'd like on your roe, start with a small amount. You can always add more after the fish eggs are cooked."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix cornmeal and flour together in a separate dish.",
      "content": "Mix cornmeal and flour together in a separate dish. Use a dish that’s a little bit smaller than the first dish you used. Pour 1/2 cup (20 grams) of cornmeal and 2 tablespoons (16 grams) of flour into the dish and stir them together with a spoon so the dry ingredients are thoroughly mixed. [3] X Research source It's also okay to use a whisk or fork to combine the ingredients."

    {
      "title": "Coat the roe in the milk mixture and then the cornmeal mixture.",
      "content": "Coat the roe in the milk mixture and then the cornmeal mixture. Place the roe in the milk mixture and thoroughly coat it before you dip it into the cornmeal and flour mixture. Make sure the cornmeal mixture is coating the roe on all sides for the best taste. [4] X Research source Coating the roe in the milk mixture thoroughly is important so the cornmeal mixture will stick to it."

    {
      "title": "Place the roe in an oiled skillet set on medium-high heat.",
      "content": "Place the roe in an oiled skillet set on medium-high heat. Sprinkle olive oil into a large skillet so the pan is evenly coated in a light layer. Set your burner to medium-high heat and wait for the skillet to heat up before placing the roe on it. [5] X Research source Spread the roe out evenly on the skillet so they cook thoroughly."

    {
      "title": "Cook the roe for 2-3 minutes on each side so they’re golden brown.",
      "content": "Cook the roe for 2-3 minutes on each side so they’re golden brown. Let the roe fry in the skillet for 2-3 minutes before using a slotted spoon or spatula to flip each one over. Wait another 2-3 minutes for this side to cook before checking the roe. When the sides are golden brown and slightly crispy, it’s done. [6] X Research source It’s a good idea to cover the pan when the roe is frying because the fish eggs tend to sizzle and pop. Set a timer for each side so they're cooked evenly."

    {
      "title": "Set the fish roe on a paper towel to let them drain.",
      "content": "Set the fish roe on a paper towel to let them drain. Once the roe is done frying, move each one to a paper towel-lined plate. Let them sit on the plate while you finish the rest of the cooking so the excess oil is absorbed. [7] X Research source Cover the roe with an additional paper towel on top to help trap the heat."

      "content": "Sprinkle garlic into the skillet and cook for a minute before adding lemon juice. Keep the onions in the skillet and add in 1 tablespoon (9 grams) of garlic, mixing it with a wooden spoon for a minute so the garlic can cook.

Continue letting the roe cook for 5-8 more minutes until they're cooked through and opaque. [16] X Research source You'll know the roe is done when it changes color and is no longer transparent.
