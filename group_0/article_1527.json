      "content": "Apply primer or a neutral matte eyeshadow on your upper eyelid. Primer helps control oil to keep your eye makeup from running or fading. Use your finger to lightly blend the primer or concealer across your eyelid and let it dry for about 10 seconds. Apply a matte eyeshadow in a neutral color to create a canvas for your eyeliner by evening out your skin tone. [1] X Research source Use a matte, skin-toned cream eyeshadow as your base for more even application of your eyeliner. Set your cream eyeshadow with powder eyeshadow or translucent powder , or it may smudge or crease throughout the day. If you need to, wash your face before putting any makeup on. A clean face helps reduce the chances that you will accidentally get bacteria in your eye, which can cause infection. Apply foundation before you put on your eyeliner to form a base for your makeup and help keep your eyeliner from running or fading."

      "content": "Hold the outer corner of your eye and draw a thin line near your lashes. This helps you apply your eyeliner evenly for a more natural look. “Tilt your head slightly back to make sure you apply [the eyeliner] really close to the lash line,” recommends Makeup artist Janet Miranda. [2] X Expert Source Janet Miranda Professional Hair Stylist & Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 11 February 2021. Start at the outside corner of your eye and keep your line as thin as possible to start. Try to deposit the least amount of pigment on the inner corners of your eye. [3] X Research source Avoid tugging the lash line too much as this can smear the liner. It’s also bad for the delicate skin around your eyes. Some makeup artists suggest making dots or dashes along your lash line and then connecting them if you aren't steady with drawing a continuous line. Make sure you have good lighting and rest your elbow on a flat surface to steady your hand and ensure even application. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Draw a line on your lower lids starting at the outer corner.",
      "content": "Draw a line on your lower lids starting at the outer corner. Slowly and gently draw a thin line from the outer corner to the inner corner. The eyeliner on your lower lid should be much softer than on your upper lid, or else it may look harsh. A good rule of thumb is that it should be one third the size of the line on your upper lid (although some makeup artists feel it’s fine to line the entire lower lid). [5] X Research source Your eyes will look larger if you only line the outer two thirds of your eyelid instead of going all the way to the inner corner."

      "title": "Connect the lines only on the outside corner of your eyes.",
      "content": "Connect the lines only on the outside corner of your eyes. Use the tip of your eyeliner pencil to join your upper and lower lines. Be careful not to apply too much eyeliner in the corner, which might smudge. Use short, light strokes and go over the line a second time to add intensity. [6] X Research source Avoid a complete circle of eyeliner around your eyes, which can look harsh and smear easily from your tears. Make the same size lines on the other eye so that your eyes will match. Refer back to your first eye as you apply the eyeliner so the finished look will be symmetrical."

      "content": "Soften the lines on your upper and lower lids. This gives your liner a softer look with a natural, lived in appearance. Use a brush, cotton swab, or even your finger to slightly smudge your eyeliner. Just remember to use a light touch to avoid removing too much pigment. [7] X Research source If you smudge your eyeliner a little too much, apply some more as close to the base of your lashes as possible to give your look more intensity. Another option for a softer look is to apply brown eyeshadow over the liner on your lower lid using a small, tapered brush. This works particularly well to soften black liner."

      "content": "Extend the upper eyeliner line to make a wing (optional). Place the point of your eyeliner pencil at the outer corner. Looking in a mirror, visualize a line that moves up and away from the eye diagonally as if you are extending the lower lash line. Start at the end of your upper lash line and sketch a thin diagonal wing along the line you visualized. [8] X Research source With your eyelid closed, draw a straight diagonal line from the very tip of the wing down to the middle of your upper lash line. Then, fill in the outline to make your eyeliner wing . Makeup artist Alicia D’Angelo recommends, “Try sketching out some different wings with an angled brush and a light toned eyeshadow first so you can see the shape without the commitment.” [9] X Expert Source Alicia D'Angelo Makeup Artist & Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 10 April 2020. If you’re having trouble visualizing the line, place a small piece of clear tape along the lower lash line to create a guide. Make light dots to mark the ends of the wings for both eyes. Check them in the mirror to make sure they’re even before continuing."

      "content": "Correct any mistakes with a cotton swab. It can be tricky to apply your eyeliner the same way on both sides. Compare your eyes to make sure they look the same. If you made any mistakes in your application, go back and correct them with a little eye makeup remover and a cotton swab. A brush can also help blend out mistakes, depending on how serious they are. You can also use a little concealer on a cotton swab to correct mistakes, which helps you avoid removing too much of your work. [10] X Research source If you’re having trouble getting a smooth line, heat the pencil up with a hair dryer to make the application a little smoother."

      "content": "Finish your eye look with eyeshadow and mascara. Use a thin coat of powder eye shadow in a similar color to your eyeliner to seal your eyeliner look. This will also give your eyes a little more of a “pop” effect. [11] X Research source Properly sealing your eyeliner will ensure that it lasts for a long time and won’t run. Apply a coat of mascara to your eyelashes to enhance your eyes even further. Make sure to apply mascara only after you've applied all of your eye makeup, including your eyeliner. “A nude eyeliner on the bottom waterline will give the eyes a doll-like appearance,” D’Angelo advises.

The right eyeliner application has the power to make your eyes look larger, enhance their shape, and help you look more alert and awake. Here are tips on how to make your eyes look their very best no matter what their shape. [13] X Research source Hooded: These eyes have more lid above the crease so there’s a “hood” over the lower part of the lid. Tightline your eyes by keeping your liner thin and close to the lash line. Almond: These eyes have a shape similar to an almond. Accentuate your eye shape with a thin line in the upper lids with a subtle wing on the outer corners. Round: A rounded eye shape looks best with softly smudged eyeliner all along the upper and lower lash lines. Monolid: A monolid eye doesn’t have an eyelid crease. Elongate and define your eye with a thin line on the upper lids that wings out in a medium cat eye . Close-set: Close-set eyes are closer together than the average eye shape. Try wings on the outer corners and short, downward-pointed wings in the inner corners to create more “space” between your eyes. Wide-set: These eyes appear to be spaced further apart than average. Make thin lines along the upper lashes and gradually make them thicker towards the inner corners of your eyes. Deep-set: These eyes look like they’re set further back in the eye socket. Make your eyes pop with a darker eyeliner shade along the upper lash line that’s softly smudged."

      "content": "Use a color that enhances your eye color or gives you a dramatic look. Pencil eyeliners come in a broad range of colors. A good rule of thumb is to apply neutral shades like brown, taupe, or gray for a more natural look. Brighter colors like electric blue, orange, or emerald green create more dramatic looks. Really make your eyes pop by using eyeliner shades that enhance your eye color, such as: Blue eyes: “Using cooler tones like grey, silver, or shades of blue will bring out the variety of shades in the eye color,” advises D’Angelo. Try warm browns and golds for a more natural look. [14] X Expert Source Alicia D'Angelo Makeup Artist & Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 10 April 2020. Green eyes: Make green eyes pop with burgundy, rust, or plum shades. [15] X Research source Hazel eyes: Use a metallic bronze, gold, or copper shade to enhance hazel eyes. [16] X Research source Hazel eyes are a combination of brown, green, and gold, so shades that flatter brown and green eyes can also work for you. Brown eyes: Try midnight blue, deep purple, or charcoal gray to line brown eyes. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose powder-based or kohl pencils for less intense color.",
      "content": "Choose powder-based or kohl pencils for less intense color. They're also a good option if you want to smudge the eyeliner for a “smoky eye” effect. Make the color more dramatic by wetting the tip before you apply the eyeliner. These powder and kohl pencil eyeliners are very easy to use and great for beginners. [18] X Research source It’s also very easy to clean up any mistakes with these types of eyeliners. Sharpen the tip regularly or before every use to get the best results. These may not be the best option for cat eye looks that require an ultra thin line. Powder-based and kohl pencils can dry out, so always cap them after use."

      "content": "Try easy-to-use gel-based pencils for a smoother application. Traditionally, gel liners were only available in a pot and had to be applied with a brush. They tended to be a bit more forgiving than liquid liners, but could be tricky to apply for beginners. However, companies have started offering a gel pencil eyeliner that combines the color payoff and durability with an easier application method. [19] X Research source If you want to try applying gel eyeliner with a brush , stroke an angled brush across the tip of a warm gel pencil and then draw it across your upper eyelid. These pencils apply a rich and intense color and are a good choice for winged or cat eye looks. Like powder pencils, gel eyeliners can harden if you forget to put on the cap."

      "content": "Get a more dramatic look with liquid eyeliner pens. Liquid liners tend to be the most challenging type of eyeliner for beginners. However, many liquid liners come in pen form (though it more closely resembles a felt marker), making application a little easier. Makeup artist Cassandra McClure recommends using liquid eyeliner if you have oily skin. “Anything that's powder or in a pencil tends to…wear off faster.” [20] X Expert Source Cassandra McClure Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 7 March 2019. McClure adds, “Liquid eyeliner is going to be your best bet to keep your eyeliner intact all day long.” [21] X Expert Source Cassandra McClure Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 7 March 2019. Tips range from very thin to thick depending on how intense you want the look or if you want to apply a cat-eye or winged look. Liquid liner pens also come with a brush tip if you like the convenience of a pencil and the versatility of a brush. Mistakes are very visible and difficult to correct because of the deep color, so you must have a steady hand during application."

Most companies offer different eyeliner formulas for different needs, including sensitive eyes and organic, animal-friendly products. “A twist up [eyeliner] is usually a softer formula, which will glide on more easily and be able to smudge,” says D’Angelo. [22] X Expert Source Alicia D'Angelo Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 10 April 2020. She adds that pencils you sharpen typically have a drier formula, which can require a bit more pressure to apply but achieve a more perfect line or wing. [23] X Expert Source Alicia D'Angelo Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 10 April 2020. “People who…are a little bit more oily, their eyeliner tends to travel. So doing something more waterproof would be better for them,” says Miranda. [24] X Expert Source Janet Miranda Professional Hair Stylist & Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 11 February 2021. If you have sensitive eyes or wear contact lenses, choose a non-allergenic (also called hypoallergenic) eyeliner.
