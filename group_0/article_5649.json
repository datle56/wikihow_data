Go to source Find a quiet, comfortable place in which the two of you can sit without distractions. Either sit up straight with a cushion or use a chair for support. Relax your shoulders and rest your hands on your thighs. Both of you should place one hand on your chest and one on your abdomen. Breathe in deeply through your nose for 4 to 8 counts. The hand on your abdomen should expand with your belly. Hold the breath briefly, for 1 to 2 counts. Then, release the air out through your mouth, watching your hand fall with your belly, for the same number of counts as the inhale. The hand on your chest should move very little. Repeat the inhale-exhale process for 5 to 10 min, or until she becomes more relaxed."

Go to source Another technique you can try to get her to loosen up and relax is progressive muscle relaxation. This exercise helps you to notice where you are holding tension in your body and know what relaxation feels like in these tense areas. Grab comfortable seats in chairs or on the sofa. Start with a few minutes of deep breathing to stimulate calm. Start at your feet and move up. Notice how your feet feel. Take several seconds to become aware of this feeling. Then, gradually contract the muscles in your feet until they are extremely tense. Hold for 10 counts. Release the tension, taking note of how it simply melts away. Stay in this state for about 10 counts, continuing to breathe deeply. Move slowly up through the body contracting and releasing each muscle group."

The intensity of working out may not immediately come to mind when thinking of way to help calm someone down, but physical activity is a terrific way to relieve stress and promote a positive mood.

Then, begin visualizing a place that makes each of you feel safe or happy, such as grandma's house, the local water hole, or an exotic beach. Use at least three of your senses to envision this place. Don't just stop at how it looks in your mind. Also, bring to mind how it smells (e.g. freshly baked cookies or coconut) or tastes (e.g. chocolate chips or salty air). Move deeper and deeper into a state of relaxation as you take in the sensations and surroundings of your special place."

Although calming her down may, indeed, be your focus, those two words actually have the power to rile her up even more. In addition, saying this can make her think you are minimizing or dismissing her feelings. Instead, try something like this: \"I can see you're upset/frustrated/anxious...what can I do?\" or \"I can't make out what you're saying. Let's take a few deep breaths and start over\"."

Active listening involves four key principles: [11] X Trustworthy Source US Department of State Official website of the U.S. Department of State Go to source Seek to understand before being understood. You must collect information about what she is saying before you can adequately provide a response to her. Be non-judgmental. Refrain from expressing any judgment about her circumstances. Demonstrate unconditional positive regard and emotional intelligence. You can be with, talk to and provide support without necessarily agreeing with everything she says. Provide undivided attention. Make eye contact within a ratio that feels comfortable to you, typically about 70% of the time you're listening (about 50% when you're speaking).

Clearly define the problem. Then, ask her ideally what she would like the end result to be. Once you've identified her goals, then outline a list of possible solutions that can meet them. Go over each solution aloud and consider the pros and cons of each. Allow her to make the final decision. Remember, you are there to be a source of support, not to take over her life. If her problem is too big for you to help with alone, offer to go with her to talk to her parents, another adult, the school counselor, or a professional counselor."
