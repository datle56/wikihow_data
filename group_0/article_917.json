      "content": "The mail carrier doesn’t think the recipient lives at the address. When the US Postal Service (USPS) tracking system shows the “Addressee Unknown” status, it means the mail carrier couldn’t confirm the person listed on the package lives at said address. This status is about the person’s name on the package, not the address. [1] X Research source A mail carrier has the authority to withhold mail for various reasons, including a blocked mailbox, hazardous conditions, and a full mailbox."

      "content": "Wait to see if the package is delivered the next business day. If the mail carrier mistakenly or improperly assigned an “Addressee Unknown” status to your package, they will most likely deliver it within 1-2 business days. The best thing to do is give them a few days and see if the package shows up at your door. Check the tracking status while you wait. Sometimes, postal employees update incorrect statuses as they process the package. You may also want to contact the sender to check the name and address the package was sent to. If your name or address was incorrect, provide them with the correct information and ask them to resend the package."

There is a type of scam called “smishing” that involves sending unsolicited text messages claiming a delivery problem with your package. These messages also include a link where the scammer lures the recipient into giving them usernames, passwords, Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information. [9] X Research source Do not click on any link from one of these emails. The USPS offers a free tracking service that sends status updates by email or text. However, you must sign up for that service with a tracking number. Legitimate tracking emails and texts don’t include links. If you receive a smishing text, email the US Postal Inspection Service at spam@uspis.gov to report it. Copy the suspicious text message without clicking on the link and take a screenshot of it. Then paste the text and attach the screenshot to your email. Include your name and any other information, like if you clicked the link, lost money, or provided personal information, and then send the email. Next, forward the suspicious text to 7726 to help report the scammer’s phone number."

If the package has a return address in a foreign country, the Post Office treats it as “dead mail.” First, they send the package to the Mail Recovery Center.
