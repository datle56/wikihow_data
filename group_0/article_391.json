      "title": "Wear good quality clothes at all times and never appear slovenly.",
      "content": "Wear good quality clothes at all times and never appear slovenly. Wear well-made quality clothing. Any clothing that you wear should be well ironed and clean. Prefer pink, tan, white or black colors as other colors may fade."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear quality and expensive jewelry.",
      "content": "Wear quality and expensive jewelry. Gold and Silver have a wealthy aura. Pick pieces that match your skin's undertone. Owning one decent piece is better than a box full of junk pieces. Earrings should be little gold or silver studs, or maybe precious gems. Have a large variety of styles of earrings such as hoops, chandeliers, and raindrops. Use real pearls; these are the only acceptable sort for the wealthy look."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have a sense of style.",
      "content": "Have a sense of style. Being fashionable is a must. Try to read more high fashion magazines to learn what kinds of clothing go well together and how to put together a classy outfit. Be sure to create your own fashion and have your own style, because it's not right to wear something that just isn't you. It's often better to have a glamorous personal style than to always be chasing the latest \"fad\" look."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have good hygiene.",
      "content": "Have good hygiene. Remember to always be clean: run a comb through your hair, keep your nails dirt-free and neat, brush your teeth and bathe/shower. When spraying perfume, be sure to use just enough, but not too much. Excessive use of perfume isn't attractive and does not improve your hygiene, despite popular belief. Being clean is important; it shows you can afford to practice self-care. Having body odor isn't classy or pleasing. Never have greasy hair. It is gross and very off-putting."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dress in a classy or posh style.",
      "content": "Dress in a classy or posh style. T-shirts and sweatpants look low class and will not cut it. A dress, skirt and blouse, shirt and pants or jeans with heels or flats will give off the impression of wealth. It shows you have the money to wear items others won’t wear in their daily lives. If you have the funds, purchase something from an exclusive designer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try to act your age.",
      "content": "Try to act your age. Yes, wealthy girls can be their parents' \"little princesses\" but outside of one's own home, acting like a little child will make you seem immature and bratty."
    },
    {
      "title": "Some rich girls are preppy, so you should look into becoming preppy too.",
      "content": "Some rich girls are preppy, so you should look into becoming preppy too. Wear Lacoste polo shirts, Tommy Hilfiger sweaters, Calvin Klein jeans, and Burberry or neutrally colored scarves. Don't try to show others that you wear expensive clothes unless that’s how you are. Rich people don't show they can afford expensive pieces. Most of them buy designer clothes because they like them, not just for the label. Also, buy a Louis Vuitton purse. If you cannot afford it, buy a cheaper one. Knock-offs are fine as long as they’re high quality."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have a rich girl vocabulary.",
      "content": "Have a rich girl vocabulary. It is a must. Use big words. Rich people are often well-educated and thus have good vocabularies. Learn a new word every day like \"aberrant,\" \"culpable,\" or \"capricious.\" Avoid filler words such as “like” or the all too common “uhh”. Having a vocabulary like this apparently increases charm and wit, which can be considered a must in higher circles."

    {
      "title": "Money is definitely essential.",
      "content": "Money is definitely essential. However, not much is needed. Look for ways to get money. Post ads on a neighborhood website offering babysitting and pet sitting. If you have a lawnmower, offer to mow people's lawns or rake leaves. Do something to get money whether that is simply asking your granny or you having to work for it."

    {
      "title": "Spend your money wisely by going to outlet malls where clothing is a bit cheaper than at the retail stores.",
      "content": "Spend your money wisely by going to outlet malls where clothing is a bit cheaper than at the retail stores. Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, Armani Exchange, and even Dolce and Gabbana clothing can be purchased for a lower price. Also, check wholesale stores that sell gently used clothing for a much cheaper price than at the actual store."

      "title": "Be willing to spend more money on \"investment pieces\" such as a nice leather handbag, fitted jeans, and cashmere sweaters.",
      "content": "Be willing to spend more money on \"investment pieces\" such as a nice leather handbag, fitted jeans, and cashmere sweaters. Spend less on trendy pieces since they tend to be low quality, try pointing your spending at timeless pieces that describe you instead. Do not wear a lot of logos. Rich kids don't need to wear logos to prove that they can afford expensive pieces. This is why you often see them downplaying their clothing choices."

      "title": "Eat healthy food at school.",
      "content": "Eat healthy food at school. Though rich girls do have junk food once in a while, they prefer to keep their bodies in shape. Try to incorporate healthy food and snacks into your lunchtime instead of going cold turkey. If you have a slight sweet tooth, eat fine chocolates such as Ferrero Rocher, Godiva Chocolatiers, and Lindor."

      "title": "Try to convince your parents to dress nicely.",
      "content": "Try to convince your parents to dress nicely. Convince your mum to dress elegantly. Some good wardrobe basics would be a Louis Vuitton handbag, a Burberry scarf, and a pair of pearls or diamonds. Also, convince your dad to dress well. Some good choices would be Lacoste/Tommy Hilfiger/Nautica polos and 2 or 3 Pierre Cardin jackets. An Armani suit would also be good. If you can't afford all these, just convince them to look elegant."

    {
      "title": "Dress up the house.",
      "content": "Dress up the house. When friends come over, make your ordinary house look 'rich' by printing poster-sized pictures of famous paintings, or you and your family dressed in beautiful clothes, or your parents' wedding and frame them. Then hang them up. On your desk keep all your things neat and tidy. Have a bedspread in a color that describes you the most, and for your computer or laptop, put a cover that compliments your room palette over it. The house should be tidy."

      "title": "Know what fine dining is.",
      "content": "Know what fine dining is. As clichéd as it sounds, learn about wines and cheeses. Learn how to pronounce words like Béchamel and Beaujolais. Learn good table manners. Otherwise, you will look like a complete fool at dinnertime. Read etiquette books (American Girl is good)."

      "title": "Act flawless!",
      "content": "Act flawless! Most people will be jealous if you have money and no worries in life. Get good grades, look nice, act nice, and always enjoy yourself when you're out. Act like a limo and your driver is awaiting your arrival. Never tell people about \"bad things\" in your life, this will make people think they are better than you if they have something you don't. If someone has something you don't have or is going somewhere nice, then don't act like it is a big deal, just stay cool, make it seem like it is something normal in your life."
