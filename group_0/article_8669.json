[2] X Research source It should also be the plainest type of toothpaste available, not the whitening or sensitivity kind. A mint-flavoured toothpaste is also helpful. The “toothpaste method\" is highly recommended by a number of DIY experts and average people, but it is not recommended by doctors. The reason why toothpaste works to get rid of blackheads and other pimples is because it contains ingredients that help dry out the infected pores. However, as you can imagine, toothpaste also contains many other ingredients that could potentially cause other problems with your skin, including an allergic reaction.
