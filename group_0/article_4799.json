      "title": "Determine the width of your wall.",
      "content": "Determine the width of your wall. To determine the width of your future wall, decide how many cinder blocks you want to use for the wall width, then calculate the width using the block's measurements. For example, if your cinder blocks are 8x8 in (20x20 cm) and you want to use 2 blocks to make up the wall's width, your total wall width would be 16 in (40 cm)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Measure the footing area.",
      "content": "Measure the footing area. The footing is the foundational base of the cinder block wall. It should be at least two times wider than the width of your block. Start by measuring the width of your future wall, then calculate the footing area. Use a tape measure to find the dimensions of the footing area on the ground. For example, if your wall will be 3 feet (0.91 m) wide, your footing area should be between 6 feet (1.8 m) and 9 feet (2.7 m) wide. Footing helps to spread the weight of a load-bearing wall across an area of soil. The taller and heavier your wall is, the wider the footing should be. Your footers should be free any potential water seeping or pooling. Make sure that your planned footing areas are all set up to drain water away from the footing. Remember to check with local building codes to make sure you are in compliance, as well."

    {
      "title": "Mark the footing area with 4 stakes.",
      "content": "Mark the footing area with 4 stakes. Place a stake in each corner of the footing area. This will help you contain your poured footing in the enclosed space. The length of the wall is up to you, just remember to mark 2-3 times the width of your wall so you can install the footing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tie string along each stake to mark the perimeter of the footing area.",
      "content": "Tie string along each stake to mark the perimeter of the footing area. The string will create a barrier and help you stay within the marked lines when pouring the footing. Tie string from stake to stake around the perimeter of the area. This creates 4 straight lines -- 1 for each side of your wall."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dig out the space between the lines.",
      "content": "Dig out the space between the lines. Use a shovel to remove dirt from the footing area. Dig out about as much depth as the cinder blocks are long, plus 3 inches (7.6 cm). For example, if your cinder blocks are 7 inches (18 cm) long, dig out the footing area about 10 inches (25 cm) deep, making sure that the footing is located below the frost line. If you are in the U.S., call the national Digline to request information for any local utilities that may run through your project area. Call at least 2 days in advance, and follow all guidelines and directions you receive."

      "title": "Place steel rebars into your trench.",
      "content": "Place steel rebars into your trench. You'll have to use a rebar bender to form an “L” shape with your steel bars. One should be placed in each corner and be about half the width of your trench on each side. Once the rebar benders are in place, apply pressure until your 90 degree bend is completed. You will also want rebar placed vertically in every other masonry core, stabilized with coarse fill grout. If your wall will be load-bearing, the horizontal tie rods should be set at least 6 inches (15 cm) into the footing. Tap the block lightly with a rubber mallet to help the grout settle."

[1] X Expert Source Gerber Ortiz-Vega Masonry Specialist & Founder, GO Masonry LLC Expert Interview. 10 March 2020.

      "content": "Pour the wet concrete mixture into your footing trench. Starting in 1 corner, tilt the wheelbarrow up by its handles and let the wet concrete drain out of it. Move slowly to the opposite end, continuing to pour. Repeat on the other side. Keep pouring until the trench is completely filled. Use a hoe or a flat nosed shovel if any concrete sticks to the wheelbarrow. Pour the concrete with great care. Kicking up dirt or debris could contaminate your mixture and create a non-binding or crumbling mix."

      "title": "Smooth the surface of the concrete with a float.",
      "content": "Smooth the surface of the concrete with a float. After pouring wet concrete, it probably won't be perfectly flat or smooth. Use a float to smooth out any rough or spotty areas on the surface of your concrete. Let the concrete harden overnight before proceeding. Use a notched trowel can provide a little bit of texture in the top of your concrete. The notches it creates will help the first row of blocks better adhere to the footer than they would on flat, smooth concrete."

      "content": "Lay out the first layer of cinder blocks. Starting at one end of the wall, lay out the cinder blocks, end to end, until you reach the first turn in the wall. If your wall is straight, line up the first layer of cinder blocks from one end to the other end. Put 3 ⁄ 8 inch (0.95 cm) plywood spacers in between the blocks. You will use spacers for straight walls and walls with turns."

Use a trowel to add mortar to the area between your traced lines. Spread the mortar to be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. [4] X Research source You can use premixed mortar or buy a bag of mortar mix and mix it yourself according to the package directions. Mixing it yourself is usually the cheaper option."

      "content": "Butter the \"ears\" of the second block with mortar. The \"ears\" are the 2 protrusions (also called flanges) running from top to bottom on both ends of every cinder block. Buttering the ears simply means use your trowel to apply mortar directly on top of both flanges on 1 end of a cinder block. This connects the flanges of this block to the flanges of the 1 already in place. You only need to use enough mortar to thinly cover the surface of the ears. You only need to use mortar on the ears. Do not apply it to the space between the ears."

      "title": "Check your base blocks often with a level.",
      "content": "Check your base blocks often with a level. This will prevent you from building a crooked wall! Use a level often, every 10 minutes or so, so your mortar doesn't have a chance to harden before you can find and fix any issues. Be sure to check vertically as well as horizontally. [9] X Research source Press the mortar with your thumb once in a while to check for hardness. Once you can just barely dent the mortar with your thumb, it means the mortar is close to being set.

Start the third layer with a regular cinder block and build out. Start the fourth layer with a half block, and continue starting layers with half blocks every other layer until your wall has reached the desired height."

      "title": "Strike the joints with a rubber mallet or sledgehammer.",
      "content": "Strike the joints with a rubber mallet or sledgehammer. This will help to solidify the bricks in place. Do this shortly after checking the mortar to make sure it has hardened somewhat, but not completely. [11] X Research source If you choose to use a sledgehammer, be sure to use one that is 2 pounds (0.91 kg) or less. Rubber mallets tend to produce more consistent results with less chance of causing damage. Strike the horizontal joints first using gentle pressure. Then strike the vertical joints gently. Scrape off the excess mortar and strike both joints once more."

Do the same things listed above, but remember to use alternating half blocks in either direction to make sure your wall remains sturdy. Use a large level often to make sure the corners are plumb and square. [12] X Research source Be sure that the joint line is staggered from block to block."
