      "content": "Review the Battle Frontier (BF) Rules. Although each BF facility has its own set of rules, the following rules apply to all facilities: No duplicate held items are allowed (e.g., Two Pokémon on your team can’t both hold Leftovers). No duplicate Pokémon are allowed on a single team (e.g., You can’t fight with 3 Slakings on your team). Items can’t be retrieved from a Bag in the middle of a battle (e.g., You can’t use a Hyper Potion if your Pokémon takes a heavy hit). The Battle Pyramid is the only facility with an exception to this rule. Certain Legendaries cannot be used: Lugia, Ho-Oh, Celebi, Kyogre, Groudon, Rayquaza, Mew, Mewtwo, Jirachi, and Deoxys (Speed Forme). Other Legendaries are fair game, like Latios and Latias. Eggs (unhatched Pokémon) cannot be members of your battle team. No money or EXP can be given out after a successful battle. [2] X Research source"

Instead, you’re caught in a cycle of battling certain trainers to increase your winning streak. Once you’ve won a certain number of rounds/battles (depending on the facility you’re in), you’ll battle that building’s “Frontier Brain,” which is the equivalent of a gym leader. You’ll need to complete 2 winning streaks and beat each Brain twice to collect all the Silver and Gold Frontier Symbols. [4] X Research source After a successful round/battle (depending on the building you’re in), your Pokémon get automatically healed. Still, it can be challenging to keep up a long winning streak, especially when you’re angling for a Gold Symbol.

In each battle (except for the first), you’ll have the option to switch out one of your Pokémon with one of your previous opponent’s Pokémon.
