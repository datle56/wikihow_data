      "content": "Remove all of the strings from the guitar (optional). Use your guitar string winder to loosen and detach all of your strings from the headstock. Use your guitar string cutter to clip of the curly frayed ends of each string. Press your strings down through the bridge until they poke out the back. Pull on the bottom end of each string and slide it all the way through the bridge. [2] X Research source Some technicians advocate for removing the strings, while others do not. Removing the strings from the guitar removes tension from your tremolo. This can make it easier to fit the block into the tremolo opening. Performing this modification with the strings still attached keeps the tremolo in your natural playing position. If you install the block without moving the tremolo, your guitar will be ready to play as soon as you close the back cavity."

This space is bordered on 1 side by the tremolo itself, and on the other 3 sides by the body cavity. Use a ruler to measure the width and depth of this opening. Write these numbers down. [4] X Research source The length of the opening should be about 1–1.5 inches (2.5–3.8 cm). There is no need to measure this."

Steady your plank of wood with your non-dominant hand. Place the sharp side of your saw on the wood, and begin sawing with a backward motion. Move the saw back and forth until you’ve made the cut. Turn your plank and cut the other side. Wear gloves and protective eyewear before using a saw."

If the block you created is slightly too large, you can also use sandpaper to make it a little smaller. [6] X Research source 220-grit sandpaper will also work."

Use a string cutter to remove the excess string, and wind your guitar strings until they have good tension. [8] X Research source You will need to tune your guitar after this."
