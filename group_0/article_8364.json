      "content": "Heat the glue gun using a heat gun or blow dryer. Set the glue gun on its side, preferably on a silicone mat. Lay a single piece of foil on top of the glue. Rub the foil in, using protection on your hands so you don't burn your fingers. Go over it with the heat gun or blow dryer. The glue should stick more to the aluminum foil than the glue gun, so you can easily peel it off. Repeat the process as needed. [4] X Research source You may need to remove parts, like the kickstand, to help clean the whole gun."

      "title": "Disinfect the glue gun.",
      "content": "Disinfect the glue gun. If you think your glue gun has come in contact with germs, you can wipe down the outside with a disinfectant. Don't use one that's flammable. Also, make sure your gun is unplugged and cool before applying the disinfectant. For instance, you can wipe it down with a solution of half vinegar, half water or a gentle commercial disinfectant. Dampen your cloth with the mixture. You don't want the cloth sopping, so wring it out. Wipe down the gun. Use a cloth dampened with clean water to wipe it off. Dry the glue gun off with a paper towel."
