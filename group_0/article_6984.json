      "title": "Use either a trickle, float, or smart charger for most battery types.",
      "content": "Use either a trickle, float, or smart charger for most battery types. These chargers work best on lead acid, gel, or absorbed glass mat batteries. Do not use these chargers with lithium batteries. [2] X Research source Trickle, or fully manual, chargers are the easiest type to use. These chargers take the AC power and convert it to DC. However, you will have to turn these charger off or else they will keep pumping energy into the charger. Float chargers are another common type of charger. They provide a constant, gentle, current to the battery. Smart chargers monitor battery charge progress. This type of charger also minimizes damage to the battery as they stop charging when the battery is full. Unfortunately, smart chargers don’t typically work well with lithium batteries."

      "content": "Buy a specialized charger for lithium batteries. Lithium batteries, including lith ion, lith-iron, and lithium phosphate require special chargers depending on which manufacturer made them. Check the manual for more information about which charger you'll need if you have a lithium battery."

      "title": "Take the battery out of the motorcycle.",
      "content": "Take the battery out of the motorcycle. Avoid leaving the battery inside the bike while charging it, as this could damage to other components. Generally, to remove a battery you must disconnect the negative cable first and then the positive cable. Then, release the battery from anything connecting it to the motorcycle body and lift it out of the bike. [3] X Research source Removing the battery is a tricky operation. Read the manual before you do anything else. The manual will tell you where the battery is, how to access it, and how to disconnect it. Every motorbike is different so reading the manual is a must."

    {
      "title": "Connect the battery charger.",
      "content": "Connect the battery charger. Attach the charger to the battery terminals in any order. Make sure the battery terminals are properly connected to the charger. When properly connected, plug in the charger. The best and safest place to charge the battery is outside or in a well-ventilated area. The process of battery charging creates hydrogen gas, a highly flammable substance. Overcharging also produces hydrogen sulfide, which is incredibly bad for you. Non-smart chargers will need to be constantly monitored so you can make sure they don’t overcharge the battery."

      "title": "Check to see if the battery is charged.",
      "content": "Check to see if the battery is charged. A smart charger will tell you when the battery is fully charged. For other batteries, perform a voltage test. Disconnect the battery terminals from the charger. Then plug the battery leads into a DVOM, also known as a multimeter . Put the black lead into the COM slot, and the red lead into the V slot. Turn the multimeter onto the 20V DC section of the scale. With the bike completely off, touch the black lead to the negative post of the battery and the red lead to the positive post. Then record the voltage. [4] X Research source If the voltage measured 12.73 volts or better, then your battery is charged and ready to go. Anything between 12.06 volts and 12.62 volts means you battery needs to be charged for longer. Anything less than 12.06 volts and your battery might be ruined, but you can try charging it more."

      "content": "Install the battery. When charging is finished, unplug the charger from the battery. Read the manual again to find out how to put the battery back in the right way. Attach the positive cable first and then the negative. The battery should now be working properly again."

      "content": "Leave the car off if jump-starting using a car. Car batteries have far more capacity than motorcycle batteries. While it is necessary to have one car running when trying to jump-start another car, motorbike batteries don’t require the same amount of energy, so the car should be left off for the duration of this process. [5] X Research source The car battery will not fry your motorcycle battery. For that to happen, the leads would need to be connected and the motorbike would have to be running for a very long time."

If you don’t want to cause wear and tear or scratches to your motorbike’s exterior, connect the clamp to a part of the frame with no paint or chrome. The reason the black clamp is being connected to the frame and not the battery is because connecting it to the battery could destroy the battery."

Check the ignition kill switch is set to “stop” and not to “run.” Make sure you have enough fuel. It seems obvious but these things can be easily missed. If the kickstand is down, an inbuilt safety feature of the bike might be preventing it from starting. If the motorbike isn’t in neutral, it won’t start. If it’s none of these issues, then chances are that it’s the battery at fault."

If you’re on your own, it’s best to push-start the bike at the top of a hill or a slope. If you can’t find a hill or an adequate slope, you’ll need to push the bike at pace before climbing on and releasing the clutch."

Using 1st gear also increases the risk of the rear tyres locking up.
