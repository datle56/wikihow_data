      "content": "Move heavier pieces of amethyst in a towel. Small pieces amethyst can be moved easily by hand. However, if you're washing large pieces of amethyst, wrap them in an old towel and use this as a dolly to transport amethyst from place to place. [2] X Research source If your pieces of amethyst are very large, it may be easier to wash them outside with a hose. You may not be able to soak large pieces of amethyst."

      "title": "Prepare a sink or bowl with soapy water.",
      "content": "Prepare a sink or bowl with soapy water. Choose a sink or bowl big enough to submerge your amethyst. Fill it with water to begin the washing process. [3] X Research source Opt for warm water over hot or cold water. Extreme temperatures can cause amethyst to crack. Use a mild dish detergent to clean your amethyst."

      "title": "Soak or wipe down your amethyst before scrubbing.",
      "content": "Soak or wipe down your amethyst before scrubbing. Small pieces of amethyst can be submerged in soapy water for 15 to 20 minutes. This helps loosen up the dirt, making it easier to scrub off dirt and grime. If your geode is too big to submerge, soak a washcloth in warm water and add a small amount of dish detergent to it. Work up a lather and wipe down the sides of your amethyst with the cloth. [4] X Research source If your cloth gets dirty while scrubbing, rinse it off and add more soap. You are only trying to loosen up the dirt at this point, so don't worry too much if you're not getting everything off the amethyst. Just make sure to get the amethyst as wet as possible before moving on to the scrubbing process."

    {
      "title": "Brush off any remaining gunk and rinse your amethyst.",
      "content": "Brush off any remaining gunk and rinse your amethyst. Amethyst should be rubbed down with a toothbrush after soaking. Use the toothbrush to remove any grease or grime stuck to the amethyst. Work the toothbrush into any unusual cracks and crevices in the amethyst, making sure to scrub harder on dirtier areas. [5] X Research source Rinse the amethyst in a bowl of clear water as you brush it off. This helps remove any dirt or grime you dislodged. For a piece of amethyst that's very dirty, this process can take as long as 30 minutes. Have patience and get in a comfortable position as you scrub your amethyst. Amethyst jewelery may not require as vigorous scrubbing, as it is likely not as prone to built up dirt. Something like a geode will require more time commitment, while a piece of jewelery may only need a quick wipe down."

      "title": "Rinse your amethyst.",
      "content": "Rinse your amethyst. Once the amethyst has been soaked or scrubbed, rinse it off completely. Stick to using warm water for the rinsing process. Remember, hot or cold water can damage amethyst. [6] X Research source Smaller pieces of amethyst can be soaked in clear water or under the sink. Make sure to rinse the amethyst until water runs clear. Left on soap can cause damage to your amethyst. Large pieces of amethyst may have to be rinsed with a hose. Make sure to use warm water and do not turn the hose on a high pressure setting. Spray down the amethyst until the water from the hose runs clear."
