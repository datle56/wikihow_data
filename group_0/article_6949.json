      "content": "Pronounce Om. The “O” sounds like the “a” sound in the word “saw,” combined with the “u” sound in the word “put.” Blend the “m” into the end. These sounds should all merge together into a single sound similar to the “ome” in “home.” [8] X Research source Om is composed of four sounds: “a,” “u,” “m,” and the silence that follows. Give equal measure to each sound. For example, “Ooommm” rather than “ommm” or “ooom.”"

Then purse your lips together for the rest. [13] X Research source To chant without physically forming the word, repeat the mantra silently to yourself. Don’t move your lips or tongue."

There is no incorrect way to pronounce “Om,” as it differs based on factors like dialect and location. The aim is for everyone to match in tone for a group chant. [15] X Research source Approach the chant with a sense of reverence and surrender. This will help you to merge into the vibration of the group chant. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Lead a chant.",
      "content": "Lead a chant. Tell the participants that if they aren’t comfortable chanting, they can meditate silently during the chant, or simply listen. View chanting as a connection to the meaning of the chant, rather than a performance. Take a few breaths before chanting and summon the positive feeling of the chant. [17] X Research source Try practicing alone before leading group chants. Add instrumental background music for the group chant if desired. Alternately, you can bring a recorded group chant to play in the background."
