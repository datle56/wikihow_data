      "content": "Use “I” statements to express how you feel and what you need. This is a tough conversation to have, so make sure to give yourself credit just for trying. Also make sure to choose a time to talk when everyone is calm and able to focus on the conversation. Speak from your own perspective—“I feel…,” “I need…,” etc.—instead of using “you” statements that make family members get defensive because they feel like they’re being attacked and blamed. Do your best to speak clearly and calmly so you can get everything out in the open and get working toward improving the situation. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Compare, for example, the following “I” and “you” statements and how family members would be likely to respond: “I understand that you’re all very busy, but I feel ignored and left out all the time, and I don’t believe that’s fair or good for me.” “You’re all so busy with your own things that you completely ignore me and don’t seem to care that you’re hurting me.”"

      "content": "You don’t need to agree with them, but you should hear them out. If you’re lucky, your family will be very receptive to your concerns and eager to work together to improve things. However, they may instead argue against your point of view and try to justify why things are the way they are. Do your best to listen carefully to what everyone has to say. Try to find areas of common ground so you can work together to change the situation for the better. [2] X Research source Don’t get discouraged if your family members are hesitant or not receptive at the start. So long as you sense that there’s hope for improvement, keep at it and give your family the chance to come around. If there is simply no common ground and no way to build a connection, accept that you’ve done your best to improve the situation. Sadly, your family simply may not be willing to give you the love you deserve. It’s a tough pill to swallow, but it can also free you to find the love you need from other caring people in your life."

      "content": "Accept your responsibility and encourage your family to do the same. If your family is receptive to making changes for the better, work together to find the barriers that are standing in the way of a more loving relationship. Take the lead by acknowledging the barriers that are your creations, then make a plan to break through them. Your example will hopefully encourage your family to do the same. [3] X Research source You might say, for example: “I accept that, because of my frustration, I haven’t been as supportive of you guys as I should be, and that has only made things worse.” If your family members refuse to accept any responsibility, remind yourself that that’s their choice to make and out of your control. Turn your focus toward the things you can control, like your own actions."

      "content": "Lay out specific, positive changes you can make. In the end, unfortunately, you can’t control whether or not you have a loving family. But you can set goals for self-improvement that will benefit you no matter what choices your family members make. Share these goals with your family if they’ve agreed to work together to improve things. Otherwise, write them down for yourself as reminders of the improvements that are under your control. [4] X Research source If you’ve admitted to yourself that you haven’t been very supportive of your family members, for example, you might challenge yourself to make at least one encouraging statement to each family member every day. Remember that your goal is to be an improved version of yourself, not to completely change who you are. If that’s not enough to earn the love of your family, then the fault is all theirs. Reader Poll: We asked 329 wikiHow readers how to avoid making the same mistake, and 9% said they would ask loved ones to hold them accountable. [Take Poll] While this may not be the best strategy according to our readers, try mapping out the causes of your mistake. Then, make a list of changes you can make to prevent it from happening again."

This is an important self-improvement to make if you’ve frequently been unreliable—failing to do things you said you’d do, forgetting important family matters, etc. Take it upon yourself to be someone who everyone in your family can depend on. Keep your word. Follow through. And set reminders for yourself!"

      "content": "Resist the urge to “get back at” family members this way. When family members have hurt you by withholding affection or in other ways, spreading hurtful rumors about them can be very tempting. Instead, work to manage problems in-house by talking directly to family members about your problems and feelings. This is essential in building trust, and trust is essential in building love. [5] X Research source For example, if your brother has been really unkind to you, you may want to get back at him by spreading an embarrassing rumor about him at school. This might feel good for a moment, but will further damage your relationship with him. Instead, talk one-on-one, or with other family members present, about how his actions have made you feel."

      "content": "Showing respect increases your chances of getting it in return. If you’re feeling unloved, you’re probably also feeling disrespected. While it’s tempting to withhold respect for family members in return, try instead to break the cycle of disrespect. Offering even small signs of respect, like saying “please” and “thank you,” can help to encourage an overall change in behavior by the whole family. [6] X Research source Showing respect doesn’t mean you can’t have your own opinions or disagree with other family members. It does mean that you should avoid personal attacks when you do have disagreements. Stay calm and explain your side of things. Hopefully this will inspire your family members to do the same."

      "content": "Do the little things that show you care about your family. Instead of refusing to help out because you’re upset, model supportive family behavior by seeking out opportunities to help. Even if your family members don’t show much in the way of appreciation, your positive, helpful attitude may help change the family narrative over time. [7] X Research source For example, offer a helping hand to put away the groceries without being asked. Or, if you get the feeling that a family member could use some encouraging words, say something nice."

      "title": "Do things yourself when you can, but ask for help when needed.",
      "content": "Do things yourself when you can, but ask for help when needed. Aim for an appropriate amount of independence based on your age and circumstances within the family. If you’re a teen, for example, don’t rely on a parent to wake you up in the morning when you can simply set an alarm for yourself. Or, if you’re a young adult, don’t bring your laundry over for your parents to do for you when there’s a laundromat near where you live. [8] X Research source However, don’t try to be so independent that you refuse to ask for help. To build a more loving relationship within your family, be willing to help them when they need it, and be willing to ask for help from them when you need it."

Instead of assuming that they know you love them, tell them you love them. Likewise, show your love by leaving little notes, giving small gifts “just because,” and being helpful and caring overall. [9] X Research source Say “I love you” to family members when you really feel it, so that it’s meaningful when you use those words."

Let your family know that you want to try to spend more time together, and explain why that will benefit everyone. [10] X Research source For example: “I’d really like to make the effort to spend more time with you guys. It seems like all of us—me included—are always off doing our own things, and I hope you’ll agree that we can become closer if we find ways to spend more time together."

It’s true that you won’t be able to please everyone with every activity, but you can at least avoid doing things that one or more family members truly dislike.

You might go on a picnic, visit a museum, attend a sporting event, see a concert, or just go for a nature walk together. Once you get the ball rolling with coming up with family activities, let each family member take turns choosing what to do together."

Be ready and willing to join in when other family members are doing something or just simply hanging out. Listen to music, read, watch movies or TV, garden together, and so on. Just being in each others' presence will hopefully spur interaction, conversation, and deeper connections. Yes, it’s also true that “together time” can sometimes result in disputes and arguments. Take a break when being together is getting contentious and try again another time. Don’t give up!"

While it’s important to talk to your family about your desire to feel more loved by them, it may be tough for you to go to them first. If so, confide in a close friend, another relative, a mentor, or even a professional therapist. Sharing your feelings openly and honestly will be a big relief and make it easier to figure out how to approach your family. [12] X Research source You might raise the subject to a close friend like this: \"Cam, I know you already know that I've been having some major issues with my family. I really need to talk to someone I can trust about how I see things and feel about the situation. I'd also really like to hear what you have to say about things. Is this a good time to talk?\" This trusted person might give you advice for approaching your family or even end up serving as a mediator to help facilitate the process. Or, they might help you realize that your family is incapable of providing the love you crave and deserve."
