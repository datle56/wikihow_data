Talk to your guidance counselor to see if they have received your scores and are available to discuss them with you yet.

      "content": "Do not try to request scores if you took the test more than 2 years ago. ASVAB only keeps your scores for 2 years, so you will not be able to obtain them after that. However, you can arrange to take the test again either at your high school or at a Military Enlistment Processing Station (MEPS). [3] X Research source The ASVAB tests offered at MEPS are more specifically geared toward military enlistment, and will include a sub-test called Assembling Objects. [4] X Research source If you don’t live near a MEPS, you may be able to take the test at a Military Entrance Test site, which is a type of MEPS satellite location. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Talk to your guidance counselor about your scores.",
      "content": "Talk to your guidance counselor about your scores. Part of the reason that ASVAB testing is conducted through high schools is that counselors are available to discuss the results and implications of test scores. ASVAB tests are meant not only to test for military eligibility, but for aptitude in other career paths as well. [8] X Research source Talk to your counselor about which sub-tests you got the highest scores in, and discuss career options that are well suited to someone with your strengths. If you already know what type of career you are interested in, ask your counselor if your scores show any areas where you need to improve in order to be qualified for that career."

      "title": "Look at your scores for each sub-test.",
      "content": "Look at your scores for each sub-test. Your ASVAB scores will be divided into individual scores for each sub-test, or category. These sub-tests measure your abilities in various categories that apply to military service and also to a variety of career options, including math, science, reading comprehension, and mechanical knowledge. Take a look at your scores and note which categories you are strongest in. [9] X Research source Consider your low scores as indications of where you need to improve, and your high scores as indications of what career paths you may be well suited for. For instance, if you got a 34 in Word Knowledge but a 63 in General Science, you may want to work on your reading skills and also look into careers in science."

For instance, if you have a GED instead of a high school diploma, your requirement may be higher. Requirements are sometimes higher for women because of limited housing availability.
