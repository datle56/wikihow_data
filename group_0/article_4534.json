Then, check that the birds are kept in a clean, healthy environment. Additionally, make sure that the birds aren't overcrowded and don't appear stressed. Observe all of the birds available for sale to make sure they look healthy and active. Do an Internet search to look for red flags that might signal the seller isn't reputable, such as complaints or bad reviews. Budgies typically cost about $10-$60 each, depending on where you purchase your bird. [1] X Research source"

However, their offspring, if they survive, will have deformities or will be susceptible to illness. When you purchase your budgies, ask if they’re related. Birds hatched by different breeders are unlikely to be related. In some cases, a grandparent can mate with a grandchild with low risk to the baby budgies. However, it’s always best to pair birds that aren’t from the same family line. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Look for a pair that is already bonded for best results. As long as they aren’t related to each other, birds that are kept in the same cage will mate more quickly than birds that don’t know each other. This is because the birds already get along, so you don’t have to wait until they get accustomed to each other. [3] X Research source In some cases, the birds may be comfortable with each other if they’ve been kept in cages near each other. While their bond won’t be as strong, this is a good first step to bonding."

Make sure you work with an avian vet or a vet experienced in treating birds, as they have the expertise to treat budgies. They can help you avoid breeding budgies that are sick or deformed. Here are some things the vet needs to check to ensure good health: [8] X Research source Both birds have no discoloration. Neither bird has discharge from its vents. Both birds have unblocked vents. Neither bird is lethargic. Both birds are eating and defecating with no issue. Neither bird is vomiting."

      "content": "Place your budgies alone in a cage together. Provide the breeding pair with their own private cage. Not only will this make them more comfortable, it will also increase the likelihood that they’ll produce baby budgies. Coupling mimics their behavior in the wild, urging them to reproduce. [9] X Research source If they start fighting, take one budgie out. Then, place the budgie in 2 cages next to each other. Watch them for bonding behavior, like playing together or preening each other through the cage bars. Once they are getting along, you can return them to the same cage."

Although your birds will enjoy each other’s company, they also need time alone. A big cage allows them to be active and spend time away from their partner. This supports your birds’ good health, making them better parents. [11] X Research source Each breeding pair that you own will need its own cage. Don’t try to keep them in a cage together, as they’ll be less likely to mate."

However, your birds will enjoy having extra perches and swings if the cage allows enough space. [13] X Research source Wood is the best material for the perches. Avoid choosing plastic options, as your birds will enjoy chewing on everything in the cage."

The eggs will rest inside the dish, which helps keep them in the nest. Then, the chicks will hatch in the dish, which provides a good surface for their legs. [16] X Research source As another option, you can make or purchase a board that fits into the bottom of the nesting box. The board should have a concave dip carved into the center.

The female bird will also enjoy chewing on the wood shavings as she gets ready to mate. In the wild, females typically pick up pieces of bark to chew on before they breed.

[20] X Research source Great fruits for your budgie include apple, banana, blueberry, grape, guava, kiwi, mango, melon, orange, papaya, peach, pear, pineapple, and strawberries. Good veggie options include broccoli, asparagus, Brussels sprouts, carrots, cauliflower, celery, cucumber, kale, pumpkin, radish, spinach, squash, sweet potatoes, ripe tomatoes, and yams.

Your budgies will need more water while they’re breeding. To make sure they don’t run out, it’s best to use two water bottles. Plus, this limits the risk of your budgies fighting over water.

Unfortunately, some budgies get into the habit of eating their eggs after doing it the first time. Budgies who continue to eat their eggs after you provide more food likely won’t be good breeders. [22] X Research source If your budgies eat their eggs, add more food to their cage over the next breeding period. If this doesn’t stop the behavior, it’s best to find a new pair of budgies to breed."

      "content": "Expect your birds to breed in October through March or when it rains. The budgies typically begin breeding during the month of October and continue through March, but they also breed after heavy rains. In the wild, their favorite food source is more prevalent after rain, which causes them to breed. They may breed at any time of the year if it’s been rainy. [24] X Research source Budgies are native to Australia, where it's warm October through March. If you live in the northern hemisphere, your budgies may mate during the months of April through September."

      "content": "Cover the cage for 12 hours every night. The birds need time to rest so that they’ll be stress free. Covering the cage also makes it feel dark and cozy, so your birds are more likely to nest. Leave the cage uncovered for the other half of the day so your birds will get proper light.

      "content": "Watch for breeding behavior, which will be brief and repeated. When the male wants to breed, he’ll approach the female making chattering sounds. Then, he’ll tap on her beak. If she wants to breed, she’ll lower her head and raise her tail so that the male budgie can balance on top of her. They’ll then mate, which will last just a few minutes.

That means you’ll likely see 1 or 2 eggs sitting neglected in the nest after she’s first started laying. This is normal, so don’t worry if your bird is not being attentive in those first few days.
