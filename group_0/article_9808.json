You want to hit them from both angles to make sure your argument is thorough. That shows them how important this is to you. Most people make decisions based on a combination of reason and emotion. They are interconnected, always influencing each other. That is why you always want to appeal to someone’s reason and emotion when you are trying to influence them. When you plan your strategy, write down how you will approach them reasonably. What kinds of things do your parents typically react to on a logical level? Then, write down the things you can say to them that will affect them emotionally. What are their weaknesses? Do they have a strong sense of pride? Are they quick to avoid fear? These are the kinds of things you should be thinking about. Keep a close eye on your parents for a while to see what kinds of things they react to, so you have a better idea of what kinds of things you can say, and what topics to avoid. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Know why you want to wear a thong. An important part of your strategy is appealing to your parents’ sense of reason. A well-reasoned argument includes persuasive justifications for wearing a thong. Write down five or six logical reasons why you want to wear a thong. Thongs don’t show panty lines. The main benefit of this is that it avoids attention to your butt. Surely your parents can get on board with that. Thongs last longer. Since there is less fabric to deal with, they reshape better than regular panties. If you change shape at all, it is less likely that you will have to buy new panties, saving money. Thongs keep you cooler in hot temperatures. They are lightweight, allowing for better airflow. By avoiding sweat in your panties you will also avoid possible skin rashes or blemishes.

Kick up the responsibility before your argument happens so it does not look obvious. If you have chores or homework, do them on time without being asked. Save your money instead of spending it on frivolous things. Do not stay out late or come home drunk."

      "title": "Practice your argument.",
      "content": "Practice your argument. To be convincing you need to have the discussion with your parents full of confidence. One of the best ways to achieve confidence is to practice what you are going to say to your parents, so you are not bumbling over yourself or forgetting your arguments. Imagine that your parents are there with you when you practice. [3] X Research source Read your notes out loud in front of a mirror. By the time you sit down with your parents to convince them, you will be well prepared. [4] X Research source Be sure you pace yourself and take breaths. You want your practice to be as natural as possible so that your conversation with them does not look rehearsed. [5] X Research source Keep practicing until you feel confident you are ready to talk with them in a calm and collected voice. Once you feel comfortable with what you are going to say, you are ready to convince them."

Let them know that you want to tell them why, and that they can ask questions after. Try to control the conversation as much as possible.

Whether it is to hide panty lines, be more comfortable, avoid pimples, or any other number of reasons. Try to get through your whole list without interruptions, but be polite if they do happen. If you get resistance, offer to provide them with sources to back up your reasons. This way they know you are not making excuses. Feel free to wing it if you come up with more reasons while you are talking with them. Do not feel like you have to stick to what you practiced from your notes."

They might even ask you why you think they should agree with you. [11] X Research source They might ask about boys. What if they see you as a sex object?

They need to see that you are mature enough to make your own decisions. If they say, “no” now, they may be more likely to say, “yes” to the next decision based on your reaction. [12] X Research source If they respond with an immediate “no”, don’t storm off in a huff or raise your voice. Listen to what they have to say, or suggest that they discuss the topic again later. The important thing is that you respond to them with respect. They may still come around. [13] X Research source If you feel yourself getting upset, breathe. Check to see if your body is tensing up, and relax your body. If none of that works and everyone is still glaring at each other, tell a joke. Humor is a great way to defuse a tense situation.

Perhaps you can agree to get a thong at a certain age. You can ask them what compromise works for them. Find out what your common interests are with them and work from there. You want to be seen as a grown-up, and they want to encourage your maturation, right? That’s a great place to start negotiating. Waiting until everyone is calm will make the process much easier. This is one conversation where you want to avoid dealing with too much emotion. Instead, try to stick to facts and needs. Be honest with them about your goals and offer a compromise that will please them but still get you what you ultimately want."
