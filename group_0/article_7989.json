If you have quartz in your home that's looking a little cloudy or oily from handling, Young suggests using household items like a soft toothbrush , water, and dish soap to clean it. [1] X Expert Source Kennon Young Master Gemologist Appraiser Expert Interview. 11 September 2019. Wet the quartz crystal with water from the faucet or a bowl and add a drop of dish soap to the toothbrush. Gently scrub the crystal's surface with the toothbrush, then rinse it clean. Dry it off with a paper towel or a soft towel before putting it back on display."

      "content": "Scrub off clay and dirt with a tough bristle brush and dish soap. If your quartz crystal has clay or dirt caked on it, you'll need something sturdier than a toothbrush to tackle it. Use a bristle brush with thick hair. Young says, \"horsehair and other animal hairs are a little bit more tough\" than a toothbrush. [2] X Expert Source Kennon Young Master Gemologist Appraiser Expert Interview. 11 September 2019. Soak the quartz in soapy water for 24 hours to loosen the clay and dirt, then scrub the quartz all over. Rinse away any leftover soap and residue, then let the crystal air dry completely. [3] X Research source Don't worry about scratching the crystal, as quartz is extremely durable. If your quartz crystals are covered by a thick layer of clay, put them outside in indirect sunlight for several hours to let the clay dry and crack. Once the clay is sufficiently dry, simply brush off the remnants before cleaning it with soap and water. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Lift small iron stains by soaking the quartz in oxalic acid. If your quartz crystals have only a small outer layer of iron, soak them in a solution of oxalic acid and water overnight. Put the quartz crystals in a plastic bucket with 2 tbsp (30 g) of powdered oxalic acid and 1 ‚ÅÑ 2 US gal (1.9 L) of water. Cover the bucket with a lid and check the crystals every 10-30 minutes. When you don't see the stains anymore, rinse it clean under a faucet or a hose to remove the gray film left by the oxalic acid. Then let the crystal dry. [6] X Research source Always start with a weak solution of oxalic acid and water. If it starts to turn dark emerald green with iron, but the quartz still isn't clean, add a small amount of oxalic acid and water to the solution to refresh it. [7] X Research source Neutralize the oxalic acid and water mixture before you dispose of it. Learn how to complete this step properly and safely under Quartz Cleaning Safety Precautions below ."

      "content": "Remove large, stubborn iron deposits with oxalic acid in a slow cooker. Place the quartz crystals in a standard 7 qt (6.62 L) slow cooker outdoors, away from children and pets. Fill the cooker with cold water and 2 oz (57 g) of oxalic acid. Cover it with a lid and turn it on Low. Check the crystals every 2-3 days and add warm water to it as needed to ensure the crystals stay submerged. Repeat this procedure for 7 days total, then turn the crockpot off and let it cool completely overnight before removing the crystals. Rinse them off completely to get rid of the oxalic acid film. [8] X Research source Avoid removing the quartz from the slow cooker while they're still hot. They might shatter from the shock of the temperature change! As the quartz dries, you may notice a white powder forming. This is the remnants of the oxalic acid. If this happens, clean the slow cooker and put the crystals back in it. Fill the pot with water, mix in a 1/3 cup (65 g) of baking soda, and let it cook on Low overnight. Repeat this process until you don't see any more white powder."

      "content": "Loosen calcite from the quartz by soaking it in vinegar. Calcite is a mineral made mostly out of calcium carbonate. It forms on or in other rocks and crystals (such as quartz) when water containing calcium and carbon dioxide drips onto it over the course of many years. Calcite looks suspiciously like clear quartz, but it's much weaker. [9] X Research source To determine if your crystal has calcite, test it by dropping a few drops of vinegar on it. If the vinegar bubbles, the quartz has calcite in it. If you want your quartz to be pure and free of calcite, here's how to remove it: [10] X Research source Soak the quartz crystals in distilled white vinegar for 2-3 days. Remove the quartz from the vinegar bath and scrub the loose calcite away with a wire brush. Rinse the quartz with water and let it dry."

If your quartz crystals are covered in algae deposits or other minerals, you can try cleaning them with the same bleach you use to clean your white clothes. Take your quartz crystals outside and soak them in a bowl filled with bleach for a couple of days. Then remove them, rinse them off, and let them sit out to dry until you can no longer smell bleach on them. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Dispose of the acid waste properly. Since oxalic acid waste is considered a hazardous material, neutralize it first before you can dispose of it. At the end of the cleaning process, the oxalic acid will be in a liquid form. Add garden lime (CaO) to the liquid until there is no longer any visible reaction. That's when you know it's neutralized and has formed into calcium oxalate, which isn't harmful. Then dump the mixture onto the ground. [14] X Research source Wash away the remnants of the calcium oxalate with a hose."
