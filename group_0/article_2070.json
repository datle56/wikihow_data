      "content": "Show off your spontaneous side. [1] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 December 2021. This is a sign that truly can’t be tamed—your Sagittarius crush is all about wild activities, off-the-cuff decisions, and adventure, 24/7. His greatest fear is probably falling into a rut (or, a relationship with someone who can’t ride the wave). So if you show him that you’re just as fun, curious, and bold as he is, it’ll go a long way. Suggest something bold. Maybe you two are at a party…why not ask him to sneak off to the rooftop pool for a midnight swim? Surprise him with an adventure. If you know him well, show up with a blindfold and take him to a special outdoor spot you know he’d love. Go along with his zany plans. If your Sag crush wants to do something random, your enthusiasm will mean the world to him—he’s looking for a partner in crime after all!"

      "content": "Maintain an air of mystery to keep him on his toes. Sagittarius is one of the most curious signs in the zodiac. If you’re an enigma that he’s constantly trying to figure out, you’ll be naturally alluring to him. So if you can, don’t give too much away off the bat. Make him work to learn more about you, and you’ll become that much more exciting to him. Give vague responses to his questions: “Oh, you want to know my story? You’ll have to work harder than that!” Ask more questions than you answer: “Enough about me—what about you? What’s your family like?"

      "content": "Tell the truth, even when it’s hard. Sagittarius are honest to a fault, and if you break his trust, he might not be able to see past it. [2] X Research source This fire sign craves authenticity in all of their relationships, so show him that you’re someone he can trust to tell it like it is—because he’ll love you for it. Sag men will be especially touched if you’re able to keep it real when it would be way easier to water down the truth. Share your real opinions. If he asks you whether you believe aliens are real, he wants your genuine take (and he’ll be able to tell if you haven't given it!). If you mess up, fess up. Even if you made a big mistake, you’ll earn points back with Sagittarius if you’re direct and apologetic. Don’t lie to fit in. He wants someone real; if your opinions change in big groups, that’ll be a red flag in his book."

      "content": "Keep things fun, light, and sunny. Sagittarius, maybe more than any other sign, loves to find the silver lining. In his mind, life is short—so why spend time moping around? If he likes you, he’ll want you two to get to truly relish each other’s company. So that means he’ll want your dates to be filled with jokes, dancing, and big smiles. Make him laugh. Why not get a little silly? If you show off your best impression, he’ll be obsessed with your goofy side. Actively seek out fun. Ice cream for breakfast, dancing to street musicians, and playing dress up at thrift stores—these are all Sag favorites."

      "content": "Make him feel challenged. This sign is energetic, dynamic, and maybe a little competitive. If you show him that you’re someone who can inspire him to think, grow, and improve, he’ll be thrilled. Start a friendly debate when you can, or look for ways that you can challenge him to reach for the stars in his own life. If he shares an opinion, politely disagree: “I actually think that “Concorde” is the best song on the album, it’s more complex.” When you two are out for a walk, why not challenge him to a race home? He’ll love all of the excitement you're able to create. Force him to think big. Say he says he dreams of leaving his hometown: “You could go anywhere! Why not make it your goal to travel the world?”"

      "content": "Wear outfits that suit your specific tastes—not the latest trends. Sagittarius likes authentic, free thinkers. So if he gets the sense that you wear whatever the fashion mags suggest, he might not be into that. He’d much rather you develop a distinct, personal style and see you stick to it. Our advice? Don’t overthink it. If you genuinely like your top and you feel amazing in your jeans, then that means you’re already dressing exactly how he’d love for you to."

      "content": "Wear bright purple clothes, accessories, and makeup. Though every Sag is different, this sign's signature hue is a bright, intoxicating purple. Some astrologers believe that people's eyes are drawn to their sign's color, so following that logic, a purple fit should give you an extra edge when attracting this fire sign. So, pull out your favorite violet garment, and wear it proudly! You could dress in neutral colors, then throw in one bright, lilac piece as an accent. If your eyes are brown or hazel, try a purple eye shadow (because this hue complements your piercing gaze!)."

[3] X Research source The downside: Sag’s gas tank never seems to turn off. If you’re getting close with this fire sign, you might need to up your daily caffeine intake.

He’s also a total social butterfly, so when he arrives at the party, everyone flocks to him in seconds. Sagittarius is a true Mr. Congeniality, and this trait can make him insanely fun to be around.

So when you’re getting to know Sag, expect challenging debates, discussions, and more! The downside: He can’t stand it when someone feels “fake.” He craves authenticity, so he’ll hate feeling like the person across the table is putting on airs. But the truth is, being 100% real 24/7 can be hard, so this sometimes, his constant desire for having meaningful conversations can be challenging."

If you’re looking to understand your resident Sagittarius, know that new experiences are a top priority for him—which means that traveling is his passion (and sometimes, sticking with the same routine stresses him out). The downside: His restlessness translates to relationships, too. Sag craves freedom, and for some of these fire signs, it takes a lot to settle down.
