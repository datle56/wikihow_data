[1] X Research source Mascara will make your brows look darker and fuller, and will also make the hairs appear a little longer, just like with your eyelashes. If you’re worried about using the same mascara wand on your brows and lashes, clean the wand between uses. Soak it in warm water and wipe off the softened makeup, then let the spoolie soak again for a minute in a makeup brush cleanser or a bit of rubbing alcohol. Rinse it and pat it dry with a paper towel. [2] X Research source"

Just follow the natural direction of each hair as you swipe on the mascara. This will help ensure that each hair is fully coated. [8] X Research source If you’re using a mascara that matches your natural brow color, don’t be afraid to push down and apply a little pressure. It’s okay if a little of it gets on your skin, as long as you stay within the natural borders of your eyebrows. If you’re using a darker mascara, be a little more cautious. Take it slow and make sure you’re just coating the hairs without getting any mascara on your skin. [9] X Research source"
