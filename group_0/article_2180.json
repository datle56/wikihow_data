Other examples include \"shell,\" \"lass,\" \"fizz,\" and \"ball.\""

Typically, to make a word past tense, you add \"-ed.\" To make it into a gerund (a verb that functions as a noun) or present participle (a verb with \"ing\" on the end), you add \"-ing.\" The trouble is the spelling rules change according to the vowel sound in the word. [3] X Trustworthy Source Understood Nonprofit organization dedicated to resources and support to people with thinking differences, such as ADHD or dyslexia Go to source If the vowel before the consonant is short, you double the consonant when adding the suffix, such as in the words \"winning,\" \"panned,\" \"stopping,\" and \"penning,\" formed from \"win,\" \"pan,\" \"stop,\" and \"pen,\" respectively. A suffix is an added ending to a word. If the vowel before the consonant is long, you use a single consonant when adding the suffix, such as in the words \"pined,\" \"paring,\" \"condoned,\" and \"naming,\" formed from \"pine,\" \"pare,\" \"condone,\" and \"named.\" Only double the consonant in 2-syllable words if the stress is on the second syllable, such as in \"preferred,\" \"admitted,\" or \"committed.\" [4] X Research source"

It doesn't rhyme as well, but it is more accurate. [5] X Research source For instance, \"fierce,\" \"tried,\" and \"friend\" all have \"i\" before \"e.\" However, \"perceive,\" \"receive,\" and \"conceive\" all use \"ei\" because they come after the \"c.\" The \"/ay/\"-sound rule comes into effect with words like \"neighbor,\" \"heinous,\" \"weigh,\" and \"feign.\" Of course, there are always exceptions. \"Weird,\" \"seizure,\" \"leisure,\" \"sieve,\" \"friend,\" and \"mischief\" don't follow these rules, for instance."

Suffixes in this category include \"-ible,\" \"-able,\" \"-ing,\" and \"-ous.\" When you add these to the end of the word where the \"e\" is not pronounced, you get rid of the \"e.\" [6] X Research source For example, \"pore\" becomes \"porous\"; \"forage\" becomes \"foraging\"; \"response\" turns into \"responsible\"; and \"move\" turns into \"movable.\" An exception to this rule is when you need to keep the soft pronunciation of \"-ce\" or \"-ge.\" Then, keep the \"e,\" such as in \"outrage\" turning to \"outrageous,\" \"notice\" becoming \"noticeable,\" or \"manage\" becoming \"manageable.\" Also, keep the second \"e\" when there's a double \"e\" at the end of the word, such as \"see\" in \"seeable\" or \"flee\" in \"fleeing.\" These \"Es\" are kept so that the pronunciation is correct."

Sometimes, an apostrophe joins 2 words together into a contraction, such as \"you are\" becoming \"you're.\" Other times, it makes a word possessive, such as \"the cat belonging to that person\" becoming \"the person's cat.\" [7] X Research source For instance, \"you have\" becomes \"you've,\" and \"they are\" becomes \"they're.\" For possessive words, \"the book Jessie owns\" becomes \"Jessie's book,\" while \"the cake the man owns\" changes to \"the man's cake.\" It gets a little more confusing with the word \"it.\" \"It's\" seems like it is possessive because of the apostrophe, but it is actually joining \"it is\" in a contraction. \"Its\" is the possessive form of \"it.\""

For instance, words like \"crush,\" \"buzz,\" \"fox,\" \"dish,\" \"loss,\" and \"echo\" become \"crushes,\" \"buzzes,\" \"foxes,\" \"dishes,\" \"losses,\" and \"echoes.\" Some exceptions to this rule include words like \"radios,\" \"typos,\" \"altos,\" and \"epochs.\" In the case of \"epochs,\" the \"-ch\" sounds like a hard \"k,\" which is why you don't add \"-es.\""

These 3 words can be difficult to spell correctly because they are so commonly used, and they're pronounced the same. \"Too\" is what you use to show that there's an excessive amount of something, such as \"She ate too much chocolate\" or \"They watched too much television.\" \"To\" is the form you use as a preposition before a noun, such as \"go to the store\" or \"run to the end of the block.\" \"Two\" refers to the number 2. [10] X Research source \"To\" usually indicates going somewhere, so to remember it, think of \"go\" and \"to\" each having just one \"o\" and one other letter. \"To\" is used as a preposition and an infinitive phrase conjunction.
