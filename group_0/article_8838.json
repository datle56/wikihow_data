      "title": "Look for flea markets or shops with costume jewelry.",
      "content": "Look for flea markets or shops with costume jewelry. This is the easiest way to collect scrap gold. Google flea markets and thrift shops near you. It’s best to look for larger flea markets with lots of vendors, as these events will concentrate the most potential gold in one spot. [1] X Research source Type something like “large flea markets near Columbus, Ohio” in the search box. Some flea markets might operate more like festivals and will only be open for business once per year."

      "content": "Visit the market in the morning. The earlier you get to the market or shop, the better. Aim to arrive 15 minutes before it opens so you can be one of the first visitors to take advantage of cool finds and great deals. Go for the costume jewelry displays first, then move on to the more expensive collections. [2] X Research source It’s best to schedule your gold hunt on a day when you don’t have anything else going on. Pick a day off from work or a free Saturday so you can spend hours looking for your treasures."

      "content": "Find a pocket-sized magnet to bring along. You can purchase a magnet online or at a local hardware store. Look for one that’s about the size of a domino. You can use this tool to test if jewelry is gold or just another metal that’s been plated with gold. The magnet won’t stick to real gold. Test clasps and other parts of jewelry separately. Sometimes a clasp will be plated, but the majority of the piece will be real gold."

      "title": "Search for markings showing the gold content of the piece.",
      "content": "Search for markings showing the gold content of the piece. Look for labels showing what type of gold the jewelry is. In the United States, most jewelry will be stamped as 10K, 14K, 18K, or 24K. The “K” stands for a karat (sometimes spelled carat), a measurement that indicates the amount of gold in an item. A 24K piece is pure gold. For jewelry made outside of the United States, you may just see numbers instead of karat markings. 10K translates to 417, 14K is 585, 18K is 750, and 24K is 999.

      "title": "Avoid jewelry with manufacturing markings.",
      "content": "Avoid jewelry with manufacturing markings. Some jewelry will be labeled with an assortment of letters. These markings show that the gold is plated. Stay away from the following: GE, which means gold electroplate. You may also see GP, which stands for gold plated. HGE, or heavy gold electroplate. GF for gold filled. HGP, or heavy gold plate. It’s also a good rule of thumb not to purchase jewelry with unusual or unidentifiable markings. These are usually a good indicator that it’s not gold. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Don’t spend over $10 USD per piece.",
      "content": "Don’t spend over $10 USD per piece. The only way to make money off your gold scrap is not to spend too much collecting it! Many flea markets will allow you to buy a whole bag of mixed costume jewelry for between $2 and $10 USD. [5] X Research source You can also choose to purchase individual pieces. And don’t forget to haggle! Offer your vendor less than their asking price and hesitate when they give you a higher counter-offer. You could say something like: “I can give you $2 instead of $5 for that bracelet.”"

      "title": "Be prepared for a small amount of gold scrap.",
      "content": "Be prepared for a small amount of gold scrap. Most electronics use gold as conductors. [6] X Research source While recycling computers and smartphones on a large scale can get you a fair bit of gold, you won’t get a lot out of a single computer. You should think of this as a fun DIY chemistry project rather than a money-making scheme. [7] X Research source If you’re really looking to make money by collecting scrap gold, stick with the flea markets. They’re safer and less time consuming. This experiment will probably result in less than 1 gram (0.035 oz) of gold, which will likely get you about $30 USD or less. If you do choose to salvage gold from your electronics, avoid taking apart cellphones. You’ll make more money returning phones to your provider."

      "content": "Find a ventilated spot and get protective gear. You’ll be using some very potent and dangerous chemicals. You either need a fume hood or a spot outside to make sure that the fumes don’t build up. You also need lab goggles, gloves, and a respirator. [8] X Research source Be sure to wear closed-toed shoes when working with these chemicals. Purchase lab goggles and gloves online to ensure that the material is strong enough to keep out the chemicals. You can find the respirator online or at a hardware store. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Disassemble your old computer to get to the motherboard. You can also take apart remotes and DVD, VCR, or CD players. Their circuit boards contain a bit of gold. [10] X Research source Open the electronics’ cases by unscrewing all the screws. For a computer, you should then cut out the wires to expose the motherboard. Remove the following gold-containing attachments from this board: [11] X Research source The central processing unit (or CPU), which will usually be covered with something called a heat sink. You may have to lift up on a lever to release this piece and remove the CPU from the motherboard. The PCI, which will look like a mini-motherboard containing gold fingers. This can just be ripped off the motherboard, unless there is a single screw attaching it. If so, unscrew it first. The RAM “sticks,” which are attached to the motherboard and may also contain gold fingers."

      "content": "Place your items in a strainer over a bowl. Find a plastic strainer and a slightly larger plastic bowl, so the two can be stacked. Put the gold fingers and any boards containing gold plating in the strainer. You will also need a glass plate that completely covers the stacked strainer and plate. [13] X Research source Glass and plastic can both hold up against the chemicals you’ll be using for this process. Do not use any metal containers, as the acids will corrode these materials. The acids you’ll add to the electronics will dissolve all the metal plating and other materials, leaving behind only the gold."

Pour the solution out into the beaker, leaving the gold scraps at the bottom of the bowl. [18] X Research source To make sure the filter doesn’t slip into the beaker, use a plastic funnel underneath it. To get as much gold as you can from the fingers, wash the fingers in water in a large bucket. Drain the water and add any gold scraps that rinse off to the other flakes. [19] X Research source You can pour the acid solution into a plastic container to store and reuse if you plan on repeating this process for more electronics. Once you’re ready to dispose of the acids, label the container and bring it to a hazardous waste disposal center. [20] X Research source"

      "content": "Refine scrap gold with acids to make it pure. Most scrap gold isn’t completely pure. Refining it will separate out any other metals and should give you 99.9% pure gold. Gather any scrap gold you’d like to refine. Weigh your gold on a kitchen scale so you know how much acid you’ll need to add. Then put the gold into a large glass beaker. [21] X Research source Go for a two or three-liter beaker to ensure you’ve got enough space. You’ll also need a glass watch glass, or cover. You can refine gold flakes collected from electronics or jewelry. Don’t refine 24K gold, as this already pure. Before you refine jewelry, contact local buyers. If they’re willing to give you a good price, skip the refining. [22] X Research source"
