Making negative comments about your bust size or other people’s bust size is a major obstacle in your quest to accept your bust size and improve your overall body image. Don’t allow yourself to talk or think negatively about your body and do not make negative comments about other people’s bodies. [1] X Research source Constantly making comments about your bust size can become a bad habit and even a fixation that will prevent you from accepting your large bust. You shouldn’t make negative comments about other people’s bodies because you wouldn’t want people to make those comments about yours. In addition, research suggests that when we say negative things about other people’s bodies, our brains actually internalize this message and we direct the message to ourselves."

      "content": "Be prepared for unwanted attention and negative stereotypes. Unfortunately, our society and culture often make false assumptions that women with large busts are sexually promiscuous and unintelligent. You can prepare to deal with these situations in advance, and challenge these negative assumptions in the process. Many women with large busts often receive unwanted male attention. Don't be afraid to be forceful if necessary and report inappropriate behavior to a teacher, supervisor, or the police. It's also not a bad idea for women to take a self-defense class and carry pepper spray. Rehearse your response to rude comments or sexual advances so you'll be ready even if taken by surprise. Sticking to conversation topics about class, business, and work helps send the message that you are smart and not merely a sexual object. Some women have reported that talking about their mothers and grandmothers forces guys to see them more as daughters or sisters rather than sex objects. Hopefully, guys will adjust their behavior accordingly. If possible, remove yourself from the situation and avoid people who objectify your body and make you feel bad about yourself."
