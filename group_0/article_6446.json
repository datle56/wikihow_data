      "content": "The trinity knot is a symbol made from three interconnected “leaves.” It’s a symbol of unity dating back to the days of ancient Celtic traditions. The trinity knot is made up of three loops, each coming to a point (almost resembling a three-pointed star) interlocking with one another to form a continuous knot with no visible beginning or end. [1] X Research source The trinity knot is also sometimes known as a “triquetra,” though “triquetra” is a general term for any symbol consisting of three arcs. So, “triquetra” applies to other famous symbols as well as the trinity knot, including the triskele: an ancient motif also associated with Celtic traditions, made of a triple spiral pattern."

      "content": "In love and relationships The Celtic trinity knot is very commonly associated with love, unity, commitment, and marriage. It’s a symbol of the unbreakable and enduring bond between loved ones, as well as eternal love. The trinity knot has no end—just like the kind of unending love that transcends time and space. [2] X Research source The three “leaves” of the Celtic trinity knot are also said to represent the past, present, and future, thus also symbolizing the joining of a couple who vow to love one another for life. Celtic trinity knots are a very popular design on engagement and wedding rings because of their association with eternal love."

      "title": "In Celtic culture",
      "content": "In Celtic culture In Celtic tradition, the trinity knot symbolizes the eternal cycle of existence: life, death, and rebirth. Because the trinity knot is made from interwoven loops, it reflects how one stage of existence continually leads into another. Beyond that, it can also be symbolic of the human experience, with the three loops representing the mind, body, and spirit. [3] X Research source The number three was significant for the Celtic people; thus, it’s possible the three loops of the trinity knot were also thought to represent the earth, sea, and sky, or the solar and lunar phases. The trinity knot can also take on secondary meanings when extra elements are added to it. For example, there’s a version of the trinity knot with a circle around it that symbolizes protection as well as unity."

      "title": "In religious & spiritual practices",
      "content": "In religious & spiritual practices The Celtic trinity knot has been used as both a pagan and Christian symbol. When it was adapted by Irish Christians, the three points of the trinity knot became symbols for the Holy Trinity: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This is reflected in art, metalwork, and religious texts from those early days of Irish Christianity. [4] X Research source The Book of Kells is one such religious text, containing the Gospels of the New Testament and created in either Ireland or Scotland. Its illustrations feature many examples of Christian iconography, including the Celtic knot . [5] X Research source"

      "content": "The triquetra has appeared in art and ceramics since the Iron Age. Although its exact origins are difficult to pinpoint, one thing is clear: the triquetra (and, by extension, the trinity knot) is an ancient symbol. It’s believed that the triquetra became a more common symbol by the 4th century BC, and its appearance was widespread, from Persian ceramics to runestones in Northern Europe. [6] X Research source The triquetra was also featured on ceramics and coins from Anatolia (Asia Minor, or the land roughly making up modern-day Turkey) and early Germanic coins. The triquetra was also used in Japan (though it was called the Musubi Mitsugashiwa) as one of the signs of the Iakšaku dynasty. Through Buddhist traditions, it spread to China, Korea, and the Kingdom of Khotan."

      "content": "The triquetra was also adopted into ancient Celtic culture. Again, it’s unclear exactly when the triquetra became a recurring theme in Celtic designs, though it definitely originated before Christianity arrived in Ireland. Among pagans and ancient Celts, it was a symbol of the natural world. Later, around 400 AD, it was adopted by early Christians to become a symbol of the Holy Trinity as well. [7] X Research source The trinity knot appears on famous artifacts like the Book of Durrow (an illuminated manuscript gospel dating back to around 700 AD) and the Killaghtee Cross (a gravestone marking the grave of a monk, dating back to 650 AD).

In modern Wiccan and pagan practices, the triquetra is used to symbolize the Triple Goddess: Maiden, Mother, and Crone . Norse and Viking cultures recognize it as a symbol of interconnectedness and the cycle of life. And, of course, it’s widely seen as a Celtic symbol—and thus associated with having a Celtic heritage. [9] X Research source The Celtic trinity knot is remarkably versatile, which is why it’s so universally recognized, even outside of Celtic culture!"

For example, the WB show Charmed used the triquetra as a symbol on the Book of Shadows (a book of spells used by the Halliwell sisters). It’s also shown on Thor’s hammer, Mjolnir, in Marvel movies featuring the superhero (including the original Thor ). In The Walking Dead , a triquetra was depicted on Michonne’s katana (because it’s a symbol of the triple goddess). In the Call of Duty games, you can see a triquetra on the Treyarch logo (the developer that makes the games). In the Netflix series Dark , the triquetra is used for its association with the past, present, and future."
