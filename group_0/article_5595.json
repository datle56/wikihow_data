      "content": "Welcome people as they arrive. This is a great opportunity to set the tone, encourage people to speak up, and direct people to the seating area. [1] X Research source Keep your body language casual by smiling and moving about the entry way. Use casual greetings. You could try a simple, “Good morning. How've you been?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Make small talk.",
      "content": "Make small talk. Have brief, casual conversations with attendees. Remember to keep your topics professional. [2] X Research source Use small talk to establish your role as chairperson in a relaxed manner. This is your opportunity to speak to attendees in your official role as meeting host. Say, \"Have you seen that news article about safer playground equipment for parks?\" Choose topics related to the meeting's agenda so that you can gently move attendees toward the meeting's objective. For example, if your meeting is related to park services, choose topics like recent park improvements or stories that take place in the park."

    {
      "title": "Start on time.",
      "content": "Start on time. Set an exact starting time and a projected end time. Stick to your schedule because delaying the start of a meeting costs the organization the time of each individual who sits waiting. [3] X Research source If someone crucial to your meeting has not arrived or you are lacking a necessary quorum, address your attendees to let them know of the delay in that person's arrival. Begin the meeting and use the delay time as an open forum. Direct the discussion so that people are not sitting around waiting. Keep in mind that if you start late, there is a likelihood that people will still leave at the originally scheduled end time because they may have scheduled other meetings or activities for later in the day."

      "title": "Stand up.",
      "content": "Stand up. When the time arrives to start the meeting, rise from your seat to get the attention of the attendees and signal that you are about to begin. By standing, you communicate that you are in command of the room."
    },
    {
      "title": "Greet the attendees.",
      "content": "Greet the attendees. Begin speaking with a generalized opening remark. This signals the opening of the meeting and draws the attention of anyone who is still occupied with a side conversation or off-task activity, such as scrolling through work email on a cell phone. For example, say, “Good morning. Thank you for joining us today.” Avoid informal greetings, such as “Hey, everyone.” This will set the wrong tone."
    },
    {
      "title": "Introduce yourself.",
      "content": "Introduce yourself. Briefly provide your name and state your position. Even if the attendees know you, it's important to establish that you are the chairperson. This is also the time to introduce any speakers. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Announce your call to order.",
      "content": "Announce your call to order. As the chairperson, you are responsible for establishing a start time for the record. The minutes start after the official call to order. As part of your call to order, you will also state the date and time for the record. [5] X Research source At a formal meeting, say, “I call this meeting to order at 11:30 AM on Thursday, May 4, 2017.” If your meeting is informal, you can vary your speech, but it's still important to state that the meeting has begun. Rather than saying that the meeting is called to order, you could say, “We are beginning this meeting at 11:30 AM on Thursday, May 4, 2017.”"

      "content": "State the purpose of the meeting. Remind the attendees of the meeting's objective. As the chairperson, it is your responsibility to make sure that everyone understands what is expected from the meeting and that everyone is on-task for the duration of the meeting.

      "content": "Conduct the meeting . Take your seat and follow the agenda to continue the meeting. As the meeting chair, you should ensure that the meeting stays on task and that everyone's input is heard.

      "title": "Make eye contact.",
      "content": "Make eye contact. Eye contact increases attention, makes you more noticeable, and convinces people that what you're saying is important. In a meeting setting, shift your gaze around the room as you speak, making eye contact with each person as your gaze passes over the room. If you are uncomfortable, look at the center of their nose instead. Get comfortable with eye contact beforehand by practicing on your friends, family, and coworkers. Start by looking at their foreheads, then move to the center of their noses. Finally, make eye contact for a few seconds at a time, slowly progressing to consistent eye contact while speaking."

      "content": "Lean in. When speaking with someone, lean towards them to show that you are interested in what they're saying and that you are active in the conversation.
