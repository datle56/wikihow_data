      "content": "Use a silicon pan for cakes that use runny batters. Silicon pans with glass bottoms protect against leaks better than most metal pans. Leakage from your pan can ruin your cake and make an unwanted mess in the oven. [1] X Research source Silicon pans peel off the cake much like a wrapper and are easy to store due to their flexibility."

      "content": "Check the pan for any leaks. Fill your springform pan with water and hold over the sink to inspect it for leaks. Leakage can occur where the outer ring attaches to the base and sometimes near the sidewall latch. If leakage occurs, wrap your pan in 2 layers of tin foil. [3] X Research source Expect most springform pans to leak a little bit."

      "title": "Grease the pan to ensure quality cooking and prevent the cake from sticking.",
      "content": "Grease the pan to ensure quality cooking and prevent the cake from sticking. Apply butter, oil, or cooking spray to your entire pan. Even with nonstick pans, it is a good idea to gently coat the pan to prevent your cake from sticking. Parchment paper can also be placed on the base of the pan to further prevent sticking on the bottom. [4] X Research source The parchment paper will help you release the cake from the pan after baking so you don't have to cut on the base. It's usually a good idea to also cut a strip of parchment paper to line the side of the pan."

      "title": "Fill the pan with the proper ingredients for your recipe.",
      "content": "Fill the pan with the proper ingredients for your recipe. If your cake has layers, gently add the ingredients of each layer to avoid the layers getting mixed together. This will ensure your cake looks great and cooks as it is supposed to. Springform pans work great for cheesecakes, kuchens with fruit toppings, and tortes since you don't have to flip the pan over to remove the cake. [5] X Research source"

You can also place your pan in a slightly larger cake pan before putting it into the water bath to avoid exposure to excessive moisture.

For most cakes insert a toothpick into the top of the cake to see if any batter sticks. If nothing is on the toothpick, the cake is done.

If you are using a nonstick pan, use a rubber spatula instead of a knife to avoid damaging the non-stick coating of the pan. [10] X Research source"
