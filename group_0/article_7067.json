      "title": "Look for changes to the cat's coat.",
      "content": "Look for changes to the cat's coat. A cat's fur is usually lustrous, but if your cat has worms, its coat might become dull or flat looking. [4] X Research source Small Animal Internal Medicine. Nelson &amp; Couto. Publisher: Mosby. This can occur because of dehydration or poor absorption of nutrients resulting from the parasite infection. [5] X Research source Small Animal Internal Medicine. Nelson &amp; Couto.

      "title": "Check your cat's gums.",
      "content": "Check your cat's gums. A healthy cat has pink gums, much like our own. If your cat's gums are pale or white, this could be a sign that it is anemic. A common explanation for this can be a parasite infection. [6] X Research source Small Animal Internal Medicine. Nelson &amp; Couto. Publisher: Mosby. To check your cat's gums, sit him or her in your lap or next to you, gently grasp the cat's head in your hands, under the jaw and behind the ears. Use your fingertips to lift the flap of the cat's upper lip so that the gums above the teeth are exposed. [7] X Research source Small Animal Internal Medicine. Nelson &amp; Couto. Publisher: Mosby. If the gums are pale, you should contact your vet as soon as possible."

      "title": "Examine your cat's feces.",
      "content": "Examine your cat's feces. If your cat uses a litter box, it is easy to keep an eye on its feces. Watch for the following symptoms: Dark, tarry stools may indicate blood loss from where hookworms attached themselves to the wall of the intestine. [8] X Research source Small Animal Internal Medicine. Nelson &amp; Couto. Publisher: Mosby. Diarrhea can occur because worms also take up space within the gut and interfere with digestion. [9] X Research source Small Animal Internal Medicine. Nelson &amp; Couto. Publisher: Mosby. If your cat has diarrhea for more than 24 hours, or if you see fresh blood or dark tarry stools, seek veterinary help."

    {
      "title": "Watch for vomiting.",
      "content": "Watch for vomiting. Vomiting is common among cats. If it occurs frequently, however, your cat should see the vet, as this may be a sign of worms or some other health problem. [10] X Research source Small Animal Internal Medicine. Nelson &amp; Couto. Publisher: Mosby. Worms can cause vomiting either by blocking the outflow to the stomach or by irritating the stomach lining. [11] X Research source Small Animal Internal Medicine. Nelson &amp; Couto. Publisher: Mosby."

    {
      "title": "Pay attention to how much your cat eats.",
      "content": "Pay attention to how much your cat eats. A high worm burden is usually associated with a loss of appetite. [12] X Research source Small Animal Internal Medicine. Nelson &amp; Couto. Publisher: Mosby. This is due to a number of factors such as inflammation of the bowel lining, stomach ache, and the physical space the worms take up within the bowel. [13] X Research source Small Animal Internal Medicine. Nelson &amp; Couto. Publisher: Mosby."

    {
      "title": "Look for changes in the shape of your cat's body.",
      "content": "Look for changes in the shape of your cat's body. Cats with a lot of worms may develop a potbelly, causing the abdominal area to look swollen. [14] X Research source Small Animal Internal Medicine. Nelson &amp; Couto. Publisher: Mosby. Like vomiting, this is a general symptom and can happen for a variety of reasons, but this sign is sufficient to warrant a trip to the vet, whatever the underlying cause.

    {
      "title": "Notice signs of lethargy.",
      "content": "Notice signs of lethargy. If the worms are stealing nutrition direct from the bowel, the cat or kitten will feel lethargic, appear listless, and lack energy. [16] X Research source Small Animal Internal Medicine. Nelson &amp; Couto. Publisher: Mosby. Pay attention to any dramatic changes in your cat's energy level. Again, this can be a symptom of many different ailments, and is one that warrants a vet check up. [17] X Research source Small Animal Internal Medicine. Nelson &amp; Couto. Publisher: Mosby. You know your cat's normal energy level best, so keep your eye out for any sudden reduction in energy or playfulness."

      "title": "Check for eggs in the cat's feces.",
      "content": "Check for eggs in the cat's feces. Put on some disposable plastic gloves and use a disposable tool such as a popsicle stick to examine feces in the litter box for signs of parasites. Tapeworms may leave egg packets stuck to the surface of the stool. These look like sesame or cucumber seeds, and sometimes wriggle and move. [18] X Research source Small Animal Internal Medicine. Nelson &amp; Couto. Publisher: Mosby. It is unusual to see a whole tapeworm in cat feces, but they look like flat, cream-colored worms made up of many segments. An adult tapeworm can reach about two feet (60 centimeters) in length. [19] X Research source Small Animal Internal Medicine. Nelson &amp; Couto. Publisher: Mosby. Roundworm eggs are too small to see with the naked eye, but sometimes whole worms do pass out in the feces, or may even be vomited up. Roundworms look like spaghetti: long and smooth and about the same diameter as a strand of pasta. An adult roundworm is usually just three to six inches long. [20] X Research source Small Animal Internal Medicine. Nelson &amp; Couto. Publisher: Mosby. Hookworm eggs are also too small to see. An adult hookworm is likewise tiny, measuring a mere two to three millimeters long, and therefore also difficult to detect.

      "title": "Check your cat's anus.",
      "content": "Check your cat's anus. Tapeworm eggs packets migrate out of the cat's anus and stick to the fur. Thus, you can safely conclude your cat has tapeworms if you see creamy-white egg packets, which look like sesame seeds, clinging to the cat's fur. [22] X Research source Small Animal Internal Medicine. Nelson &amp; Couto. Publisher: Mosby."

      "title": "Examine your cat's bedding and other favorite spots.",
      "content": "Examine your cat's bedding and other favorite spots. Egg packets sometimes get stuck on places where the cat has sat, such as bedding or soft furniture, so check these areas if you suspect your cat may have worms."

      "title": "Call your veterinarian to schedule an exam.",
      "content": "Call your veterinarian to schedule an exam. If you are concerned your cat may have worms, one of the most reliable ways to find out is to submit a fecal sample for analysis to your local veterinary clinic. The sample will be looked at under a microscope to detect worm eggs. Each worm type has different shaped eggs and so this is the most effective way to determine what type (or types) of worms your cat may have. [23] X Research source Interpretation of Laboratory Results for Small Animal Clinicians. Bush. Publisher: Blackwell. When you call the vet, describe any symptoms your cat may be displaying."

    {
      "title": "Collect a stool sample.",
      "content": "Collect a stool sample. If you are asked to collect a sample, you'll need to gather up some of your cat's feces and store the collection container until your appointment. Worm eggs are hearty, but for best results, keep the container in a cool, dark place such as a garage or shady shed. [24] X Research source Interpretation of Laboratory Results for Small Animal Clinicians. Bush. Publisher: Blackwell. Do not keep the container in a room where food is prepared, and always wash your hands after collecting a fecal sample. [25] X Research source Interpretation of Laboratory Results for Small Animal Clinicians. Bush. Publisher: Blackwell. To decrease the chances of a false negative on the fecal test, some vets will ask for a pooled sample, which means collecting three bowel movements from three separate days in the same container.
