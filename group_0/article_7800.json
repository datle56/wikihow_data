      "content": "Fill a large container with lukewarm water and wet several clean rags. Find a container or tub large enough to hold your gourds and fill it with lukewarm water. Then, grab several clean towels and submerge them in the water until they’re dripping wet. [1] X Research source Do not use hot water, as this can cause the gourd to crack. For extra cleaning power , add 1 tbsp (15 ml) of bleach per gallon (3.8 l) of water in the container. The bleach helps kill mold and bacteria on the gourd. [2] X Research source If you don’t want to use bleach , add a squirt of liquid dish soap. This can also help clean and disinfect the outside of the gourd. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Put the gourds in the container and cover them with towels. Place the gourds inside the tub of water so at least one side of each gourd is submerged. Dried gourds float, so cover the sides of the gourds that aren’t in the water with the wet towels.

Just let the gourds soak for about 15 to 30 minutes. [5] X Research source To help soften the gourds’ skin further, turn the gourds over about halfway through the soaking process so the other side is submerged in the water."

      "content": "Scrub the gourds with a metal dish scrubber or scouring sponge . Hold the gourd in the water and use an abrasive scrubber or sponge to remove the dried skin and layers of mold and dirt. Just press hard enough to scrub away the debris but not so hard that you scratch the gourd. [7] X Research source It usually takes some elbow grease and a few minutes of scrubbing to completely clean the gourd. Don’t forget to scrub the stem, too! It's normal for some of the mold and dirt to stain the gourd. You can sand away these spots when the gourd is fully dry, which we explain below. Avoid using steel wool to clean your gourds, as it tends to leave metal particles on the gourd."

Then, grab a gourd scraping tool, spoon, or clay sculpting tool and drag it against the sides and bottom of the gourd. This gets rid of dried pulp and skin you couldn’t remove with your hands and smooths the interior of the gourd. [14] X Research source Shake the gourd over a trash can or trash bag to get all of the debris out. Note : If you’re making a birdhouse, you don’t have to scrape out the inside. Birds don’t mind the debris and often use it to build their nests. If the opening is too small or the pulp and seeds are in a tough ball, soak the gourd in warm water for 30 minutes to loosen the debris. After cleaning the inside, let the gourd completely air dry. Save the pulp and seeds for fun projects, like planting gourds or creating pulp sculptures."

[20] X Research source Your gourds are fully dry when they feel light and you can hear the seeds rattling around inside. It might take your gourd more or less than 6 weeks to dry.

Just remove any gourds that shrivel up or grow soft."
