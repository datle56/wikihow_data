      "content": "Let your boss know as soon as possible. The earlier you let them know, the more time they’ll have to prepare for your absence. If you woke up sick on a day you’re scheduled to work, that’s okay—just let your boss know as soon as you can! It will look better for you if you give your boss some advance notice rather than waiting until the last minute (or until your scheduled shift has already started). [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Share only the necessary details. Sometimes when you’re sick it can be tempting to share a list of all your symptoms with your boss to really show them just how sick you are, but try to avoid it. [2] X Research source You’re not obligated to share all of the messy, sniffly details, and your boss doesn’t need to know them either. They just need to know that you’re sick and not able to work today. Keep things brief by saying something like: ”I’m feeling very ill today.” ”Unfortunately, I’m sick with the flu.” ”I have a fever and I think I’m coming down with something.”"

      "content": "Assure your boss that your work will be covered if necessary. If you have work that needs to be covered while you're off, like a shift or a meeting you were supposed to host, ask a coworker to cover for you while you’re out sick if you’re able to. Then, let your boss know that you’ve already handled it when you text them. They’ll appreciate that you took the initiative. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep things professional in your text.",
      "content": "Keep things professional in your text. Texting is more casual than email or a phone call, but you still want to make sure you’re being professional since you’re communicating with your boss. Include a greeting (“Hi, Stacy”) at the beginning of your text, and use full sentences and proper grammar throughout."

      "title": "Texting in sick for one day:",
      "content": "Texting in sick for one day: If you just need to take one day off, let your boss know that you’re planning on returning to work tomorrow. Try texting them something like: \"Hello, Mark. I have a cold and I don’t think I’m going to be able to make it in today. I’ll be back in the office tomorrow.” \"Hi, Jan. I’m feeling ill today and I won’t be able to make my shift later. Sam agreed to cover for me until I’m back tomorrow.” \"Good morning. I started feeling sick last night and I’m not feeling better today, so I’m going to have to take a sick day. I’ll make sure to catch up on what I’ve missed when I’m back in the office tomorrow.”"

      "content": "Texting in sick for multiple days: If you think you’re going to be out sick for more than one day, try to give your boss a heads up when you text them. Text them something along the lines of: \"Hi, Elize. Unfortunately, I have the flu and I’m feeling very ill, so I think I’ll need to take the rest of the week off. While I’m out, Max will be helping with my workload. I’ll be back on Monday morning.” \"Hey, Travis. I’m feeling pretty ill because of a stomach bug and I don’t think I’ll be in today or tomorrow. I’m planning on returning to work on Friday.” \"Good morning. I’m very sick with a fever at the moment and need to take a few days off to recover. I’m hoping to be back on Thursday. In the meantime, Erin agreed to lead the team meetings.”"

Try texting them something like: \"Hi, Jordan. I’m feeling very ill today and won’t be able to log on for the day. I’m hoping to be back online tomorrow, but I’m not sure how I’ll be feeling. I will keep you updated.” \"Hello, Tia. I came down with a fever last night and I’m not feeling well this morning. I may need to take a few days off but I will keep you posted. Sarah is going to help with training until I’m back.” \"Good morning. I scheduled a doctor’s appointment today because I haven’t been feeling well for the past couple of days. I’m hoping to feel well enough to return to work in the next couple of days, but I will let you know.”"

      "content": "It depends on your relationship with your boss and what they prefer. If you and your boss normally text each other, sending them a text that you can’t make it in today most likely won’t be a problem. On the other hand, if you and your boss don’t usually text, calling in or sending them an email is probably a safer bet. [4] X Research source Some managers (and companies) have specific policies for requesting sick days, in which case you would want to follow whatever those policies say to do. [5] X Research source If you’re not sure, ask your boss if they have a preference. After you let them know you won’t be able to work, end with something like, “In the future, would it be okay if I texted you that I’m sick, or do you prefer me to call in or email you instead?” Some bosses actually prefer when you let them know over text. It’s quicker and more efficient than a phone call or email. It just depends on what your boss’ preference is!"
