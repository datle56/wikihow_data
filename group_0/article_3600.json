      "content": "Write down a list of your skills and interests. Figure out what being interesting means to you. What's interesting won't be the same for everybody and for everybody. Knowing what you are interested in is essential to becoming more adept at interacting with others in a way that might be seen as more interesting. Hone your skills by learning about what you are good at. This is a much easier approach instead of trying to force yourself to learn more about something that you don't have any interest in. [1] X Research source Think about qualities and activities that are fascinating to you. What do you think is interesting, either about yourself or about other people? It is also much easier to converse about topics that you already have some interest in, as opposed to simply acting interested in others' lives simply to make them happy."

      "title": "Think about what “interesting” might mean to other people.",
      "content": "Think about what “interesting” might mean to other people. Determining what is “interesting” – and how you can attain this quality – will probably depend on your own unique skill set as well as the group of people you enjoy being around the most. If you consider yourself a pretty good musician, for example, and enjoy hanging around musically inclined people, then being interesting will likely involve a working knowledge of music and how to play an instrument. On the other hand, such elements might not be so important to being an interesting person if you are someone who's primarily interested in sports or cars. This doesn't mean that you should completely tailor your conversations for other people. If you're not interested in what you're saying, then you're not going to be as interesting. Strive to be genuine while being interesting."

      "title": "Embrace your uniqueness.",
      "content": "Embrace your uniqueness. Recognize that you are already an interesting person. You may become a more interesting person for other people when you highlight some of your unique qualities. This might sound paradoxical at first, but it really just means that striving to be yourself is the best way to appear most comfortable. This, in turn, will make others more comfortable around you. Remember that you are a whole and complete person with inherent self-worth. Everybody makes mistakes, but that doesn't make you less amazing!

You inject more excitement into your life. You meet new people. Be open to trying new activities so that you learn to be a little more fearless.

      "content": "Build your personality traits by trying out concrete activities. Your goal to become more interesting might involve becoming more courageous or being friendlier. But it's difficult to achieve these traits unless you have a specific plan in place. Try out concrete activities or skills, instead of focusing on building one of your personality traits. For example, instead of convincing yourself you need to be more courageous, you might try simply participating in an activity that produces some degree of fear when you think about it. Or, you could try rock climbing if you are afraid of heights, or visit a petting zoo if you are afraid of animals. By pushing yourself out of your comfort zone, you might eventually become more comfortable with participating in activities you or others might find interesting."

      "content": "Learn to engage with others about their interests. It's important to learn how to engage with others even when you're not interested in the topic that's being discussed. Conversation is like a back and forth negotiation with another person. The conversation can go in any direction. Remaining open to this process is important for becoming a more interesting person. Ask questions to show that you are interested in. This also opens up the conversation to give you more material, which helps you figure out more questions to ask. For example, if you find out that a person is an expert beekeeper, you could ask, \"I've always wanted to get into beekeeping. How does a person get started doing that?\" You're allowing the other person to share his expertise with others, something most people are thrilled to do. If you're talking with someone about her job, you might ask, \"Did you always want to be a journalist?\" Or you might ask, \"Which journalist do you admire most?\" [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Learn to shake off insults or disrespect from other people. Everyone has their own interests and manners of acting in the world. It will be impossible to make yourself seem interesting to everyone. Be happy with who you truly are. Accept that not everyone will find you interesting, or even necessarily like you. This can, in turn, make you more interesting to the people who actually respect your unique sense of self. Give this person the benefit of the doubt. Say to yourself, \"This person is probably having a bad day.\" Then say something nice to the person. This might jar him enough to recognize that he's being rude. You could try exaggerating the insult, which also functions to make a mockery of the insult. If someone says, \"I've seen lots of people learn to ski more quickly than you,\" you might say, \"I've only just learned how to walk upright, so I guess I'm going at a good pace.\" [11] X Research source If you want to become more emotionally resilient, you can try meditating.

      "content": "Become an active listener. Oftentimes, you can be an interesting person simply by allowing those around you to say what's on their mind without interrupting or imposing any sort of moral judgment. While this might sound easy, it can actually be a particularly difficult thing. This is especially true if you're used to saying exactly what's on your mind without pause for concern. Active listening means that you are following along actively with what another person is saying without forcing your own ideas and thought into the conversation. [16] X Research source Active listening also means that you remain attentive to what's being conveyed without necessarily trying to think forward towards what you want to say next. Next time somebody is trying to tell you a story, try simply letting them speak for as long as they feel compelled to do so, all the while allowing yourself to be affected by what they are saying. Watch for changes in facial expression or tone of voice. Good listening requires paying attention to non-verbal features just as much as what's said. [17] X Research source People typically like being around others who give them a chance to speak what's on their mind."
