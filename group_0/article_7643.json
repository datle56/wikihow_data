Lacquered brass does not tarnish and usually has a clear coat covering it. If your brass tarnishes easily and has no coating, it is unlacquered. [1] X Research source Often, brass will indicate if it's lacquered or unlacquered on purchase. If you still have the package, you can check to see if your brass is lacquered or unlacquered using that. It's also a good idea to make sure your brass is genuine brass and not just plated or imitation. Cleaning methods used for real brass could damage plated/imitation brass.
