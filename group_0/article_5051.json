      "content": "Pick the right notebook. Believe it or not, you don’t need a fancy notebook to bullet journal—all you actually need is a notebook that you can easily transport from place to place. Any type of notebook can get the job done, like a notebook with an elastic , or even a Moleskine notebook . A decorative notebook, or one with existing sections, is not necessary for bullet journaling since you'll be doing all the organizing on your own. You can personalize the notebook a bit if you’d like, though! If you love the color blue, for instance, you could invest in a blue notebook. You don't have to stick to lined notebooks, either. You could work with dotted notebooks, grid notebooks, and blank notebooks. It's all up to you! Lines and dots can be a built-in grid so you can easily trace it The official Bullet Journal brand sells a great bullet journal made with the LEUCHTTURM1917 notebook ."

      "content": "Create an index. Bullet journal pages are designed to be numbered and tracked in an index. This index helps you track which sections fall on which pages. The first blank spread (the first two blank pages that fall side by side) will be your index. To get started, simply write \"Index\" on the top of both pages. You can write in pen or pencil using whatever color you’d like. However, pencil fades over time. If you want to read this a year or two in the future, it's best to use a pen."

Your future log is a way of getting a bird's eye view of tasks you need to complete within the next six months. It will include a month-by-month breakdown of events, tasks, and goals. To start, divide each page into 3 even vertical sections. Use a ruler to draw three straight lines down the spread, dividing it into three equal sections on each page. [1] X Research source For example, if each page has 24 lines make three sections on each page of 8 lines each."

[2] X Research source Be sure to write page numbers on the corners of each page. As your future log in your first section, the page numbers should be one and two.

After you finish, write down the abbreviation of the day of the week next to the number. On the right page, jot down your task list for the month, using bullet points to make a list of all the goals you hope to complete, any bills you have to pay, and any deadlines you need to meet.

When the day ends, make a new entry in the line below for the next day. [4] X Research source A bullet journal is meant to be brief, so try to use short, simple sentences. For example, something simple like do not say, \"Called vet to ask about cat's vaccinations. Rabies due.\" would be better than \"Today, I called the vet to discuss the cat's vaccinations, including the rabies vaccines that is due.\""

There are no set rules about establishing signifiers—it heavily depends on the types of events you choose to journal. Feel free to break down events into categories, such as work, school, bills, personal, creative projects, etc. Each type of event should have a different bullet point signifying its type, but it's best to only use a few categories to keep things from getting confusing. [6] X Research source For example, creative goals could be signified with a star, work could be signified by a simple bullet point, hobbies could be signified by an arrow, bills could be signified by a small dollar sign, and personal topics could be signified by a heart. As you track your goals on your daily calendar, use your signifiers to keep things organized! For example, an entry may look something like, \"$ Paid Cable Bill today.\""

Under \"Weight and Fitness Goals,\" for example, you could write something like, \"Visit the gym 12 times this month.\""
