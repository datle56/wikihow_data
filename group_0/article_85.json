      "content": "With the 3-day rule, a couple agrees to take a break from an argument. Sometimes, after a really heated argument that’s left both partners in a couple reeling or reconsidering where the relationship is heading, they may agree to put a pause on the argument (and maybe even each other) to reflect and calm down. [1] X Research source Couples commonly take 3 days apart—hence, the 3-day rule. The 3-day rule gives both parties in the relationship time to think before acting or speaking. During a heated argument, it may be necessary to give one another time and space to collect your thoughts and cool down. Not taking space may result in one or both partners saying things they don’t mean or rushing to resolve the disagreement prematurely for the sake of being on good terms again, without taking time to really reflect.

While on the surface taking a break from your partner after a fight or disagreement may seem like avoidance, this technique is actually rooted in patience, self-awareness, consideration, and personal accountability. [3] X Research source Partners who employ the 3-day rule realize that things said or done in the heat of an argument are usually short-sighted and later regretted; the 3-day rule is an attempt to avoid lashing out or acting irrationally."

For some couples, taking a 20-minute break is helpful, while for others, a break is unnecessary. [4] X Research source Some couples may generally resolve all or most of their arguments in the moment and not typically need a 3-day rule. Meanwhile, depending on the argument, other couples may need to take a break of longer than 3 days to resolve their issues. Some couples cut off all contact for 3 days, but depending on your relationship, logistics, and the nature of the argument, you may opt to go low-contact or see each other as usual, but avoid discussing the argument."

[5] X Research source Agree to any ground rules ahead of time, and plan out when and how you’ll reconnect at the end of the break. For instance, will you talk at all (if you live together or have kids, you'll likely have to)? Or will you take a total break from them? Establish where you’ll meet again after the break. Depending on the subject, you may want to meet at home or in a neutral space such as a park or café to resume your discussion. Regardless of what rules you implement, be sure you and your partner are both aware of them and consent to them—otherwise, it’s not “the 3-day rule,” it’s just “the silent treatment.” [6] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source"

[7] X Research source This may mean limited or no texting, calling, or social media interaction. Depending on your relationship, you may have to interact sometimes—such as if you have a kid together or live together—but you can control in what ways you’ll interact.

This way, when you and your partner come back together, you’ll feel more relaxed and like yourself. [8] X Research source Spend time outside in nature or meditate to feel calmer and more collected. Be sure to get good quality sleep so you feel rested and rejuvenated when you reconnect with your partner. Engage yourself in a new hobby or any activity that makes you feel more like yourself.

Consider how you feel about the situation—and how you felt in the heat of the moment. Now that the adrenaline from the original argument has worn off, do you feel any differently? Do you regret anything you said or did in the heat of the moment? [10] X Research source Try to understand where your partner is coming from as well. Consider how their perspective on things may have affected their behavior during the fight. [11] X Research source While distractions can help you calm down, you also need dedicated time to reflect on the argument and your feelings about it. It may be uncomfortable to sit with the tension, hurt, or regret leftover from the argument, but it’s essential in order to move through it. Journaling is a great way to work through tough emotions. Try free-writing what you’re feeling to overcome writer’s block and get to the heart of your emotions. You might even consider writing a letter to your partner. This could be an effective way to get your feelings out, even if you don’t end up giving it to them."

In your time apart from your partner, consider what issue(s) lying under the surface might have contributed to your disagreement, and think about how you and/or your partner might go about discussing and improving the issue(s). [12] X Research source Speaking to a therapist may help you work through underlying problems. If you’re not already seeing a therapist, it may not be feasible to schedule an appointment during your 3 days, but depending on the issue, it may be worth looking into even after your break is up. You and your partner may also find couples counseling a useful tool to address underlying problems in your relationship."

I interpreted this to mean you felt I overreacted, but let me know if I’m misunderstanding.” [16] X Research source Listen to their viewpoint without making any judgments. Try to get as thorough of an understanding of their side of things as you can before offering your perspective. That means listening without interrupting.

When you’re in the midst of a heated disagreement, it can be tempting to dredge up your partner’s past offenses, but this will only expand the argument and cause you both to lose focus on the actual issue at hand. More importantly, it can cause you both unnecessary hurt and stress. [17] X Research source Sometimes past wounds may contribute to conflict in the present, and they may need to be addressed. But if you've resolved a past issue and/or it has no bearing on the current conflict, avoid rehashing the argument—even if you really want to. If you do feel it's necessary to address a past issue, introduce the subject gently so your partner doesn't feel blindsided or attacked, and clarify how the issues are connected: \"You canceling our date because of work hurts even more before because it reminds me of how things were at your last job. I felt really abandoned back then, and I'm worried it'll happen again.\""

If you need to delay a discussion because you're tired, stressed, or otherwise not able to engage fully and patiently, gently communicate this to your partner: \"I want to talk about this with you, but could we wait until after dinner?

The partner who needs a break from the discussion might say something like, “I’m feeling worked up and I think I need a timeout. Can we talk about this in the morning?” Regardless of whether you and your partner unanimously opt to employ the 3-day rule, if you want to put a discussion on pause, it’s important to give your partner a timeframe by which you’d like to return to the subject, for accountability: “Could we talk more tomorrow evening?” is more specific than “Can we continue this another time?”"
