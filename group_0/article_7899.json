      "title": "Wait for the mud to dry.",
      "content": "Wait for the mud to dry. You may be eager to clean your shoes off right away, but trying to wipe the mud off before it has dried can actually stain the fibers of your shoe. Put your shoes somewhere warm and dry--outdoors in direct sunlight, if possible. Don't put your shoes by a radiator or other direct source of heat to dry, as this can warp the plastic and alter the shape of the shoe. [1] X Research source If it's humid, damp, or there's no sunlight, dry your shoes with a household fan. Either put the shoes on a towel or plastic tray with the top facing the fan (so the air gets inside the shoe), or use an over the door hook (or \"S\" shaped hook) to hang the shoes directly on the grill of the fan. [2] X Research source Don't leave your shoes outdoors overnight. They'll just get damp again."

      "content": "Beat your shoes together or against a hard surface to remove the dried mud. The mud will chip and flake off, and you should be able to get most of the mud off your shoe. If you can get the shoes on your feet, stomping your feet will also cause the mud to fall off the exterior of your shoe. However, it may not be possible to even get them on if your shoes are filled with dried mud."

      "content": "Wipe the shoe down with a dry paper towel. A wet paper towel could grind the dirt into your shoes and stain the fibers. The dry paper towel should remove the fine, powdery dirt left from the larger chunks that fell off."

      "title": "Remove the shoelaces and inserts (if possible).",
      "content": "Remove the shoelaces and inserts (if possible). Removing the laces will allow you to pull the tongue up and open the shoe a little wider, so you can really get into those hard to reach places. If there's mud trapped under the inserts, your shoe can become moldy and smelly. Sometimes you can't remove the insert without ruining the shoe. If this is the case, then leave them in and just try to get them as clean as possible. If your shoelaces are knotted and won't loosen or come out, you can always cut them and buy a new, clean set of laces wherever shoes are sold."

      "title": "Scrub your shoes with a soft toothbrush.",
      "content": "Scrub your shoes with a soft toothbrush. Use water and a few drops of dish detergent and go to town on the exterior and the inside of your shoes. Get into every little crevice where mud might be lurking. Use a dry rag or paper towel to wipe off the dirty water as you clean. If you don't have a toothbrush other than the one you use on your teeth, try a nail brush or a shoe polishing brush. [3] X Research source If you removed the inserts, don't forget to scrub them off as well."

      "title": "Put your shoes in the washing machine if they're still dirty.",
      "content": "Put your shoes in the washing machine if they're still dirty. You don't want to do this very often--try brush the shoes clean whenever possible--but after a mud run you will probably need the power of the washing machine to thoroughly clean your shoe. You can wash them with towels or sheets to protect the machine and your shoes from damage, but the other items may need another wash afterwards. [4] X Research source Wash the shoes in cold water only, and on a \"gentle\" or \"delicate\" setting. You can machine-wash the inserts as well, just make sure they are not still in the shoe."

      "title": "Let your shoes dry.",
      "content": "Let your shoes dry. Stuff your shoes with newspaper or paper towels to help absorb dampness. [5] X Research source The same rules apply as before--try to let your shoes \"bake\" in direct sunlight and don't leave them outside overnight. Do not put them by a radiator or in the dryer, as this can ruin the shoe (and your dryer). Your shoes should be dry in about 12 hours. [6] X Research source If you insist on trying to dry your shoes in the dryer, lace them back up and tie the laces to something heavy. Hang the laces over the dryer door, with the weight on the outside of the door, and close the door. This should keep your shoes from banging around. You can also put each shoe in a pillowcase and try to dry them that way."

Add a little baking soda, then let them sit for a few hours, and the smell should be gone. [7] X Research source Make sure you get the baking soda out before you put the shoes back on. Bang them upside-down or use a vacuum with a hose attachment."

      "content": "Clean your shoes as soon as the mud is dry. When bacteria is allowed to grow in the fibers of your shoes, you end up with some seriously smelly trainers. Plus, the longer you leave a stain, the more time it has to set, and the harder it will be to remove. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Pull out the tongues between uses. Unlacing your shoes and pulling the tongues forward will allow your shoes to air out and dry before your next run. [10] X Research source If you don't have time to unlace and re-lace your shoes after and before every run, at least loosen the laces and lift the tongue a little to increase the air flow."
