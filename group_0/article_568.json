Remember, the denominator tells you how many parts are needed to make a whole, and the numerator tells you how many parts you have . [1] X Research source So, putting the whole number over 1 tells us we have that many whole parts. For example, 2 + 3 4 {\\displaystyle 2+{\\frac {3}{4}}} . This will now become 2 1 + 3 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2}{1}}+{\\frac {3}{4}}} ."

First, we could find the least common denominator . [2] X Research source Or, we could simply multiply the two denominators together, which is often easier, so that’s how we’ll do it here. For example, we have 2 1 + 3 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2}{1}}+{\\frac {3}{4}}} . When we multiply the denominators together, we get 1 ∗ 4 {\\displaystyle 1*4} , which is 4 {\\displaystyle 4} , so that’s our new common denominator."

To do this, we multiply the numerator of each fraction by the same number that we multiplied the denominator by. [3] X Research source For the first fraction, 2 1 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2}{1}}} , we multiplied the denominator by 4 {\\displaystyle 4} , so we’ll do the same to the numerator: 2 ∗ 4 = 8 {\\displaystyle 2*4=8} . Put this new numerator over the new denominator to get 8 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {8}{4}}} . Since 3 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{4}}} already has a numerator of 4 {\\displaystyle 4} , we don’t have to multiply the numerator by anything—we can leave it as it is."

Now, we convert our improper fraction to a mixed fraction just by dividing the numerator into the denominator, Jia says. Doing this can get you either a mixed fraction or a whole number. Both would be correct depending on the numerator and denominator divisibility. For example, our final answer was 11 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {11}{4}}} : 11 / 4 = 2 {\\displaystyle 11/4=2} , with 3 {\\displaystyle 3} parts left over as the remainder. The whole number stands alone, and we put the remainder over our new denominator to find the fraction part of our mixed number. So the answer is now 2 3 4 {\\displaystyle 2{\\frac {3}{4}}} ."

Multiply each whole number by the denominator of the fraction that it’s next to. Then, add the product to that fraction’s numerator to get the new improper fraction. [5] X Research source For example, say we want to add 3 1 2 + 2 3 4 {\\displaystyle 3{\\frac {1}{2}}+2{\\frac {3}{4}}} : Starting with the first fraction, we multiply 2 ∗ 3 = 6 {\\displaystyle 2*3=6} . Then, add this to the fraction’s numerator: 6 + 1 = 7 {\\displaystyle 6+1=7} . Put this number over the denominator to get 7 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {7}{2}}} . Do the same operations with the second fraction, 2 3 4 {\\displaystyle 2{\\frac {3}{4}}} . 4 ∗ 2 = 8 {\\displaystyle 4*2=8} . Then, 8 + 3 = 11 {\\displaystyle 8+3=11} , so our second improper fraction is 11 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {11}{4}}} . Now, we have the equation 7 2 + 11 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {7}{2}}+{\\frac {11}{4}}} ."

Now we have two improper fractions, but before we can add them together, Jia reminds us that we need to make their denominators match. We can do this either by finding a least common multiple, or just by multiplying the denominators together, which, in this case, is easier. [6] X Research source We’re working with the fractions 7 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {7}{2}}} and 11 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {11}{4}}} , so multiply the denominators: 2 ∗ 4 = 8 {\\displaystyle 2*4=8} .

Place this new numerator over the new denominator to get 28 8 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {28}{8}}} . Our second fraction is 11 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {11}{4}}} and we multiplied the denominator, 4 {\\displaystyle 4} , by 2 {\\displaystyle 2} .

To do this, Jia reminds us that we just divide the numerator by the denominator.
