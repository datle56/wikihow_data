    {
      "title": "Fill a container with warm water.",
      "content": "Fill a container with warm water. The container should be large enough to fully submerge the jacket you plan to bleach (a standard household bucket should be sufficient)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add bleach to the water.",
      "content": "Add bleach to the water. Roughly, for every 4.5 liters (1.2 US gal) of water 1 cup of bleach should be added. If unsure, too little bleach is preferable to too much, as you don't want it eating through the fabric of your jacket. Mix the liquid well, and remember to always wear gloves when handling bleach. Low-splash bleach is recommended for tidiness."
    },
    {
      "title": "Immerse the jacket in the mixture.",
      "content": "Immerse the jacket in the mixture. Make sure it is completely covered, as this will prevent a patchy, light and dark result. Leave for 5 to 10 minutes before checking the extent of the fade. If further fading is required, leave for an additional 5 to 10 minutes. Repeat the process as necessary. Be sure to smooth out all folds, such as the collar. If bleach does not reach the entire surface of the jacket the result will be uneven. If a 'tie dye' look is desired, elastic bands can be used to protect certain areas from bleaching. If your jacket's thread colour is beginning to bleed into the fabric, this is a sign that it has been soaking for too long. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Rinse your jacket with warm water.",
      "content": "Rinse your jacket with warm water. When satisfied with the new lighter shade, rinse the jacket thoroughly to make sure all bleach residue is removed. If using the same container to rinse and clean your jacket, make sure to remove all traces of bleach from it beforehand."
    },
    {
      "title": "Machine-wash the jacket as usual.",
      "content": "Machine-wash the jacket as usual. Run a routine wash, washing your jacket alone, and with cold water and detergent. Your fashionably faded jacket is now ready to be worn. When hanging to dry, note that sunlight will naturally fade denim. If the current shade is to your liking, avoid sun-drying."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill your washing machine with hot water.",
      "content": "Fill your washing machine with hot water. You can do this by beginning a wash cycle, allowing the water level to rise. Pause your machine when it is sufficiently full, or when it enters its 'wash' phase."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour in 1 cup of bleach.",
      "content": "Pour in 1 cup of bleach. Use the bleaching dispenser on your machine if it has one, otherwise, add the bleach as you would in any other container. Mix it with the water by resuming the wash cycle. Let the water churn for 5 minutes before pausing again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add your jacket to the machine.",
      "content": "Add your jacket to the machine. Place your jacket so that all parts are below the water line and leave it to soak for up to an hour. Finally, let the wash cycle run to completion, and run a second wash to ensure all traces of bleach are gone. Once dry, see if the new tone suits you by trying your jacket on. You may wish to run an extra \"clean-out\" cycle after extracting your jacket. While most washing machines drain chemicals well, this will protect your next laundry load from any lurking bleach. Use a machine dryer if happy with the outcome, or hang in the sun to encourage extra fading."
