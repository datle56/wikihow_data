      "content": "Gather 5 fresh, ripe figs. To roast your figs, make sure you get some that are fresh and ripe, not dried. Ripe figs are firm and give slightly to pressure, not too hard like an apple, but also not too soft or mushy. When you cut them, they should hold their rounded shape. Different types of figs come in various colors, including yellow, brown, red, purple, and even black. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Wash the figs and remove the stem. You should always wash fruit before cooking and eating it.

Once they’re dry, remove their stems. You can pull off the stems with your fingers, or cut them off with a pairing knife. When washing, use your fingers to remove any dirt on the surface of the figs. Don’t scrub to hard though, because figs are delicate."
