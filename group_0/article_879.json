Avoid using any fancy fonts that make it harder to read (both to the human eye and to postal scanning machines). [2] X Research source"

      "content": "In the address, remember to include the correct \"attention to\" details. Using \"ATTN:\" or \"Attention\" highlights the precise person who is supposed to read your mail.

      "content": "Write out the address in full. To avoid any errors, make no assumptions that those reading the address know what your abbreviations mean. Moreover, don't even assume that common abbreviations are as common as you think! Spell out State names, town names, people's names, to be certain."

      "content": "Add your return details. This is crucial for return if anything goes wrong during delivery. Write your return details clearly, or use a sticky label that has been pre-printed with your address details. Use the appropriate address for return â€“ consider whether it should be your home address, a work address, a business address, etc. In North America, place this return address on the top left-hand corner of the envelope (your left when looking at the envelope). In other countries, it is more common for individuals to place the return address on the other side of the envelope, about where the envelope is sealed, although companies tend to prefer the front corner style.
