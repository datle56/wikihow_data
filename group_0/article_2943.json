      "content": "Ask your doctor about mold exposure and describe your symptoms. There is no need to worry about life-threatening conditions after an exposure to mold—especially if you aren’t allergic. To determine whether mold exposure is actually causing you harm, schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor. Show up and describe the symptoms that you’re experiencing. [1] X Research source Don’t assume that you need to run off to the doctor as soon as you see mold. If you aren’t experiencing any symptoms and you’re not allergic, there isn’t any cause for serious concern so long as you have the mold removed . [2] X Research source Mold (such as coccidioides) can grow in certain soils, and it's possible to inhale the spores and develop pneumonia. This can cause flu-like symptoms that last for weeks to months. It's most common in the southwestern United States (California and Arizona), as well as parts of Mexico, Central America, and South America, and you don't need to worry about it if you don't live in these areas. If you have an allergy to mold, your symptoms may include sneezing, itchy eyes, coughing, and wheezing. According to the CDC, all types of mold should be treated with the same degree of seriousness. See your doctor if you have symptoms of an allergy or illness, and take steps to clean the mold, regardless of what type of mold it is. You should seek medical help immediately if you experience shortness of breath, chest pain, memory loss, or lethargy after a prolonged exposure to mold. Some bacteria can build up in your lungs and cause infections if you’re exposed to mold for too long. These infections are extremely rare, though. The treatments for mold-based infections are typically steroids or antibiotics.

Consult your doctor first before going to a private company for testing."

During your examination, tell your doctor that you’re worried about mold exposure. It’s possible that you may have an allergy to mold, and your doctor will be able to answer any of your questions and take a closer look at your skin, eyes, and nasal passages.

If your doctor believes that it is appropriate, they will refer you to an allergy specialist. Follow your doctor’s post-care instructions to ensure that your symptoms do not get worse.

The allergy specialist will apply a small amount of concentrated mold and study your skin’s reaction.

      "content": "Ask your doctor or allergy specialist for a mycotoxin diagnostic test. If you really want a more in-depth picture of your mold exposure, ask your doctor or allergy specialist for a mycotoxin test. Mycotoxins are toxic compounds that grow and feed on mold, and may be the source of your symptoms if you’ve been exposed to mold for an extended period of time. [9] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source You're more likely to be exposed to mycotoxins if you work in agriculture, and it's considered an occupational risk. It's best to take precautions to limit your exposure. The only type of mold that produces mycotoxins in high amounts is stachybotrys, which is commonly known as “black” mold. They can often grow on moldy food as well. There are 3 major mycotoxins: trichothecenes, aflatoxins, and ochratoxins. Your test may break your results down into these subcategories."

To use one of these kits, unpack the materials and read the instructions carefully. Usually, you leave a small petri dish out in an enclosed room for 24-48 hours. The chemical in the petri dish will absorb mold particles from the air. Put a lid on the dish and seal it. Check it after 2-4 days to see if mold has grown inside the dish. [16] X Research source DIY kits are less reliable than a professional service when it comes to identifying mold. If mold grows inside the dish, you have a high percentage of mold in your air. You can send the dish to get tested at the manufacturer’s lab. Getting the sample tested will cost an additional $20-100. If no mold grows, the odds that you have mold in your home are low."
