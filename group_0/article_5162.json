      "content": "Contact your local animal shelters. Injured or orphaned prairie dogs are occasionally turned over to shelters by wildlife services. Shelters also occasionally have domesticated prairie dogs that are surrender by their owners for a variety of reasons. Go online to get contact information for the shelters in your area and give them a quick call. If you adopt from a shelter you will generally have to agree to get your prairie dog spayed or neutered by a certain date, if it hasn’t been done already. You may need to pay an adoption fee."

      "content": "Contact local wildlife rescue organizations. Many areas with prairie dog populations also have wildlife organizations established to protect the area’s animals. These groups often maintain a rehabilitation center as part of their operations or they work cooperatively with local vets. The animals that they sell are often rehabbed after injury or abandonment. [1] X Research source Many wildlife rescues, as well as animal shelters, now list their available animals online either on their main website or an adoption listing service. Adopt-A-Pet is a good site to see pics of rescued prairie dogs. You can search by location as well. [2] X Research source Getting your dog via a rescue or a shelter is a humane option as it frees up more space for another animal to be taken in and cared for. Many of these organizations will also require that you surrender the prairie dog back to them if you change your mind."

      "content": "Search online for prairie dog breeders. There are a handful of breeders online who make a living raising and selling prairie dogs. You can find a listing by searching for “prairie dog breeders” online. Before you buy, carefully discuss the details of cost, care, and transport. Request to see photos of the particular dog that you are purchasing as well, which can help ensure that you receive a healthy animal. Make sure that you buy a young, hand-raised dog. It is best if you can have the dog in-hand before it is 10 weeks old as this is a critical bonding time for you both. Breeding conditions are often a subject of some controversy. Check online or with animal rights organizations (such as the SPCA) to make sure that your breeder is not under investigation for animal cruelty. For example, one prairie dog breeder (U.S. Global Exotics) had animals seized due to inhumane treatment."

However, they can cause a fair amount of pain and physical damage with their bite. Their front teeth are extraordinary sharp and can cut through even a thick pair of gloves. You’ll want to decide if you are comfortable working with these occasionally outbursts. [7] X Research source Think about what you will do when bitten. Your immediate response may be to fling your hand, but you can kill your prairie dog in the process. It is better to carefully pry the dog’s jaws open. Sexual maturity often triggers violent impulses in prairie dogs. Plan to spay or neuter your dog by 9 months to avoid these issues."

      "content": "Develop an “it isn’t working out” plan. Carefully consider the possibility that prairie dog ownership may not end up being for you. If this is the case, what will you do?

Domesticated dogs are ill equipped for surviving in the wild and will often perish if uncared for. [10] X Research source"
