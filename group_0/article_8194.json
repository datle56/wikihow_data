      "content": "Use simple water and dishwashing detergent to clean your shower screen. Squirt some high-quality dishwashing detergent over the grotty shower screen. Use a scrubbing brush (or an old cloth) and a bit of water to ensure the whole screen is clean. Use the brush or cloth in a circular motion until the whole screen has been covered. Wash off with fresh water."

      "content": "Clean a glass shower screen by scrubbing with baking soda and vinegar. First, get the shower screen wet by running the shower. Put baking soda in a cloth and scrub the screen.

      "title": "Use a vinegar soak to loosen up hard mineral deposits.",
      "content": "Use a vinegar soak to loosen up hard mineral deposits. Completely dry off your screens. Soak paper towels in vinegar and stick them onto the screen until the area is covered. Try putting more than one layer on if possible to keep the area soaked. Leave them on for at least 45 minutes. If there's a lot of lime, then you may want to leave them on for a few hours. Once that's over, the residue should wipe off easily."

      "title": "Buy a commercial cleaning cream.",
      "content": "Buy a commercial cleaning cream. It doesn't need to be expensive—a generic brand should suffice. Find a shower cream anywhere that sells cleaning supplies: home-and-garden stores, bathroom-supply stores, and some drugstores."

      "title": "Squeeze a bit into your hand or a cloth and spread it over the whole surface of the screen.",
      "content": "Squeeze a bit into your hand or a cloth and spread it over the whole surface of the screen. Don't worry about ruining the surface—the cream doesn't harm glass. Rub the cream all over the glass, and don't feel that you need to rub too hard. If you have a marble shower, you should keep the cleaning cream away from the marble."

      "title": "Grab a damp/wet cloth and wipe off the cream.",
      "content": "Grab a damp/wet cloth and wipe off the cream. The cream will froth, and it might take a few attempts to wipe it all off—but you don't need to scrub!"

      "content": "Dry the screen. Use a clean, dry towel (cloth or paper) to gently dry the shower screen so that the end result is evenly clean."
