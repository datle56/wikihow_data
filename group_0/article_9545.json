People with strong social connections tend to cope with different life circumstances in a healthier way than those without these connections. Make new social connections to support you as you manage your anxiety. Join a local support group for anxiety-sufferers, participate in a religious or spiritual organization, or get together frequently with your favorite group of close friends. Having a sense of belonging and reassurance from others can have drastic effects on overall health. In fact, research shows that elderly individuals with poor perceived social support were at a higher risk of mortality.

For that reason, it's important to spend time with others. [3] X Research source"

To gain control of your anxiety, focus on getting at least seven hours of sleep each night. Use the following tips to get adequate shut-eye: Allow your body to adjust to sleeping on a regular schedule. Go to bed at the same time each day. Turn off electronics 1 hour prior to bed. Make your bedroom environment comfortable and strictly for sleeping. Get your bedroom cool and dark. Exercise, but not in the 2-3 hours before bed. Develop a winding down ritual to follow nightly. Use aromatherapy like lavender scents to promote relaxation. Don't drink caffeine after noon. Avoid eating right before bed. Spend time in the sun every day. Quit smoking (nicotine can affect sleep). Don't drink alcohol in the 2 hours before you go to bed."

Base your diet around fresh produce, fish, beans, legumes, nuts, whole grains, and healthy oils, which support mental health. However, cut out processed foods and treats, which can negatively affect your mental health. Prebiotics and probiotics are both essential to your gut health. While you can take supplements, you can also find food sources. Eat fruits and vegetables that are high in fiber to increase your consumption of prebiotics. For instance, eat asparagus, tomatoes, mango, onions, apples, and bananas. For probiotics, eat yogurt with live or active cultures, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso soup, kefir, tempeh, and kombucha. There are heaps of research connecting caffeine to increased anxiety. Caffeine has been found to increase anxiety, depression, and hostility.

Additionally, do something for yourself every day to relieve stress. Make it extra special so that you have something to look forward to daily. Clean your living space weekly so it doesn't get too messy. Additionally, pay your bills each month on a set day.

All or nothing (or black and white) thinking: Viewing situations in absolute categories — something is good or bad, right or wrong, with no subtleties, complexities, or gray areas. Mental filter: Exaggerating the negatives while minimizing the positives. Jumping to conclusions: Assuming someone else's negative reaction is because of you; predicting the future to be negative. Magnification or minimization: Either maximizing or minimizing the importance of a situation. Overgeneralization: Seeing a negative event as a part of a nonstop pattern. \"Should\" statements: Judging yourself or others by what they \"Should,\" \"Ought,\" \"Shouldn't,\" \"Have to,\" or \"Must\" do. Emotional reasoning: Reasoning based solely on your emotions — \"I feel stupid, so I must be.\" Discounting the positives: Diminishing the value of your accomplishments or positive attributes."
