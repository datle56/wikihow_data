As soon as you notice the oil or grease spill, put a paper towel on top of it and press down to lift up as much of it as you can. Don't rub it because that will only spread the oil over a larger area. [2] X Research source [3] X Expert Source Guy Peters House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 27 September 2021. It's important to get to it right away because oil can darken stone if it sinks in and dries (especially if it's unpolished slate). It probably won’t leave a stain after a few hours but try to get to it as soon as you notice."

      "content": "Rinse the area with water and dry it with a cloth. Soak a sponge under the faucet and wring it out so it's slightly damp. Gently scrub the area and then use a different cloth to pat it dry. Stone is porous, so it’s important to wring out the sponge so you’re not exposing it to lots of water."

      "content": "Use equal parts of vinegar and water to clean grease and grime from grout lines. Pour an equal amount of water and white vinegar in a spray bottle and shake it up. Spray it into the lines between the stone tiles and scrub it with a nylon brush to leave your grout lines sparkling clean. [4] X Research source Undiluted vinegar is extremely acidic and can damage grout lines and stone surfaces, so be sure to dilute it to about 50% (or more if you’re worried about it). If you don’t have a nylon brush, you can also use a medium-bristled toothbrush."

      "title": "Make a stain-lifting putty if you couldn’t clean up the oil right away.",
      "content": "Make a stain-lifting putty if you couldn’t clean up the oil right away. Oil stains stone once it’s dry, so you’ll need to make a paste to lift the stain. Pour 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of acetone and 1/4 cup (45 g) of baking soda into a small plastic cup or container. Stir it together and keep adding the ingredients little by little until it's the consistency of pancake batter. Smear it onto the stain and cover it with plastic wrap. After 24 hours, scrape it off using a plastic putty knife, spatula, or some other utensil (anything but metal!). This is a great option for polished stone like granite, quartzite, and marble. You can buy 100% acetone from your local hardware or home goods store. You can also use nail polish remover if you have some."

      "content": "Blot away as much of the oil as you can with a paper towel right away. As soon as you notice the greasy spot on the floor, lay a paper towel on top of it to soak up as much as possible. Don't try to rub it around because that will only spread the oil over a larger area beyond the initial spill. Grease that sits too long can stain your hardwood floor. It’s much easier to clean up a spill than it is to lift a stain."

[5] X Research source If you're only spot-cleaning a greasy area, cut the recipe in half or a quarter. You can also put a lid on the bucket and save the solution for future cleanings. If you have waxed floors, only use a small capful of vinegar (1 to 2 oz or 30 to 60 mL) or omit it altogether because it can damage the wax."

      "content": "Dip a sponge or mop in the solution and wipe the greasy area with it. Dunk a mop or a soft kitchen sponge into the bucket of homemade cleaning solution. Squeeze out the excess and start mopping or wiping the oil away. Move the mop or sponge in small, circular motions so you’re not missing any greasy spots. [6] X Research source Don't use the rough side of the sponge because it can damage the wood. It's best to use a soft microfiber mop because it won't soak up a ton of water (water and wood aren't friends, especially if you have natural wood or laminate). It's important to squeeze out excess water because pouring lots of water on wood can make it expand and crown (or lift up at the edges)."

Wring it out so it's just barely damp and then go over the areas a second time to wipe up the solution. [7] X Research source Don’t let the solution dry on the floor because it can leave it looking streaky and dull."

      "content": "Lift stubborn grease stains with mineral spirits if you didn’t clean the spill right away. Put on gloves and protective eyewear before opening the bottle of mineral spirits. Soak a cotton ball or the corner of a rag with mineral spirits and rub it onto the stain. This will work on most types of hardwood floors, even engineered hardwood and laminate. However, it can be a little strong and remove the finish on some floors so do a test run in an inconspicuous area first (like a closet or under a piece of furniture). [8] X Research source If you see any sign of the finish coming off on the cotton ball or rag as you're wiping it on, stop and go over the area with a damp rag. Don’t use acetone (or nail polish remover) as a substitute because it will eat through the finish on your wood floors. Vapors from mineral spirits can make you dizzy or irritate your throat, so it’s best to only use it in a well-ventilated area. If you’re cleaning a spill that occurred in a room that’s not well-ventilated, set up a fan before you open the bottle and get to work."

Wring out the mop before you start cleaning the floor. [10] X Research source Always wring out your mop! Plopping a sopping-wet mop onto a linoleum floor can stain it or cause it to lift up (which is a way bigger problem than a simple oil spill)."

[11] X Research source If the grease stain is still there, try again but add a little more baking soda so it really fizzles up."

Put a few dabs of mild dish soap onto the area and rub it with a damp cloth or sponge. [12] X Research source Don't use a heavy-duty scrub brush or steel wool because they’re too abrasive and might scratch the vinyl. Vinyl floors can stand up to water better than other types of flooring, but it’s still a good idea to dry the floor after you’ve cleaned it."

Then, after the 20 minutes, scrub it with a brush to help lift the stain. [19] X Research source You can also use stronger chemicals like bleach or ammonia—unfinished (i.e. not shiny) concrete can stand up to most strong cleaning solutions. Don’t leave the hydrogen peroxide on for longer than 20 minutes because it could bleach the concrete."
