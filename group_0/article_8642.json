      "title": "Pull off any leaves or other debris by hand when possible.",
      "content": "Pull off any leaves or other debris by hand when possible. Take a close look at your AC unit. If there are any leaves sticking out or large clumps of dirt that could easily be removed, pull these off using your hands. This will make it easier to hose off the unit. [1] X Research source Brush off any cobwebs or large areas of lint buildup."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove any landscaping that’s growing near the unit.",
      "content": "Remove any landscaping that’s growing near the unit. This includes things like bushes or tree limbs. If your shrubbery or trees are getting in the way of your AC unit, now is the time to trim them back using gardening shears. This will make it easier for air to circulate around the AC unit. [2] X Research source Try to cut landscaping so that it’s at least 3 ft (0.91 m) away from the AC unit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid blocking the AC unit with structures or fencing.",
      "content": "Avoid blocking the AC unit with structures or fencing. This also makes it difficult for the air to flow freely and can cause long-term damage to your unit or structure. Remove any fencing or overhangings that are blocking the unit and instead give it a wide berth of 3–6 ft (0.91–1.83 m). [3] X Research source This includes the sides of the AC unit as well as the top. Never lay anything on top of the unit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn off the power to the AC unit.",
      "content": "Turn off the power to the AC unit. This makes it safer for you to clean it and avoids any chance of electricity flowing. Switch off the power right next to the unit at the outdoor box, or turn off the circuit breaker panel for your home. [4] X Research source If you're not sure where your circuit breaker is, look in the garage, basement, or even outside along a wall of your house."

    {
      "title": "Use a hose to spray down the unit and dislodge the dirt.",
      "content": "Use a hose to spray down the unit and dislodge the dirt. Turn on your regular garden hose and use it to wash the dirt off of the AC unit. Start on one side of the unit at the very top, going back and forth along the edge to ensure you remove all of the grime. [5] X Research source Hose off the top of the AC unit as well as the sides."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply a foaming coil cleaner if your AC unit is super dirty.",
      "content": "Apply a foaming coil cleaner if your AC unit is super dirty. If you don’t think a regular soaking with a hose will get all of the dirt off, spray a foaming coil cleaner right onto the coils, covering the length of each one entirely. Wait 5-10 minutes before washing the foam off with a hose thoroughly. [6] X Research source The foaming cleaner will help break down dirt particles so they wash away more easily. As soon as you apply the coil cleaner, it will begin to foam. Look for a foaming coil cleaner for AC units at your local hardware store or online."

      "title": "Avoid using a strong stream of water so you don’t mess up the coils.",
      "content": "Avoid using a strong stream of water so you don’t mess up the coils. Never use a power washer or harsh hose stream on your AC unit. This can damage the delicate coils that help cool down the air. Just use a simple stream from your water hose, placing your thumb over a portion of the end if you need the stream to be a bit stronger to wash away the dirt. [7] X Research source Avoid using a special setting on a hose with a nozzle and instead opt for a regular stream of water."

    {
      "title": "Spray the unit at different angles to wash off fine particles.",
      "content": "Spray the unit at different angles to wash off fine particles. Spraying the AC unit all in one direction may not remove all of the dirt. Instead, start by angling the stream downwards as you go back and forth along the side, and then go at different angles to wash away dirt hidden away in the crevices of the paneling. [8] X Research source Look closely at the AC unit to see where the dirt particles still are."

    {
      "title": "Turn the power back on once you’re finished cleaning.",
      "content": "Turn the power back on once you’re finished cleaning. After you’ve cleaned each side of the AC unit, as well as the very top, turn the power back on at the circuit breaker or the power box right next to the AC unit. Now you won’t need to clean the outside of the AC unit for another year! [9] X Research source If you don’t turn the power back on after you’ve finished, your AC won’t be able to cool down your house."
