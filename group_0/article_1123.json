For example, a \"p\" tag would become \"p style='text-align:right'\" within the \"<>\" symbols."

If you need the image to hang in the center, the code gets a bit more complicated. There is not \"float:center\" property, so you have to add the work-around \"style='align:center;text-align:center'\" to the tag, as in \"img style='align:center;text-align:center'\" again within the \"<>\" symbols."
