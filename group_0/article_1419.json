      "content": "Apply your moisturizer and concealer. First, apply a moisturizer with SPF, choosing a moisturizer suited for your skin type. Then, apply concealer to the dark circles on your face and any blemishes, dabbing the concealer in with your middle finger until it is blended in with your skin. If you're using concealer to cover circles under your eyes, use a concealer with a peachy-orange tone. If your skin is lighter, it should be more towards the peach end, and if it's darker, your concealer should be a deeper orange. Then, set the concealer with a translucent powder.

      "content": "Apply foundation to your skin. Choose a natural looking foundation, and apply it to your face with a brush, sponge or your fingers. Make sure you choose a foundation that is similar to your skin tone, and blend it in with your fingers or a beauty blender. Use a damp beauty blender sponge so it doesn't remove any of the foundation from your face. At this point, you can apply another layer of concealer for any blemishes that are really stubborn, but make sure you don't cake on your makeup."

      "content": "Save the powder until after the blush. If you apply a cream blush after you have applied powder to your face, the blush will not blend in well to your cheeks. Instead of applying powder to your face before you apply blush, apply your blush first and then finish with a small dusting of loose powder. This will help your blush cling to your face, as well as create a more matte finish on your face, which will remove some of the dewy look. If you have a naturally dry face, and don't want to remove any of the glow or dew from the cream blush, then don't apply a powder finish. Powder can be skipped in the makeup process -- it's really a personal preference."

      "content": "Choose your method of application. There are several different ways to apply cream blush. Any of them can be used to apply the blush effectively, so it just depends on your preference. You can apply cream blush in three ways: Cheek highlighter brush: This brush has soft, flat bristles and you can apply blush by dabbing the brush into your cream blush, and then tapping it onto the apple of your cheeks. Beauty blender sponge: You can apply your blush with this tool by gently swiping it in an upward motion on the apple of your cheeks. A sponge can also be used to blend your blush into the skin. Your fingers: This may be the easiest way to apply your blush as you will dip your fingers in the blush and then swipe it onto your cheeks."

      "content": "Locate the apples of your cheeks and your cheekbones. You can choose to apply blush to either of these areas. To locate the apples of your cheeks, first smile. The area of your cheeks that is raised while you are smiling is the apple of your cheek. To find your cheekbones, suck in your cheeks, making somewhat of a fish face. The area on your cheekbones where it experiences the indentation is where you will apply your blush. [3] X Research source Most people tend to apply blush to the apples of their cheeks, but you can apply to your cheekbones instead if you desire a different look. If you have high cheekbones and a hollow in your cheeks, applying to the apple of your cheeks can help soften your features and make your face look less angular. [4] X Research source If you have a rounder face, applying blush to your cheekbones instead of the apples in your cheeks can help your face look slimmer. Make sure you stay on the high part of the indentation, where you can feel the lower part of your cheekbone -- you don't want your blush to rest too low on your face."

      "content": "Make sure to apply your blush in the right area. You can choose between the apple of your cheeks or your cheekbones. If you're applying it to your cheekbones, sweep it back toward your hairline. Avoid applying the blush too close to the center of your face; it shouldn't go past the smile lines on either side of your nose. [5] X Research source If you're using blush in a neutral color, you can apply it to both your cheekbones and the apple of your cheeks."

Gently dab your fingers onto the apples of your cheeks or your cheekbones. If you feel your blush is too bright, continuing tapping it and blending it in with your fingers until you have your desired color. If you feel like you put on too much cream blush, just rub the area with your fingertips and it will start to lighten. [6] X Research source Christin Birckhead. Makeup artist.

      "content": "Apply blush with a brush to concentrate the color. Tap your brush into your cream blush for a few seconds until you have enough blush on your brush. Then, stipple the blush onto your cheekbones or apples of your cheeks. Blend out any excess blush with your beauty blender or your fingers. If you feel you have picked up too much blush, you can tap the brush on the back of your hand to remove some of the product. Stippling your brush just means you are creating a pattern of small dots, that when formed together look like a solid color or shading."

      "content": "Understand the difference between cream and powder blush. The two different types of blushes will help you achieve different looks, so it's really a personal preference which one you use. A powder blush will give you a more finished look, and can be applied with a large makeup brush. A cream blush gives you a more dewy, outdoorsy finish and is applied with a brush or your fingers. [7] X Research source When applying cream blush, always use a smaller amount at first. You can go back and add more blush to your cheeks, but it's harder to remove excess blush than it is to add more. If you have accidentally added to much blush to your cheeks, you can blend it in or you can apply a light layer of foundation on top of it to conceal some of the color."

      "title": "Choose the right shade of blush.",
      "content": "Choose the right shade of blush. If you want your blush to look natural, you'll need to choose the right shade of blush. If you really want your cheeks to pop, then you can choose a blush in any color. To find the most natural blush color, pinch your cheeks and try to match the color created on your cheeks with a blush color. If you are having trouble choosing the right blush color, you can follow this general guide for skin tones: Fair/ivory skin: Choose a baby pink or pale pink for your blush color. This is the most natural look for very fair skin as other shades can look orangey. For fair skin that is a little bit darker you can use a peach blush in a satin or sheer texture. If you want to go a little more dramatic for a night out, you can use a plum colored blush in a translucent shade. Choose a plum colored blush that is a shade or two darker than your lip color. Medium skin: Wear a blush that is an apricot shade, as this will bring out the natural warm colors in your skin. You can also wear a pinky-berry color; because a pale pink looks good on fair skin, a medium pink will look good on medium skin. For a more dramatic look, choose a muted mauve (pale purple) color that has a hint of plum. Olive skin: Look for warm tones like an orangey-peach, that will hide the green undertones in the skin. Wear a rose or bronze colored blush for a more dramatic look that will add warmth to your skin and help boost the olive color. If you have fair olive skin you can use these same colors, just don't apply as much blush. Dark skin: Go for bold, highly pigmented shades like raisin, brick, and cranberry. For a dramatic look, choose a bright tangerine that will be pretty and subtle on dark skin."

      "content": "Know the benefits of cream blush. Cream blush differs from powder blush in that it is good for dry skin as powder blush can enhance your dryness. If you have aging skin, cream blush will give you a more youthful look and adds dewiness to your skin that people tend to lose as they age. In cold climates or during cold seasons, cream blush adds moisture to your cheeks that is drawn out with the cold air so it keeps your face from looking as dry. Using cream blush in a very humid environment can be difficult because it can make your face look even more oily. If you live in an area where you experience lots of humidity or you tend to sweat a lot during the day, using a powder blush might be better because you won't need the extra moisture added to your skin."
