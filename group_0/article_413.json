      "title": "Get into character",
      "content": "Get into character . Familiarize yourself with your character’s role in the play and pay attention to everything you are told about the character, including their age, upbringing, social status, likes and dislikes, and political or religious viewpoints. Think about what motivates your character to say and do what they do, what they are afraid of, and what they are hoping for. Make up the information you are not given to fully round out the character. For instance, think about what their childhood was like, which relationships are most important in their life, how they’ve handled adversity or disappointment, and so on."

      "title": "Connect with your character emotionally.",
      "content": "Connect with your character emotionally. Even if you don’t like the character’s behavior, you’ll need to connect with them to play the role as well as possible. Work to understand where the character is at in their life and what crossroads they are facing. Think about what they want and why. Then, find similar emotional experiences in your own life that you can use to play the character believably. [3] X Research source For example, you may find it hard to relate to the death of your character’s spouse if you aren’t a widow. However, think about another loss you’ve experienced, like the death of a grandparent, to help you connect with the character’s emotions."

    {
      "title": "Speak like your character.",
      "content": "Speak like your character. If your character has an accent, take the time to learn how to emulate it properly. Watch movies, TV shows, or video clips of people speaking with the accent you need to learn. Also, adjust the tone and speaking speed of your voice to make your character come alive. [4] X Research source For instance, if playing the CEO of a major company, you may want to speak quickly and forcefully to show that the character is both busy and important. Conversely, if playing a young child, you may want to speak in a sing-song voice to show the character’s innocence and imagination."

      "title": "Use body language to show personality.",
      "content": "Use body language to show personality. It’s not enough to simply say the lines in a certain tone of voice. You must also use your body to demonstrate your character’s personality. Think about the way your character would move (e.g., a young person may move quickly and have lots of energy, while an older character has slower, more halted motions). Make your motions slightly larger than you normally would so they can be seen from anywhere in the audience. For instance, make eye contact if your character is assertive, or avert your gaze if they are shy. If your character is anxious, for example, show that by playing with the hem of your shirt or biting your lip. Alternatively, if your character is elated, smile brightly and act energized."

      "content": "Connect with your castmates. It’s important to develop a good relationship with other people in the play, especially if your character is close with their character. Spend time together outside of rehearsal—see another show, go out to eat, visit an art gallery or a museum, or go on a nature walk or hike. If you feel comfortable around them it will be apparent to the audience and make your on-stage relationships more believable. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Attend every rehearsal. Your first rehearsal may actually be a table read, where everyone attends and reads through the entire play. You should have read the play and have a basic understanding of your character and their lines at this point. [6] X Research source There will be many rehearsals before your first performance and you should attend each one, even if you aren’t in the scenes being rehearsed. Use the time to watch the play so that you have a strong understanding of what happens and why, or practice your lines until it’s your turn on stage."

      "title": "Practice stage blocking.",
      "content": "Practice stage blocking. During technical rehearsals, you’ll focus on stage blocking, or how and when characters move around the stage and utilize the space. Sometimes, markers in the form of masking tape will be placed on the floor to help characters find their spots. Remember to think about how the character you are playing would walk and move in real life. Practice your entrances and exits from the stage as well. [7] X Research source For example, if the character you are playing is clumsy, bump into a table or other piece of furniture, or pretend to trip while moving across the stage."

      "title": "Memorize your lines",
      "content": "Memorize your lines . It’s critical that you know all of your lines before the play is performed. Highlight your lines and practice them every day outside of rehearsals.

Take their advice to heart and do your best to incorporate it into your role. [9] X Expert Source Lesly Kahn, MFA Acting Teacher & Coach Expert Interview. 12 May 2020."

Get to the stage early to iron out any last-minute wrinkles and to give yourself time to warm up. If you need to bring anything, do so, and follow any directives given from the wardrobe or makeup department (e.g., wear a strapless bra or refrain from cutting your hair before the show).

      "title": "Be present in the moment.",
      "content": "Be present in the moment. Don’t think about the audience or about previous or future performances. Let go of everything that has happened in rehearsal and focus only on the performance. Allow yourself to get caught up in the play as though the events were actually taking place in real time.

Make sure to clearly speak each syllable of each word you say so that there is no confusion. Don’t forget to vary your speaking speed and tone based on the lines you are saying.

      "content": "Deal with mistakes in character. If something goes wrong, don’t just ignore the problem. Think about how your character would face that challenge, and act accordingly. [15] X Research source For instance, if the knife you need to cut a rope is missing from the set, don’t just pretend to cut the rope. Say something like, “My knife is gone!” and look around for another prop from the set to use in its place, like a fire poker. Alternatively, if you drop and break something that your character is supposed to give as a gift, show the audience that you are upset about the accident. Say something like, “I can’t believe I broke that 400-year-old vase. What am I going to give Grandma for her birthday, now?”"
