      "content": "Take a shower or bath and dry your skin completely. The best time to apply perfume or cologne is right after you bathe. Not only is your skin is free of dirt and sweat, but it’s also warm and ready to absorb moisturizers and fragrances. [1] X Research source Make sure to dry yourself off before applying your scent, or it may rub off or evaporate faster while you’re drying. [2] X Research source Use a body wash or soap that is unscented, or has very little scent, so your perfume doesn’t clash with its smell."

      "title": "Use moisturizer before spraying your fragrance.",
      "content": "Use moisturizer before spraying your fragrance. Applying a non-scented body lotion before spraying cologne or perfume can help the fragrance last throughout the day. If you have a lotion, mist, or oil in the same fragrance line as your perfume or cologne, use that instead to layer the scent and make it stay even longer. [3] X Research source Another great option is petroleum jelly. The perfume will stick to the jelly molecules rather than the pores, keeping the fragrance alive longer. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Spray the perfume or cologne before putting on your clothes.",
      "content": "Spray the perfume or cologne before putting on your clothes. Fragrances last longer when they’re in direct contact with your body’s natural oils, and the alcohol in them can potentially discolor your clothes. [5] X Research source After you apply the scent, try to let dry on your skin a little before putting on your clothes, too. [6] X Research source If you do decide to give your clothes a quick spray to freshen them up, do it before you put them on. That way, you can mist them evenly and avoid hitting one area directly. [7] X Research source Although some recommend spraying the fragrance and walking through it, this can miss areas you want to target, wasting expensive perfume and possibly staining objects nearby."

      "title": "Spray fragrance on your inner elbows, knees, and wrists.",
      "content": "Spray fragrance on your inner elbows, knees, and wrists. Your “pulse points” are areas on your body where the blood vessels are close to the skin’s surface, creating extra heat. [8] X Research source The heat enhances the fragrance and makes it last longer. Three of the most effective pulse points are on the inside of your wrists, elbows, and knees. [9] X Research source Try to avoid rubbing your wrists together—this can break down the top notes, or lighter scents, in the fragrance and change the way the scent develops on your skin. Even if you’re not wearing a short-sleeve shirt, spraying fragrance on the inside of your elbows can spread the scent to other areas of the body and in the fibers of your clothes. Spraying perfume or cologne on the back of your knees can leave a trail of scent (or sillage) wherever you go. If your perfume is roll-on or doesn’t have an atomizer (or spray nozzle), apply some to your fingers and rub it gently in a small circle on your pulse points."

      "title": "Apply your cologne or perfume near your collarbone.",
      "content": "Apply your cologne or perfume near your collarbone. Your neck is another pulse point that has a lot of dips because of the bone structure, giving the fragrance plenty of room to rest and interact with your skin. Apply the scent to your wrists, then lightly dap on each side of your neck near your collarbones. [10] X Research source Aim for the areas on your neck where you can feel your pulse, like just under your ear. [11] X Research source Try dabbing a little cologne or perfume on the back of your neck if you’re wearing a shirt with a collar."

[12] X Expert Source Erica Coates Professional Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 8 April 2022. Spraying this area also puts a little of the scent in your hair, holding the fragrance longer and allowing it to diffuse throughout the day. [13] X Research source If you’re wearing jewelry, try spraying behind your ears instead of your neck. That way, you avoid tarnishing your necklaces. [14] X Research source This also allows people you hug or hang out with up-close to enjoy your perfume or cologne."

      "content": "Try spraying perfume down your back for a more natural scent. Your back is an area that’s usually covered up by clothing, making your scent last longer and preventing it from being too overbearing for others. Simply pull the collar of your shirt back and mist the scent between your clothing and skin. [16] X Research source If your fragrance is super light and floral, try spraying twice. Your natural movements throughout the day will disperse the scent, and it won’t be right in front of you all day—that way, your fragrance will just seem like a part of your natural scent."

That way, none of your perfume or cologne is wasted and you get just enough scent to make a lasting impression without harming your skin. [17] X Research source Less is more when it comes to fragrance—spray it on one area of your body to start out with, then apply to more if you feel like it’s too subtle. [18] X Research source"

Because fragrances latch onto hair fibers, your hair will carry the scent for a long period of time and leave a scent trail as you move from place to place. However, spraying your hair directly can also dry out the fibers—to prevent that, spray the scent on your brush before styling your hair.

Stick with 2 spritzes to start—you can always take the bottle with you and apply more later if it’s not strong enough. [26] X Research source Before wearing a new scent, test it out at home. Spray 1 pulse point and take note of how strong it is. Every couple of hours, check in and see how the scent is holding up."

Mixing fragrances on paper can help you see how the two scents will interact with each other so you can avoid them clashing or overpowering each other. Try to start with a warm base (like cedarwood or vanilla) and add a lighter, more vibrant scent (like floral or citrus) on top. [27] X Research source Start with two fragrances you think would compliment each other well and spray them on yourself to test how they mix with your body’s natural scent."

If you don’t know whether you’re allergic to any ingredients, test a new scent on a small area of your skin and wait for an hour to see if there’s any reaction. If there is, don’t use it. If your skin reddens, itches, becomes bumpy, swells, or peels, you might be allergic to something in the fragrance. Wash your skin immediately with scent-free soap and water.

Perfumes and colognes are usually made up of 3 layers of scent combinations called “notes.” Light citrus or floral notes are usually found in the top notes, spices and fruity scents are in the middle notes, and woodsy or musky aromas are in the base notes. After applying a fragrance, wait to smell all three layers to see if you like them. [32] X Research source Top notes: Smell after 5 to 15 minutes. Middle notes: Test the fragrance after 20 to 60 minutes. Base notes: Sniff the cologne or perfume more than 6 hours after applying.

However, each fragrance has a different lifespan. You can tell if yours has expired if it smells slightly sour or off, or if the color or shade of the liquid in the bottle has changed. [36] X Research source Perfumes with citrus essential oils tend to expire faster than those with spicy, wood, or vanilla notes, or synthetic ingredients like musk. [37] X Research source When fragrances degrade, they tend to take on a more orange or yellow hue.
