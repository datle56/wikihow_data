      "content": "Find the gutter downspout closest to the soggiest part of your yard. After it rains, note which part of your yard is having the most trouble with drainage. Take a stroll around your yard after a heavy rain and look for the area retaining the most water. Typically, the flattest section of your yard will have the most trouble with drainage if there aren’t any valleys. [1] X Research source Dry wells are designed to keep water from building up near your home when it rains. You typically want to install your dry well near the downspout that has the biggest issue with water pooling up around it."

      "title": "Position the dry well 10 feet (3.0 m) from the downspout.",
      "content": "Position the dry well 10 feet (3.0 m) from the downspout. You need to place your dry well at least 10 feet (3.0 m) away from your home to ensure that you aren’t soaking the ground around your basement or foundation. The water may seep at least 25 feet (7.6 m) away from your well, so try not to aim it towards a neighbor’s home."

      "title": "Ensure the excess water will lead away from your home.",
      "content": "Ensure the excess water will lead away from your home. In the event that your dry well floods, you’ll want the excess water to pool up and drain away from your home. Look for a direction away from your spout with a slight decline away from your home. Choose a path that doesn’t lead to your walkway or driveway. Ideally, your dry well will never flood. Unfortunately, this can happen during storms or periods of intense rain. To make things easy, you can use a sequence of flags or spray paint to indicate the location of the drain pipe and dry well."

      "content": "Call your local government before you dig to check for utility lines. Once you know where you want to install your well, call your local government to let them know you need a consultation for a dry well. Unless you live in a rural area, there are utility lines running all over the place beneath your yard. Your local government will want to check to see if there are pipes where you plan on digging. This service is almost always free. You may need to pay for a permit to build a well though. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal obligation to contact your local government to let them know you’re planning on installing a dry well."

      "content": "Dig a 4 by 4 ft (1.2 by 1.2 m) hole where you want the dry well. Use a long-handled shovel to start digging where you want your well to go. Start in the center by pointing the head of your shovel into the well. Use the heel of your shoe to punch the shovel into the ground. Lift the dislodged soil and toss it on to a tarp or in a wheelbarrow so that you can dispose of it or reuse it later to fill your ditch. [2] X Research source Don’t do this if it has rained within the past 2 days. Try to dig the walls of your well straight down. This can be kind of tough though and it’s alright if the vertical sides angle down towards the center a little."

Use your shovel to dig in a straight line starting at the downspout. If there isn’t a decline running from your downspout to the well, dig slightly deeper as you work your way toward the well. [3] X Research source A small ditch designed to redirect water is called a swale."

      "content": "Connect a PVC downspout adaptor and elbow to your downspout. Measure the opening of your downspout and buy an adaptor that is the same size. Get an elbow joint to connect your adaptor to the ditch pipe. Slide the adaptor into the opening of your downspout and point the opening towards your ditch. Use a natural brush to add a layer of PVC glue to the inside of the connection for your elbow and adaptor. Slide the 2 pieces together hold it for 30-45 seconds to let the glue settle. PVC glue is toxic so you need to wear a dust mask and gloves when you’re working with it. You’re working outside though, so it shouldn’t be too tough to avoid the fumes."

      "content": "Apply glue to 4 in (10 cm) PVC pipe and lay your drain line. Apply glue to the inside of each pipe fitting. Use your brush to add 1-2 layers of glue to the inside of each outer-fitting. Slide each piece of PVC together and work from the downspout towards your ditch. Let each pipe sit for 30-45 minutes to give the PVC glue time to dry. Measure the distance from the bottom of your spout to the middle of your well to determine how much PVC piping you need to buy. Add 5–6 feet (1.5–1.8 m) to your pipe measurement so that you have some backup pieces in case you need some extra pieces. If you bought a flat length of pipe, add glue to the inside of each fitting ring before sliding each pipe together."

      "content": "Lay non-woven landscape fabric under your pipe as you work. While not mandatory, you can prevent leaks in your pipe from destroying or eroding the soil under your drain by laying unwoven landscape fabric underneath the pipe. Simply slice a length of fabric with a utility knife and slide it underneath your pipe as you’re laying it. [5] X Research source Use your PVC piping measurement to determine how much you need for your ditch. You’ll need plenty of excess fabric to stick out of each side of your well, so add 20–35 feet (6.1–10.7 m) to your order. The landscape fabric will diffuse water and divert it over a larger surface area to protect the soil underneath it. Landscape fabric is sometimes called geotextile."

      "content": "Buy a drain tank or make your own from a large bucket. Buy a drain tank if you want a clean connection between your pipes and the tank. Build your own if you want to save a little money. To build your own tank, get a large, plastic bucket. Drill 25-30 2 in (5.1 cm) drainage holes all over the bottom half of the bucket. Tanks aren’t particularly expensive to buy. If you use a bucket for your tank, it won’t be able to fit a pipe perfectly to the tank. This is fine though; the water will drip from the opening down to your bucket. A 40 US gal (150 L) drain tank will be perfect for a 4 by 4 feet (1.2 by 1.2 m) hole. There are bigger or smaller sizes though if you prefer."

Spread the sheets out and push them into the sides and floor of your well. Lower your drain tank into the center of your hole so that the opening at the top lines up with the drain pipe. This will ensure that you can connect your last piece of piping. You do not need to affix the fabric to anything. The weight from the tank and the gravel will keep it in place."

      "title": "Connect your drain pipe to the tank.",
      "content": "Connect your drain pipe to the tank. You have a few options when it comes to how you connect the pipe to the tank. You can use a PVC elbow and an adapting piece to glue pipes together and slide it into the top of the drain tank. If you want a looser connection, use PVC glue to add a flexible pipe to the last length of your pipe. Fit it over the hole to your drain tank and wrap a worm drive around the connection before pulling the adjustable tab to tighten it. If you don’t want to connect the pipe, you can run the PVC pipe right over the opening for you tank. If you’re using a bucket as an improvised drain tank you won’t have anything to connect your pipe to. Simply leave the PVC opening directly over your bucket. You have to use a flexible pipe if your PVC pipe isn’t perfectly aligned with the opening of your drain pipe."

      "content": "Fill in the remaining space in your well with loose gravel. Take your loose gravel and pour it all around your drain tank. Fill in the space over your tank once the sides are filled. Continue adding gravel until the pile of rocks is flush with the bed of your soil. Smooth the pile out on top so that it’s flat on your garden. Some people decorate the space around their gravel pit with flowers or decorative rocks. You can also add soil on top of the gravel, but this will make it hard to access your drain tank in the future. The gravel will ensure that the water drains evenly through the bottom of your well."

Either use a shovel to add the soil that you dug out from your ditch or pour rocks over each section of pipe. Try to avoid walking directly on your gravel or soil when you’re walking around your garden."
