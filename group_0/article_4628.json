      "content": "Combine the coating mix ingredients. In a medium bowl, whisk or stir together the flour, salt, pepper, thyme, tarragon, ginger, ground mustard, garlic salt, and oregano until the ingredients appear to be evenly distributed. [1] X Research source You should have just enough coating mix for this recipe, so you should not need to save any. If you choose to make a double batch, however, take what you need for this recipe and save the rest in an airtight container. It should last in your pantry for a few months, as well."

      "title": "Cut the legs off the chicken.",
      "content": "Cut the legs off the chicken. Twist the legs out of their joints and cut them away from the body of the chicken. Extend one leg as far away from the body as possible and cut through the skin to reveal the inner meat. Bend the leg back until the ball joint pops out of the socket. Cut the leg off from the body, slicing through the joint as close to the backbone as possible. Repeat this process with the other leg."

      "title": "Separate the drumstick and thigh.",
      "content": "Separate the drumstick and thigh. Look for the line of fat lying in between the drumstick and thigh portion of one leg. Cut along this line to separate the two portions. Repeat this step with the other leg. Note that this line of fat marks the location of the joint, and it is the joint itself that you need to cut through."

      "title": "Remove the inedible portions.",
      "content": "Remove the inedible portions. Cut through the ribs and collarbone on both sides of the body of the chicken using sharp, clean poultry shears. Pull away the back and the neck when finished. You should be able to remove the back and neck in one piece. These portions are usually discarded, but you can also save them for use in chicken stock. Place them in a sealed bag or container and refrigerate for up to 3 or 4 days."

      "title": "Loosen the breast meat.",
      "content": "Loosen the breast meat. Cut and twist the breast meat away from the remaining bone. Turn the chicken so that it lies with the breast skin facing down. Draw your knife through the breast, splitting it from the neck end to the breast bone. Score down the length of the breastbone, as well. Place your thumbs on either side of the breastbone and bend the breast portion of the chicken back until the top of the bone starts peeking out. Loosen the bone with your fingers and pull it out. Split the rest of the breast meat in half using your knife. Make the cut along the mark left by the breast bone."

      "content": "Soak the chicken pieces in salt water for 60 minutes. Pour 4 cups (1 L) of water into a large bowl and add 1/4 cup (60 ml) salt. Stir to combine, then place the chicken pieces in the water and allow them to soak for 60 minutes. Do not drain the chicken. You will remove it and add it directly to the coating mix when the time comes instead of letting the chicken dry first."

      "title": "Heat oil in the pressure cooker.",
      "content": "Heat oil in the pressure cooker. Pour the canola oil into the pressure cooker and set the pressure cooker on the stove. Heat the oil on high until it reaches a temperature of 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius). Make sure that your pressure cooker can be used on the stove. It should have a flat bottom, rather than sitting on elevated feet. Most pressure cookers are made from metals that are safe to use on the stove, but you should check the instructions that came with the pressure cooker to verify that stovetop use will not damage it."

      "title": "Add water to form a batter.",
      "content": "Add water to form a batter. Slowly pour up to 1/2 cup (125 ml) of water into the dry batter ingredients, whisking continuously. Stop adding water once you have a thin, smooth batter. You may not need the full 1/2 cup (125 ml), so it is important that you add the water slowly. The batter should be thin, but if it becomes too watery, it may not adhere to the chicken."

      "title": "Coat the chicken.",
      "content": "Coat the chicken. Remove a piece of chicken from the salt water using tongs and toss it directly into the batter. Use your tongs to turn the chicken in the batter until all sides are coated. Repeat this as needed, working with one piece of chicken at a time, until all the chicken has been coated. Hold each piece of chicken over the bowl of salt water for a few seconds to allow the excess water to drip off. You need the skin to be moist, but it should not be dripping wet. It is best to drop the chicken directly into the hot oil after coating it. If you place the chicken on a plate beforehand, some of the coating might wipe away."

      "title": "Deep-fry the chicken for 2 to 3 minutes.",
      "content": "Deep-fry the chicken for 2 to 3 minutes. Place the pieces of chicken in the hot oil, cooking a few at a time. Fry each piece for 2 to 3 minutes or until the coating becomes crisp and lightly golden. Remove the finished pieces of chicken from the hot oil using tongs and transfer them to a plate lined with several layers of clean paper towel. All pieces should be on this plate before you move onto the next step."

      "title": "Drain most of the oil.",
      "content": "Drain most of the oil. After frying the chicken, pour off all but 1/4 cup (60 ml) of the oil. [2] X Research source Add 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water to the pressure cooker, as well, before continuing on. You should avoid using more than 1/4 cup (60 ml) of oil in your pressure cooker while the pressure cooking function is active. Oil and other fats rise to a much higher temperature than water and water-based liquids, and when heated in a pressure cooker, the oil could overheat and cause burns. Make sure the water is warm to hot when you add it to the hot oil. Adding cold water could produce steam and cause the oil to splatter. It is strongly recommended that you wear oven mitts when you do this step to avoid burning yourself on the oil or the hot pressure cooker."

      "title": "Cover and cook for 10 to 12 minutes.",
      "content": "Cover and cook for 10 to 12 minutes. Put the chicken back in the pressure cooker. Tightly secure the lid onto the pressure cooker and cook the chicken inside for another 10 to 12 minutes, or until it is no longer pink in the middle. Make sure that the pressure cooker trivet or rack is in place before you return the chicken to the basin and cover it. Consult the manufacturer's instructions to determine how to engage the pressure regulator. The pressure should usually be set to 15 lb (6.8 kg). Consult the instructions for brand-specific guidelines on pressure. Do not attempt to open the pressure cooker during the cooking process."

      "title": "Remove the lid.",
      "content": "Remove the lid. Pull up the pressure valve and allow the vapor to completely escape before unlatching and removing the lid. You must allow the vapor to escape before you open the lid. If you open the lid too quickly, you could actually burn yourself on the burst of steam that will rush out."

      "title": "Drain the chicken.",
      "content": "Drain the chicken. Remove the chicken with tongs and transfer the pieces to another plate lined in fresh paper towels. Allow the excess oil to drain off for about five minutes. During this time, you are also allowing the chicken to cool slightly. While you'll want this chicken to be hot when you eat it, the internal temperatures will usually be a little too hot when you initially pull the chicken out of the pressure cooker."

    {
      "title": "Serve hot.",
      "content": "Serve hot. You should enjoy the chicken while it is still freshly cooked and warm. The chicken can be saved, but it can become soggy when you reheat it, so it is best eaten when freshly cooked. If you do choose to save the chicken, place it in an airtight container and refrigerate it for up to 4 or 5 days."
