      "content": "If you want to let him know it's over, here's what you can say via text. There's no good way to break up with the special man in your life, but keeping it direct, sincere, and respectful is important. Typically, you'll want to reflect on the relationship while explaining why it needs to end. Here are some ideas. \"I remember the first time we met. It was 4th period English on a rainy day, and you had asked me for a pencil. Look how far we’ve come since then, growing in love while growing up. Our history has bonded us for life, even if we have to part ways now. I’ll never regret a moment of our time together.\" \"You were the first love of my life. I’ll always think of you that way, as the boy who made me feel worthy, as if I mattered. You have that amazing gift of making everyone around you feel special– never lose it! The right person for you won’t take any of your wonderful qualities for granted, like I regrettably did. I hope we can get together later on and catch up one day.\" \"I’ll never forget our first date. You wore a blue polo shirt and ordered the orange chicken. I wore white and ordered the egg drop soup. Since then, you’ve been a constant in my life, pushing me to grow in so many ways. Saying goodbye is really hard, and my eyes are tearing up as I write this, but I know it’s the best thing for us both.\" \"Our time together has been so memorable. From the first weekend road trip we took up to Big Sur to the last set of matching tattoos– you’ve been with me through thick and thin. Believe me when I say I never envisioned this happening– I thought we’d be together forever. But I think it’s finally time we both accept that it’s better for us to go our separate ways.\" \"Waking up without you by my side hurts. I got so used to seeing your eyes flutter open in the morning after a sweet, deep sleep, but I’m at peace knowing that the time we shared together was a gift. I hope you are, too. And I also hope you know that there are no hard feelings because love as deep as ours is always laced with a little pain. So, no more pain. Only joy, even if we wake up in separate beds.\" \"You’ve been my best friend for so long. You’ve been there beside me to celebrate every birthday and to offer a shoulder to cry on after every disappointment. I can’t imagine my life without you, although I’ll have to from now on. You’ll find someone who can fulfill you in all the ways I fell short, which is exactly what you deserve.\" \"You’ve brought so much joy and adventure to my life. From the moment you stepped in it, I knew nothing would ever be the same. And nothing will be now that you’ve left it. I wish you nothing but thrills, love, and laughter, even if it’s not with me. I truly hope you find the kind of love you deserve.\" \"Our love story has been so beautiful. Your kindness, generosity, and positive influence will never be forgotten. But it’s time to move on and close this beautiful, albeit sometimes painful, chapter of our lives together. You’ve changed me for the better, and I hope you think of me fondly when I do cross your mind.\" \"The end of this relationship has deeply affected me. I want you to know that even though it was my decision, it was the hardest one I’ve ever had to make. Please reach out to me if you ever need anything, as I promised to always be there for you, and I meant it.\" \"You’ve taught me so much about the world. Not only that, but I’ve also learned so much about myself throughout our relationship, and I thank you for that. You’ve taught me love and patience and opened my eyes to different points of view. No matter what happened between us, you deserve happiness, and I hope that you find it.\""

      "content": "Let your lady know it's over tactfully via a breakup paragraph. If your love affair has come to an end, thoughtfully consider how you want to word it in a breakup paragraph. Acknowledge the good times while looking ahead toward your separate futures. Here are a few ways to do it. \"You are such a beautiful soul. Our time together has changed me forever. I hope that one day down the road, we can catch up over some coffee and pancakes– our favorite– and see how far we’ve come. Until then, I’ll think of you warmly.\" \"Nothing could have prepared me for this. Our untimely end has truly devastated me. I thought we’d get married and have a family, and now I’m having to reimagine my entire future without you in it. I’m sorry I couldn’t save us.\" \"The truth is, I’ve felt this way for a long time. My love for you has never faltered, but I think I’ve known for a while that we’re not long-term compatible. The things you want for your life are not the same ones I want for mine, and I’m sorry I can’t give them to you. I wish things were different.\" \"The thought of being without you is crushing. I didn’t sleep all night, just thinking about the fact that I’ll never hold you in my arms again. I can’t believe we’ve reached this point of no return. I don’t know if there will be a day that passes where I won’t think of you and wonder how you’re doing… even if it’ll be too painful to reach out and ask.\" \"Thank you for all you’ve done for me. You’ve taught me so much about loyalty and friendship and pushed me to be better because you saw my potential. I hope you felt seen, too, because your light was and is unmatched. Words cannot express how much you’ve meant to me.\" \"I’ve never met somebody like you. Your humor, kindness, and quirkiness are one of a kind, and anyone who knows you is lucky, myself included. The warmth and joy you bring with you when you enter a room should be studied for science. I feel grateful to have had you as the star in my solar system for as long as I did.\" \"You’ve been my rock all this time. You’ve stood by my side and asked for nothing in return, and for that, I’ll be forever grateful. Perhaps I was like the river that broke through the rock, slowly eroding it into dust. I’m sorry I couldn’t add to your strength, and I hope you find somebody who can.\" \"My happiest moments have been spent with you. Every trip, joyride, late-night taco mission, fit of inappropriate laughter– you’ve been behind them. Thank you. You’ve been a shining light in my life, and your absence has left a darkness that I did not expect. Please don’t dim yourself for anyone– you deserve to shine bright.\" \"I really never wanted to give up on us. I sincerely thought we could go the distance. But after years of couples counseling and little change, I think it’s best that we be honest with ourselves and move on. Please tell me what you need from me for a smooth transition, and I’ll try my best to facilitate this in any way I can.\" \"I couldn’t have asked for a better, more loyal girlfriend. You’ve stood by me when I had nothing, and you celebrated with me when I had everything. You’ve taught everything I never knew I needed to know about love, trust, friendship. The most bitter lesson of all is realizing that love isn’t enough, is it? If it were, we wouldn’t be here, broken up. But I trust that God had a different plan for us, and I hope we can make each other proud, even if only from a distance.\""

      "content": "If you’ve decided that it’s over, send a quick text to inform them. Perhaps you don’t want to make it a big deal, or perhaps you simply want the breakup to reflect the length or seriousness of the relationship. [1] X Research source Here are some short— and bittersweet— ways to convey the message that the relationship is done. “You’ve tried, I’ve tried— we’ve both tried everything. There’s nothing left to try, so let’s end it here before we get hurt even worse.” “I’m sorry I couldn’t be the person you needed. It’s over. I wish you the best.” “Our relationship is over. There’s nothing left to save. Goodbye.” “You deserve somebody who prioritizes you above all else, and I realized I’m not in a position to do that. And because I love you, I have to let you go.” “I don’t think we’re as compatible as we originally thought. We have to break up. I hope there are no hard feelings.” “I wish you happiness, and I know that’s not with me. Please take care of yourself. Goodbye.” “Our love burned hard and fast, and now it’s faded to an ember. Let’s go our separate ways before there’s nothing left but ashes.” “As it turns out, maybe opposites don’t attract. I wish you the best with someone who can love you the right way. Take care.” “I think we should break up and just be friends.” “After much thought, I need to be in a relationship with someone who suits my lifestyle better. I hope you understand.”"

      "title": "Long breakup paragraphs help to express all of your feelings.",
      "content": "Long breakup paragraphs help to express all of your feelings. When breaking up with someone, a call might result in too many questions that could change your mind or result in confusion, and an in-person meeting might get too emotional. Sending your partner a lengthy paragraph detailing all your feelings and reasons could offer a clean end to your story. You can ask rhetorical questions or even include a quote to further express yourself. Here are some ways to go about that. “I was looking back at some of my journal entries from when we first met. Before you, I was a complete mess. Unsure, lost, sick of taking crumbs of affection from people when I knew I deserved more. Then you came along. You, with your megawatt smile and your terrible taste in music, which was still so charming somehow. You brought me back to life, and I’ll be forever grateful. Our relationship thrived for a long time… until it didn’t. We both walked in opposite directions for so long and when we finally stopped and turn around to look for the other person, we realized we were both totally alone. We’ve grown apart, but I’ll always remember us as we were once: young, wild, in love, and on the same beautiful path, walking hand in hand.” “Some people call it destiny, kismet, fate— I just thought we were meant to be. From the first moment I laid eyes on you in that blue polka dot dress and cowboy boots, I knew you’d be someone I’d fall really hard for. I loved everything about you immediately— your sense of style, humor, all your little celebrity impersonations. You checked boxes I didn’t even know I had. Your laughter was contagious, as was your generosity and warm spirit. I feel so lucky to have known you, to have let you shine in my life like a star. No, not just a star— a sun, the center of my entire world. And while letting you go feels like I’m severing off a limb of my own, I know that it’s the right thing to do. You deserve a passionate, exciting, adventurous life with somebody who knows how to keep your fire alive. I’m sorry I ever tried to dim it. But I’ll never be sorry I loved you for as long as I got to.” “I know I need to let you go, but I’m really struggling with that at the moment. How can I willingly let go of my best friend, my partner, my whole life? It’s been three years, but it feels like I just met you yesterday. Since that pivotal moment, my life has never been the same. You’ve opened my eyes to everything from sweet plantains to Icelandic post-rock to the miracle of unconditional love. I’d never experienced that before— somebody loving me despite all my faults. Perhaps, even because of them. On the wall of his room in rehab, David Foster Wallace once wrote, ‘Everything I've ever let go of has claw marks on it.’ [2] X Research source That’s how I feel about you: I know I have to let you go, but I just want to hold on a little longer, if only a moment.” “Do you remember the time we visited my parents in Ojai? We’d driven for hours, and it was Christmas Eve. The gorgeous little mountain town unfolded at the end of a wide road, as if it and its residents had been suspended in animation in anticipation of our arrival. There were the cutest shops and bakeries, the chocolate place where you bought $50 worth of fudge. Some miles away, the Pacific Ocean roared like an animal wounded by love. I wish I had known it would be the only time we’d go there together, so that I could have absorbed every single detail, from your strawberry hair glowing in the morning sun to the sweet pears my mom picked and poached in red wine for us. Maybe I remember more than I think. Maybe these memories will hold me over for the rest of my life— they’re all I’ll have left of you.” “I wish I had met you when we were kids. I wish I could have been your neighbor and that we could have opened up a lemonade stand together. I wish I could have gone to all of your birthday parties, watched you run through the sprinklers in your pink tie-dye swimsuit, taken you to every homecoming dance… I wish I could have been your first everything. I guess I’ll have to settle for being your penultimate everything. The last first kiss before your final first kiss. The last ‘I love you’ before your final I love you. The last handhold before you hold the hand you’re going to hold forever. If only it were mine. I’m already jealous of your final love, but I know you deserve to find it.” “When I spoke to your sister and told her we were breaking up, she was in complete shock. Nobody would have expected it, right? From the outside in, we looked like the perfect couple, didn’t we? We presented a united front, never revealing the truth of how we were really feeling inside. All the conflict that happened behind closed doors affected us both deeply, although we had tried for years to move past it. We couldn’t, could we? Too many fights, some of them lasting the entire length of our relationship, slowly chiseled away at the marble block of our love. Maybe the masterpiece was choosing ourselves, and choosing peace and choosing the truth, versus hiding in the shadows instead of facing an unavoidable reality.” “I just want to take this opportunity to thank you. Thank you for always knowing exactly the right thing to say to make me smile. Thank you for making me the best birthday cakes every single year, and particularly for the blueberry lemon one last year. Thank you for being so kind to my friends and family. Thank you for helping me practice my French. Thank you for kissing me even with morning breath. Thank you for encouraging me to love all the things about me that I hated. Thank you for your optimism and strength. Thank you for watching reality TV with me and for introducing me to the world of science fiction. Thank you for your generosity and for teaching me how to be more like you. Thank you for your empathy and humility. Thanking for making me feel I was worthy of your radiant, one-of-a-kind love. Thank you for everything.” “What began as a friendship turned into the greatest love story of my life. I always thought you were beautiful, but a total mystery that I was too intimidated to try and solve. When you finally let me in, I quickly realized I was right to worry— I was in over my head. I’d never been with anyone as dynamic, brilliant, or consuming as you. And I loved it at first, despite my fears about not being able to handle you. But it wasn’t sustainable, and before long, I could tell you resented me for not matching your energy. That’s why it’s time to end this now, before your resentment grows into hatred, which would truly destroy me. When I say that I wish you the best, know that I mean it from the bottom of my heart. “In one of my favorite Vance Joy songs, the lyrics ask, “When you think of love, do you think of pain?” [3] X Research source I know what my answer to that question is now. My love for you has caused me more pain than I could have ever imagined, but I guess that must mean it was real. It wasn’t just puppy love, or something I wanted until I got, or used to fill a void— it was the deepest love I’ve ever experienced. Something I never thought possible, in general, but for me specifically. Me, my fractured past like a field of landmines. And you were brave enough to walk through it to get to me. But the bomb of our love still went off in the end, and here we are, picking up the pieces. For the rest of my days, I’ll think of this as the happiest and saddest time in my life.\" “I thought it might feel nice to have some time to myself again, really figure myself out and learn what I want out of life now that our relationship is over. But as it turns out, I miss you more than anything else. The time I spend alone is mostly time I spend thinking about you, the way your hands kneaded bread, the smell of your hair after a beach day. I’ve been reflecting a lot on our relationship, and I finally see all the things you did, all the cracks and dings. I thought these made us unique, but now I see how unhappy you were and all that I could have done in the moment to remedy it. I never did, and instead chose to turn a blind eye from our problems, which is probably what lead us here, on the last page of our beautiful and painful book.”"

You can tell them exactly how upset you are, how empty your life feels without them, and/or remind them of all the good times that will never happen again. Warning: don't be surprised if they send a gut-wrenching paragraph back. Here are some examples. \"My heart is broken . Shattered into a thousand splinters. What if things had been different? I guess we’ll never know. All I know now is I’m going to need a lot of time to heal from what I thought was my happy ending. I’ll try to write a new one– you do the same.\" \"I have no idea how to move on. How are you supposed to move on from the person you thought you’d know forever? I keep asking these questions over and over again. I know you can’t answer them. So, we’ll just let these thoughts hang in the distance between us like paper lanterns, warmed by the memory of our love. Goodbye.\" \"There’s a hole in my life in the shape of you. Nothing else fits in it, not even my pain. I hope you know that what we had was real, raw, intense. I’ve never felt that way about anyone, and I don’t think I ever will. All the love I had left in me– you took it with you.\" \"You will always be the one that got away. The next pair of lips I kiss will remind me of you. The next hand I hold will remind me of you. Every girl I meet, I’ll compare to you, which is so unfair to them. But all I can do is be honest with myself, and I know I’ll never forget you– nor will I want to. You’ve ruined me for all loves to come.\" \"Forever and a day– that’s how long I’ll love you. I believe you and I are twin flames, meaning our souls have been intertwined before we were born and will remain intertwined long after we die. In this life and the next, I will love you, even if I never see you again. Maybe especially then.\" \"I can’t imagine anything more painful than this. It feels like a bullet to the heart, a sharp and unrelenting pain. I didn’t know humans could endure this and live– add it to the list of all the things you’ve taught me. It makes sense now, what they say: 'Grief is love with no place to go.'\" [4] X Research source \"This is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to go through. It’s as if I’m mourning the death of somebody who is still alive. Why did you have to go and make me feel like you’d love me forever when your love actually had an expiration date on it? Your love spoiled, became rotten, made me sick. How will I ever recover?\" \"The thought of never holding you again kills me. I might as well not have hands, because all they’re good for is missing you and praying that you come back to me. I know it may not be any time soon, but I’ll never give up on wishing we could work.\" \"I wish we could go back to the beginning before all of this. If I had a time machine, I’d go back to the first day we met. I’d hold you and never let you go. I’d cherish every kiss, giggle, secret– I’d take nothing for granted. Even if I knew this is how it would end, I’d still do it all over again.\" \"I feel like a fish out of water without you here. I’m gasping for air, trying to make sense of this nightmare. One moment, we were happy and planning for the future, and the next, you were crying on my doorstep in the rain. The words you said have changed me forever. I understand I have to let you go, even if it feels like I’m drowning. For now, all I can do is try to breathe.\""

      "content": "Quote others in your breakup paragraph for added meaning. James Baldwin once said, “You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read.” [5] X Research source Literature, and media as a whole, can help us process big life events, like breakups. It can show us how other people have reacted to this kind of pain before, allowing us to feel less alone. Here is what others have had to say on the subject of ending a romantic relationship, which you can include in your breakup paragraph. “For what it’s worth... it’s never too late [...] to be whoever you want to be. There’s no time limit. Start whenever you want. You can change or stay the same. There are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you’ve never felt before. I hope you meet people who have a different point of view. I hope you live a life you’re proud of, and if you’re not, I hope you have the courage to start over again.” ― F. Scott Fitzgerald [6] X Research source “I couldn't sleep last night because I know that it's over between us. I'm not bitter anymore because I know that what we had was real. And if, in some distant place in the future, we see each other in our new lives, I'll smile at you with joy and remember how we spent the summer beneath the trees, learning from each other and growing in love. The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds, and that's what you've given me. That's what I hope to give to you forever. I love you. I'll be seeing you.” —Nicholas Sparks, “The Notebook” \"I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go, things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they're right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.\"— Marilyn Monroe [7] X Research source “You cannot prevent the birds of sorrow from flying over your head, but you can prevent them from building nests in your hair.” — Chinese Proverb “The truth is, unless you let go, unless you forgive yourself, unless you forgive the situation, unless you realize that the situation is over, you cannot move forward.”— Steve Maraboli \"You replace these old habits with new habits, like texting your friends in a group chat all day and planning fun dinner parties and going out on adventures with your girlfriends, and then all of a sudden one day you're in London and you realize you've been in the same place as your ex for two weeks and you're fine. And you hope he's fine.\" — Taylor Swift. “You have to love. You have to feel. It is the reason you are here on earth. You are here to risk your heart. You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness. Tell yourself you tasted as many as you could.”— Louise Erdrich, “The Painted Drum” \"Pain is a part of life. Sometimes it's a big part, and sometimes it isn't, but either way, it's a part of the big puzzle, the deep music, the great game. Pain does two things: It teaches you, tells you that you're alive. Then it passes away and leaves you changed. It leaves you wiser, sometimes. Sometimes it leaves you stronger.\" — Jim Butcher “We believe that we can change the things around us in accordance with our desires—we believe it because otherwise we can see no favorable outcome. We do not think of the outcome which generally comes to pass and is also favorable: we do not succeed in changing things in accordance with our desires, but gradually our desires change. The situation that we hoped to change because it was intolerable becomes unimportant to us. We have failed to surmount the obstacle, as we were absolutely determined to do, but life has taken us round it, led us beyond it, and then if we turn round to gaze into the distance of the past, we can barely see it, so imperceptible has it become.” — Marcel Proust, “In Search of Lost Time” “It is always important to know when something has reached its end. Closing circles, shutting doors, finishing chapters, it doesn't matter what we call it; what matters is to leave in the past those moments in life that are over.” ― Paulo Coelho, “The Zahir”"

      "content": "Process the end of a lengthy relationship with a breakup paragraph. When a relationship has run its course after a few years together, this can be particularly painful and difficult. Hopefully, you’ve reached a mutual agreement in person about the end of your relationship, but sending them a post-break-up paragraph can help you heal and process. Here are some ideas on what to say after a long relationship ends. “It’s been five years and I still remember the day we met. It was a Tuesday and it was snowing in St. Paul. You’d left your glove on the park bench, and I chased you down to give it back. It wasn’t until my face finally met yours on that cold January day that I realized how beautiful you were. I still feel the same way, even if our paths have diverged. Wishing you all the love and happiness in the world.” “I’ve learned so much over the course of our relationship. I was a kid when we met, in my 20s, unsure of where to go or what to do next. You helped center me, offered me the stability I didn’t know I needed, and for that, I’ll always be thankful. I hope I’ve encouraged your growth, too, in whatever small ways I could. Think of me the next time you hear John Mayer sing— I’ll always think of you for the rest of my life. You’ve left a lasting impression on my heart.” “You’ve been my best friend, lover, and roommate for the past few years. Letting you go was something I never thought I’d have to do. I envisioned our future together— marriage, children, a big house with a wraparound porch where we would drink wine and watch the sun sink in the sky. But that wasn’t in the plan for us, as we have morphed into totally different people from the ones we were when we met. I forgive you and I accept our new future, separate but still bright. You deserve the world, and I know that soon enough, you’ll find the right person who will give it to you.” “I hope you move on from our six-year love story, and I hope I never have to hear about it. I don’t want to think about you holding another hand, kissing another pair of lips, or sleeping beside another warm body in the bed that was once ours. It would kill me to imagine you happy, laughing, once again starry-eyed in the blue mist of new love. The truth is: I may feel this way again, too, but it’ll never be the same as it was with you. Our love was so comfortable, so perfectly worn in, and when the highs were high, it was the stuff of fairytales. I don’t know about you, but I know I’ll never find that again.” “Ten years with you has felt like a lifetime, in good and not-so-good ways. I loved you, you loved me, I hurt you, you hurt me, we went to therapy, took time apart, and came back together only to realize that what we had once is completely gone. I’ll miss you as my friend, my partner, my love… but I’ll be relieved to have a fresh start with someone new. I hope you will be too.” “What if we could go back in time to three years ago with the knowledge we have now? Would we still go on that first date? Would you still ask me to be your girlfriend two weeks in? Should we have taken more time to get to know each other, to really figure out if we were compatible before we fell too in love to reason? It’s clear now that we’re not meant to be, but that doesn’t take away the pain I feel. I hope it helps to take away yours.” “On paper, we made perfect sense. When we met all those years ago, we were both pursuing our passions in grad school, and we both made it through, supporting each other every step of the way and growing in love. Who knew we’d end up growing apart? It was a natural progression, I suppose, and the older we got, the more different we became. I’m sorry I couldn’t bend— only break.” “When you finally spit out that you thought we should break up, I was in disbelief. We’d been together for so long, and I could never have imagined a life without you… until you uttered those words. When the shock wore off and I realized you were really serious, I started thinking about what my life would look like without you. Sure, there were cons, but there were also pros, which I did not anticipate. Ultimately, I agreed with you, and now, I thank you for making that difficult decision for us. I never would have pulled the trigger and we would have been miserable forever.” “After four years, I have some questions for you. They don’t require an answer, but I wanted you to know that they’ll be percolating in my mind for a while after this. Did you ever really love me? When you asked to be my boyfriend, was it because you hoped I would fix you? Did you ever envision marriage, children, growing old together? You said you did, but was that true? Who will make me lemon chicken soup when I have a cold? Who will remind me to carry a jacket after checking the weather? Why did you leave? Is there someone else? Does she sing in the shower? Is she taller than me? Will she keep your heart safe? When you close your eyes, will you still see me?” “I’d like to set aside some time for you to come by the house to pick up your things. After two years, you’ve accumulated a ton of stuff. I’ll stay out of your way unless you need my help. Let me know what date and time this would work best for you. I’m happy to facilitate a smooth transition back to our individual lives as seamlessly as possible.”"

Whether it was a month-long fling or a two-week romantic rendezvous, be clear and concise. Here are some examples. “Hey. We’ve had a good time so far, but I don’t want anything serious right now, and I don’t think it would be fair to lead you on. Let’s end things now before anyone gets hurt. I hope you understand, and I wish you all the best!” “I know we talked about going on a trip this weekend, but I honestly think this fling has run its course. You haven’t done anything wrong, but we discussed early on that we wanted to keep it light and taking a trip together would feel like we were taking it to the next level, which we agreed not to do. Wish you well!” “After spending so much time together lately, I realized that I need to work through some personal issues before I can enter a relationship. I’ll reach out to you again in a few months if you’re open to it. Good luck and best wishes!” “I don’t think our relationship has long-term potential, so I believe that it’s best to part ways now while it’s still early. You’re going to find someone perfect for you— it’s just not me!” “I really enjoyed this tiny slice of eternity we’ve spent together, but I do want to spend more time working on my art. There’s nothing you could have done differently, and I genuinely don’t mean to hurt you. Quite the opposite, I wish you the best!” “We’ve had such a good time together, but I think we can both agree that this can’t go anywhere. We both want such different things out of life, and it just won’t work. I hope you find what you’re looking for!” “I’m so glad to have met you, and our brief time together will forever stay with me. I wish you luck, love, and luminous joy! Cheers.” “Hey, I don’t think we should hang out anymore. I’ve met someone that I see long-term potential with, and I know that’s not what you’re looking for. Hope you understand!” “I had lots of fun with you, but it’s time to move on. Nothing personal at all. Goodbye and good luck!” “Let’s end things. You deserve someone who can provide you with the love and affection you need! And I hope you find them!”"

      "content": "Make the healthy move away from an abusive relationship with these texts. Know your worth and cut off any relationship that doesn't make you feel valued, seen, or loved. Although these toxic relationships can be some of the most difficult to leave, here are a few ways to let them know you're done putting up with their abuse. “After such a long time of living in the fog of your abuse, I’ve finally seen the light. I’m leaving, taking everything I own with me, and you’ll have no way of ever finding me again. After I send this message, you’ll be blocked, so don’t even bother replying. Goodbye forever.” “You can’t treat me poorly anymore. I’m done feeling like a pebble in your shoe. I’ve called my friends, and they’ll be here when you get home. You’ll have a chance to pack up all your things and go. This is not up for discussion, and I never want to see you again after today.” “Over the last few months, you’ve become the most toxic person I’ve ever met. Your constant criticisms of my character are not only unfounded, but incredibly cruel. This relationship is over, and I’ll be the better for it.” “You have hurt me in more ways than I thought possible. I know you don’t see it now, but one day, I hope you can reflect on your actions with remorse. I have nothing left to say except goodbye. I wish I could say I wished you well, but I can’t.” “Why would I stay with someone who treated me like scum? I wouldn’t. That’s the answer. So, I’m not. Our relationship is over, for good. I’ll never go back to you again. Please delete my number.” “You’ve damaged me permanently and I can’t stand for it anymore. We’re done. Please take all of your disdain and lock it up inside you, where it belongs. Nobody deserves that kind of treatment. “I’m doing what I should have done a long time ago: breaking up with you. Don’t call. Don’t text. And don’t ever think you’ll be able to treat me like that again. I’m beyond done with you and your abuse.” “Instead of saying all the horrible things I want to say to you, I’ll say this instead: I hope you seek help. I hope you take your anger issues seriously and work toward fixing them. I hope you find a therapist that will teach you how to treat people you ‘love.’ And I hope you learn what that even means, one day.” “Being with you has taught me a lot about how I don’t want to ever be treated moving forward, so, thank you. Our relationship is over. Good luck not having me as your punching bag.” “I’m breaking up with you. In time, I hope to heal from all the grief you’ve put me through. It will take a long, long time, but I’m hopeful. Without meaning to do so, you’ve made me stronger, so I guess our relationship wasn’t a total waste.”"

Breakups are always hard, but if your partner has cheated on you, your anger and pain are certainly valid. Try to remain as graceful and respectful as possible, despite the fact that they truly wronged you. “Try” is the key word here. Here are some examples of how to do it. “It’s over. I know what you did and although I’m hurt, I’m more so disgusted. Your things are on the porch in trash bags. Please do not contact me again unless it’s absolutely necessary.” “I’m breaking up with you. I hope she was worth it and that you’re happy with her. Not really, but that feels like a kind thing to say. No need to apologize or make excuses— I saw it happen with my own eyes.” “I can’t believe you did this to me. We are done. Please take all the things I left at your place and mail them to me. I never want to see you again.” “I know you cheated on me with your co-worker. We are over-- we are more than over. The bond we once had is completely severed. Good luck going through life, knowing you ruined the best thing that’s ever happened to you.” “You cheated on me 48 hours after you told me I was the love of your life. Lol. We’re so over. I wish you the life you deserve. Never talk to me again.” “You must be dumber than I thought to think you could cheat on me and keep me. I was gone before you even finished admitting what you did. Please get rid of my contact info and forget I ever existed. Goodbye.” “I guess we did have artistic differences after all. I saw you as faithful, and you saw the hot new neighbor as your next pursuit. I wish you the best of luck together, and I hope you can live with yourselves.” “You’ve said you’re sorry 1000 times and I could not care less. You are dead to me. I truly hope it was all worth it— your affair, sacrificing our relationship, my pain.” “Congratulations, you’re single now and free to be with whoever you want. You were already doing that, but now, at least, I won’t be made to look like a total clown in the process. Good luck with your future circus!” “I’m not sure how I’m supposed to trust anybody ever again, but I guess that’s not your problem. I’m leaving you and your new girlfriend alone, just like you wanted. Enjoy your miserable lives together.”"

If you’ve been on one date with a person and you felt no fireworks, it might be a good idea to send the breakup paragraph via text explaining why. Feel free to keep it short and sweet, as you don’t owe this person as much as you would someone you were in a real relationship with. Examples: “Although I had a nice time on our date, I don’t think we had romantic chemistry. No hard feelings though! Wish you better luck next time!” “After going on our date, I realized we have better potential as friends. Let me know if you’d be interested in that— I would be, you’re awesome! Hope you understand.” “Dinner was fun, but I think you’re looking for something more serious than I am. Let’s just stay friends, and maybe we can try again down the line. Hope there’s no hard feelings!” “Hey, last night was great, but I’m getting more of a friend vibe! I hope you did too! Wish you the best with dating though!” “I didn’t feel a romantic connection on our date, but I do wish you the best! You’re a wonderful person and I have no doubts you’ll be off the market soon. Lucky them!” “It doesn’t seem like you’re quite over your ex yet, and I don’t want to feel like a rebound. So, it’s best if we go our separate ways. Good luck!” “I didn’t appreciate the way you acted last night, so I’m going to have to end things here. Our personalities simply don’t mesh, and that’s okay. Best of luck out there.” “You were very sweet on our date, and I really appreciate you taking me out. However, I realized I’m not ready to prioritize romance right now. I hope you understand and that there’s no hard feelings.” “That first date was one for the books… and not in a good way. Please don’t contact me again. Goodbye.” “If our first date was a foreshadowing for the rest of our relationship, I think it’s best if we stop seeing each other now. I hope you find someone that can match your vibe. See ya.”"

If you find yourself having to end a friendship you thought would stand the test of time, it may really sting. Here are some ways to broach the subject thoughtfully and kindly. “As much as I care about you, I think we’ve grown apart drastically. We don’t see eye to eye on anything anymore, and I don’t feel safe sharing my thoughts or feelings with you. It’s best that we take time to focus on our individual lives, while always wishing each other well.” “I’ve been there for you through the years, but I’m afraid I can’t be your rock anymore. There’s lots of things you need to work on without me enabling you, and I think it’s time to take a pause in our friendship. I hope there are no hard feelings and that we can have a good chat later down the line and laugh again.” “I don’t support of the way in which you’ve been acting. I know you’ve been going through a rough patch, but I have to prioritize my peace and well-being. Please understand that I need to be away from you for a while, although I hope not forever.” “I’ve tried to help you over the past few months but I’ve now realized that I can’t. You need to help yourself, and I can’t be a part of it. I wish you nothing but health, wealth, and joy, and I’ll always be cheering for you from the sidelines.” “You’ve been my friend since we were kids but it has recently felt like we’ve reached an impasse in our friendship. We see things so differently now, and feelings have been hurt, and trust has been broken. With a heavy heart, I think it’s time we go our separate ways.” “I thought you’d be my friend forever, until this happened. There’s no love lost, but I no longer trust you, and a friendship without trust is nothing. I hope you heal from all your past wounds, and I sincerely wish you the best. I just can’t be in your life anymore.” “I’ve asked you repeatedly to change your behavior as it has been affecting me, and you haven’t. So, I can no longer accept apologies without changed behavior. Please don’t try to contact me as I don’t want to continue being friends with you and that will make it harder for everyone.” “Despite our best efforts, a friendship between us is no longer sustainable. You’ve been there for me and I’ll be eternally grateful, but it’s time face reality. Please take care of yourself and know I’ll always think back fondly on all the good times we shared.” “Unfortunately, I see no other solution than to end this friendship. We’ve upset each other continuously for months now over and we simply can’t reach an agreement on the matter. I respect you and love you, which is why I ask that we end our friendship now before resentment takes over.” “You may not have been my friend for life, like I know we both had hoped, but you were a good friend for a long time, and that’s not nothing. I wish you the very best, and I’m sorry we couldn’t figure out our issues. Goodbye, old friend.”"

      "content": "Send a direct, kind, and respectful breakup text. There’s no way to soften the blow of ending a relationship, but following the next steps might help the transition back to single-dom. Here’s a breakdown of how to word your breakup paragraph. Tell them directly that you want to break up. You can open with something along the lines of, “I don’t want to be in this relationship anymore” or “We need to break up.” You can also include a reason for the breakup, like, “We’re just not compatible enough to make it work.” Mention positive takeaways from the relationship. Let them know how much you enjoyed certain events or moments. You can say something like, “I’ll never forget our trip to NYC” or “Our time together has been marked by so much joy.” Don’t point blame. Even if you feel like your partner is at fault for the end of the relationship, pointing fingers won’t solve anything after you’ve already decided to break up. Instead, just take accountability for what you can. Examples: “I know we both really did try to make it work” and “It’s time to accept that we failed.” Wish them the best. This may seem cliche, but ending a relationship on a positive note is never a bad thing. Let them know that you hope they find love elsewhere and that you’ll think of them fondly. You can say something like, “I wish you nothing but joy and success in your next relationship” or “Wishing you the very best, always.”"
