      "content": "Have a strong understanding of the courts and equipment. Badminton can be played on any type of court. However, at the professional level, matches take place on a court that is 20 feet (6.1 m) in diameter with a length of 44 feet (13 m). A net is then placed horizontally across the court, approximately 5 feet (1.5 m) off the ground. [1] X Research source Badminton can be played recreationally on either an indoor or outdoor court."

      "title": "Understand the different types of shuttlecocks.",
      "content": "Understand the different types of shuttlecocks. Players will hit the shuttlecock (also called a birdie) back and forth over the net to score points. They are generally made from plastic and contain feathers at their base for speed. Shuttlecocks come in 3 different speeds (slow, medium, and fast) for different levels of players. For beginners, plastic shuttles are ideal because of their durability and reasonable price. It is recommended to start with a shuttlecock with a medium speed. Altitude and temperature will determine which shuttlecock is best to use. The lowest shuttle speeds should be used in areas with high altitudes such as Colorado Springs, CO and the Yunnan Province in China. Medium speeds are best to use while at sea level. Leaving shuttlecocks with the fastest speeds for areas below sea level or with cold temperatures."

      "title": "Know how to score the game.",
      "content": "Know how to score the game. Players rally until the first player or team reaches 21 points. A single point is awarded when a player fails to return the shuttlecock. This can be when the shuttlecock hits the ground, hits the net, or is out-of-bounds. Matches consist of 3 games. If the score is tied at 20-20, the first side to gain a 2-point lead, is declared the winner of that game. If there is no winner by the 29th point, and the score is tied, the first side to reach 30 points, wins that game. If the server loses the point, the shuttlecock will be given to the receiver for the next serve. When playing doubles, if the team that is serving scores the point, the same player will serve again but to a different opponent on the opposing team. If the opponent in a doubles’ match wins the point, and the score is an odd number, the serve goes to the player in the left service court. If the new score is an even number, then the serve goes to the player in the right service court."

      "title": "Be familiar with the racket.",
      "content": "Be familiar with the racket. There are currently no standard rules regarding Badminton rackets for unofficial and professional players. Have your players look for a light-weight racket that is flexible and has the string strength preferred for their level. The amount of tension in the strings of the racket will affect what types of shots they can make. Strings with a higher tension are geared towards strengthening the control and direction of shots, while lower tension strings will put more power behind the shots. [2] X Research source Have your players try as many rackets as they can before they purchase one. Each racket will have a different feel to it, so finding the one that feels the best to each player will determine their success."

      "title": "Make sure your players practice the right grips.",
      "content": "Make sure your players practice the right grips. There are 2 grip positions used in badminton: the forehand and backhand. These grips are the foundation for any other stroke so knowing and mastering these grips are essential to succeeding at badminton. [3] X Research source Instruct your players to use their forehand to return shots that are directed toward their dominant side. Your players should use their backhand when the other player has returned a shot to their non-dominant side. If they do not have time to reposition themselves to return the birdie using their forehand, have them use their backhand stroke for the return."

      "title": "Have your players master the strokes for basic and professional play.",
      "content": "Have your players master the strokes for basic and professional play. Make sure, when your students are approaching hits, they follow 3 main steps. Always have them begin with the backswing to aim and get momentum. Have them use the forward swing to make contact with the shuttle and end with the follow-through, for added momentum and direction. [4] X Research source After they have perfected the basic swings, you will be able to have them move on to mastering other shots. These include the clear shot, for offensive hits, the drop shot, a slow, shallow hit, and the smash shot, a powerful overhead shot. They will also learn the drive shot which is a shot that travels parallel to the ground. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Instruct your players to perfect their serves.",
      "content": "Instruct your players to perfect their serves. A serve is what will begin every rally — making it a crucial stroke to master. Make sure to have them keep both feet on the ground when serving to keep the serve legal. Instruct your players to alternate between the 4 different types of serves and not to aim their serves directly at their opponent. [6] X Research source There are 4 main serves including the low serve, high serve, flick serve, and drive serve. The low serve is a shallow serve that uses a gentle tap to get the birdie over the net. The high serve is a powerful upwards serve that focuses on height and distance. The flick serve also uses an upward motion but will get less altitude. It is used to deceive their opponents because of the players’ use of their backhand. The drive serve will not be one you practice with your players as much. Professionals commonly use this serve to aim the shuttle directly at their opponent to catch them off guard."

      "title": "Tell your students to return to their beginning position after every shot.",
      "content": "Tell your students to return to their beginning position after every shot. The ready position is where they will begin and end each shot. Their rackets should be held parallel to the ground with their dominant hand holding the bottom of the handle. The top of the racket should line up between the middle of their neck and chin. Having your players return to their starting position is key to help them move around the court while staying prepared for any shot that comes from an opponent."

      "title": "Have your players utilize their overhead shot or lob.",
      "content": "Have your players utilize their overhead shot or lob. Overhead shots tend to lead their opponent back to the farthest edge of the court, depending on how powerful their swing is. These power shots are one of the most effective shots because it is harder for opponents to return. [7] X Research source The fall of an overhead shot is harder for your opponent to predict, which makes them very useful when scoring points."

      "title": "Do not have your students return shots to the same area on the court.",
      "content": "Do not have your students return shots to the same area on the court. Teaching your students variety with their shots will keep them from becoming predictable. Predictability will give their opponent a better chance of returning the shuttlecock to an area of the court they are not able to cover. [8] X Research source For better chances of scoring, have them always keep their opponent running."

This can be difficult to accomplish, but it will relieve a lot of stress when you start recruiting. Look for a facility in your area as most students will not want to travel more than 20-30 minutes for practice. [12] X Research source Most public facilities will charge you to use their space. Make sure you look into prices and availability of the facility before you book.

However, if you are on your own, it is important to establish your policies before you begin recruiting students. [15] X Research source For example, collect player fees at the beginning of your sessions or set a firm due date. Decide if you will accept cash, utilize online accounts such as Paypal, or require payments by check. [16] X Research source Be sure to take into account certain situations that may be out of your players’ control, such as injuries or unexpected circumstances.

As a badminton coach, it is important to understand these emotions so you can recognize them with your players. Sometimes they may be struggling or pushing themselves too hard and you will need to know how to handle these situations. [19] X Research source Some signs that your athlete may be in distress are anxiety, frustration, and unrealistic expectations. If you see these signs in an athlete, it is important that you encourage them to deal with these feelings in healthy ways. This can include having your player practice relaxation techniques, talk to someone they trust, or seek professional help.

Ask your students for feedback and make sure to take any feedback you receive seriously and change your lessons accordingly, when appropriate. [21] X Research source If you are receiving complaints from different players on the same issue, it would be an appropriate time to change your lesson. For example, you might not be spending enough time on a specific drill that your players feel is useful to them, or that they may be having trouble getting the hang of. Do not change your lesson if you are receiving complaints simply because your players do not want to participate. For example, running is an important exercise to integrate into coaching badminton. However, not everyone likes to run, and they may complain about running the required amount. Never belittle, embarrass, or insult your students when they ask for clarification or offer suggestions, as this may lead to lower feelings of self-worth. [22] X Research source"

Knowing this will allow you to cater to each one of your student’s specific needs. [23] X Research source Make sure to individualize conversations to understand your athletes, provide motivation, and coach in a way that will help each of your players feel comfortable. Some players may need more reassurance than others. For players that may be shy or introverted, you might need to provide feedback in a one-on-one setting, or somewhere they feel comfortable. It will take a while to learn each player’s specific needs, but it will pay off as you earn more respect and credibility with your players.

Make sure you are working with your students on muscular endurance and speed to increase their success with playing badminton. Add in conditioning workouts that will help your students learn how to move around the court quickly. These workouts can include basic endurance running and sprinting exercises. Start with shorter intervals of aerobic exercises such as 4 sets of 10-second sprints with 30 seconds of walking in between sprints. Allow your students to rest for 2 minutes after each set.

Make sure you are practicing drills with your students that will help them to not only concentrate on the location of the shuttlecock but also, to stay aware of where their opponent is on the court. Hand-eye coordination is one of the most important aspects of the game. Your students will be expected to stay aware of their surroundings, especially when playing doubles. To increase hand-eye coordination, break your students into pairs. Have your partners toss a small ball back and forth. To increase difficulty, adjust throwing speeds, alternate angles, and create throwing patterns. You can also have the partner catching the ball face away from the thrower and have the catcher turn around when the other partner tells them to as they toss the ball. [29] X Research source"

For this exercise, have your students align their feet with their hips and hold the kettlebell with both hands in front of them. As they bend their knees, have them rotate their torso and hands to one side of their body and then the other, while straightening their legs.

Having strong footwork and agility will allow your students to position themselves anywhere on the court to successfully return shots. Building endurance is key to having strong footwork on the court. These exercises, such as the multi-directional shuttle run, work better with a partner. For this exercise, you will want to make sure your students are facing the net at all times. Have their partner call out different directions, such as north and west. The other partner will then sprint for 5 steps in the direction called, hit the floor with one hand and then return to their original position by sprinting 5 steps back, and hitting the floor again with one hand. For this exercise to be successful, it is important that your students keep working towards moving faster rather than further. As your students agility increases, you can substitute the floor touch, for a harder step such as a tuck jump. Make sure you are providing at least 10 minutes for this drill during each training session."

Building strength in your players’ calves and ankles will help reduce the risk of injuries while helping them to make rapid changes in direction on the court. Try having your students position themselves so that the ball of one foot is supported on a bench or step. Ensure that the heel is hanging over the edge while the other foot rests against the back of the ankle. Using the foot that is elevated, have them lower their heel as much as they can, and then use the ball of their foot to lift the heel as high as they can. [30] X Research source Have them repeat this motion 20 times on each leg. When starting strength training, you may need to allow them to switch legs more frequently.
