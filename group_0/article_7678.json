Lemon and baking soda. You can also use a chrome-friendly cleaning spray. Commonplace household cleaners like Vim Bathroom cleaning spray are well-suited to cleaning chrome."

Paper towels also work in lieu of a cloth hand towel, although you'll probably have to go through quite a few in order to clean any large chrome surface."

For the vast majority of them, applying your soapy water to an old toothbrush and scrubbing the nooks will get the dirt off. Although the toothbrush can be old, make sure that the majority of the bristles are still intact. Scrubbing chrome with a worn-down toothbrush is inefficient and could risk scratching the chrome if you scrub hard enough."

Although the chrome may never be perfect after rust sets in, you can drastically improve the look of it once the rust is removed. Waxing and polishing the freshly de-rusted surface will help to further improve the chrome's appearance."
