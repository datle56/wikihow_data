White vinegar is an all-natural and cost-efficient option, and studies have shown that it’s effective at killing mold spores. [1] X Research source Simply fill a large bowl with equal parts white vinegar and water, and submerge your water bottle in the solution. If your bottle has any detachable parts (straws, lids, rubber components, etc), make sure to take them apart and place them in the vinegar solution as well. Alternatively, you can fill your water bottle with a solution of equal parts water and vinegar, shake it up, then leave it to soak. However, if you see mold growing on the rim or the outside of the bottle, it’s best to submerge the whole thing in a bowl of the vinegar solution to make sure you get rid of it all."

Pour out half of the water and add a pea-sized amount of dish soap. Put the lid back on the bottle and shake it up again. Or, for an extra deep clean, use a bottle brush to scrub the inside before sealing it and shaking it up. Pour the soapy water out of the bottle. If the bottle has a lid with a nozzle, leave it on and pour the water out through the nozzle so it gets cleaned too. Rinse the bottle and cap thoroughly until there is no more soapy residue.

[13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you’re immunocompromised, it’s more important to avoid mold, since you may be more likely to experience negative effects from it. [14] X Research source The bottom line? If you notice mold on your water bottle, stop drinking out of it and deep clean it as soon as possible. Chances are that a small amount of mold won’t affect you negatively, but it’s still best to avoid ingesting it."
