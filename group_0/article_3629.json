      "title": "Know your ISO, Aperture, and Shutter Speed.",
      "content": "Know your ISO, Aperture, and Shutter Speed. These determine the quality of your pictures, how much motion blur you want, and so much more! ISO: The higher your ISO is, the brighter your images. Unfortunately, that means more digital noise. The lower your ISO is, the darker your image but less digital noise. 100, 200, and 400 are about the range that you want for out of doors or bright sunshine. If you're in a darker place, use 800, 1600, 3200. Aperture: Again, the higher the aperture, the brighter the picture is. Also, it gives more blur to your background making the subject stand out. This is super good for close up pictures. Can you guess what low aperture is? Darker images, but the background is much clearer. You got it! Shutter Speed: The funny thing is, with shutter speed, the slower it is, the brighter the image! The faster it gets, it gets darker. But here's the catch: With slow, you get a lot of motion blur. With fast, there isn't as much."
