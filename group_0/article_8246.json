Also be sure to remove any other items you may keep in your oven, such as an oven thermometer or pizza stone. [1] X Research source If your oven racks are also coated in burnt food remnants, you can use these same cleaning solutions to scour them. Simply remove them, clean the oven racks, and replace them once you’re done cleaning the oven. You can easily clean oven racks by soaking them in warm water with dish detergent mixed into it. After the oven racks soak for a few hours, use a scouring pad to remove any stuck on grime. Then dry them with a clean dish towel. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Run a self-cleaning cycle if your oven has one.",
      "content": "Run a self-cleaning cycle if your oven has one. This process causes your oven to heat up to a high temperature and bake any food remnants or spills to a crisp. This may help you more easily remove the grime. Depending on your oven, a self-cleaning cycle can take between 1.5 and 3 hours. If the bottom of your oven is completely covered in burned-on food, you may need to skip this step. Excessive amounts of burned food layers can end up smoking a lot, setting off your smoke alarm and releasing chemicals. [3] X Research source Keep an eye on your oven while running the self-cleaning cycle. If you start to see smoke, it’s probably best to shut off the cycle and just clean everything by hand. Once the cycle is done and the oven has cooled, remove the light-colored, charred ash from the bottom of your oven by wiping it down with a damp cloth."

      "content": "Make a paste of baking soda and water for an easy solution. Combine ½ cup (260 g) of baking soda and 2–3 tablespoons (30–44 mL) of water in a small bowl. Wearing gloves, spread the paste onto the burnt areas. Let it sit overnight to loosen the grime. As you spread the paste around, try to rub it into the particularly bad burnt spots. The mixture should start to turn brown. [4] X Research source Add vinegar to the cleaning paste to make it more effective. As an alternative, spray the vinegar onto the paste just before you scrub it off. The vinegar will react with the baking soda to create more cleaning power."

      "content": "Bake lemons in your oven for a natural cleaning option. Cut 2 lemons in half and squeeze the juice into a small oven-safe bowl or baking dish. Add the peels and enough water to fill the bowl or dish ⅓ of the way. Put one of the racks in the center of the oven and place the bowl on the rack. Bake it for 30 minutes at 250 °F (121 °C). The vapors from the lemon juice will penetrate through the burned layers, making them easier to remove. [5] X Research source It’s normal for the oven to smoke during this process. Provide ventilation by turning on your oven fan and opening a nearby window. Let the oven cool down and remove the rack before trying to wipe away the spills."

      "content": "Use a store-bought cleaner if you don’t mind using harsh chemicals. These cleaners will probably work better than any other method, so if your oven is really dirty, you may want to try this option. However, these cleaners can be toxic, so you need to make sure they’re fully removed before you cook food in your oven again. Spray the cleaning agent on the burnt areas, and let it soak in for 20-30 minutes. Wear safety glasses and thick rubber gloves if you use heavy-duty cleaners to prevent the chemicals from splashing in your eyes or absorbing into your skin. Check the package directions to find out how to apply the cleaner and how long to let it soak."

      "content": "Avoid getting any type of cleaner on the heating elements. Whether you’re using a natural or chemical cleaning product, do your best to keep the cleaner away from the heating elements. When you turn the oven back on, the heating elements can create fumes when burning off the cleaner, which could alter the taste of your food. For electric ovens, lift up the thick metal wire that forms the bake element and apply the cleaner underneath. If your oven is gas, try not to spray or get cleaner on the gas valve or igniter. If you accidentally get some of the cleaner on the heating element, wipe it away with a cloth dipped in clean water."

Make sure you’re getting the cleaner out of every nook and cranny. If you used a commercial cleaning product, read the label and follow the instructions for removal. If you used baking soda paste, put a bit of white vinegar in a spray bottle and spray it on the paste before trying to wipe it away. The baking soda-vinegar mixture will foam up, making it easier to see.

Let your oven air dry or dry it with a clean towel. [10] X Research source If you used a heavy-duty cleaner, it may be a good idea to wash the bottom of your oven again with a bit of dish soap just to make sure that no toxic chemicals remain. If you notice any remaining bits of grime, spray vinegar onto them and continue wiping with your wet rag. The vinegar will help you remove the stubborn spots."
