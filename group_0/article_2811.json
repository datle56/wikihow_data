      "content": "Put important dates in a calendar . Get a calendar and hang it in a spot where you can look at it daily, such as in your kitchen, by your bed, or in your home office. You can also put a calendar on your computer desktop or use the calendar app on your smartphone. Put all essential dates in the calendar, such as due dates, appointments, and meetings. Keep it updated regularly to help you organize your time. [1] X Research source Make it habit to check the calendar daily, such as first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. Color code items in your calendar by priority. For example, you may highlight important dates in red and less important dates in yellow. If you are using a calendar app on your phone, you can set reminders a few days or a few hours in advance so you don’t forget an important date. You can also use other organizing apps on your phone like 24me, Quip, and Wanderlust. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a day planner",
      "content": "Use a day planner . A day planner is another great way to keep your time organized. It will break down the week by day, allowing you to put in appointments or meetings for each day. It is especially useful if you have a lot of commitments throughout the day. Write down all of your commitments by hour in the day planner. Check the planner at the start of your day so you know what you have scheduled and can stay organized. [3] X Research source For example, you may write down a meeting in the morning, a phone call with a client in the afternoon, and a deadline in the evening."

      "title": "Keep a to-do list.",
      "content": "Keep a to-do list. To stay organized, make a to-do list. You may have one list for short term things you have to do and one list for long term things you have to do. Write the to-do list on a whiteboard and keep it somewhere you can see it, such as in your kitchen or your bedroom. Cross out items as you complete them so you feel productive and motivated to tackle more items on the list. [4] X Research source If you’d prefer to keep the to-do list on your computer, make a spreadsheet and use it as a to-do list. Keep the spreadsheet on your desktop so you can look at it and cross off items as you complete them. For example, you may have a list of short term to-do items like complete assignment for tomorrow, clean room, and order supplies for the week. You can then keep a list of long term to-do items like apply for college in 1 month, learn Arabic, and plan a trip."

      "title": "Reward yourself for staying organized.",
      "content": "Reward yourself for staying organized. To help motivate you to stay organized , use a rewards system. You may treat yourself to a baked good or lunch at your favorite restaurant when you check an item off your to-do list. Or you may give yourself a 5 minute break and go for a walk if you complete the items in your calendar or day planner early. [5] X Research source You can also reward yourself with fun or relaxing activities, such as playing your favorite video game or watching your favorite show. Only give yourself these rewards when you have completed the necessary tasks for the day."

      "title": "Make a daily schedule.",
      "content": "Make a daily schedule. To stay organized while you work, create a daily schedule of tasks. List each task by importance and check them off as you complete them. Put the most important tasks first, followed by the least important. Doing this can help you feel organized on a daily basis, whether you are at work or at school. For example, you may list tasks like completing an assignment or preparing lunch for your children first. Then, you may schedule in time to read emails or catch up on the news, followed by other tasks in the afternoon and evening. Reader Poll: We asked 1393 wikiHow readers what they found most helpful for establishing a morning routine, and 55% of them said Setting an alarm. [Take Poll] So, start the day right by getting at the same time every day."

      "title": "Schedule breaks throughout your work day.",
      "content": "Schedule breaks throughout your work day. Though it is important that you get all of the necessary tasks done, you should also set aside time for short breaks. You may schedule in 5 minute breaks after every few tasks so you can stretch your legs, go for a short walk, or do a few light exercises. You may also use the breaks to get coffee or a snack. [6] X Research source Having breaks will ensure you do not get too worn out or overworked, especially if you have a lot of tasks to complete for the day. If you are really busy, try to schedule at least one break in the day so you are not working too many hours straight."

      "title": "Multitask",
      "content": "Multitask . Another way you can work in a more organized way is to multitask, where you switch between several tasks at once. Multitasking can allow you to get multiple things done within a short period of time. It can also help you be more organized, as you will feel less overwhelmed or stressed about the things you need to get done if you complete them all at once. [7] X Research source For example, you may put the kettle on for your tea and fold towels, send emails, and load the washing machine while the water boils. Or you may set a download on your computer at work and do paperwork or other tasks in the office while you wait for the download to finish. Just keep in mind that some studies have shown that multitasking may diminish one's ability to focus on one thing at a time."

      "title": "Delegate tasks to others, when needed.",
      "content": "Delegate tasks to others, when needed. If you have a lot to get done, try to delegate tasks to others when you can. You may delegate tasks to workers in your office or to other family members in your home. Delegating tasks can make your day run more efficiently and allow you to stay organized. For example, you may delegate chores in your home to your children or your family members so you are not the only one cleaning and maintaining the house. Or you may delegate tasks to coworkers who have free time or an hour to spare so you can ensure all your tasks get done for the day."

      "title": "Organize your bedroom.",
      "content": "Organize your bedroom . To keep your space organized, start by focusing on your bedroom. Go through each item in your bedroom and determine if you can get rid of any items you no longer use or need. Reduce clutter in your bedroom and clean it out so you feel more organized, and keep only items you use in your bedroom. [8] X Research source For example, you may have a bookshelf in your bedroom that is stuffed full of books. Go through your books and put ones you no longer read or need in a box. Try to get rid of any books you honestly do not think you will read again. You can then donate the books in the box to charity so they are out of your room."

      "title": "Keep your home office and your desk organized.",
      "content": "Keep your home office and your desk organized. If you have a work space in your home, tackle this area and keep it organized. Go through all papers and bills on your desk. Put these items in folders or in a filing cabinet. Get rid of any papers you do not need to keep as hard copies. Put office supplies in drawers or cabinets. Place pens and pencils in a pen holder. [9] X Research source You should also position items that you use often closer to your workspace so they are within reach. For example, if you often use a stapler in your office, keep it in the top drawer of your desk so it’s within reach and you know where it is at all times. Organize electrical cords in your office by using zip ties to keep cords wrapped. This will prevent them from getting tangled and messy."

      "title": "Organize your kitchen.",
      "content": "Organize your kitchen . Your kitchen will likely be one of the most used areas in your home. Keep it organized by going through each item and donating any items you no longer use. Throw away broken kitchen tools or old utensils. Clear out these items and then assess how to organize the items you are keeping. [10] X Research source Place related items together in drawers or cupboards. For example, store all coffee mugs together or all utensils together. Keep your kitchen counters free of items when possible and only leave out items you use often, such as a large cutting board or a kettle. Some items need layout or ordering rather than just grouping. Frequently used unique items, like spices, should be kept handy and accessible, such as on a spice rack on the counter. Perishable items, like food, should be consumed on a first-in, first-out basis. Load stacks of perishable items, such as canned food, starting with the oldest first in a cupboard or a pantry."

      "content": "Keep your closet organized. Another spot that tends to get messy is your closet, especially if you have a lot of clothing. Organize your closet by going through your clothing and getting rid of any items you no longer wear. Often, if you haven’t worn the item in one year, you can get rid of it. Group items of clothing together, such as all jeans on one shelf or all jackets hung in the same spot in your closet. [11] X Research source Rotate items that are within reach in your closet so you wear different items and get the most out of each item. Keep all shoes together, preferably on a shoe rack or in labeled bins. This way you can view each pair and know exactly what you have in your closet. If you’re having trouble keeping your closet tidy, get a closet organizer to help you keep your items sorted."

      "title": "Clean your space regularly.",
      "content": "Clean your space regularly. To maintain your organization, do regular cleanings of your bedroom, your home office, your desk, your kitchen, and your closet. Designate one day a week as cleaning day and do a good clean of these spots. This will ensure that you reduce any clutter that accumulates in each area of your home. It will also make it easier for you to maintain the system you have in place in each area to keep them organized. You can also clean each space periodically throughout the week to maintain them. Do a light dusting of your home once a day. Throw out any papers or bills you don’t need right away, rather than let them clutter up your space. It is good to clean your place every week. If your place becomes untidy very quickly, then you can clean more frequently."
