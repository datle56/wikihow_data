      "content": "Have a pi feast. No Pi Day activities are complete without pi foods! Eating these may be the easiest and the most fun way to celebrate pi. If you're in school, everyone can bring in a pi-themed food for a pi pot luck, and if you're just celebrating with friends, you can all enjoy a pi-themed meal together."

      "title": "Eat pie.",
      "content": "Eat pie. While \"pie\" and \"pi\" are spelled differently, they sound the same so eating pie on Pi Day is a popular option. Furthermore, since traditional pies are round, their circular shape acknowledges the mathematical importance of pi. Eat any type of pie. Try key lime pie, pumpkin pie, pecan pie, or apple pie. You can even make a special Pi Day pie in honor of the day. For something a little different, consider purchasing and using a pie pan shaped in the mathematical symbol for pi. Such pans can be purchased online. Pi foods don't have to be limited to desserts. Eat shepherd's pie or chicken pot pie."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose circular foods.",
      "content": "Choose circular foods. Any food that has a circular shape can be fit for your feast due to the mathematical significance of pi. You might try making cookies, cakes, cupcakes, or pancakes. Consider using icing to put the pi symbol on a variety of cookies, pies, and cupcakes. You can even make the foods in advance and write pi on them in icing in a big group. Similarly, you can use pi-shaped cookie cutters, pans, and free-form techniques to shape these foods in the symbol for pi."

      "title": "Make a pun.",
      "content": "Make a pun. Serve foods that start with the letters \"pi.\" For instance, you could eat pi neapple, pi zza, or pi ne nuts, or drink pi ña coladas and pi neapple juice. You might even consider combining this idea with some of the others. Write the symbol for pi using toppings on your pizza or make a pineapple pie."

    {
      "title": "Wear pi-themed clothing.",
      "content": "Wear pi-themed clothing. Math geeks and clothing manufacturers have a better relationship than you might expect. Consider purchasing a t-shirt with the mathematical symbol for pi on the front and wearing it on the special day. You can easily find these shirts online. If you don't want to buy a shirt, consider creating your own pi shirt using fabric paint and a pi-shaped stencil instead. You can also wear pi accessories. This idea can be taken further to include pi symbol pendants and other jewelry, or you can take a representative approach by wearing something like a necklace with beads representing the numbers of pi, You could even consider wearing a pi symbol temporary tattoo."

      "title": "Carry pi with you where you go.",
      "content": "Carry pi with you where you go. Shop around online for some fun pi paraphernalia, like pi mugs and pi watches. Another option would be to put pi symbol stickers on your belongings. If you want to spread the celebration, try giving away pencils with pi symbols on them. Make your computer or phone background into something related to pi. The symbol might work, or you can have a background filled with bubbles or other circular shapes."

      "title": "Play pi games.",
      "content": "Play pi games. Pi games will not only be fun, but they will improve your understanding of pi and will make everyone around you have a deeper appreciation of pi. There are plenty of traditional games that are appropriate on Pi Day, like a pi ñata, a pie-eating contest, or a pie-in-the-face fundraiser. Answer math questions. Come to Pi Day with at least ten math questions you can spring on people. They should be related to geometry, trigonometry, or other fields where pi is particularly useful. Conduct a Pi Day Scavenger Hunt. Hide pi-themed objects around your classroom, home, or other celebration venue. You can also hide objects representing the digits of pi: three baseballs, one frisbee, four basketballs, etc. Pi Day also happens to be the birthday of Albert Einstein. Play an Einstein-themed trivia game, or have an Einstein impersonator contest. [3] X Research source Have a pi memorization or recitation contest. As soon as someone loses, you can hit him in the face with a pie. If you want to really show your dedication on Pi Day, learn to memorize pi in advance by studying as many of the digits of pi as you can."

      "title": "Use your artistic side to celebrate pi.",
      "content": "Use your artistic side to celebrate pi. You don't have to be a left-brained thinker to fully celebrate pi. You can use your creative side to show how much you love and appreciate pi. And even if you're not the world's most talented poet or writer, you can still have fun while being silly. You don't have to create art to celebrate pi; you can also just appreciate art that already celebrates it. Here are a few ways to celebrate pi artistically: Write poetry. Write either a pi-ku (haiku) or a regular pi-em (poem) to show how much you love pi. Write a pi-themed song and sing it, or write a short pi-themed skit and act it out. Paint a picture of pi. Watch movies related to pi. Try the film π --it's an interesting and dark movie about a mathematician who goes crazy, but intended for an adult audience only. You could also watch the film Life of Pi . [4] X Research source Technically \"Pi\" is only the protagonist's name, but it has gotten people thinking about pi. Listen to Kate Bush. Progressive rock musician Kate Bush performed a song titled π on her 2005 album Aerial. Bush sings pi to its 137th decimal place, but omits the 79th through 100th decimal places of pi for unknown reasons."

      "content": "Get physical with pi. You can also use your physical prowess, or even your car, to show your love for pi. Here are a few things you can do to celebrate pi: Do a pi mile run. Run 3.14 miles (5.05 km), which is just a tiny bit longer than a 5K. You can take this a step further by organizing a pi mile run with friends or colleagues. Lay down in pi formation and take a picture. If you're bold, have two people standing up while holding up a third person who is lying sideways in between them. Make sure the lightest person is on top. Drive exactly 3.14 miles (5.05 km). March in a circle to show your love for pi."

      "title": "Celebrate at 1:59 PM on Pi Day.",
      "content": "Celebrate at 1 :59 PM on Pi Day . This time represents the next three digits of pi: 3.14 159 . Take a minute to acknowledge pi in whatever way you see fit at that moment During this minute, you can cheer wildly, or even have a countdown leading up to \"pi minute\" the minute before. For added effect for a countdown, have a \"pi drop\" where you drop a big pie off a balcony or another elevated structure. You can even add a lot of sprinkles to the pie to make it look like a disco ball. If you've written a pi song or made a pi dance, this would be the perfect minute to share your art. Note that there is some debate regarding the exact time that Pi Day should be celebrated. Though 1:59PM is probably the most common, some believe that the 24-hour clock should be used instead, which would mean that Pi Day should be celebrated at 1:59AM or 15:09PM."

      "title": "Convert things into pi.",
      "content": "Convert things into pi. This step is absolutely necessary for two reasons: first, to utterly confuse people who have no idea what you're talking about, and secondly, to have fun seeing how many things can be referenced with pi. This will help you reach an even higher appreciation for the amazing number that is pi. Consider two approaches: Use pi to tell the time. Convert naturally circular things into radians, like the hours on the clock. Instead of it being 3 o'clock, now it's 1/2 pi o'clock. Or, instead of it being 3 o'clock, convert the inclination of the sun into radians and describe that as the time. Simply use 3.14 as a unit of measure. Instead of being 31 years old, you are 9pi years old. With this same approach, you can find out your next pi birthday -- just don't forget to celebrate it when it comes!"

      "title": "Help the tradition continue.",
      "content": "Help the tradition continue. Don't let this be a one-time thing — you owe it to pi to celebrate again and again. Set the date for next year and consider creating a pi club or website in the process. Talk about your plans for Pi Day the following year. This will help generate enthusiasm. Take notes after your Pi Day celebration. What can you do next year to make your celebration even more incredible? Next year, talk about the day months in advance so your skeptical friends can be convinced to join in. You can even advertise for the event by emailing your closest friends or even setting up a Pi Day Facebook page."
