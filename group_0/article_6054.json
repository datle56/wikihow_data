During hibernation, the immune system slows down considerably, and a turtle that was even mildly ill going into hibernation is likely to die during or shortly after the process. Examine your turtle carefully for signs of illness. Even if you see nothing, still have the turtle examined by a veterinarian. [3] X Research source Signs of illness include: Swollen eyes. Discharge from the nostrils Swollen ears Low body weight Difficulty breathing, exhibited by opening the mouth frequently Aquatic turtles remaining out the water at night Abscesses or other signs of parasite infestation Wounds or shell rot Strong smell,inflammation, or leaking liquid from underneath the tail Inside the mouth, any of these: the appearance of small blood-spots; deep red-purple tinge; a yellow cheesy substance"

      "content": "Learn how your pet should hibernate. Most experts recommend that you keep your indoor turtles and tortoises indoors and active during the winter, and that you bring outdoor turtles and tortoises inside for the winter if their natural habitat will not be safe. [4] X Research source Aquatic turtles can hibernate outdoors as long as it is safe and the water doesn’t freeze. Terrestrial and semi-aquatic turtles and tortoises can hibernate indoors and outdoors. If the animal lives outdoors, it will respond to changes in the temperature and length of sunlight, and instinctively know when and how to get ready to hibernate. If your animal lives indoors, you will need to simulate these changes. Check your local pet club information listings or ask your vet if you are unsure how to care for your pet. Most box turtles and tortoises hibernate between October or November until the late February through early April in the United States. Most turtles and tortoises hibernate for 2-4 months. Some species in some regions can hibernate up to 6 months, though that length of time is not required. Ask your veterinarian for specific recommendations for your turtle."

Weigh your turtle or tortoise now to get a baseline weight, and keep weighing your pet every 2-3 weeks. [5] X Research source Use the same scale you will use leading up to and during hibernation. Use a digital scale for animals under 6 lbs (2.5kg) to ensure accuracy."

Before you fast your turtle or tortoise, you should feed your pet higher levels of vitamin A since hibernation depletes stores of vitamin A. At the beginning of summer (12-16 weeks before hibernation), begin adding vitamin A-rich foods to the turtle's diet. You can simply swap out some of these foods for other things your turtle normally eats. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source Some good sources of vitamin A include: For tortoises: carrots and squash For turtles (non-meat): Leafy green vegetables like kale, broccoli, mustard and collard greens, and dandelions; orange vegetables, like alfalfa, squash, carrots, sweet potatoes; orange fruit, like cantaloupe and peaches For turtles (meat): fish and baby mice If your pet already gets a lot of vitamin A, just keep feeding it as normal."

Do not try to hibernate a turtle or tortoise who has eaten within the last month; instead, delay hibernation. Ask your vet for a specific fasting time for your species. Undigested food kills hibernating pets in 2 ways. Either the food decays and causes fatal bacterial infections inside your pet; or the food decays and creates large clouds of gas, which press internally on your pet’s lungs to suffocate it. When in doubt, contact your vet. [10] X Research source Your pet’s digestive system is controlled to a large extent by temperature. Tortoises can need 3-6 weeks. [11] X Research source Small tortoises (<1kg) need 3 weeks; medium sized (1-1.5 kg) need 3-4 weeks; large tortoises (2-3kg) need 4-6 weeks. Turtles need roughly 2-3 weeks. A small turtle like a Box turtle might need only 10-14 days. [12] X Research source"

Ensure that all food is out of your pet’s body before you go onto the next step. Do not go below 50°F (10°C). Turtles: start 1 week before hibernation. 65°F (18°C) for 2-3 days, gradually reduced to 60°F (15°C) over 2-3 days, then gradually reduced to 50°F (10°C) or a little below.

Gradually reduce temperature to 60°F (15°C) over 1 week, then keep temperature 55-60°F (13-15°C) for 3 weeks so your tortoise can fully digest its last meal. 50°F (10°C) is the maximum (warmest) temperature for hibernation to occur.

Make sure your turtle or tortoise is completely safe from predators such as rats, which like chewing on hibernating tortoises. If you have an aquatic turtle that is staying in water outdoors, make sure the water does not freeze and has a depth of at least 18 inches. If your pet is staying indoors, scope out a cool location in your house for your turtle or tortoise. Many people use refrigerators. Others use garages, basements, or any room at room temperature. Pick a location that stays above 50°F (10°C) as its default. If your power goes out, your pet escapes, or another accident occurs, you want your turtle or tortoise to live despite the temperature change."

A fridge is air-sealed, so you must provide air to your turtle or tortoise. Open the fridge door at least 3 times a week, for 1-2 minutes. [15] X Research source Test the fridge temperature. Place a thermometer in the fridge and monitor its fluctuations and accuracy. If there is a lot of temperature fluctuation, fill your fridge with other masses, like water bottles, that will hold the temperature steadier than just air will. [16] X Research source Pick a fridge that you will not be using often throughout the day. Opening and closing the door often can deregulate the temperature, as well as flicker the fridge lights on and off."

Cover the bottom of your smallest box with some substrate. Some examples of substrate include: coir (crushed coconut husk) straw shredded newspaper peat moss commercial substrates for reptiles, such as Carefresh or Bed-A-Beast Do not use substrate with fertilizers, plant food, or any chemical additives Check the appropriate moistness of your substrate for your species of pet. For example, box turtles need very moist substrate that is almost wet. Turtles and tortoises use up very little oxygen when hibernating, but still require a small amount of oxygen. Make ventilation holes that are small (less than an inch or centimeter in diameter)."

Make sure that your turtle or tortoise has no illnesses or injuries, no food in their digestive system, constant access to water, and is at a temperature hovering around or above 50°F (10°C). If any one of these things is not true, do not force your pet into hibernation. Otherwise, place your pet in the hibernaculum. Place your hibernaculum in a cool location where it will stay throughout hibernation, except for when you are inspecting it. If your pet is hibernating outdoors in nature and not in a hibernaculum, make sure your pet will neither drown or freeze in its hibernation spot. Your pet should still have constant access to drinking water. If your pet is hibernating outdoors, it will naturally bury itself in or around a pond. The pond should have a good bed of dirt or muck to dig into, and be at least 18 inches (45.7 cm) deep to provide some temperature insulation. If needed, keep the pond from freezing by using a floating pond heater through the winter. [19] X Research source If your outdoor turtle will not hibernate, even though the weather has cooled, or you see it swimming or basking a lot after other turtles have disappeared, bring it inside. Some turtles just don't know how to hibernate and will not survive the winter outside."

If your 1) tortoise or turtle has urinated or defecated while hibernating, 2) your pet's skin is dry, or 3) hibernaculum is just much wetter than usual, soak your pet for 2 hours in room-temperature water. The water level should happen just below your pet’s bridge. Dry your pet thoroughly, and return your pet to the hibernaculum placed in a slightly cooler location: you had been keeping your pet in a location that was too warm and dehydrated your pet. [20] X Research source [21] X Research source Signs of infection include discharge, breathing difficulties, and changes in the skin or shell. If you notice anything concerning, call your vet.
