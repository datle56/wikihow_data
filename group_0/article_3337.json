      "title": "Understand the main point.",
      "content": "Understand the main point. You have to keep Springtrap, an old springlock animatronic suit, out of your office. and also avoid hallucinations that cause errors in your system, which can affect your chances of survival."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get used to the layout of the camera system.",
      "content": "Get used to the layout of the camera system. When you open the camera, you will see cameras titled somewhat like “CAM60”. Click on the camera to see its content. Use it to find Springtrap. Once he is located, switch to a nearby room and play the audio. This will lure him away. Be sure to check the vents as well, and seal the vents when you find him in a vent camera. Just double click on the camera number and it is sealed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the Maintenance panel when needed.",
      "content": "Use the Maintenance panel when needed. If there is an error of a specific system, then reboot it by clicking on it. Rebooting for no reason can waste time that springtrap can use to get to you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch out for errors.",
      "content": "Watch out for errors. These are defects in your system, and they will be displayed on your camera system. An audio error makes you unable to play the audio in the cameras, while a video error makes it so you can't see anything in the cameras, and a ventilation error makes the lights turn on and off and make noise, which can bring Springtrap to you in the blink of an eye. He can also move when the lights turn off, because you aren't watching him directly. Also, phantoms can cause errors. For example: phantom mangle=audio error, and all the others just cause ventilation errors."
    },
    {
      "title": "Expect Phantoms.",
      "content": "Expect Phantoms. These are hallucinations that cause errors when you don't know how to stop them from jump-scaring you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find Springtrap.",
      "content": "Find Springtrap. The first thing to do when a night starts is to find Springtrap, who is usually in cam 10. Keep your camera on him. He may make the screen fuzzy, therefore allowing him to move. If he does this, find him. Only close the camera if there is an error."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the audio.",
      "content": "Use the audio. Lure springtrap to a nearby camera using the audio button located on the bottom left of the camera layout, right above the vent camera toggle. Keep in mind you can't use it in the vents, instead, double click to seal a vent you see him at."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't look left unless necessary.",
      "content": "Don't look left unless necessary. There is no reason to look left unless there is an error, or you see the animation of Springtrap run by the window. If it is near the end of the night, you can stare at him if he is in the proximity of your room (AKA not in a camera but outside your office) hoping there is no ventilation error, and stare at him until it’s 6AM. It’s best to do this when you’re already at the end of the night."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check those vents!",
      "content": "Check those vents! If you hear a sound of something crawling in a vent (similar to the one in FNAF 2), click \"Toggle Map\" and check all of the vent cameras. Double click to seal a vent if he is in one, forcing him to take another way. There is really no point in sealing a vent that he’s not in, because it doesn't really help at all."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid the phantoms in the cameras.",
      "content": "Avoid the phantoms in the cameras. Close the camera on a phantom if you see them, toggle map, or change camera number, failing to do so will result in a jump scare, triggering a ventilation/audio error. Also, if you stay on the camera for too long, you can trigger a camera error. You can avoid them though, and that is done by not using the cameras for too long."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ignore Phantom Freddy.",
      "content": "Ignore Phantom Freddy. If you see PF walking outside your office window, just open your camera or maintenance panel. He can only jump scare you if you stare at him for too long, and wait for him to reach the end of the hall. After that, you’re free to pull down your maintenance panel/camera."
    },
    {
      "title": "Play the audio!",
      "content": "Play the audio! This is how you keep Springtrap from killing you. If you see him in a camera, play the audio in a corresponding camera that he went to before he entered the camera he is in now. So if he moved to camera 1, play the audio in camera 2, forcing him to go back. This only works on cameras next to the one he’s already in. If you see Springtrap outside your office window, there is a chance you can make him leave by playing audio in Camera 02. If he is behind the left door, once you move away he might kill you. However, if he doesn't, you can try to play audio in Camera 01. This is the last chance you have to not be killed."
