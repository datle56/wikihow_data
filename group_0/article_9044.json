Many doctors and scientists doubt that diet can exert any strong influence on a child's sex and consider the sex of a baby to be based on random chance.

Dietary changes can supposedly affect your likelihood of conceiving a girl by altering the mineral content and acidity of the uterine environment. According to this theory, a woman's diet in the weeks leading to conception can make her body more \"friendly\" toward X chromosome sperm (which lead to a baby girl) and less \"friendly\" toward Y chromosome sperm (which lead to a baby boy).

If you have a regular menstrual cycle, you can also predict the date range of ovulation by counting back 12-16 days from the date your last period started, though the prediction might not be entirely accurate. [6] X Research source Keeping track of ovulation can also increase your likelihood of conceiving at all (regardless of sex) because women are usually the most fertile in the few days prior to ovulation. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Other signs of ovulation include abdominal pain, changes in vaginal fluids, and changes in basal body temperature. Consider tracking your cycle carefully on a calendar in order to understand how your body responds to ovulation.

Having sex at least two days before ovulation gives the slower female sperm more time to move up the uterine canal before the egg arrives. [9] X Research source This is known as the \"Shettles Method.\" There is an alternate theory known as the \"Whelan Method\" that suggests that sex should take place 2-3 days prior to ovulation to conceive a girl and 4-6 days before ovulation to conceive a boy.

It is possible to sort sperm into Y-chromosomal and X-chromosomal sperm using a technique known as cytometric sorting, after which an egg is fertilized with the desired sperm using artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization. Because X chromosomes are slightly larger than Y chromosomes, sperm that lead to girls are able to absorb more fluorescent dye than sperm that lead to boys. The sperm can then be separated, and the desired sex of a baby can be chosen. [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Sperm sorting is highly effective, though it is not 100% effective. [14] X Research source It can, however, be costly and might not be available for all prospective parents."

      "content": "Pursue preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). This procedure can be done on embryos created using in vitro fertilization. It allows doctors to identify embryos of a certain sex, thus providing sex selection prior to embryonic implantation. In addition to identifying (and potentially selecting) embryos of a certain sex, chromosomal disorders and conditions can be identified using PGD. [16] X Research source Though highly effective, the procedure is costly and invasive, and it raises ethical dilemmas about the appropriateness of sex selection of embryos. In fact, sex screening is banned in some places. Certain countries, like Britain, make exceptions only when there is a medical necessity to screen for sex, such as sex-specific genetic diseases. [17] X Research source Other doctors similarly support post-fertilization sex selection in cases of medical necessity, but reject post-fertilization sex selection practices because of personal preference. The procedure works by identifying the sex of an embryo while it is still in the lab before it is placed in the womb, and claims 100% accuracy."
