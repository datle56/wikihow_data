      "content": "Show kindness and courtesy. Being respectful starts with a basic consideration of other people's feelings. Ask yourself how you'd want to be treated in a given situation, and make an effort to treat other people that way. Treat everyone you encounter—strangers on the street, coworkers, classmates and family members—with respect and courtesy.

      "content": "Be polite . The concept of etiquette and good manners seems pointless when you're a kid, but when you grow up you realize that these customs function as a way to keep society running smoothly. Practicing good manners is a way to be respectful of other people's space and time. If no one bothered being polite, everyday situations like eating in a restaurant, waiting in line at the post office or dealing with bad traffic would be completely intolerable. Here are a few ways to be polite: [2] X Research source Wait your turn. Don't cut in line, or cut people off in traffic, unless it's an emergency (e.g. rushing to the hospital). Avoid disruptive talking in public. Be quiet once the lights go down in a movie theater. Don't talk on your cell phone in indoor places like a coffee shop, store, or restaurant. (Take the call outside instead.) Clean up after yourself. If you make a mess, clean it. Throw away or recycle your trash, including small things like cigarette butts or food wrappers. Speak politely. Say please and thank you. Avoid name-calling or aggressive speech. Don't swear in polite company. [3] X Research source Follow rules that keep things safe and pleasant. Don't eat or drink if it's not allowed somewhere. Obey signs like \"don't feed the birds\" or \"only use a public computer for half an hour\" so that the environment is pleasant for everyone."

      "content": "Refuse to discriminate. Be respectful to everyone—not just people you know or those you perceive as having a higher status than you. Some people save their respect for people upon whom they want to make a good impression, and they're rude to everyone else. But there is truth in the saying, \"You can judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them or to them.\" [4] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Be kind to everyone, regardless of who they are, what they look like, or what their relationship is to you. Be kind to people regardless of their social status. Examine and let go of any negative attitudes you have towards women and girls, people of color, people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ people, people of different religions, poor people, overweight people, and other who might be viewed negatively by society. Being different does not make someone inferior. Take a \"live and let live\" approach. Be kind to people you encounter throughout the day who aren't always treated with respect. For example, homeless people are often overlooked or treated rudely, but they deserve the same respect and courtesy as anyone else."

The differences among us are what make life interesting, and besides, you probably have more in common with people than you know. Even when you really don't see where someone else is coming from, be courteous and civil.

Your home (if you live with other people), your school, your street, your bus line - these familiar spaces are familiar to other people, too. You wouldn't appreciate it if other people trashed the places where you spend time every day, so be sure to clean up after yourself and do your part to keep them nice for others. [5] X Research source Clean your own messes. Pick up your trash and throw it away. Don't leave wrappers or cigarette butts for other people to clean.

We're all living here together, and each one of us is deserving of respect. Treat every living creature as an individual worthy of courtesy. Do your part to avoid polluting the environment. Understand how your actions affect the rest of the world. For example, using pesticides on your lawn could contaminate the groundwater and have a negative impact on your environment.

      "content": "Respect personal space. Personal space varies in different situations. Strangers (e.g. people on the subway) should be given a space bubble, and it's best not to strike up conversations unless they're showing signs that they're open to talking. Friends and family members usually are more open to touching, but it's still important to make sure they're okay with it. [7] X Research source When offering hugs and kisses, let the person see it coming so they can decline it if they don't want it for any reason. Don't make a big fuss if they say no. Ask before prolonged contact, such as playing with someone's hair or rubbing their back. Treat disability equipment (canes, wheelchairs) and service animals like extensions of a person's body. Don't touch without permission."

Other people should get to set their own boundaries and choose what to share or not to share about their plans, thoughts, and feelings. Respecting privacy is important for healthy and trusting relationships. Knock and pause before entering a bedroom. Someone inside should have time to call out something like \"Don't come in!\" or \"Just a minute!\" before you enter. Don't eavesdrop. Don't push people to share personal information (from weekend plans to intimate dating details) if they don't volunteer it. If someone seems uncomfortable with a question you asked, try saying \"You don't have to tell me if you don't want to\" to take off the pressure."

[11] X Expert Source Kirsten Parker, MFA Mindset & Action Coach Expert Interview. 22 July 2020. If you look bored or interrupt the person, you're showing that you don't really care what he or she has to say. Practice listening more intently and waiting until the person is finished talking before you respond. Making eye contact is a good way to show that you respect what someone is saying. Other body language cues can help as well. Face the person to whom you're talking and try not to fidget while they speak. [12] X Research source (If you're disabled and can't do this comfortably, just look at their face and fidget quietly.) Process what the person is saying instead of just absently nodding your head."

Take into account what the person was saying and voice your opinion without undermining theirs. Avoid insulting the other person by saying something rude or callous. It's okay to pause while you think about what to say. Try not to be condescending. Don't over explain a concept the other person clearly already understands. For example, don't tell a varsity athlete how to hit a baseball. Don't be patronizing. Along similar lines, talking down to someone can make them feel disrespected. Avoid phrases like \"Don't worry your little head about it,\" or \"It's a guy thing, you wouldn't understand.\" Don't ask intrusive questions. For example, don't ask acquaintances about scars, disabilities, or details of their love lives."

The key is to disagree with what the person is saying without undermining the actual person's worthiness. For example, you might strongly disagree with someone's political beliefs, but you can still value the person as a human being, and that should come through in the way you argue. [13] X Research source Never resort to insulting someone during an argument. Don't let \"I don't agree with your view on that\" escalate to \"You're an idiot.\" If necessary, halt the conversation before things get too out of control and you say something you'll regret.

      "content": "Skip the gossip. It's a common form of disrespect that people usually get away with, but gossiping is a bad habit. It puts you in the practice of seeing people as characters who are up for discussion instead of individuals with feelings that can be deeply hurt. Even the strangest, most annoying or obnoxious people should not be regularly discussed as though they exist to provide entertainment for others. If you have nothing good to say, it's better not to say it at all. Politely object to gossiping if someone else starts it. Try saying something like \"I'm not interested in gossip\" or \"I don't want to say anything about him that I wouldn't be willing to say to his face.\""

Your hurtful mistake is less important than how you react to it. If you realize you did something unkind or upsetting, talk to the person about it to apologize. Avoid saying \"but\" to justify your actions. If you wish to explain why you behaved the way you did, try \"and\" instead. For example, \"I'm sorry I winced when you said you were autistic, and I was acting on a misconception of what autism is. I'm sorry I upset you, and I accept you for who you are.\" This explains the action without excusing it."

The school principal, the boss, the church leader, the mayor, the King of England—these are people who have risen to leadership positions because they have exhibited qualities society deems worthy of respect. Show authority figures respect according to the proper custom, whether it means calling the principal \"Sir\" or bowing to the king. Elders are also deserving of extra respect.

[14] X Expert Source Kirsten Parker, MFA Mindset & Action Coach Expert Interview. 22 July 2020. An \"others first\" approach is kind, but is only realistic to a certain extent.

      "content": "Practice empathy and compassion . To really understand how to respect other people, put yourself in their shoes and attempt to truly understand where they're coming from. You can be courteous to people without really caring much about them, but true respect stems from a sense of empathy, a deep sense of shared understanding. Try to recognize the bonds that tie us all together and the fact that we're all sharing the same earth. Respecting each other is a way of getting along and making the world livable and more delightful for everyone."
