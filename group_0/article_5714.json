      "content": "No, don't expose or store contact lenses in water. Tap water, pool water, and lake or ocean water contain microorganisms that can potentially lead to serious eye infection. One of the most common is Acanthamoeba, which can infect your cornea (the clear outer layer of your eye where your contacts sit). [1] X Trustworthy Source American Optometric Association Professional medical organization dedicated to supporting optometrists and improving public eye and vision health Go to source Water can make your contacts swell or warp, causing them to stick to your eyes and scratch your cornea.

[3] X Trustworthy Source American Optometric Association Professional medical organization dedicated to supporting optometrists and improving public eye and vision health Go to source If storing them isn’t an option, swim with goggles on and soak your monthly or biweekly lenses in contact solution for 24 hours to disinfect them (throw away daily lenses). [4] X Research source Alternate between 2 pairs of lenses or between lenses and glasses so you can see while the water-exposed pair disinfects. If you don’t have goggles, do your best to avoid getting splashed in the face and eyes while you’re in the pool or tub.

      "content": "Use prescription goggles or consider LASIK eye surgery. If you're a frequent swimmer, the best alternative to wearing lenses is prescription goggles . Shop from performance brands rather than leisure brands—it’s easier to find a pair with a good fit against your face. If you can't find a pair with your exact prescription, choose the closest option, which will still let you see clearly below and around you while swimming. [6] X Research source Consider LASIK if contacts or glasses are a nuisance. Consult a reputable center that checks your general eye health in addition to LASIK eligibility. Alternatively, switch to daily contact lenses and continue wearing goggles. Throw away the potentially infected lenses after your swimming session. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Throw away your contact lenses and put in a new pair. Toss your current pair if you realize you’re out of solution and can’t buy any right away—this is the most effective way to guarantee you won’t accidentally infect your lenses by using other substances. Ignore rumors that distilled water or saliva work in a pinch, since they can still contain microorganisms (especially your spit!). Remember, it’s way less inconvenient to throw out a good pair of lenses and buy more solution than it is to deal with an eye infection."

      "content": "Try store-bought saline , even if it’s not meant for contact lenses. Use a sterile saline wound wash or nasal spray (0.9%) if absolutely necessary, but try not to do this for more than 1 day or night. It’s safer than water because it’s sterile and will keep your lenses from drying out. However, it won’t clean them or remove mineral deposits like an enzymatic contact lens solution. [8] X Research source Saline for contacts is not the same as contact solution. Contact solution cleans and disinfects while saline is just pH-balanced saltwater used for rinsing. Non-contact lens saline is not as gentle on your eyes and may cause discomfort. Use this as a last resort if you cannot throw out your lenses. Avoid using homemade saline solution to store or rinse your contact lenses. The risk of infection is too great.

Then, use your dominant pointer finger and thumb to gently pinch and grab the contact and pull it away from your eye. [13] X Research source Look straight ahead into a mirror or look slightly upward—whichever feels easier. Try to grab the lower half or lower third of the lens. The lens will bend and pull away from your eye a bit easier than if you grab at the exact middle. Start with the same eye each time you remove your lenses to avoid mixing them up (it doesn’t matter which you do first as long as you’re consistent)."

This gets rid of mineral deposits and any loose fibers, dust, or dirt that might be on the lens. Alternatively, squirt some solution into the palm of your hand and rub both sides of the lens in it with your pointer finger. Soaking your contacts overnight without rubbing them first is not as effective for disinfecting and can shorten the life of your lenses."
