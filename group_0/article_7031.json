      "content": "Don't get caught . Cheating only helps if you can get away with it. Here are some simple tips to avoid getting caught: Don't look suspicious. It's important to strike a balance between effectively getting your answers and not making it obvious. To do this, don't overly fidget. If you must look around, never hold your gaze in one place for longer than five to ten seconds. Switch it up by randomly staring in other directions — this way, your test supervisors won't get too suspicious and find out where your accomplice (or cheat sheet) is. Don't aim too high. It's not impossible to cheat your way into a perfect score if you really put in the effort, but if everyone else is getting an unremarkable grade on the exam, you will draw attention to yourself. This is fine if you normally get decent marks, but if you're known among teachers as one of the slower students, then there's a chance that they'll find out. Deliberately miss a few questions, though, and you'll be good to go. Try getting a B on a test and continually but slowly raising your average score until it's an A. You can even shoot for ups and downs in your scores, to make it appear more natural. Dispose of the evidence. As soon as the test is over, ask to go to the bathroom (if you haven't already gone) to wash off or throw away any evidence of cheating. The longer you hold on to something, then the better your chance of getting caught because one person or another will notice."

      "content": "Write or print the information correctly. The font should always be clear to read, and in the Goldie Locks size (not too big, not too small). While you would want to include as much as possible on the small sheet of paper, remember if the font is too small you will overly focus on your cheat-sheet thereby increasing your chances of getting caught. Also, if it is possible to print-out your cheat sheet, do that. It will reduce the chances of your teacher or professor being able to trace it back to you."

      "content": "Copy it down. This is most common for spelling tests. Copy down the spellings in your spelling book to a piece of paper, then put it on your lap or up your sleeve. This is a high-risk method, so be careful."

    {
      "title": "Hide the sheet.",
      "content": "Hide the sheet. Try the \"Body Part Cheat-Sheet\" method. Instead of printing out the cheat sheet, try writing it on a part of your body. Good places include your forearm if you are a man or your upper thigh if you are a woman. These are both great because you can wear a dress or long sleeve shirt to cover up your cheat sheet when you aren't using it. It's important to not make it obvious that there is writing on your body. Put the words in a place that faces you only. Try the \"Water Bottle Cheat-Sheet\" method. Print out the cheat sheet on a colored piece of paper that matches that label of your water bottle. Paste it on the label and turn it so that it only faces you. Ideally, you want to mimic the writing on the label to avoid suspicion. [1] X Research source Try the \"Binder Cheat-Sheet\" method. If you have a binder that has a clear slot in the front, slide your cheat sheet into there. Move your binder from under your desk to the side of your desk to peek at your cheat sheet. Try to minimize the number of slides, especially if you don't have carpet in your classroom. Try the \"Calculator Cheat-Sheet\" method. This is common for people who are taking math tests because that's the only reasonable time to have a calculator without being suspicious. Slide formulas or information terms between the back of the calculator and the calculator's cover. Another Calculator Method to try: If you have a graphing calculator, save the math formulas into your calculator. Then, put the information into an archive, so you will still be able to get to it if your teacher makes you clear the RAM. Unarchive the information during the test. Clear the memory after the test. This also works if it's the school's calculator because no teacher or student is going to look in the archive. If you don't know how to archive things on a calculator, look it up. [2] X Research source Try the \"Stashed Cheat-Sheet\" method. Hide a cheat-sheet in a separate place altogether to avoid it getting connected back to you. This includes on a bulletin board in the classroom, in a bathroom stall, or on someone's chair. Wear a long-sleeved shirt and hide your cheat sheets under the sleeves. It is a very good method because your teacher won't look under your sleeves. And when your teacher isn't looking, you can easily take out a cheat sheet, and it's easy to put it back."

      "content": "Try the \"Peeking-Partner\" method. Seat yourself behind someone who will do well on the test (either bragged about studying or is an expert in the subject). Adjust yourself so that you are on the furthest left or right on your seat facing diagonally towards their desk, this should allow you to look over their shoulder without having to move your head too much. Never choose a student in the center of the classroom or the front as this makes it more likely that your teacher will notice you looking over their shoulder."

      "content": "Try the \"Signing-Partner\" method. Create a system of signing with a fellow student in the class. This is going to double your knowledge of the subject because you can work together to sign answers to each other. On multiple-choice exams: Establish hand or foot tapping signals for A, B, C, D, E, and \"wrong answer.\" By creating a signal for \"wrong answer\" you are going to improve the likelihood of you both doing well on the test by helping each other eliminate wrong answers. Also create a vocal noise for getting their attention that isn't suspicious (like a cough, or foot tap). Start by coughing to get their attention. Use your fingers to give the number of the question (flash 3 than a 2 to with your hand signal question \"32\"). Wait for them to signal their answer (pulling their ear for \"B\"). If you need help deciding between 2 answers: cough, give the question number, and signal for the answer you suspect it might be. They can nod their head if it's correct. if it's the wrong answer they can send the \"wrong answer\" signal (put up your hair in a ponytail)."

If you know a professor or teacher will let you come back to finish a test, purposefully don't finish the exam, and ask to come back on a later date. Make sure to memorize the topics or questions so that you can look up the answers before finishing the test later. Claim to be sick, go to the bathroom towards the end of the exam until it's over. Or pace yourself slowly. Be sure that your professor will let you come back before using this method as you could actually do worse if they don’t let you finish."

As you turn in your exam, if your professor isn't at their desk, use a pencil you brought up with you to change or write in answers from the test at the top of the pile. (This is high risk!) Keep in mind that some classrooms have cameras. Avoid this if the one you are in does have a camera because if that is the case, it’s much riskier."

      "content": "Try the \"Fake Exam Paper\" method. Knowing the exact format of the exam paper will help with this, so you can write down all the important points on a paper which looks exactly like the exam paper. If your exam paper is a question/answer type then remember to add one important point as the question and the other as the answer. You also have to include the page number and marks per question (if included). The next thing to do is a staple this piece of paper with the original question paper during the test without anyone noticing."

      "title": "Try not to cram information last minute.",
      "content": "Try not to cram information last minute. By not spending the few minutes before an exam skimming over your notes or studying, you may not have a shot at being able to do well without cheating. For essays , try to remember keywords and points. Usually, professors or teachers look for keywords or important points; the essay's formal \"fluff\" is less important. If you know the topic or possible topics of an essay question, cram four to five terms or important points you know your professor will be looking for instead of studying everything, thereby reducing the effort required. The same is true for short answers that require one or two sentences with keywords and points. For true-or-false exams, try studying the facts enough to pinpoint the details. Typically, there are more true statements on a test than false statements. If you find a statement where you have to change part of it to make it true, it's false. For multiple-choice exams , try \"chunking\" information you know will be on the test. Instead of memorizing a list of words, try breaking it into easier to remember smaller lists. [4] X Research source For example, if studying for a history test , instead of remembering \"Jefferson, Hamilton, Franklin, Washington, Grant, Lincoln, and Lee\" break it up into the \"4 of the founding fathers: Franklin, Washington, Jefferson and Hamilton\" and the \"3 civil war leaders: Lee, Lincoln, Grant.\" By memorizing the number of men to a specific topic, it'll be easier to narrow down who you are missing. For math exams , try to memorize formulas. Knowing a formula can be more powerful than spending hours doing practice problems — although learning the formula through the practice problems can be an amazing idea. If you can write down a formula enough to memorize it, then you can spend the test trying to apply those to the problems."
