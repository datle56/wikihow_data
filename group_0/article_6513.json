This button is different depending on the manufacturer of your computer's motherboard. Common keys include F1, F2, F10, F12, Delete, or Esc. The correct key is usually listed when your computer boots up. If the bootup process goes by too quickly, you can use the following steps to reboot your computer into BIOS from within Windows 10: [1] X Research source Click the Windows Start button. Click the Gear/Settings icon. Click Update & Security . Click Recovery in the panel to the left. Click Restart now below \"Advanced startup.\" Click Troubleshoot . Click Advanced options .

Not all computer BIOS menus have the option to change the fan settings. Check the user's manual or manufacturer's web page if you can't find the option to change the fan settings. The following indicates where you might find the fan settings for different motherboards. These setting may not be true for all models. [2] X Research source Asus motherboards have \"Q-Fan Control\" under the \"Power\" menu. [3] X Research source Gigabyte motherboards have separate customizable fan settings for \"Quiet\", \"Power Saving\", \"Performance\" and \"Entertainment\" in the Control Center. [4] X Research source You can find fan controls under System Information Viewer (SIV) in the App Center in Windows. [5] X Research source ASRock motherboards have “CPU_FAN1 Setting” under the H/W Monitor menu heading, which is the “Hardware Health Event Monitoring Screen”.

Some BIOS menus may have generic settings like \"Quiet\", or \"Performance\". Some may allow you to specify the speed or percentage the fan operates at. In some cases, you may be able to specify at what temperature different fan speeds or power percentages activate. Go through the menu and select which fan speeds are most appropriate for your usage. [9] X Research source Warning: Lowering the fan speed below recommended settings may increase the chances that your CPU or other components may overheat and cause damage to your computer. Use faster fan speeds for more CPU intensive activities like gaming, or video/audio editing. Use slower fan speeds for more mundane work that doesn't require too much processing power This will allow for quieter fans that are less distracting."

First, you'll need to see how many fans your computer has so that you can purchase a fan controller that supports all your fans. You'll also need to disconnect each of the fans from the motherboard so that you can see if they use a 2, 3, or 4 pin connector. You'll need to know what type of connector your fans use when you purchase a fan controller. When handling the inside of your computer, make sure you touch something metal to ground yourself. This prevents static discharges that can damage your computer. You may even want to purchase a pair of static wrist bands to wear while you tinker with your computer. The slightest static discharge can ruin your entire computer system."

Make sure the fan controller you purchase is able to support all the fans in your computer and has the appropriate pin connectors. Most fan controllers require an available slot in the drive bay of your computer tower. If your computer's fans use 2 or 3-pin connectors, you may be able to purchase new fans with 3 or 4 pin connectors as an upgrade. 2-pin connectors only supply an electrical current to the fan. 3-pin connectors allow the fan to have speed control. 4-pin connectors add pulse wave modulation (PWM), which controls the fan power by sending power to the fan in pulses."
