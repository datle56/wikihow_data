If you're skilled at drawing, illustrate your own (you may find it helpful to watch a tutorial on how to do it first). You can also download cat fursona bases for free or for a low cost on websites like Fur Affinity , DeviantArt , and Etsy .

      "content": "Choose a species or breed for your cat fursona. There are dozens of cat varieties to choose from, so take your time and find one that speaks to you! To get started, decide whether you want your fursona to be a big cat or a house cat.

Big cat species: Lion, tiger, panther, cougar, jaguar, spotted leopard, snow leopard, puma, cheetah, lynx, and bobcat House cats breeds: Tabby, calico, Siamese, Persian, ragdoll, sphynx, Abyssinian, British shorthair, Maine coon, Birman, and Scottish fold"

      "content": "Choose colors for different parts of your cat fursona's body. Now that you've decided on a cat species or breed and given your fursona similar fur patterns, it's time to add color. Since your cat fursona isn't real, feel free to pull from traditional cat colors like brown, orange, white, and black, as well as every other color in the rainbow. We're talking blue, purple, red, green, magenta â€“ whatever colors you want your cat fursona to have, make it happen! Look for hues that complement each other or belong to the same color family, so your fursona's colors don't clash. For example, apply different shades of blue and purple (both cool tones) or blue and yellow (complementary colors) to most of their body. Add a pop of color to your cat fursona's stripes, spots, toe beans, or nose to make them stand out. Look at jewel tones like sapphire, emerald, peridot, diamond, and topaz for inspiration to inspire your cat fursona's eye color. Real-life cats have beautiful blue, green, or amber-colored eyes that change hue in different lighting. You may want your cat fursona's eyes to have the same vibrant appearance."

      "content": "Decide on your cat fursona's unique physical features. Because cat fursonas are only inspired by real cats, they can possess unique features that only humans or other animals would have normally. For example, you can put hair on the top of your cat fursona's head in whatever style and color you desire. You can also add freckles, dimples, abs, and any other distinctive points of interest to their body that you think will enhance their overall appearance."

      "title": "Select your cat fursona's dominant personality traits.",
      "content": "Select your cat fursona's dominant personality traits. Start by thinking about traits you associate with cats (see our list of common cat fursona traits below !). Do you think of them as independent or social? Active or lazy? Are they clever or do they share a brain cell with other felines? At the same time, think about traits you possess (or would like to have), and try to incorporate those, as well. For example, if you're shy or ambitious, those are good traits for your cat fursona to have, too. Your cat fursona can also be completely unlike how you imagine a cat's personality. You can choose a cat for your fursona just because you love how cats look or sound, and for no other reason!"

      "title": "Name your cat fursona.",
      "content": "Name your cat fursona. You can put as little or as much thought into your cat fursona's name as you want. For example, if you want to go the easy route, give them a variation of your name or a name you've always liked. If you want options, look up lists of baby names and see if any strike your fancy. You can also pull inspiration from mythology; your favorite books, movies, or comics; or just make up a name right out of your imagination!"

      "title": "Build a cat fursona ref sheet.",
      "content": "Build a cat fursona ref sheet. The last step to building your cat fursona is drawing a reference sheet, or ref sheet for short. This is a page that shows your cat fursona from head to toe and from different angles (you can also showcase them in different outfits and accessories, too). The ref sheet also lists basic information like their name, pronouns, traits, and details about the personal life you imagine for them. Just like the base, you can either draw your ref sheet or download a blank one on the internet."

    {
      "title": "Independence.",
      "content": "Independence. Cat fursonas are known for being independent, just like their real-life feline counterparts. They don't need help (at least not most of the time) and are perfectly content to lead their own lives pursuing their dreams, which sometimes means just curling up in bed and snoozing for hours! Yet don't let their independence fool you: cat fursonas also love their friends, family, and partners deeply and aren't above seeking them out for some low-key socializing."

    {
      "title": "Cleverness.",
      "content": "Cleverness. No doubt, most cat fursonas are quite clever (though maybe not as clever as they think they are)! They enjoy solving challenging puzzles and riddles as long as they have time to think and experiment. They're also incredibly skilled at figuring out ways to make their lives as easy and convenient as possible. That way, they can go back to what they love doing the most: eating, entertaining themselves, and sleeping!"

    {
      "title": "Action.",
      "content": "Action. Some cat fursonas are highly active and enjoy activities where they can jump, explore, and push things across the ground. That means they like hiking and rock climbing, but also soccer and hockey. Just know that they tend to get invested in whatever they're doing, so they may need to be reminded to take breaks and rest!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Laziness.",
      "content": "Laziness. While many cat fursonas like to stay active, others simply prefer to rest as much as possible. They're most often found in a supine position, that is, lying down. The interesting thing is they'll lie down anywhere: not just on the bed or the couch, but also on the floor, the dining room table, the kitchen counter, and even in the grass outside. It matters less to them where they relax and more that they get as much relaxation as possible."

    {
      "title": "Aggression.",
      "content": "Aggression. Aggression is a common trait in many cat fursonas, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. They just want everyone to know where their boundaries are so they don't cross them. If someone annoys them too much, a cat fursona will let them know with some judicious growling and well-timed hisses. Don't push their loved ones around, though, or the claws and fangs might come out!"

    {
      "title": "Protectiveness.",
      "content": "Protectiveness. Whether they're active or lazy, clever or silly, the one thing all cat fursonas can agree on is that they want to protect the people they love. And they'll do just that without hesitation, no matter the time of day or the circumstances. Yes, even a cat fursona who loves nothing more than napping will get out of bed to come to the rescue as soon as they're needed. It's one of the cat fursona's most endearing traits."
