      "content": "“Care of” means “via” or “by way of.” Also written as “℅” on mailed items, this addition means that the envelope, postcard, or package will be delivered to a caretaker, who will then deliver it to the intended recipient. This is opposed to the mail being delivered directly to the final recipient, as usual. “℅” also lets the caretaker know that the mail isn’t for them, even if it has their address on it, and they shouldn’t open it themselves."

This is the caretaker, or the person who will receive the mail first, but then will ensure it gets to its final recipient. It might be an individual person, a business place, a hotel, or any other organization. For example: John Smith ℅ wikiHow In the above example, John Smith is the intended recipient, and wikiHow is the caretaker. This means the letter will come to the wikiHow office first, where John works, and someone at the office will then deliver the letter to John."
