      "title": "Be prepared!",
      "content": "Be prepared! Mewtwo is a level 70 Pokémon, and it knows Psychic, Aura Sphere, Barrier (raises its Defense), and Recover (restores half its HP). You will need Pokémon stronger than Mewtwo. Get a Pokémon that can Paralyze it, a Pokémon that knows Sing, or any other Pokémon that uses any other status condition. In this type of battle, you need more strategy than power. Do not use Toxic, Will O' Wisp, or any move that causes a HP-sapping status condition. This makes damage worsen every turn, and Mewtwo is going to faint quickly if you are not careful. When you are ready, advance. Paralysis is best, since this condition makes Mewtwo slower, easier to catch, and less likely to use moves."

      "title": "Understand the catch rate of the balls.",
      "content": "Understand the catch rate of the balls. The Ultra Ball is ineffective, but 40 may work (this is not, however, guaranteed). Timer Balls are if there at least 30 turns. The Master Ball always works, unless you are trying to catch a trainer's Pokémon-but you may need it later."

      "title": "Build your party.",
      "content": "Build your party. Mewtwo is level 70, which means you're going to be in for a tough battle. Make sure that you have a party that can survive Mewtwo's attacks as well as put out enough damage to lower its health for capturing."

      "content": "Find the cave on the edge of the village. Walk to the left after reaching the village until you reach the edge of the river. Use Surf and travel up the river until you reach the waterfall. Jump back onto the ground on the right side of the bottom of the waterfall. Walk down the path to the right until you reach the cave. The cave entrance will be blocked until you become the Champion, by defeating Diantha."

Ultra Balls aren't guaranteed to work, so you'll likely have to throw quite a few before you can capture Mewtwo. If it heals himself, use your Pokémon to lower its health again before throwing more balls."
