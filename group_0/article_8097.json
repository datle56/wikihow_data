      "content": "Empty stored items and remove the bottom utility drawer if you have one. Pull the drawer open as far as it will go and take out all of the pots and pans, cookie sheets, and anything else that you have stored in there and set them aside. To remove the utility drawer, lift the front of the drawer upwards to release it from the track. As you lift the drawer upwards, continue to pull the drawer towards you. [1] X Research source You should feel the drawer easily release from the roller track so you can completely remove it from the stove. If the drawer doesn't come out easily, check to make sure that it is properly aligned. The drawer should be straight as you pull it out from the cavity, not at an angle. If it is angled, push the drawer back in and try again. Set the utility drawer aside once you have it removed."

If your bottom drawer is used for warming food, you will need to make sure you turn the power off before you get started. Once the power is off, pull the drawer open as far as it will go. Locate the locking levers on each side of the glide rails. Use your left hand to push down on the left lever, and use your right hand to lift up on the right lever simultaneously. [2] X Research source Once you feel the warming drawer release, completely remove the drawer from the stove. This locking mechanism is common on many brands and models of stoves. If your stove does not have these levers, check your owner's manual for specific instructions. Set the warming drawer aside."

Make sure you never mix vinegar or ammonia with bleach, as they will produce toxic fumes. Always keep these cleaning products separate."

Use one hand to grip the back of the stove, and use your other hand to grip the front of the stove. Slide the stove forward. If you don't have a partner to help, place your hands on both sides of the back of the stove or near the front of the stove—whichever is more comfortable and gives you a better grip. Slide the left side forward, then slide the right side forward. Repeat this movement until the stove is cleared away from the area. The stove should remain level on the floor while you are sliding it—do not rock or tip the stove."
