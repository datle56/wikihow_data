WhatsApp says that once a person has blocked you , you won't see updates to their profile. [1] X Research source Some WhatsApp users state that they can't see the profile photos of people who've blocked them at all . Either way, if you know someone's profile photo has changed and you can't see the new photo, it's likely you're blocked. If you have any mutual friends with the person, ask them to look at the person's profile and let them know if they can see it. If they can't see it, or if it's different than the one you see, you could have been blocked."

If you're not blocked, you should see checkmarks under the messages you send that indicate that they've been sent and received. According to Ben Dror, if you're blocked, the message will never make it to the other person, so there will only be one checkmark below the message."

Call the person on WhatsApp. Since all contact is prevented when someone blocks you on WhatsApp, all the calls you make to that person (using the app) will not go through. If all three of these are what you're encountering, you're most likely blocked. If, for example, you can see their profile picture, but only see one 1 checkmark instead of two2 under your sent messages, they may have a limited time when WhatsApp can use data to receive messages, or they don't have an internet connection. To be sure if the contact has blocked you, all three of these criteria should be met."
