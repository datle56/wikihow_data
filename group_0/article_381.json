      "content": "Be light and cheery, This makes people think that you are fun and outgoing. Don't be gloomy and act bored. Try to always smile at people and have a cheerful expression to communicate your feelings. To lighten the mood play some music by the latest artists, people will think you know what music is current. If they don't like the song play a different one that matches their personality."

      "content": "If people expect you to be on your iPhone more than your computer, just type in \"Sent from my iPhone\" at the bottom of the screen. However, the best way to be very social is to eliminate the art of technology or, at least, to a lesser degree. Being on your phone for the majority of the day takes away the opportunity to interact with the world. For example, when you are waiting in a checkout line, be more communicative. Start a conversation with the person next to you instead of having your face in an electronic device. In other words, interact with the world a bit more than usual."

      "title": "Act like you have better things to do.",
      "content": "Act like you have better things to do. To give your friends, family, or whoever the idea that you are social, begin to document your life either through a social media site, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Take pictures of the party you attended and post them at a later time. When at the party, do not sit in a corner and be on your phone the whole time. Get into the mood of the party, take some selfies, videos, or group pics. Also, being social has more to it. Instead of only attending when invited, ask a couple of friends out for lunch or movie."

      "title": "Be yourself!",
      "content": "Be yourself! Instead of pretending to be social, the best way for others to perceive this quality in you is to actually become more social. If you are a shy type of person, get out in the community. If you have trouble talking to people or a group, volunteer at a local museum, where you can interact with a diverse group of individuals. Preferably a museum with docent-led tours. This will heighten your communication skills and make your sociable. That being said, always attempt to become a better you; not into someone you are not."
