      "content": "Understand when these tricks will work. If the site that you're trying to access is blocked specifically on your computer, you may be able to access it by using the website's mobile version, IP address, or Google Translate. In the event that you're unable to access websites that are blocked on your Internet connection, however, you'll need to use a VPN . VPNs can be difficult to install on monitored or controlled computers (e.g., library, school, or work machines); however, if you use a personal computer for work, you should be able to install the VPN while on your own wireless network."

      "title": "Try using the website's mobile version.",
      "content": "Try using the website's mobile version. Many websites, such as Facebook have mobile alternatives that can be visited by typing \"m.\" between the \"www.\" section of the website's address and the website's name. Many blocking services do not account for the mobile versions of blocked sites. For example, you would access the mobile version of Facebook by going to \"https://www.m.facebook.com/\" in your browser. If the website reroutes you to the desktop version of the site, try minimizing your web browser and viewing it in a small window the size of a smartphone screen."

You can find a website's IP address, which is its raw numerical address, on any major computer platform, after which point you can enter the IP address into the browser's URL bar the same way that you'd search for a regular address (e.g., \"https://www.google.com/\").",

This won't work for all websites; some services hide their IP addresses, and others use multiple IP addresses which aren't always reliable. If you don't have access to Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac) on the computer on which sites are blocked, you can use a personal computer on an unrestricted network to find the IP address and then just use the address on your restricted computer.

Use the following steps to install and use Tor on your computer: Go to https://www.torproject.org/download/ in a web browser. Click the download link for your operating system. Open the installation file in your web browser or Downloads. Follow the instructions to complete the installation. Open the Tor browser. Click Connect .

This helps to hide your IP address, access blocked websites and region-locked content, and protect your privacy. A VPN can be installed on your computer or mobile device to route all internet traffic on that device, or it can be installed on your router to route your entire home network through a proxy server."

While some VPNs are free to use, paid VPN services tend to be more trustworthy. Free VPNs may use adware and/or collect and sell your personal data to maintain the cost of their servers. If you are looking for a temporary solution, many paid VPNs offer a free trial. If you are concerned about your privacy, make sure you use a VPN service that doesn't keep logs. If a VPN service keeps logs, they have a record of the websites that you have visited. Paid VPN services include Express VPN, NordVPN, and CyberGhost.
