For example, buy her a pizza decorated with a heart formed out of pepperoni and write, “I know it’s cheesy, but…will you be my valentine?” on the lid. Or, get her a small stuffed animal holding a sign with the same question. Whether you express yourself with food or a romantic memento, you’re sure to put a smile on her face. [1] X Research source Level-up a bar of chocolate by putting a cute note on it, like a short and simple, \"Chocolate is sweet, but you're sweeter. Will you be my valentine?\" You can also put a label on a bucket of popcorn and write, \"In my eyes, you're perfect! I'm not just buttering you up!\" on it. Then, give it to her and ask if she'll catch a movie with you on Valentine’s Day. Or, you can give her a s'mores kit that's packed in a mason jar and tie a little sign on it that says, \"There's nothing I like s'more than you! Be my valentine?\""

When it comes to Valentine’s Day, you can never go wrong with flowers . “To some people, flowers are very meaningful symbols of love,” explains marriage and family therapist Moshe Ratson. They’re also a great option if you’re on a budget, since you can usually find reasonably-priced bouquets at places like the grocery store (or you can even pick flowers yourself for a cost-free option). Try to remember what her favorite flowers are, or get some hints from her friends. For instance, she may prefer tiger lilies or tulips . When in doubt, you can never go wrong with a lush bouquet of red roses . To brighten her mood even more, deliver them when she’s at work or school—it’ll definitely make her feel special and impress everyone around her!"

If you’re more of an amateur baker, try following a recipe for a delicious but basic treat, like a batch of chocolate chip cookies . If you’re a cooking enthusiast, try something indulgent that requires a little more skill. For example, French macarons or an exquisite cake are sure to impress! [2] X Research source To go the extra mile, make your baked goods with heart-shaped baking trays and decorate them with colors like pink or red. Use a small piping bag to write a short and sweet message on your mouth-watering treats, like \"be mine,\" \"xoxo,\" or \"Happy V-day!\""

Hide objects around her school or at your place, then give her a list of clues to follow. For example, tape a cute selfie to her locker, hide a corsage in your glove compartment, and wait at the cafeteria to hand her a big box of chocolates as her final prize. When she meets up with you, drop the age-old question: will she be your valentine? [4] X Research source Here's an example clue to inspire you. Say you wanted to direct her to your school's track field. You might plant clue #1 in her locker, with this note: To \"track\" down the first clue, \"race\" over to the spot where we first met 1 year ago."

In fact, you could even get some of your other musically inclined friends to help out and make it a Valentine’s Day she’ll always remember! If you’re an artist, you can draw a portrait of her, or if you’re in a woodworking class, you could build a cute memento box for her. In both of these cases, she’ll have a memento she can cherish forever, which is an added bonus. Whatever you go with, chances are she’ll really appreciate the fact that you put your whole heart into it!"

For example, add the song you listened to on the way to your first date, or the first song you slow-danced to. Or, if you’re not in a relationship with her yet, try gradually dialing up the romance with your song choices—start with a song about having a crush, then end with one that hints you have serious feelings for her. [6] X Research source Think about the genres that she seems to like. Whether it’s pop, punk, or alternative rock, it’s important to treat her to some ear candy she actually enjoys! Add all the songs to a playlist on Spotify or Apple Music, or go old-school and burn them onto a CD for your valentine to listen to any time."

Check if she'd be okay with you sharing it on social media, too. She might be really touched if you share your feelings for her publicly. Here's another bonus—you can keep re-recording your message until you feel like it's perfect and ready for her to see. If you really want to go \"all in,\" list all the reasons you like her and fell for her, then wrap it up by asking her to be your valentine."

You could go on a tour of a brewery or to a winery. You could go on a dog park date. You could do a couple’s cooking class, or maybe some kind of a concert or musical.” The options are endless! When you ask her out on your unique date, try to use a cute, funny, or romantic pun. For example, you could give her a card that says: “I’ve already fallen for you, but if you want to watch me fall some more, meet me at the ice rink at 6:00 p.m. on Friday.” Then, when you get to the rink for your date, you could hand her a bouquet of flowers and ask her to be your valentine."

To make a girl feel extra special on Valentine’s Day, “you must know her, and what she likes and doesn’t like,” explains professional Matchmaker LeTisha Underwood. When you ask her to be your valentine, take her hobbies, extracurriculars, and favorite colors, foods, and places into account. For example, maybe she’s nuts for roller derby, adores polka dots, and loves the park. Arrange a romantic picnic at the park for her, and gift her with a brand-new set of polka dot roller skates. Your niche valentine will knock her socks off! Or, say she's an animal lover who enjoys being in nature. Try inviting her to hike to a beautiful look-out point. At the end, you could give her a stuffed elephant from a non-profit that supports animal welfare and ask her to be your valentine. [8] X Research source"

To infuse your message with extra love and care, try making a handmade card . Get some nice cardstock, fold it in half, cut hearts out of red or pink construction paper, and glue them on, then write your message in your best handwriting. [9] X Research source If you’re not crafty, no worries! Just keep her personality in mind when you pick a V-day card at the store or online. For example, if she likes to goof off with you, opt for a jokey card that treats her to a punchline when she opens it up. Not sure what to write? Here are some sample messages to inspire you: “Happy Valentine’s Day to the one who makes my heart skip a beat. I feel so lucky to know someone as kind, thoughtful, and beautiful as you!” “The more I’ve gotten to know you, the more I’ve fallen for you. I’d be the happiest person in the world if I could call you mine. Will you be my valentine?” “You bring a smile to my face even on my toughest days, and you mean more to me than I can even express in words. Will you do me the honor of being my valentine?” “You are my sun, my moon, and all my stars.” — E.E. Cummings “Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies.” — Aristotle “Grow old with me! The best is yet to be.” — Robert Browning “If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day, so I never have to live without you.” — Winnie the Pooh"

It can be a bit nerve-wracking to approach a girl and ask her to be your valentine, so it’s a good idea to rehearse your spiel ahead of time.

All these details really count, and they can help build chemistry and attraction right away! Start off with a polite greeting: “Hey! It’s good to see you.” Then, show interest in her day: “How’s it going?” Finally, smile and cut to the chase—tell her exactly why you approached her: “I’d love to get together on Valentine’s Day. I think we’d have a lot of fun.” “There’s no true way of knowing someone is interested in you unless you ask,” says Underwood. So if you're feeling nervous, remember that the only way to win her over is to take that leap of faith and tell her how you feel. You've got this!"

If you like to connect face-to-face, talking in person can show her how sincere you are. However, if you’re a little more shy, it might be easier to text her or reach out on Instagram. This could also be the right move if you already have a back-and-forth convo going over text or DM. Trust your instincts: whatever feels right is the best move. If you do decide to send a cute text to ask her to be your valentine, her are some ideas of what you could say: “Roses are red, violets are blue; I’d love to go out on a date with you. Would you be my valentine?” “I love talking to you, and I think you’re the coolest girl in the world. Will you 🐝 mine this Valentine's Day?” “Are you a thief?
