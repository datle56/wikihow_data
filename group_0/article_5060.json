Bunny lines are a cute term for the diagonal and vertical wrinkles that appear on and around the bridge of the nose, especially when squinting, laughing, or otherwise scrunching your face. They aren’t typically visible when your face is relaxed, but may become more pronounced as you age. [1] X Research source Bunny lines are natural, and almost everyone gets them. There’s nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about if you notice them. Nose wrinkles are called bunny lines because they typically occur when you scrunch or wiggle your nose like a bunny."

      "title": "Botox",
      "content": "Botox “For dynamic wrinkles (wrinkles caused by muscle movements), Botox is a reliable solution,” says Dr. Barrett. Whether your bunny lines occur naturally or as the result of Botox, getting more Botox can actually help treat them. By injecting small amounts of Botox around the nose, the muscles that are responsible for the lines are temporarily inactivated, which creates a smoother, more youthful look. If your bunny lines were caused by Botox in the first place, you can also choose to have the Botox dissolved or let it wear off naturally. Botox gradually fades, usually after 3-4 months. If you choose to get more Botox in the future, adjust your treatments to meet your needs. Your doctor may recommend using less Botox in the glabella area, using alternate treatments, or avoiding injections near the nose altogether."

Many dermal fillers (including Belotero, Restylane, and Juvederm) are available to address bunny lines, so consult your doctor to determine which option is best for you."

Avoid skincare products that are designed to make your skin feel silky and smooth and have perfume associated with them. Sure, they feel and smell nice, but they may not be doing anything for your skin.” Dr. Barrett also adds, “If you want really effective products, visit a skincare physician to have a custom-tailored skincare program developed for you. Physicians can also prescribe pharmaceutical-grade products that you wouldn’t be able to buy over-the-counter.”"
