      "content": "Read the classics before 1600. Reading the classics is the very first thing you have to do to be well-read. If you want to build a solid foundation for your understanding of the books you read, then you can't avoid some of the earliest plays, poems, and oral tales ever written down. Remember that the novel didn't really get popular until the 18th century, so you won't find novels on this list. Without reading the poetry of Homer or the plays of Sophocles, you won't be able to call yourself well-read. Here's a list to get you started: The Epic of Gilgamesh (Unknown author) (18th – 17th century BCE) The Iliad and The Odyssey by Homer (850–750 BCE, 8th century BCE) \"The Oresteia\" by Aeschylus (458 BCE) Oedipus the King by Sophocles (430 BCE) Medea by Euripides (431 BCE) Aeneid by Virgil (29–19 BCE) One Thousand and One Nights (Unknown author) (700–1500) Beowulf (Unknown author) (975-1025) The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu (11th century) The Divine Comedy by Dante (1265–1321) The Decameron by Boccaccio (1349–53) The Canterbury Tales by Chaucer (14th century) \"The Mahabharata\" by Vyasa"

Start small: say, you want to read one book a month. Then go down to a book every two weeks. When you're officially addicted to reading, you can read one book a week -- or even two. Make a list of books and stick to them and you'll be reading more and more in no time at all. Setting goals will also keep you from wasting your time in less productive endeavors.

Suddenly you'll be looking forward to that long drive to work instead of dreading it! Before you buy or rent the book, see if you can listen to a sample to make sure you like the voice of the person who is reading. If you think the person has an annoying voice, the book will feel like a slow read."
