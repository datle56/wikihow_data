It might seem counterintuitive, but making a note of every time you do something that feels routine will help you figure out where you can start to loosen up. [1] X Research source Ask yourself questions like: Do I walk the same route every day? Do I sit in the same desk during classes?

      "content": "Break completely from your routine by leaving true free time. Take an hour, an afternoon, or however much time you’d like to unwind and try something new. Avoid scheduling activities, and see what opportunities come up! Some routine is good—having habits like exercise, regular self-care, and meditating or praying can keep us productive and comfortable—but leaving free time can refresh your perspective on life.

      "content": "Tune into feelings about what you want to do. If you develop a craving to eat pizza late at night or to become a vegetarian over the weekend, what's stopping you?

[10] X Research source Start by asking yourself how you feel about something instead of dismissing your ideas and wants. Use common sense. Don’t act on impulses that are illegal, extremely unhealthy, or that put you in danger."

Strike up a conversation with a stranger by asking about your surroundings. For instance, if you’re at a café, try saying something like, “Wow, the line’s really long today. Have you ever seen it this busy in here?”"

      "content": "Taking \"no\" out of your vocabulary opens up a world of possibilities. The next time a friend asks you to try out a new restaurant or go see a movie, say yes. Just keep in mind that saying yes isn't about forcing yourself to do things that’ll make you deeply uncomfortable—it's about getting yourself to do things you might like and never get around to. [12] X Research source Act in your best interest. If you have absolutely no desire to go to that glow-in-the-dark bubble rave or if you can’t afford that restaurant, don't go. As you find activities or new places you like, focus your energy on pursuing those opportunities. Use your spontaneity to make life more enjoyable, not more hectic or challenging."
