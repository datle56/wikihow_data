      "title": "A butterfly haircut is a hairstyle that mixes short and long layers.",
      "content": "A butterfly haircut is a hairstyle that mixes short and long layers. Butterfly cuts are heavily layered, with two distinct sections that are blended together: the shorter layers hitting around chin-length and the longer layers that start just past the shoulder. [1] X Research source These two sections distinguish butterfly cuts from standard layer cuts that may have more uniform layers throughout the length of the hair. Many butterfly cuts also feature curtain bangs—the short layers around the crown plus the face-framing curtain bangs resemble butterfly wings, which is where the butterfly cut gets its name. [2] X Research source Butterfly cuts have been compared to other popular hair trends like the 1990s “Rachel” cut, the 1970s shag cut , and the wolf cut. Wolf cuts , however, have a more edgy and choppy look than the butterfly cut’s soft and rounded layers. [3] X Research source Will a butterfly cut suit me? Due to the dimension of the layers, butterfly cuts add texture, movement, and volume to the hair. This style works for all hair types, is easy to style, and defines the face without having to do a major chop!"

      "title": "Ask your stylist for face-framing layers that blend into longer layers.",
      "content": "Ask your stylist for face-framing layers that blend into longer layers. Decide exactly where you want the shortest layer to fall on your face, which is typically at your cheekbone or jawline. From there, ask for those shorter layers to gradually blend into long layers. The long layers should continue all the way to the ends of your hair. [4] X Research source Show your stylist photos of the cut you want on people who have hair types and textures similar to yours. Otherwise, the stylist may copy the cut exactly, but it won’t turn out exactly like your inspo photos. If a hairstylist is familiar with the butterfly cut, then you can simply tell them that that’s the style you want. If not, they should be able to replicate what they see in the photos."
