      "content": "Name yourself after something you find beautiful or symbolic. This word need not even be a traditional human name; it just needs to be something that you feel represents you on a deep, existential level. Bear in mind that a unique name may draw attention to you. Choose a color that you've always liked, such as Rose, Indigo, Scarlett, or Emerald. Don't be afraid to choose something that isn't traditionally used as a person name, like Blue, Topaz, Cinnabar, or Vermilion. Draw inspiration from a plant. Choose a flower for your name, like Lily, Daisy, Belladonna, or Aster. [1] X Research source Use an herb or spice, like Sage, Pepper, or Basil. Try using a tree, like Magnolia, Aspen, Willow, Ivy, Peach, Juniper, or Pippin. Borrow your name from a piece of the world that speaks to you, like River, Mountain, Cloud, Rain, Autumn, Blossom, Boulder, Moonshine, Dawn, Ravine, Fog, or Flight. Name yourself after an animal (Bear, Fox, or Badger) or a place (London, Kili, or Sequoia). [2] X Research source Adopt a word or idea that you find particularly lovely, like Morning, Serenity, Cellar, Yonder. August, Aura, Apricot, or Joy. Follow your heart. You can name yourself anything!"

      "content": "Borrow the name of a fictional character. This can range from the nontraditional (Bilbo, Brock, or Huck) to the fairly inauspicious (Cedric or Samwise). Pick a character that you aspire to be like, or just pick a name that you appreciate. Bear in mind that if your name is obviously derived from a character in a story, people may call attention to the connection, and they may compare you to that character. Consider whether this is an association that you want people to make."

You can give a unique flavor to your moniker by picking up a name that doesn't get used anymore. like Gertrude, Beatrice, Cornelius, or Rutherford. This is a way to pay homage to the past and choose a traditional human name that is still unique."

Be aware that when you borrow someone else's name, you permanently associate yourself with that person's deeds, words, and personality. Ask yourself whether you want to pay homage to another person in this way. Think about how this decision will affect your self-identity. Consider changing your name to that of a family member who did something brave or good. This can get confusing if they're still alive, so you may want to talk to them about it first.

For example, the name Mackenzie could also be spelled McKenzi or Makenzee. You may want to pick something unique and creative instead of the typical spellings. If you have a more traditional name, like Elizabeth, you might change your name to Bethany if you really like being called Beth."

You can find inspiration anywhere you look, but ultimately, your choice will come down to something that feels right―something that fits. If you want your name to blend in, choose something common and classic, like Joseph, William, Mary, or Elizabeth. If you want your name to stand out, choose something less traditional.

Whether you identify as Alexander or Alexandra, you can call yourself Alex. Samuel and Samantha can be called Sam. Jordan can easily become Jordy or Jordi.

This is a simple way to transmute your name without choosing something completely new. Try building off of the first syllable: David to Dana, Zachary to Zandra, or Ronald to Robin. Visit http://www.namenerds.com/uucn/advice/family.html and scroll down to either the \"Girls' Names into Boys' Names\" heading or the \"Boys' Names into Girls' Names\" heading. If your original name is on the list, check for any common masculine or feminine forms. Examples for trans women: Paul to Paula, George to Georgia, James to Jamie, Daniel to Danielle, Michael to Michelle or Michaela/Mikayla, or Andrew to Andrea. Examples for trans men: Georgia to George, Nicole to Nicholas, Alexandra to Alexander, or Christine to Christopher. [5] X Research source"

If your birth name is \"Martin\" and you are transitioning to a feminine gender, you do not have to choose \"Martha\" when you have always loved the name \"Laura\".

You may have connotations about certain names: tough, sweet, adventurous, etc. Pick a name that helps you become who you want to become. Name yourself after someone inspiring.

Try this: when you leave the house today, set yourself the goal of introducing yourself as [your new name] to at least one person. Make sure that you aren't with anyone who knows you by your birth name. At least explain what you're doing beforehand. If you bring along a friend who knows that you're choosing a new name, you may feel much more comfortable introducing yourself. Be mindful when introducing yourself to friends of friends, or to people who you might encounter in the course of \"everyday life\".
