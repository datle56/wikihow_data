[1] X Research source Start by making sure the fonts are installed properly on your PC or Mac—just double-click the font file(s) and select Install font (Mac) or Install (Windows). If you're using a Chromebook or Linux, Figma doesn't support local fonts. If there's a font you want to use, have your team or organization administrator install it for your whole team or organization."

If you're using Figma on the web, you must install this separate service if you want to use the fonts installed on your computer: Go to https://www.figma.com/downloads . Click your operating system under \"Font installer.\" Double-click the downloaded file to install. Reload all tabs in Figma after installing so your fonts will be available."

      "content": "Troubleshoot font issues. Figma can be a little picky about fonts, but don't worry—all font issues are pretty easy to fix! If you've installed a font that isn't showing up in the Figma font picker, make sure it's installed in the correct folder—that's /Library/Fonts for macOS and C:\\Windows\\Fonts for Windows. If you're trying to use an Adobe font that's installed on your computer, you'll need to be signed in to Creative Cloud, or have signed in within the past 30 days, to use the font. [2] X Research source If you see a missing font warning on a file—it'll be a yellow icon with an \"A\" and a question mark—it's either because an editor used a font you don't have, or because they used a different version of the same font. Click the yellow icon to view the Missing Fonts panel and select a replacement font. Figma does not support variable font files—the types of font files that contain many font styles or families (bold, light, etc.) in a single font file. Look for the word \"variable\" in the font's file name on your computer—if you see it, delete that font and replace it with the static versions of the font instead. If you're using the web version of Figma and your local fonts aren't showing up, click your profile photo at the top-right and select Settings . If the font service is running, you'll see \"Local fonts are enabled\" near the top. [3] X Research source If you don't see this, check your computer's activity monitor to make sure either Figma Daemon , Figma Font Helper , or Font Service is running. If you don't see any of these, try closing and re-opening your web browser."

Figma supports TTF and OTF fonts only—if your fonts are web fonts or don't end in .ttf or .otf, you won't be able to add them to your organization. If you're not an organization admin or would just prefer to make the font available to a specific team, you can upload fonts to a team instead."
