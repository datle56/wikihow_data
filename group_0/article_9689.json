[12] X Research source Here's an example of how to use this: Problem: convert 65.24 kilograms to grams. 1 kilogram = 1000 grams. Count the number of zeroes: three. That means we multiply by 10 three times, or just move the decimal three spaces to the right. 65.24 x 10 = 652.4 (multiplied once) 652.4 x 10 = 6524 (twice) 6524 x 10 = 65240 (three times) The answer is 65240 grams ."

[13] X Research source Here's an example: Problem: convert 793 milliliters to decaliters. 1 milliliter = 0.001 liters. There are three zeroes, so we move the decimal point three to the left. (Remember, move left when dividing.) 793 milliliters = 0.793 liters 10 liters = 1 dekaliter, so 1 liter = 0.1 dekaliters. There is one zero, so move the decimal point one to the left. 0.793 liters = 0.0793 dekaliters ."

If you converted to a smaller unit, your number should get larger . (Just like 1 foot converts to 12 inches.) If your result doesn't match this, check your work."
