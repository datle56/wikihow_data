      "content": "1 (800) 275-8777 – Customer Service This is USPS’s main customer service number, and it’s the option that will be most likely to lead to a real person on the other end of the line. Follow the robo menus and enter your tracking or confirmation number to get the info you need. All of the USPS phone numbers are available Monday through Friday from 8 am to 8:30 pm ET, and 8 am to 6 pm ET on Saturdays. If you want an easy way to remember this number, it’s 1 (800) ASK-USPS."

      "content": "1 (800) 222-1811 – Delivery Tracking If you want to know where a package is located, call this number. Follow the robo menus and enter your tracking information. You’ll get a set of options regarding tracking info to help you locate your package. You can text 1-800-222-1811 if you want to get tracking info via text. Reply to the SMS prompts using HELP, INFO, AIDE, YES, or NO."

      "content": "1 (800) 344-7779 – Technical Support If you’re looking for tutorials or help with one of USPS’s online features, this is probably the number you want. You can choose from “troubleshooting” or “how to” to access sets of prerecorded guides regarding informed delivery, notification alerts, online user profile setup, and more. This also pops up as “Processing and Distribution” on caller ID, so this may be your best option if you’ve got a business relationship with the post office."

Notably, the hours for this number differ from the others. They’re only open until 4:30 pm ET during the week, and they’re closed on Saturday.

      "content": "Use the online “email us” form if you have a tracking/confirmation number. USPS seems to have a loose definition of what qualifies as an email. Their “email us” page contains an online fillable form, but it’s not via your email. Enter your tracking or confirmation number to pull up the form and send your request. [1] X Research source If you don’t have a tracking or confirmation number, scroll down on the “email us” page. There are a bunch of FAQs that might help. Unfortunately, you can’t use the web form without a number."

      "content": "Try emailing socialmedia@usps.gov or postalone@email.usps.gov. USPS does not publicly list either email address for customers, but frankly, they don’t make it easy to talk to a person so we’ll forgive you for giving this one a shot. Try firing off an email to one of these addresses to get a person to respond. If you’re lucky, they’ll forward it to someone who can actually help you. [2] X Research source You’re probably going to have better luck with the social media email. The USPS Postal One program website doesn’t look like it has been upgraded in a while."

      "content": "If you have a tracking number, call 1 (800) 275-8777. It is impossible to get through the robo menus to get a hold of an actual person without a tracking number. If you do have a number, call and follow the menu prompts. [3] X Research source To get a real person, say “tracking” or “package,” enter your tracking number , and then say “customer service.” It’s unclear what the distinction between the “tracking” and “package” menu options are, but both options will lead to a customer service rep. The other options (“stamps,” “mail,” and “tools”) do not appear to lead to a real person. It’ll take about 7 minutes to get through the robotic menus you need to listen to, so kick up your feet and try to not get frustrated. Pro tip: mute your speaker until you have to speak. The robo menu is extremely sensitive to background noise and interrupting it will require you to listen through the options again."

      "content": "Frankly, you’re best off going to a local USPS office to ask for help. For reasons beyond explanation, USPS makes it extremely difficult to get help if you don’t know your tracking or confirmation number. If you lost that info or you never got it, you may be best off just going to a physical post office and asking a staff member for help. We know that’s frustrating, but USPS doesn’t seem to offer any options. [4] X Research source"

You will need your mailing receipt, a tracking or label number, and proof of value (i.e. sales receipt for the cost of the package, credit card statement). You will also need proof that the package was damaged, so take photos of your package! Sign into your online account and upload the relevant documents to file your claim. [5] X Research source Consult the timetables here to see how long you need to wait before you’re allowed to file a claim. Unfortunately, you cannot file a claim for a missing package if it is uninsured. [6] X Research source USPS doesn’t have a complaint number or any other way to file a grievance outside of filing a claim or calling customer service at 1 (800) 275-8777 and complaining to the customer service rep."

This is a little frustrating, but the missing mail help form needs to be completed on the same “email us” page mentioned earlier. Enter your tracking or confirmation number and follow the menu prompts to submit a help request form. [7] X Research source It’s unclear what happens after you submit the form, but USPS claims they’ll start an investigation. Unfortunately, USPS can’t do anything about porch pirates or thieves.

If you aren’t the executor, just give them any mail you receive for the deceased—they’ll take care of it. [8] X Research source USPS won’t take any info from you regarding another person’s mail (alive or deceased) if you are not legally in charge of their estate, which is why the executor is in charge here. If you share an address with the deceased, you’re allowed to open and manage their mail."
