      "content": "An Aries and Virgo friendship can be awkward since they have little in common. Astrologically, these 2 signs are what's known as quincunx , meaning they're exactly 5 signs apart. Signs that form a quincunx typically have little to nothing in common. This isn't a problem for Aries and Virgo, though, because their differences don't really conflict. As long as they can look beyond the superficial, they can form a strong bond. Many of their differences complement, rather than contradict, each other. For example, Aries likes to lead while Virgo prefers to take on more of a supporting role, which can make them the perfect team! Even though there might not be a lot that they have in common, they can both learn a lot from each other. For example, Aries can help Virgo learn to cut loose a little while Virgo can teach Aries the value of patience and planning."

      "title": "Aries loves to talk and Virgo is a great listener.",
      "content": "Aries loves to talk and Virgo is a great listener. Marathon conversations are nothing for these two—they can talk about anything and everything under the sun. Virgo's broad knowledge base means they have something interesting to add about virtually any topic, but their shy, quiet nature means they're more than willing to listen as Aries goes on about their own passionate pursuits. [1] X Research source Aries : Make yourself open and available so the shy Virgo feels comfortable approaching and talking to you. Virgo : Try to keep your criticism to a minimum. Pay attention when they're talking—your Aries friend doesn't like to have to explain something more than once."

      "title": "Aries and Virgo are interested in completely different things.",
      "content": "Aries and Virgo are interested in completely different things. The bad news is that these 2 signs really have nothing in common—they're headed in 2 different directions. But the good news is that they're not acting against each other either! They have plenty of room to learn and grow together as they each pursue their own ambitions. Aries : Avoid pushing your Virgo friend too far out of their comfort zone. Share your adventures with them and let them embrace the world at their own pace. Virgo : Embrace a supportive role and cheer your Aries buddy on when they head out to conquer the world—they always appreciate a fan who encourages them to pursue their passions."

      "content": "Aries and Virgo have a strong and deep emotional bond. The big differences these 2 signs have on the surface naturally encourage them to dig deeper to find their connection—and when they do, there's not much that could get between them. They develop affection for each other's little quirks that only strengthens their bond. Aries : Have patience with your sweet Virgo friend's fussy nature. You might find them annoying at times, but they just want everything to be perfect (and don't mind a little friendly teasing about it). Virgo : Try not to let your Aries pal's temper get to you. The fire sign runs hot and is quick to spark, but once they've let it out they quickly recover—just don't take it personally."

      "title": "Virgo wants to consider all possibilities while Aries dives in headfirst.",
      "content": "Virgo wants to consider all possibilities while Aries dives in headfirst. Aries is ruled by Mars while Virgo is ruled by Mercury. This means on the battlefield of life, Aries is the impulsive soldier while Virgo is the tactician. Poor Virgo can get awfully frustrated when Aries continues to leap without looking, but they'll lighten up when they realize the ram always seems to land on their feet. Aries : Expect your Virgo friend to be a little frustrated with you at first. Give them time and they'll come to appreciate your active and competitive nature, even if they still find you a little headstrong. Virgo : Take on the planning yourself—your Aries pal will appreciate your careful attention to detail, but they don't want to be involved in it themselves."

      "title": "Aries likes to take the lead while Virgo prefers to take a step back.",
      "content": "Aries likes to take the lead while Virgo prefers to take a step back. As a cardinal sign, Aries prefers to be the leader of basically everything. This is no problem for Virgo, a mutable sign that is perfectly content to stay back in the shadows and help out where needed. This is one instance where differences are actually a strength—2 signs that wanted to lead would constantly butt heads, which isn't a problem for Aries and Virgo. Aries : Consult your Virgo friend on occasion to make sure you're both on the same page regarding whatever activities you're doing together. It'll give them the opportunity to express any misgivings they might have, which will make them feel appreciated. Virgo : Have patience with your Aries pal's snappy temper. [2] X Research source While they might be quick to rage at something that seems minor to you, they'll be over it just as quickly—they just need to let off a little steam."

      "content": "Aries and Virgo make a diverse and interesting team. Because they approach things differently, they can give each other fresh insight. And since they have very little in common but love to talk and are both curious, they can learn a lot from each other. These two often get to the point where they tell each other everything. Having no secrets between them only strengthens their bond. Don't be surprised if these two become each other's \"ride or die.\" Their differences mean they can cover a lot of ground—together, they're an unstoppable team."
