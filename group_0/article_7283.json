      "content": "Install Spek on your computer. Spek is a free program that performs a spectrum analysis on an audio file. The spectrum (or chart) is a graph which shows the frequency (in kHz) and the loudness (in dB), and you can use this information to determine the true bitrate. To download Spek, go to http://spek.cc , and then: If you're using Windows, click spek-0.8.2.msi (the version number may be a little different) to download it to your computer. Then, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install. If you're using macOS, click spek-0.8.3.dmg (the version number may be different) to download then installer. Then, double-click the downloaded file and drag the Spek icon to the Applications folder icon to install. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Observe the cut-off on the graph. How high does the spectrum go? The cut-off is the line where the graph cannot go any higher. To get an idea of the cutoffs you'd see for certain bitrates: MP3 64 kbps: Cut-off at 11kHz. MP3 128 kbps: Cut-off at 16 kHz. MP3 192 kbps: Cut-off at 19 kHz. MP3 320 kbps: Cut-off at 20 kHz. M4A 500 kbps: Cut-off at 22 kHz. FLAC or WAV lossless quality (usually 1000 kbps or higher): No cut-off. [2] X Research source"
