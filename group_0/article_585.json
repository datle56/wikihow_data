      "content": "Start box braids on clean, dry hair. Wash, condition, and dry your hair as usual, then section it off. Clip up any sections that you aren't planning on adding to the braid. Install your extensions into your natural hair using your preferred method, then begin to braid the extensions. Stop when you are a few inches/centimeters past your real hair, and are only braiding with the extension hair. You will continue braiding and lengthening them 1 at a time. This method works best on skinny braids, such as box braids or goddess braids. It is not recommended for thicker braids, such as pigtails."

Use a pair of scissors for a blunt cut, and a pair of thinning sheers for a more natural look. Straighten the end of the braid to make the crimped hair look smoother. Real hair: straighten the hair with a flat iron on a low setting. Synthetic or kanekalon hair: dip the hair in boiled water, then pull it out. Wrap the hair in a towel to remove as much water as possible, taking care to not burn yourself. Then, smooth the fibers out with your fingers and let the hair dry."

Make sure that the cornrows are running in the same direction, from your forehead down to the back of your nape. How many cornrows you create is up to you, but the more you make, the thinner and less bulky they will be. [8] X Research source If your hair very long, finish the cornrows as regular braids. Tuck them against your nape, and sew them to the adjacent braids."

Whether you start on the front or end of the cornrow is up to you. Most people find it easier to start on the end of the cornrow (back of head).

Slip the loop onto the hook. [10] X Research source Marley hair is very fluffy. If you pull on it, the strands will come together and appear smoother. Marley hair separates into locks on its own.

[15] X Research source Plan on leaving about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of space between the strands in the back of your head, and even less space in the front. Use thicker strands in the back, and thinner strands in the front. This will help your hair look fuller while still staying natural in appearance.

[16] X Research source Brush the hair like you would your own hair: gently and starting from the ends. Applying product is optional and not always necessary. You want the hair to be moisturized, but not so much that it looks shiny or becomes matted because you used too much product."

Instead, wrap and twist the strands into loose bantu knots. Dip the knots individually into a cup of boiling water. Let the hair dry completely before unraveling it. [17] X Research source You can try curling the strands using a no-heat method, such as foam rollers, but they may still end up frizzy. Refill the cup with hot water periodically.

Work your way around your hair in layers, working in thin strands. [18] X Research source Depending on the quality of your Marley hair, the highest setting on your hair dryer should be safe. If you need to, hold the nozzle further away from the strands. The sections you are working in should be just a little narrower than the width of your hairdryer's nozzle."
