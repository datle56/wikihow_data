      "title": "Prepare for the battle.",
      "content": "Prepare for the battle. You will be taken to your first chance to capture Zekrom directly after defeating the Elite Four. Zekrom is an extremely dangerous Legendary Pokémon. When you fight it, it will be Level 50. That being said, you should have a good Pokémon team that can go head-to-head with Zekrom. Stock up with healing items and of course balls for catching the Legendary Pokémon. You will receive a Master Ball after defeating the Elite Four that you can use, but you might want to save that for more difficult Pokémon such as Landorus,or Kyurem. Zekrom can only be caught in Pokémon White. If you are playing Pokémon Black, you will need to trade for Zekrom."

      "title": "Defeat the Elite Four.",
      "content": "Defeat the Elite Four. Before proceeding to the main castle where Zekrom is, you have to defeat the Elite Four first. They will have different types of Pokémon so make sure you have a well-rounded team to beat each member. After beating the Elite Four, activate the glowing statue to descend into the mountain. After a scene, you will be taken to N's castle."

      "title": "Make room for Zekrom.",
      "content": "Make room for Zekrom. When you capture Zekrom, you can immediately add it to your party if you have five Pokémon in your group instead of six. You can find a PC to do this on the third floor. In the second floor of the castle, you can heal your Pokémon team. You can leave the castle if you need to get some more supplies or level your Pokémon up some more. Go to the third room from the right on the third floor of the castle. Talk to the Plasma Grunt and you can be teleported away. When you're ready to return, talk to the Grunt at the Pokémon Center at the Pokémon League."

    {
      "title": "Find Zekrom.",
      "content": "Find Zekrom. You'll find N at the top of the tower. After a cutscene, Zekrom will be summoned. You'll have a chance to save your game, and then talking to Zekrom will start the battle. Make sure to save in case you mess up the battle and need to retry."

    {
      "title": "Battle with Zekrom.",
      "content": "Battle with Zekrom. Use your strongest Pokémon to lower Zekrom's health. One strategy is to use Pokémon with the Dig or Dive ability to elude Zekrom's strong attacks such as Fusion Bolt. Keep in mind that Zekrom is at level 50 when you battle against it. Zekrom is weak to Ice, Ground, and Dragon attacks. Since you want to capture Zekrom, you would want to keep his HP low and then go for the capture! If you get it's health ball into the red, start throwing Ultra Balls at it. Keep chipping away at the health and tossing balls until you catch it. If you fail to capture Zekrom here, you have another chance to do so at the 7th floor of Dragonspiral Tower, which can be found to the north of Icirrus City. [1] X Research source This is where Zekrom can be found in Black 2 once you receive the Dark Stone from N."
