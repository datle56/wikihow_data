Your amp should have a label near the speaker output jack that indicates the output power (measured in Watts) and the minimum impedance (measured in Ohms). Be sure that your use the values for bridged mode, it is usually double the minimum impedance as stereo mode (meaning you need a much high impedance to run a bridged system) and up to four times the power output. Your sub-woofers should also be labeled with an impedance value (in Ohms) and a value indicating the maximum power input that they can handle (in Watts). [1] X Research source The majority of amps on the home theater market are only stable at 4 ohms when bridged. Most car stereo amplifiers can do 2 ohms."

      "title": "Calculate the total impedance of all of your speakers.",
      "content": "Calculate the total impedance of all of your speakers. To do this you should add together the speaker impedance number for all of your speakers. You want the impedance to be at least equal to the minimum impedance value of your amp on each channel, but not to exceed 16 Ohms unless your amp is specifically rated for impedance values above 16 Ohms. The formula for finding total impedance for speakers wired in series is Z1 + Z2 + Z3 …. = Ztotal. Where Z is the impedance of a given speaker. For example, if you have three speakers with impedance values of 4 Ohms, 6 Ohms, and 8 Ohms your total impedance wired in series would be 18 Ohms (4+6+8=18). The formula for finding total impedance of speakers wired in parallel is a little trickier. It is (Z1 x Z2 x Z3…) / (Z1 + Z2 + Z3…) =Ztotal. So say you have two speakers with impedances of 6 Ohms and 8 Ohms. This time it would look like this: 1) Multiply the values. 6 x 8 = 48 Ohms 2) Add the values. 6 + 8 = 14 Ohms 3) Divide the top by the bottom to find your total impedance. 48/14 = 3.43 Ohms (rounded) You can also use an impedance calculator."

      "content": "Verify that your amp has enough power for your subs. The output power should be stamped near the output jack on your amplifier and measured in Watts. You speakers should also be labeled with a wattage. The output wattage should meet or exceed the sum of all of your speakers. For example if you have two subs that each pull 200 W, you would want an amp that produces a minimum of 400 W. Ideally you would have an amp that produces more than what is required, this is referred to as \"head room\" and helps to avoid clipping."

Choose one of the positive terminals and connect it to the positive bridged terminal of the amp."

Just like wiring two separate speakers, the two coils within your DVC can be wired in series (increasing the sub's impedance) or in parallel (decreasing the sub's impedance). If you are wiring the coils in series then run a wire from the positive terminal of the first coil (the one wired to the amp) to the negative terminal of the second coil and from the negative terminal of the first coil to the positive terminal of the second. If you are wiring the coils in parallel then run a wire from the first positive terminal to the second positive terminal and a wire from the first negative terminal to the second negative terminal."

Next, connect the negative end of the first coil to the positive end of the second coil. Finally connect the negative end of the second coil to the negative bridged terminal on the amp. If wiring in parallel, connect the negative end of the first sub's second coil to the negative end of the second sub's second coil.
