If you're still in high school, focus on brushing up on your skills (listed below) so you can start applying for jobs after you graduate. A college degree may or may not be necessary, depending on the position. For the most part, a college degree in game design, programming, software development, or other related field isn't necessary but might help you get the job, depending on what the job requirements are.

      "content": "Technical skills The technical skills required to get a game tester job vary greatly depending on the job type, company, and project. However, below are some basic technical skills that you can expect to use during your time as a tester: Console familiarity and knowledge (including PC) Being familiar with multiple consoles is a bonus. However, since cross-platform games are very common these days, you may have to work with consoles you've never used before. Computer/tech literacy Reading and writing Project management tools (optional) Some common project management tools you might use as a tester include Jira and TestRail. For an entry-level position, knowing how to use these tools usually isn't necessary, but having some knowledge before you get the job can give you a leg up. Game engines (optional) Some common game engines you may need to understand as a tester are Unity or Unreal Engine. Knowing how to use these tools isn't imperative for an entry-level position, but learning them will help if you decide to stay in the game dev industry. 3D modeling software (optional) Some common 3D modeling software you might need to use as a tester include Maya or 3DS Max. Entry-level game testers usually won't be using these tools, but having some prior knowledge will always help you in your job search. Programming languages (optional) Some programming languages you may encounter as a game tester include Python and C++ . Like the other optional skills, you likely won't need to know these languages as an entry-level tester. However, knowing a bit of Python or C++ can help you in the long run if you stay in the game dev industry. Servers and APIs (optional) Like the other optional skills, knowing how servers and APIs work isn't required for an entry-level position, but it's good to have a basic understanding of how they work."

You may get health insurance (potentially including vision and dental insurance), a 401k, paid time off, and sick leave. You may also get some special benefits, such as discounted or free video games. This varies based on your employer, however, so don't expect any extra benefits unless told otherwise."

However, if you know more than one language or you're fluent in one or more languages, you may be able to find work as a translation or localization tester . You can also work as a compliance tester , but these jobs may require some prior experience as a compliance tester or knowledge of how certain compliance processes work. While there are many more facets to QA testing (such as regression testing, integration testing, balance testing, performance testing, etc.), these usually fall under the \"functional testing\" umbrella when a job is titled Functional Tester. Job listings may say QA tester, quality assurance tester, QA analyst, quality assurance analyst, game tester, video game QA, functional tester, QA specialist, QA engineer, or a combination of these terms. There doesn't seem to be any particular standard as far as what an entry-level game tester position is named, so you may have to do a little digging to find a job that you're qualified for."

These employment types have their pros and cons, but all of them are valid ways to get work as a QA tester. Contractors sign a contract to work on one project or for a set period of time. They may be independent, or they may be hired through an employment agency. Contractors are usually in charge of figuring out their own self-employment taxes. Non-contractors are full employees of the studio that hired them, so there is no time frame for their employment. The employer takes care of taxes and benefits. Gig workers are similar to contractors but work on shorter-term jobs. Gig workers are usually responsible for figuring out their own self-employment taxes. Temporary workers aren't contractors, but are only hired to work for a certain period of time. They may or may not be hired through an agency. If a temp worker is hired by an agency or studio, they will likely take care of your taxes and benefits."

Sometimes testing involves playing a game naturally, but testing can also involve doing various tests in a methodical way, checking every model in the game for visual bugs, doing repetitive tasks to check for gameplay bugs, and more.
