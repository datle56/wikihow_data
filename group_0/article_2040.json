      "content": "Pour on the romance. A Cancer woman loves traditional romantic trappings. If you're wooing a Moon maiden, you definitely want to show her that you can be romantic . And don't worry—she loves it all; there's no gesture too cheesy. Show her you know how to speak the language of love, and she'll definitely be thinking about other ways to show her appreciation. [1] X Research source Since her sign is ruled by the Moon, a moonlit walk holds special appeal for her. Even better if it's on the beach or by any body of water. Go the extra mile: Keep things close, personal, and private. She's likely to get overwhelmed by grand gestures or large, public spaces. Since she's a bit shy, she'd likely feel more comfortable having a candlelit dinner on your balcony at home than at a big fancy restaurant."

      "content": "Create a safe and comfortable environment. Comfort and seclusion are paramount for the private Cancerian—she's not much of an \"anytime, anywhere\" type of lover.

If you have roommates, choose an evening when they're going to be out. She'll feel more comfortable if she doesn't have to worry about anyone overhearing. Go the extra mile: Kick your thermostat up a degree or two so that it's slightly warm—she'll feel more comfortable and won't catch a chill if clothes start to come off."

      "content": "Air signs might have a hard time getting a Cancer lady to warm up. Air signs (Aquarius, Gemini, Libra) tend to value logic and reason over feelings, and that can result in a huge disconnect with someone as emotional as a Cancer woman. But if they have other things in common, they can end up having some adventurous times in the sack as well. If a Cancer woman does end up in a sexual relationship with an air sign, it can get pretty hot and heavy—but often, they have more of a platonic attraction than a romantic or sexual one. Make it sizzle: Dial back your urge to experiment from time to time and relax. Make an effort to go slow and pay attention to her, and you'll be rewarded."
