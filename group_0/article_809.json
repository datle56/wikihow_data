      "content": "Plug the device into your computer. Depending on the type of audio device you're connecting, you can go about this in a few different ways: USB — Some audio devices can be connected to your computer using a USB port. You can connect to any free USB port on your desktop or laptop computer. Audio Jack/3.5 mm — The 3.5-millimeter headphone jack can reliably be found on most computers somewhere on the side of a laptop or the back of a computer case. The plug is sometimes color-coded in green and usually has a headphone symbol identifying it. The pink jack is for microphones, and the blue jack is for line-in, similar to an aux input. Many headsets have a single 3.5mm jack for both the audio and microphone. HDMI — these ports work the same on your computer as on your TV, including audio transmission. Optical — A pentagonal port. Optical cables will usually work with high-end, modern speakers, but not all computers have optical ports. RCA — These are red and white color-coded ports. These ports receive 3.5-millimeter cables of the same colors. If your computer doesn't have RCA ports , you'll need to connect a USB sound device with RCA ports to connect your audio device. You might need a converter if your computer doesn't support the connection that the sound device offers. These are usually easy to find and relatively inexpensive."

      "content": "What if the Bluetooth scan doesn't find my device? Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can easily follow: Move your sound device closer to your computer. Bluetooth has a 30-foot range, but items like microwaves, wireless routers, and similar electronics can interrupt that range. Clear the path between your computer and the sound device if possible. [5] X Research source Make sure your sound device is charged. Many Bluetooth speakers and headphones require a full charge to work correctly; many devices won't pair if they are low on battery power. Put your sound device in pairing mode again. Pairing mode can time out if more than one to five minutes have elapsed since entering pairing mode. Factory reset the sound device. Doing so will erase all the current data on the sound device, including Wi-Fi networks or other paired devices, so you'll have to reconnect to everything in the future. However, starting with a clean slate might help you pair the device with your computer."
