      "content": "A nice outfit can make a great impression. If you’re going to a nice restaurant, you might put on slacks and a button-down. If you’re going mini golfing, jeans and a T-shirt are perfect. Make sure whatever you put on is clean and wrinkle-free to make a good first impression. [1] X Research source If you’re having trouble figuring out what to wear, ask your friends or family for advice. They can help you figure out what you look best in. Spend a few minutes getting cleaned up in the bathroom before you head out on your big date. If you want to wear cologne, remember: less is more. you. Aim to get to your date about 15 minutes early so you don’t leave your date waiting. If you are going to be late, send your date a text or give them a call to let them know."

      "content": "This will help you focus more on your date. If you’re scrolling through social media the entire time you’re on your date, you can’t get to know each other. Keep your phone in your pocket or put away somewhere, and only take it out if you just need to check something really quick. [2] X Research source If you do take out your phone, let your date know that it will just be a second."

      "title": "Going on a date is all about getting to know the other person.",
      "content": "Going on a date is all about getting to know the other person. Come up with a few questions ahead of time so you can leave the date feeling like you know this person a little more. You could try asking: [3] X Research source What’s your favorite subject in school? Have you read any good books lately? What’s something you wish you were better at? What do you like to do for fun?"

      "title": "Hearing about your ex-partner can be a little jarring.",
      "content": "Hearing about your ex-partner can be a little jarring. Besides, it might throw up a red flag to your date. If you can avoid it, try not to talk about your ex until you know your date a little better. [4] X Research source If it comes up in conversation naturally, it’s fine to spend a few minutes talking about your past relationships. However, if that’s all you talk about, your date might think you’re not ready to move on yet."

      "title": "It’s always nice to hear good things about yourself.",
      "content": "It’s always nice to hear good things about yourself. If you notice something that you really like about your date, let them know by giving them a compliment. Stick to one or two compliments throughout the date to avoid going overboard. Try something like: ”I love the way you laugh.” ”You’re really fun to hang out with.” ”It’s so easy to talk to you.”"

      "title": "Asking a constant stream of questions turns your date into a job interview.",
      "content": "Asking a constant stream of questions turns your date into a job interview. Make sure you tell your date more about who you are, too, so they can get to know you. [5] X Research source You can respond to something your date said with a little tidbit about you. For example, “Oh, you have a dog? That’s super cool, I have 2 cats at home and they love dogs.” Or, “Have you ever gone mountain biking before? I’ve never gone myself, but it looks fun!”"

      "content": "The goal is to learn more about each other, not to start an argument. Stick to fun, light topics that are easy to chat about, and stay away from politics and religion. [6] X Research source These are important things to talk about, but you can save them for when you know your date a little better. If you notice that a topic has struck a nerve or made them feel uncomfortable, back off the topic, apologize, and talk about something else."

      "content": "Chivalry can be an effective way to impress your date. You don’t have to do these things (and don’t force them if it feels awkward), but adding a bit of chivalry can leave your date feeling charmed. [7] X Research source Chivalry doesn’t necessarily mean you have to pay for the date. You can ask your date to split the bill with you, if you feel comfortable."

      "content": "This helps end your date on a good note. After a few hours, you both might be getting tired. If you feel like the date is winding down, let them know how good it was to see them and that you enjoyed your time together. [8] X Research source Say something like, “Thanks for meeting up with me, I had a really good time tonight.” Or, “This was so much fun! I really enjoyed talking to you.” Even if you don’t see yourself going out with this person again, it’s still polite to tell them that you had fun."

      "content": "This really lets your date know that you had a good time. You can see if they’re free next week sometime, or let them know that you’ll text them to set something up. You don’t have to commit to anything, so don’t feel pressured to go on another date if you don’t want to. [9] X Trustworthy Source Go Ask Alice Medical advice site with content written by health promotion specialists affiliated with Columbia University Go to source Say something like, “I had a really good time tonight. Wanna do this again sometime?” Or, “It was so nice to meet you. Are you doing anything next weekend?” If you don’t want to ask for another date, don’t ask for one. You can keep it ambiguous for now and then let them know later that you aren’t interested."

      "content": "This is optional, and it depends a lot on their body language. If you were both smiling and laughing throughout the night, it’s probably safe to lean in. If your date seems tired or ready to get home, stick with a handshake instead. [10] X Trustworthy Source Go Ask Alice Medical advice site with content written by health promotion specialists affiliated with Columbia University Go to source If you really enjoyed your date, you might go in for a kiss. Try a hug first, and then see if they’re smiling afterwards. You can either lean in and go for it, or you can ask them directly if they want to kiss you."

[12] X Research source If you don’t want to set up another date, honesty is always the best policy. Let your date know that you just weren’t feeling it so they aren’t left hanging."
