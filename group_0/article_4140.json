To accomplish this, you have three options. First, you can opt out of creating a robots.txt file—when the robot does not find a robots.txt file, it will continue to crawl and index your entire site. Second, you can create an empty robots.txt file—the robot will find the robots.txt file, recognize that it is empty, and continue to crawl and index your site. Lastly, you can write a full-allow robots.txt file. Use the code: User-agent: * Disallow: When a bot, such as googlebot, reads this file, it will feel free to visit your entire site. User-agents : this is another term for search engine spiders, or robots * : the asterisk signifies that the code applies to all user-agents Disallow : the blank disallow command indicates that all files and folders are accessible"
