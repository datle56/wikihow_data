      "content": "Cut a 1 inch wide leather strip. Determine the length of braid you need and add 1/3 more material to that measurement before cutting. [1] X Research source The process of braiding will shorten the material by the time you have completed braiding, so cutting extra leather will make the braid the proper length once you finish. Use sharp scissors to cut the leather strip to the desired length. A good length to practice on is 9-10 inches."

      "content": "Make 2 parallel slices down the middle of the strip, but don't cut the very ends. Your strip of leather should be divided into 3 equal parts. For the following steps, the individual strands will be referred to as 1,2, and 3 from left to right. [2] X Research source Be sure that the two cuts are evenly spaced from each other. The spacing between the cuts should be about 1/3 inches. Stop the slices at 3/4 inch from the vertical ends, leaving the strip intact. This technique requires the strip to remain as a single piece, as opposed to braiding hair or string. If you decide to make your cuts with a blade, place a piece of cardboard, wood, or other protective board under the leather to protect the surface you are cutting on."

Pull the end of the strip down from the other side so that it is back in its original position. Looping the strip through strands 2 and 3 will bend it, making it so that the individual strips are twisted and easier to braid. If done correctly, your strip of leather should have a kink throughout the middle and should not lie flat. You should also be able to see through the slits you made earlier."

Using 4 strands will also form a round braid rather than a flat one, hence its name."

[5] X Research source Since you will be working with many strands, try tying the ends to a key-chain ring and putting the ring under the leg of a chair. This will keep the strands secure so you can focus all of your attention on this slightly intricate process. To help you keep track of each strand, consider practicing with colored yarn first. It can become very easy to lose track of which strand is which. Alternately, you could tie-off different colored strings of yarn to the end of each strand."

[11] X Research source As outlined in the 4-strand braiding method, you could tie the opposite ends of the braid to key-chain rings and connect the rings afterwards to form a bracelet. While this method is easiest, it may not look the most appealing. Alternately, you could take the trick braided leather and puncture a small hole in the intact, 3/4 inch ends. Run a regular strand of leather through each hole and tie the ends off into knots. Adjust the size of the regular leather strand to better fit your wrist. To make a high quality, professional looking bracelet, hold the ends of your braid together so that they line up (this won't be necessary for the trick braid). Take a pinch crimp — which can be purchased at most jewelry shops — and place your braided ends inside of it. Use a pair of pliers to squeeze the pinch crimp shut over the ends. Now you're bracelet has metal ends like store-bought jewelry!"

Though your necklace will differ mostly from your bracelet length-wise, you can add other accessories to customize it. Find some beads with holes that run through them. You could run the braid through a single, tubular bead so that it sits in the middle, almost like a pendant. Or, you could fill the entire bottom portion of the braid with various colored beads so that only half of the braid is showing. Instead of beads, put a locket on your braid. Place your picture inside and give it to a special someone as a token of your friendship. Or, you could find letter pendants and use them to spell your name across the bottom of the braid. The possibilities are virtually endless!"

Fit the ends with pinch crimps and wear the ring on your finger with pride."
