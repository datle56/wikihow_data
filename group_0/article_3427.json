      "content": "Figure out what being popular means to you. Before you dedicate your time, effort, and resources to becoming cool, take a moment to evaluate your desire to be popular. Are you searching for acceptance? Are you looking for attention? Are you trying to rebel or reinvent yourself? Torrecillas advises asking yourself what being popular even looks like to you. If you define “popularity” as “everyone liking you,” “I'm sorry,” Torrecillas says, “that's just not gonna happen.” If you view popularity as people being “excited to sit next to you like they think that you're a cool person in general”? That’s more doable. [1] X Expert Source Evanne Torrecillas School Counselor Expert Interview. 14 April 2022. Even if you try really hard to be well-liked, you may never become popular in society’s eyes. What will happen if you don’t become popular? How can you cope with failing to fulfill this desire? What other outlets could you explore as you try to discover your authentic self? [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Be true to yourself. In order to become popular, you don't conform to societal norms or completely reinvent yourself. Strive to develop into the best version of yourself —the most compassionate, spunky, authentic you. As you become more self-aware, your confidence will grow . You will become more adventurous, passionate, and interesting. Your social anxiety will decrease and people will be more drawn to you.

      "title": "Stand up for your beliefs.",
      "content": "Stand up for your beliefs. Never compromise your personal beliefs and opinions in exchange for popularity. Instead, openly embrace what you believe in and love. Follow the fashion trends that you like, and not because you saw a celebrity wear it. If you want to, make new trends, instead of following old ones. You may gain acceptance by some in-crowds by defaulting to more popular kids' beliefs and opinions, but this is likely to leave you feeling unhappy and unseen. And in fact, you'll probably be more respected by sticking to your own values, opinions, and beliefs, and not giving in to peer pressure from others."

When you make a mistake or a social faux pas, don’t be afraid to laugh at yourself. When you accomplish something incredible or do something wonderful for another person, don’t broadcast your achievement. When you get a new outfit or item, don’t rub it in others’ faces."

Remember, a kind, compassionate person wins over more friends than a nasty, unconfident person. [7] X Research source Never judge people, but always jump to their defense. Don’t bully others, but befriend them. Plus, you don't want \"friends\" that are only friends with you because they're afraid you'll bully them. Be kind to people outside your group. Being a clique that despises outsiders will not earn you many friends beyond the group. Instead, work to earn the respect and friendship of outsiders."

Let this person know that you do not appreciate and will no longer tolerate their negative treatment of you. Don’t take it personally.

Run for student council. Join a culture-themed club. Torrecillas says, “Just being part of that club isn't going to make you popular, it's that you enjoy this thing. You own it, you like it, you want to share it with other people. You can develop those leadership skills, which will definitely help make you more popular, and stand out from the crowd….
