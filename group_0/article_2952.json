Don't feel pressured to shave or not shave your body, regardless of your gender. Do what is right for you. Half of looking well groomed is the confidence around you. If you have sensitive skin, consider shaving less frequently and find a shaving cream made for sensitive skin."

      "content": "Make your hair look nice. Before styling your hair, you should understand what type of hair you have. You can determine the thickness of your hair by how many times you need to wrap it in a ponytail. One wrap means your hair is thick, 2-3 wraps is medium, and anything more is fine hair. Use a high-wattage blow dryer (above 1800 watts) to prevent frizz and create a shiny, smooth finish. Curl your hair. If you plan on curling your hair apply a lightweight mousse while your hair is wet. Then use a ceramic curling iron once it has dried. Keep the curls all day by using a frizz-fighting hair spray. Straighten your hair. Choose a hair straightener with ceramic plates and prep your hair before straightening. Use shampoo and conditioners that are meant for smoothing. Add volume to your locks by adding a volumizing gel while your hair’s wet from a shower. Do this at night and put your hair up in a bun before falling asleep. Then let your hair down the next morning for a healthy bounce. [4] X Research source When all else fails, wear a hat."

      "content": "Wash hair when needed. People with straight hair may choose to wash their hair daily while others with very curly hair may need to do so less frequently. There is some debate on how daily washing can dry out hair and strip the scalp of important nutrients. When you do shampoo, lather the product on your scalp and don't worry about the rest. For curly hair that becomes very dry, consider conditioning your hair more frequently than shampooing. Use conditioner for your mid-length hair and tips. These parts of hair are more vulnerable to becoming dried out. Reader Poll: We asked 157 wikiHow readers if they use conditioner every time they wash their hair, and 63% of them said yes. [Take Poll] Everyone’s hair is different, so create a wash routine that works best for your needs."
