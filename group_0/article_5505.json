If you are working with an actual circle, measure the diameter by placing a ruler so its edge passes straight through the circle's center , touching the circle on both sides. [1] X Research source If you're not sure where the circle center is, put the ruler down across your best guess. Hold the zero mark of the ruler steady against the circle, and slowly move the other end back and forth around the circle's edge. The highest measurement you can find is the diameter. For example, here we have a circle with a diameter of 4 centimeters."

      "content": "Divide the diameter by 2. A circle's radius is always half the length of its diameter, math teacher Grace Imson says. That means all you need to do is divide the diameter by 2 to find the circles’ radius. For example, if the diameter is 4 cm, the radius equals 4 cm ÷ 2 = 2 cm . In math formulas, the radius is r and the diameter is d . You might see this written in your textbook as r = d 2 {\\displaystyle r={\\frac {d}{2}}} ."

[2] X Research source The symbol π {\\displaystyle \\pi } (\"pi\") is a special number, roughly equal to 3.14. You can either use that estimate (3.14) in calculations, or use the π {\\displaystyle \\pi } symbol on a calculator or type it on your keyboard ."

The radius is the line segment that can be drawn from the center of the circle to its edge. And since every point on the edge is an equal distance from the center, the radius is the distance from the center to any of those points. [14] X Research source Mathematically, we can express the general equation of the radius of a circle drawn on a cartesian plane (a grid) as (x-a) 2 + (y-b) = r 2 , where a and b represent the center point of the circle. This is also known as the equation for the circle where radius is known."
