      "content": "Use conditioner only on the ends of your hair. Conditioner is great for detangling your hair and locking in moisture, but it can leave a heavy residue that can weigh down your roots. Use a volumizing conditioner on just the ends of your hair to get moisture where you really need it.

      "content": "Spray your hair with dry shampoo to get second-day volume. If your hair looks limp and oily the day after you wash it, use dry shampoo on your roots to absorb oil and add volume. Spray the dry shampoo on the first 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of your hair, especially around your hairline and at the crown. [5] X Research source Massage the dry shampoo into your roots with your fingers and let it sit for a few minutes, then comb through to the ends of your hair. This will help absorb oil throughout the length of your hair, especially right at the roots where it builds up the most."

      "content": "Brush 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) sections with a round brush as you blow dry your hair. A round brush gives you more control over each section of hair since it grips from all sides. Hold the brush under your hair and push it upwards to lift your roots as you dry them to give them the most volume. You should also use a nozzle attachment on your hairdryer so you can focus the air on the brush. After you dry your roots, slowly move both the brush and hair dryer down each section of hair to dry it. If you have short hair, use a smaller round brush. Hold the brush at your roots instead of moving it through your hair to avoid adding too much curl. Flip your head upside-down and blow dry your hair without the brush until it’s about 70% dry, then turn upright to finish styling. For longer hair, you can play around with different round brushes and styling techniques."

If you normally wear your hair parted so it falls to the left, brush it over to the right, or vice-versa.

      "content": "Pull your hair into a bun to air-dry if you don’t have time to dry it. If you’re in a hurry, pull your hair as far forward into a bun as you can get it. As it dries, the roots will hold their shape, so when you pull it down, you’ll have extra volume. This is a great method to air-dry your hair if you like to shower before bed at night."

Depending on the size of the rollers, section the center part of your hair — the part where a mohawk would be — into 3-4 sections. Wrap each one around a roller while you finish getting dressed or do your makeup. [10] X Research source If you use hot rollers, leave them in until they cool. If you use foam rollers or other rollers that aren’t heated, blast the roots of your hair with your blowdryer, then leave them in until your hair cools.

      "content": "Add clip-in hair extensions for added volume. Hair extensions aren’t always just for creating length. Extensions cut to the same length as your hair can give you a huge volume boost. Tease your hair a little to hide the clips, then attach the extensions a few inches away from your roots. [13] X Research source Make sure your hair is thick enough to cover the extensions. Clip-in extensions are usually placed fairly close to the roots, so even if your hair is on the thinner side, they wouldn't be as noticeable. If you place them a few inches away from the roots, then thin hair may not fully hide them."
