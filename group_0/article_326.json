      "title": "Aceflux is a sexual orientation that fluctuates on the asexual spectrum.",
      "content": "Aceflux is a sexual orientation that fluctuates on the asexual spectrum. Someone who identifies as aceflux automatically identifies as asexual (to some degree), which is a sexual orientation where people feel little or no sexual attraction to others. Asexuality exists on a spectrum—some people may feel completely turned off by sex, while others may feel attraction under certain circumstances. Being aceflux simply means that your sense of attraction shifts around on this spectrum. [1] X Research source The word “ace” is shorthand for “asexual.” Aceflux experiences are typically centered on the asexual spectrum, but it ultimately depends on the person. For instance, some aceflux people may feel allosexual (experiencing sexual desire) at times. [2] X Research source A person can be aceflux as well as other orientations. For instance, someone could identify as both a lesbian and aceflux (a woman attracted to women whose sense of sexual attraction fluctuates). A biromantic aceflux individual would be someone with fluctuating sexual attraction who is romantically attracted to 2 or more gender identities."

The first, red-pink stripe stands for allosexuality (experiencing sexual attraction toward others); the second (fuchsia) stripe, the third (magenta) stripe, and the fourth (pink-purple) stripe represent a shift between sexual attraction and a lack thereof; and the bottom (purple) stripe stands for asexuality.

      "content": "Try out different relationship paradigms to find the right fit. Relationships aren’t one-size-fits-all—they come in all shapes and sizes, with certain paradigms working especially well for aceflux individuals: Queerplatonic relationships : Queerplatonic relationships go deeper than a traditional friendship, but don’t quite qualify as romantic. Queerplatonic partners can do a lot of the things that romantic partners do, like moving in together or even getting married. Romantic asexual partnerships: Aceflux individuals might have a lot of success and compatibility dating a fellow member of the asexual community. Polyamorous relationships : Polyamorous relationships involve breaking out of a 2-person relationship and including another (or multiple) partner(s) in the dynamic. If all parties are on board, a poly relationship could be a helpful, consensual way for an allosexual partner to satisfy their sexual desires."

      "title": "Communicate openly and honestly with your partners.",
      "content": "Communicate openly and honestly with your partners. There’s no denying that communication is important in any relationship—but it’s especially important when an ace individual is dating an allosexual. The aceflux partner needs to be okay with discussing sex and being really clear about what they are and aren’t comfortable with, and establish clear boundaries that best represent their needs. That way, their partner will know how to support them. These boundaries ultimately depend on the aceflux individual’s preferences when it comes to sex. They should be upfront with their partner about how their sexual attraction tends to fluctuate, so both parties can be on the same page."

[5] X Research source The term abrosexual can mean different things to different people, especially as the LGBTQ+ lexicon continues to evolve and grow. What matters most is choosing and using labels that feel the most comfortable and accurate to you."

      "content": "Acespike Acespike people are asexual individuals who feel little/conditional or no sexual attraction most of the time, but who have sudden, deep moments of experiencing sexual attraction. These bouts of attraction don’t last for very long. [6] X Research source While the term acespike definitely has some overlap with aceflux, the fluctuation of attraction that most acespike individuals experience is much more drastic and intense than what aceflux individuals experience."
