      "content": "Spend time getting to know the kids. Babysitting is as much a job as it is an opportunity to enjoy the company of children. The kids will be more receptive to you and your rules if they like you, and they’ll grow to like you faster if you try to develop a relationship with them. Talk with them, ask them questions, and joke around in order to develop a good relationship. Younger kids might not want to talk for too long, so try to incorporate during play or activities."

It is not good babysitting to just allow the children to eat whatever. Tell them before they get crackers they have to eat a piece of fruit. These things include apples, carrots, grapes, and oranges. Be sure the child doesn't have something they are not allowed to have (such as a cookie or ice cream) too often."

You may want to let them stay up 10-15 minutes past what their parents allow—just be sure they know it's a special treat. Other than that, be firm with when it's time to go to sleep. Be prepared for some whining. For older kids, you need to know the difference between real problems and stall tactics. For babies, you have to be sure the sleep environment is safe. End-of-day routines help kids wind down and signal their bodies that it's time for sleep. Ask parents what they usually do before bedtime. Maybe they have rules like no TV or computer time for an hour before bedtime. If they typically read, talk quietly, or listen to music before bed, follow the same routine. [1] X Research source Go through the basics. Take a child to the bathroom (or put on a nighttime diaper). Help the child brush their teeth. Find out from parents what else is necessary before the kid hops under the covers. [2] X Research source Always put babies (and children) to bed in their designated sleep space (be it a bed, crib, bassinet, etc.) This is especially important for babies, who can be injured if their sleep space isn't how it should be. Remove padding, pillows, stuffed animals, and other items from the crib, if these items are present. Be sure to lay babies on their back when putting them to sleep. It helps reduce the risk of suffocation. Give the child any comfort items, such as pacifiers, stuffed animals, or blankets, that they usually sleep with. Do not give stuffed animals and similar to babies. [3] X Research source If a child calls you/wakes up, wait a minute before going in. They may fall back asleep on their own. If a baby can't go back to sleep, stroke them gently on the arms or belly. If the baby uses a pacifier, that can also help. Find out what calming tactics the parents use."

Play will vary based on their ages; if you’re watching an infant you may be doing nothing more than making faces and holding up toys. Get creative with the things you come up with for the children to do to keep them interested and out of trouble. Make-believe games are great fun. You could even make up a simple handshake with the children. Be an entertainer. Parents love babysitters who help kids have fun and learn while still reinforcing rules and keeping discipline. Ask kids to show you their favorite toys. Find out from parents and other babysitters what games kids of different ages like to play. Get the kids outdoors if you can. Playing with toys, board games, and activity-based games are all good options for older children. Ask what their favorite thing to do is. You can also bring a few of your favorite games and toys from when you were their age, like Monopoly, Life, Candyland, Uno, or other card games. Stay off screens.

If you and the children make a mess, pick up before the parents arrive. Play cleaning games with the kid. Say whoever picks up the most wins or makeup a silly game that includes cleaning.

Remember, you're not their parents, so you don't really have much say in how the house rules go. You can't be a child's friend all the time. Know when to say no and when it's OK to let something small go like letting children stay up 5 minutes past bedtime on occasion. Children will challenge you. Pushing boundaries to see how much they can get away with is a normal way kids (even toddlers) learn and figure out where they stand. Check in with parents to find out what the rules are, then follow them, even if you don't agree with them! The best babysitters think of the job as a responsibility first, with having fun, or earning money, second. Few things are as rewarding as knowing you've earned a child's trust and affection. Always feel free to call the parents if you feel you need to. It is better to be safe than sorry, and most likely the parents will appreciate your concern."

Clarify about any foods that aren’t allowed; these are typically candy and dessert-related goodies that the kids might ask for when their parents aren’t supervising.

If you have an older sibling who is moving on to another job, contact their clients. It's always best to babysit for someone you know or someone you've heard about from a friend. If you're new to babysitting, you may choose to only babysit for those you know. If word of mouth doesn't work, consider advertising in your neighborhood. You can use flyers delivered to homes in your area or send out an email if your neighborhood provides a list of residents. If you decide to advertise, check with your parents first.

What can you offer to the kids and their families? Do you want to babysit occasionally or find a regular babysitting position? If income is a concern, will the hours and payment meet your needs? How many kids will you be taking care of? What are their ages? The amount of care needed differs with age. Do the kids have any special needs? Special diets? Does the family have pets? A pool? What are the hours you're expected to work? What are you allowed to do in the home (e.g., use their computer, help yourself to food and snacks or bring your own)? If you have your license, are you expected to drive the kids?"
