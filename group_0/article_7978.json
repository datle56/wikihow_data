Most tags on furniture contain codes in the washing instructions. “W” means you should only use water-based solutions. “S” means the fiber can only tolerate solvent-based solutions. “S-W” allows you to use either solvent- or water-based solutions. If you see an “X,” however, you should only vacuum the material. [1] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 215 wikiHow readers how they prefer to clean polyester, and only 3% of them said a professional upholstery cleaner. [Take Poll] There are lots of simple DIY methods that can effectively clean polyester instead."

Move the cloth with the grain of the fabric. The cloth may be made of any absorbent material.

      "content": "Wash the pad in cold water. Always default to cold water, even if the tag doesn't specify a temperature or allows hot water.

      "title": "Tumble dry on a low setting.",
      "content": "Tumble dry on a low setting. Low heat will prevent shrinkage of the material or stretching of the elastic. Add two dryer balls (available in most big box stores) if the pad is larger than twin size. If you don't have dryer balls, use two tennis balls. This will prevent the pad from twisting into a ball shape and allow it to dry more thoroughly."
