      "title": "Have camera-ready hands.",
      "content": "Have camera-ready hands. Are your fingers long, your hands narrow? Do you have perfect cuticles and nicely-shaped nails? Small knuckles? Those are wonderful signs that you have good looking hands. Make sure you have a smooth, even complexion. Don't assume makeup will, well, make up for your imperfections. Birthmarks, freckles, moles, scars, crooked fingers, and irregularly shaped nails will severely limit your progress as a hand model. Pay special attention to your thumb; it'll play a huge role in many hand shots, so it needs to be good-looking. Here are some other things to consider: [1] X Research source Inspect the back of your hand. If you're a woman, it needs to be narrow. Though women are more often hand models than men, men can be hand models too. Just make sure you don't have hairy knuckles. Don't get discouraged, though. There are a number of different types of hand modeling looks such as beauty, mommy, product, and older hands. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Have steady hands.",
      "content": "Have steady hands. This is just as important as having nice-looking hands. Can you hold an object for an extended period of time without leaning on anything and without shaking? Any movement will translate into blurry pictures, so if you find that you can't keep your hands steady, modeling might not be the best use for them. Shooting TV commercials or ads for your hands can take several hours. A 30-second spot can take upwards of 12 hours to shoot and you have to be ready at all times and prepared to do take after take of small actions."

      "title": "Have patience.",
      "content": "Have patience. If you want to be a hand model, then you have to prepare to hold your hands in the exact same position for hours on end. This means that you have to deal well with boredom and have really, really steady hands. If you're addicted to caffeine or chocolate, you may have to curb your addiction, because these things will only make your hands shake more. You can even practice holding your hands steady for long periods of time so you'll be more comfortable when the time comes. Patience and the ability to always hit your mark can be the most important thing. Once the camera and lights are set, you have to be able to set the product down in the exact same place over and over."

      "title": "Create a portfolio.",
      "content": "Create a portfolio. If you have the money to spare for a portfolio for your hands, then find a photographer you trust to get you started. If you find a photographer who is just starting out too, then they may work with you for a small price, or no price at all, since you'll be helping them build their portfolio too. Make sure you get a professional manicure before you take those photos. Here are some other things to consider as you put your portfolio together: Learn common hand poses. Study magazine ads and commercials to see how hands pose and move. Mimic those poses and movements for your portfolio. Include at least one photo showing your face so that if they need a shot that includes someone's face, they'll consider you (and also so they can recognize you when they meet you). [3] X Research source Include a straight on shot of the back of your hands and the palms of your hands."

      "title": "Send your portfolio to reputable modeling agencies.",
      "content": "Send your portfolio to reputable modeling agencies. Tell them that your are specifically interested in hand modeling and request an interview. Some agencies may have a separate department for hand modeling, or some agencies will be parts agencies specifically. Tell them that you have a portfolio and if they ask whether it's professional, be honest but specify that they simulate professional ads. Be politely persistent until you get an interview."

      "title": "Sign with an agent.",
      "content": "Sign with an agent. If an agent thinks your hands have the look they want, then congratulations! You have made it through a tough hurdle on the hand modeling trajectory. Once you've got the offer from the agent, however, you have to make sure that it's the right for you. First of all, the agent has to be legitimate. A legitimate agent won't charge for money up front and will only get paid if you get paid. Agents typically receive a percentage of your pay, so they are motivated to find you work. Make sure to meet the agent or speak to them at length before you make a decision. Look good for the meeting with the agent. Even though you're modeling your hands, you still want to give off a professional impression, and that means looking neat and nice. They might send you out on calls (more interviews) eventually, and they'll want you to represent them well. If all goes well, they'll send you to do test shots with a local photographer to see if you've got what it takes. Once you've met with the agent and have gotten a positive vibe from them, as well as proof of the agent's legitimacy (names and samples of the work of other clients, for example), then carefully study the contract you are given and sign it when you're ready."

      "title": "Go to go-sees to find work.",
      "content": "Go to go-sees to find work. Once you've signed with the agent, they will provide you with some places to go to look for work. These are called go-sees, just like in the world of traditional modeling. You will have to go from place to place, show off your hands, and see if you've got what they're looking for. Your agent won't be able to say, \"Hey, I found you a great gig\" -- they can get you to the gig, but you'll still have to work for it. Once you've found some work, you'll be able to add it to your resume. And the more experience you have, the more luck you'll have in future go-sees. Be persistent. You may have to go to a number of go-sees before you find work. But if your agent thinks you've got the look, then you should be able to find work eventually."

Sure, if you're a top hand model, you'll be making enough to live on, but most hand models do the work to supplement their income, or even for the fun experience.

But if you're really serious about the work you do, then you should move to a big media city to have an edge. You shouldn't drop everything and move hundreds of miles away to a big city before you even take your portfolio shots, but if you've already gotten some gigs and want more opportunities to grow in your career, then consider moving to one of the following cities: New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Atlanta, San Francisco, or Chicago.

Even if you're holding a book or a cutting board, you should treat it like it's the most delicate object in the world if you want to succeed. You should treat every item gingerly and with the utmost caution. This will make the object look even more desirable and special in the photographs or advertisements. If you grip anything too hard, then your hands won't look as delicate, either. [8] X Research source"

You may have to hold a book open for hours, or even lie on your back holding a camera for a long stretch of time. You should be flexible and be prepared to hold your hands in unusual positions for a number of hours. This may get exhausting and will require you to have both mental and physical strength, but it will lead to some unbelievable photos."

This will lead you to meet celebrities, directors, and other interesting people.
