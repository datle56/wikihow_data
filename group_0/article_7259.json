      "content": "Find the vehicle identification number (VIN). Every car has a VIN, which you should check so that you can perform a search. The VIN is made up of 17 characters and is like the car’s Social Security Number. Don’t just accept whatever VIN the seller gives you. Instead, thoroughly inspect the vehicle yourself to find the VIN.

Also check for scratches, tears, or gouge marks. Also run your fingers over the VIN label. It should be smooth to the touch. If it is scratchy, then it may have been tampered with. The VIN label should not be obscured with a screw or plug. If so, the owner might be trying to hide the VIN."

      "content": "Perform a title search. [8] X Research source You can perform a title search by contacting your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or an equivalent office and provide the car’s VIN. The report should list whether the car was ever salvaged or declared as a total loss by an insurance company. [9] X Research source It costs money to run a title search, so contact the DMV ahead of time to check the price and acceptable methods of payment.

Make sure the VIN on the service records matches the VIN on the car. If not, then the car has probably been stolen.

They also probably don’t have a fixed address, either. [13] X Research source When you go to look at the car, ask the seller where they live and work. If they hesitate, then you may be buying a stolen car."
