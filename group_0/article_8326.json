      "content": "Ideally, yes. Clean and gut fish as soon as possible after catching them. If you don’t want to gut a fish right after catching it because you want to keep fishing, the best thing to do is keep it alive by putting it into a bucket of water until you’re ready to clean and gut it. Alternatively, you can bleed the fish and store it on ice in a cooler for 24-48 hours before gutting it. [1] X Research source If you don’t keep a fish alive in water or put it on ice, it can spoil in 2 hours or less, depending on how warm it is outside. You can also use a fish stringer or a fishing net cage to keep fish alive in the water while you continue fishing. If you happen to be ice fishing, you can bleed the fish you catch and just store them right on top of the ice until you’re ready to gut them!"

      "title": "Because the entrails can cause the fish to spoil if you leave them too long.",
      "content": "Because the entrails can cause the fish to spoil if you leave them too long. Even after a fish is dead, there is enzyme activity inside its guts that cause tissues to break down, which can lead to off-putting flavors and aromas or make you sick. In other words, removing the guts as soon as possible keeps the fish fresher and preserves the quality and taste of the flesh. [2] X Research source Keeping an intact fish cool slows down the enzyme activity inside it, giving you a longer window of time to gut it before it goes bad."

      "title": "Start by cutting a shallow incision from the anus up towards the head.",
      "content": "Start by cutting a shallow incision from the anus up towards the head. The small hole on the belly of the fish, back near the tail, is the anus. Using a sharp fillet knife, make a shallow cut from here along the belly of the fish, stopping at the base of the gills. [3] X Expert Source Michael Reynolds Professional Fishing Instructor Expert Interview. 26 February 2021. Don't jam the knife all the way inside the fish or you can cut the intestines open. You want a shallow cut so that you can pull them out intact, preventing messy (and unappetizing) spillage. [4] X Research source The process for gutting a fish is the same for any size or type of fish. If you want to gut fish in the wild, bring a sharp fillet knife with you and a bucket to work over and dump the guts into. If you’re gutting fish at home, work on a clean work surface, such as a cutting board."

      "content": "Use your fingers or a dull spoon to scoop out the fish's innards. Get in there and get everything out. These gummy, long guts should come out without much of a fight. Make sure to check inside to get out anything you missed, like a large, dark kidney that some fish have in the back or some strands of innards along the walls. [5] X Expert Source Michael Reynolds Professional Fishing Instructor Expert Interview. 26 February 2021. Don’t leave anything inside the fish. Pull out everything from inside until you only see flesh. It’s up to you whether or not to cut off the head. If you want to cook the fish whole, leave the head on. If you want to fillet the fish, chop it off right below the gills. If you want to remove the dorsal fin, simply grip the fin tightly near the tail and pull quickly in the direction of the head to rip it out cleanly."

      "content": "Finish by rinsing out the inside of the fish with a stream of water. Spread open the cavity and hold it under a stream of cool, running water. Rinse it out thoroughly to remove any remaining residue from the guts. [6] X Research source Rinsing the inside of the fish very well gets rid of strong, oily flavors that the entrails can leave behind. Be really careful when handling the fish because some fish have particularly sharp fins and/or teeth that could cut your hands. If you’re cleaning a fish out in the wild, you can rinse it out in a clean creek or river. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after you’re done cleaning and handling the fish."

      "title": "Dispose of them like regular household waste.",
      "content": "Dispose of them like regular household waste. If you’re gutting a fish out in the wild and not at home, pack the guts out with you in a tightly closed plastic bag or a sealable container of some type. Toss the guts into your trash can at home. In small quantities, it’s sometimes okay to toss fish guts back into deep or running water so other fish can feed on them. However, this is illegal in some areas, so make sure to look up local regulations on your local fish and wildlife service’s website. To prevent your trash from smelling like rotten fish, seal the fish guts in a zip-top plastic bag and put them in your freezer until it’s trash day."

      "title": "Scrape the scales off with the back of a knife.",
      "content": "Scrape the scales off with the back of a knife. Hold the fish firmly by the tail with your non-dominant hand. Starting at the tail, scrape the back of the knife along the whole length of the fish until you reach the head. Repeat this until all the scales flake off, then do it again on the other side of the fish. Wash the fish thoroughly when you’re done removing the scales. [7] X Research source You can also scrape scales off with a spoon or another dull utensil that won’t cut into the fish. It can help to scale under running water, or simply underwater in the sink, to prevent a mess. Don't worry if you miss a few scales—they aren't tasty, but they won't hurt anyone."

      "title": "Skin thick-skinned fish instead of removing the scales.",
      "content": "Skin thick-skinned fish instead of removing the scales. If you’re cleaning something like a bullhead, a catfish, or another thick-skinned bottom feeder, Skin it. To do so, cut a 1 in (2.5 cm) notch right where the top of the fish's head meets its body. Then, gripping the fish from the head, peel the skin back to the tail. Rinse the flesh thoroughly when you’re done. [8] X Research source These types of fish, in particular, have a thick, unappealing skin that most people remove before cooking. You can use a pair of catfish pliers to peel the skin off more easily."
