Set any remaining solution aside; you may need to use more of it. [3] X Research source If there's some sort of grease stuck in the trays, you can also spray some degreaser and let it sit for a couple of minutes. Another option is to spray an all-purpose disinfectant."

      "title": "Place an open box of baking soda in your freezer.",
      "content": "Place an open box of baking soda in your freezer. Ice trays (and the ice inside them) absorb odors from other items in your freezer over time. This often results in bad-tasting ice cubes. An open box of baking soda will soak up odors in your freezer and drastically reduce what your ice trays absorb. Replace the backing soda with a new box every 30 days for best results. Make sure all of the food in your freezer is packaged tightly to reduce odors."
