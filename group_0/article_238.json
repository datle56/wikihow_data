  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Spend time on your hobbies.",
      "content": "Spend time on your hobbies. Throw yourself into the things you enjoy doing to keep your mind off your crush. If you used to spend a lot of time thinking about the object of your affections, reclaim that time by putting it towards a new project, a good book, or a series on Netflix that you’ve been meaning to watch. If you previously dropped some of your hobbies because you were distracted by your crush, picking them up again is a great way to move on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Meet new people.",
      "content": "Meet new people. Instead of pining over someone who isn’t interested in you, mix it up with some new people who will appreciate how great you are. You don’t have to go looking for another crush just yet, but don’t be shy about reaching out to all kinds of people and making new friends. [1] X Research source School, extracurricular activities, community clubs, and volunteer work are all good ways to meet people."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try something that is completely different.",
      "content": "Try something that is completely different. Expand your horizons and take your mind off the past by challenging yourself. If you’ve always wanted to do something but never worked up the nerve, there’s a no better time than right now to give it a try. [2] X Research source For example, you could audition for a play, take a solo trip, or apply for a new job."
    },
    {
      "title": "Respect your crush’s boundaries.",
      "content": "Respect your crush’s boundaries. Don’t try to change your crush’s mind or prove to them how great you are. This might get on their nerves, and worse, it will make you feel a little pathetic. Save your energy for someone who likes you, and leave your crush alone. [3] X Research source Remember that there are many reasons your crush might not be interested in you. Maybe they’ve liked someone else for a long time, or maybe they like you as a friend but don’t think you’d be a compatible couple. It doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Explain that you need some time to recover.",
      "content": "Explain that you need some time to recover. If you are friends with your crush, it’s normal to feel a little awkward around them after getting rejected. Let them know that you need some time away from them to get over your feelings. If they are a good friend, they’ll understand and respect your wishes. If you aren’t really friends with your crush, you don’t need to explain to them that you’re taking some time away from them. In fact, it’s probably better if you don’t."
    },
    {
      "title": "Unfollow or block your crush on social media.",
      "content": "Unfollow or block your crush on social media. Resist the urge to stalk your crush online by unfriending or unfollowing them on the social media platforms you use. If you’re worried about caving in and re-following them later, block them. [4] X Research source You can always re-add them in the future, once you’re over your feelings."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stay away from places you think your crush may be.",
      "content": "Stay away from places you think your crush may be. Don’t try to get a glimpse of your crush in the hallway at school or in the break room at work, no matter how tempting the idea may be. Put as much distance as you can between yourself and them. If you have to see your crush every day, try to sit far away from them and avoid conversation. [5] X Research source Be polite. It’s okay to say hello if you happen to see your crush, but don’t linger or try to start a conversation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid asking your friends about your crush.",
      "content": "Avoid asking your friends about your crush. If you and your crush have mutual friends, let them know that you’re trying to get over some feelings, and ask them not to talk about your crush around you for a while. Don’t ask what your crush is up to or whether they’re dating anybody since this might re-ignite your old emotions."

    {
      "title": "Avoid entertainment that reminds you of your crush.",
      "content": "Avoid entertainment that reminds you of your crush. Music, movies, and books can all be helpful in getting over an unrequited flame, but stay away from entertainment that helps you wallow in your feelings. If certain media makes you think about your crush, cut it out for a while and replace it with something that isn’t so emotionally loaded. Try indulging in escapism for a while. Look for novels and TV shows that transport you to worlds very different from your everyday life."
    },
    {
      "title": "Accept your feelings.",
      "content": "Accept your feelings. Admit to yourself that you’re feeling bad about getting turned down. There’s nothing wrong with liking someone, and rejection is something almost everyone has experienced at some point. The sooner you come to terms with your feelings, the sooner you can heal from them and move on. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Grieve the loss of the potential relationship.",
      "content": "Grieve the loss of the potential relationship. Even though you were not in a relationship with this person, in your mind, it may feel like you “lost” someone. Allow yourself time and space to grieve properly, then it will be easier to move on. Having a crush is like having a one-sided imaginary relationship. In your mind, you develop an attachment to another person that is not reciprocated. You will need time and space to break that attachment. Reader Poll: We asked 896 wikiHow readers what’s the longest a crush has lasted for them, and 60% of them said over a year. [Take Poll] It’s okay if you don’t get over your crush quickly. These things take time, and it’s okay to feel sad."

    {
      "title": "Find support.",
      "content": "Find support. Seek out the company of people who value you, like your friends and family. It’s okay to cry or talk your problems through with them, especially at first, but try to have some fun with your loved ones too. A day out with your pals or a visit with extended family can do wonders for your mood and self-esteem. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Make a list of your good qualities.",
      "content": "Make a list of your good qualities. Sit down with pen and paper, and spend a few minutes brainstorming all the reasons someone would be lucky to be with you. Include overall positive traits like kindness, as well as little quirks like always remembering someone’s favorite foods. Save your list so you can look at it when you feel down about yourself.

    {
      "title": "Think about your crush’s negative traits.",
      "content": "Think about your crush’s negative traits. Nobody’s perfect, and your previously rosy view of your crush might have hidden their bad qualities. Now that you have a bit more distance from them, think of everything that bothers you about your crush, from their weird laugh to their inability to remember your name. You’ll be feeling less love-struck in no time."

      "title": "Express yourself creatively.",
      "content": "Express yourself creatively. Channel your feelings into your writing, drawing, music, or any other kind of art you like to make. You can show other people your finished work, or keep it private – it’s up to you. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Practice good self-care.",
      "content": "Practice good self-care. Your heart and ego are probably feeling a little bruised, so be gentle with yourself as you recover. Cut yourself a bit of slack at school or work. Instead of burying your sadness with endless movie-and-takeout sessions, do your best to eat well and get some exercise, and treat yourself to things that make you feel good about yourself. [10] X Research source For instance, you could spend an afternoon at your favorite coffee shop or get a new haircut that you love."
