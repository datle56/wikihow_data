      "content": "Do cone exercises to increase your speed and agility. Set up 6 rows that are 3 ft (0.91 m) long using 3 cones each. Space each row so they’re 2 ft (0.61 m) apart. Stay in a crouched position and shuffle your feet side to side between the rows. Go through the rows as fast as you can to build agility . After the last row, sprint forward 10 feet (3.0 m) to work on explosive speed. [1] X Research source Do at least 10-12 reps of the exercise. To build hip strength, use resistance bands around your thighs for 6-8 of the reps. Agility is an important skill for football players so they can travel with the ball and avoid getting tackled."
