Write the base of the destination system (in our case, \"2\" for binary) as the divisor outside the curve of the division symbol. [2] X Research source This method is much easier to understand when visualized on paper, and is much easier for beginners, as it relies only on division by two. To avoid confusion before and after conversion, write the number of the base system that you are working with as a subscript of each number. In this case, the decimal number will have a subscript of 10 and the binary equivalent will have a subscript of 2."

This is the binary equivalent of the decimal number 156. Or, written with base subscripts: 156 10 = 10011100 2 [5] X Research source This method can be modified to convert from decimal to any base. The divisor is 2 because the desired destination is base 2 (binary). If the desired destination is a different base, replace the 2 in the method with the desired base. For example, if the desired destination is base 9, replace the 2 with 9. The final result will then be in the desired base."

Using your new number (28), move down the chart marking how many times each power of 2 can fit into your dividend. 64 does not go into 28, so write a 0 beneath that box for the next binary digit to the right.
