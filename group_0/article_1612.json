      "title": "Determine which program is right for you.",
      "content": "Determine which program is right for you. Three Florida programs offer assistance in buying food for residents. Figure out which one best suits your needs. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) helps low-income households purchase healthy food. This is the default food assistance program. SUNCAP provides food assistance for individuals who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI). If you already receive SSI, you may be eligible for SUNCAP benefits without additional paperwork or applications. Food for Florida provides help for people affected by disasters. Food for Florida is not always in effect, and is only available to people living in an active disaster area. Recipients must not currently receive assistance from the Food Assistance program or SUNCAP."

      "title": "Find out if you meet the income guidelines.",
      "content": "Find out if you meet the income guidelines. To be eligible for SNAP, most households must not exceed a gross income limit, which is equal to 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). For example, a household of two cannot make more than $2,622 per month. A household of three cannot make more than $3,300 per month. A household of four cannot make more than $3,976. For each additional person in the household, add $678 to this maximum monthly income. If a member of your household is disqualified from receiving food assistance benefits, you are required to meet a gross income limit less than or equal to 130 percent of the FPL. That is, for a household of two, you must now make $1,705 a month or lower. All households with a disqualified member must have a net income of 100 percent the FPL or lower -- that's a monthly income of $1,311 for a household of two, with $339 added for each person. A household member is disqualified if he/she was convicted of drug trafficking, ran away from a felony warrant, intentionally violated the SNAP rules in the past, or does not have the required citizenship or non-student status."

      "title": "Figure out your deductions.",
      "content": "Figure out your deductions. If your monthly income exceeds the poverty guidelines, you may still qualify. Certain expenditures can be deducted from your monthly income. The following expenses can be deducted: Child care. Training for work or expenses in looking for work. Medicare expenses. Child support payments. A portion of shelter and utility costs."

    {
      "title": "Know your assets.",
      "content": "Know your assets. There is also a limit to the value of the assets you possess. The limit is $3,250 for households with an elderly or disabled person. For households with a disqualified member, the asset limit is reduced to $2,250. However, some property is excluded from the calculation of assets. Those things are: Home and surrounding property. Household goods and personal effects. Burial plots. Life insurance policies. Vehicles."

      "title": "Gather your information.",
      "content": "Gather your information. To complete the online application for food assistance, collect documentation pertaining to household income; bills, including utilities and rent; medical bills; proof of child care costs; wage and employment information; and bank statements. All of this information will go into your application; it'll be easiest if you have it all organized now. All U.S. citizens must provide proof of U.S. citizenship and identity. Non-citizens are ineligible for food assistance unless they meet certain criteria. Lawfully admitted permanent residents, refugees, and those who have been granted asylum may apply. You must be able to provide a Social Security Number for each person who is applying for food stamp benefits, or proof that each person has applied for an SSN. To receive food stamps in Florida, you must be a Florida resident. The easiest way to demonstrate Florida residency is to show a valid Florida Driver's License or Florida-issued non-driver's photo ID."

      "content": "Use your access code to check your claim status periodically. The approval process can take up to 30 days to determine eligibility of benefits. You will be notified once the process is complete. Some Florida food assistance applications can be approved or denied in as little as two weeks, but don't be alarmed if it takes the full 30 days. You may qualify for expedited benefits. These are for the truly needy and are available after seven days. You will be asked a series of questions at the time of application for SNAP benefits to see if you qualify for expedited benefits. You generally will qualify for expedited benefits if the monthly, pre-tax income for your household is less than $150 or if your household has less than $100 in the bank. You also qualify if your monthly rent or mortgage payment, when combined with your utilities, exceeds your monthly pre-tax income and savings. For example, if your rent is $800 a month and your monthly utilities are $300, then you could qualify for expedited benefits if your combined pre-tax income and savings is less than $1,100."
