      "content": "Understand the United States court system. In order to understand what type of records you will need to look for, you must first understand how the judicial system is set up in the United States. There is a hierarchy of courts at the state and federal level, with overlaps in certain places. At the federal level, at the top of the hierarchy is the United States Supreme Court, which is then followed by appellate courts and trial courts. [1] X Trustworthy Source United States Department of Justice Official website of the U.S. Department of Justice Go to source Both appellate courts and trial courts are divided into geographic based jurisdictions. [2] X Trustworthy Source United States Department of Justice Official website of the U.S. Department of Justice Go to source At the appellate level, these jurisdictions are known as “circuits” while federal trial courts are known as “districts. ” [3] X Trustworthy Source United States Department of Justice Official website of the U.S. Department of Justice Go to source There are also several federal courts with jurisdiction over a specific subject matter (e.g., bankruptcy courts and courts of international trade). Similar to the organization of federal courts, at the top of the state court hierarchy is the state supreme court, which is then followed by the appellate courts and trial courts. Depending on your state, trial courts may be called \"circuit courts,\" \"superior courts,\" or even something else. State appellate courts will often be called \"courts of appeal.\" Be aware of how your state designates its different courts. At some points in the judicial process, there is a possibility for overlap between the state and federal systems. For example, a case may be heard in front of both a state supreme court and the federal Supreme Court under certain circumstances. Be aware of this when you begin searching for court records. Look at these websites to learn about the names of all the federal and state courts."

      "title": "Assess the documentation you have.",
      "content": "Assess the documentation you have. When deciding whether you need to search for state or federal court records, start by analyzing the documents you have in your possession. Different documents will have different information on them, so look for documents with the most identifying information about your case or situation. Typically, documents include information indicating the type of court (i.e., criminal or civil), the location of the court (i.e., federal, state, county, or municipal), and the specific designation of the court (i.e., California District Court of Appeals). For example, a criminal citation (a written form given to someone by a law enforcement officer in response to an alleged illegal act) will usually have information about the types of charges being brought against a person and will provide you with a court name and location where the person is required to report. By looking at this, you can get an idea of what type of law is involved and what court is going to be hearing the case. This should allow you to decide whether you are in state or federal court. On the other hand, a document like a complaint (a court filing that states the issues in controversy in a given case) is going to have a cover sheet that includes the title of the exact court in which the complaint was filed. For instance, a complaint's cover sheet may be titled \"In the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.\" This gives you all the information you need in order to determine that you are in federal court."

      "title": "Determine the subject matter of your issue.",
      "content": "Determine the subject matter of your issue. Think about what you are looking for and decide what type of law it involves. This can be helpful because certain legal subjects are either predominantly state law or federal law, depending on the subject. For instance, contract law and family law are generally governed by state laws and not federal laws. If your research topic deals with one of these subjects, you will likely want to look in a state database. On the other hand, bankruptcy law, maritime law, and constitutional law are generally governed by federal laws and not state laws. If your research topic deals with one of these subjects, you will likely want to search in a federal database. Be aware that these are general rules and they do have their qualifications. There are situations in which federal courts can hear state law issues and state law courts can hear federal law issues."
