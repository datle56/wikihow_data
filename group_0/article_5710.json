      "content": "Yes, you can absolutely meditate while lying down. Meditation is all about training your mind, and you can do it in any position, including in bed or lying on the floor. If you're new to meditation, lying down may be more comfortable for you and help you relax. It's easy to fall asleep while meditating lying down, so if sleep isn't your goal, use a guided meditation or concentrate on a focal point to keep awake. Lying down is also more beneficial—and sometimes necessary—for people suffering from back pain or exhaustion."
