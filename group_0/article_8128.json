      "content": "Spray all-purpose cleaner on the trim if there's a thick layer of wax. If you accidentally wiped wax onto trim, it's usually a pretty thin layer. However, if you've found patches of thick wax that might be tricky to remove, spray them with an all-purpose cleaner and let it sit for about 5 minutes before you scrub the wax off. [1] X Research source The cleaner helps break down the wax so it's easier to remove with the toothbrush and eraser. If the wax is in a thin layer, you can skip this step."

      "content": "Rub a toothbrush in the crease between the trim and paintwork. Wax can get stuck in this very narrow crease so take an old toothbrush and brush it in the space. There's no need to put anything on the brush since you're just trying to lift the wax. [2] X Research source Choose a toothbrush that has soft bristles that won't damage your paintwork. If you sprayed the trim with all-purpose cleaner, dry it off with a soft cloth once you finish using the toothbrush."

      "content": "Scrub a regular vinyl or rubber eraser on the wax to remove it. You probably already own one of the best tools for getting wax off of your car's trim. Get out a vinyl or rubber eraser and rub it back and forth on the trim so it pulls the wax off. Press firmly to lift the wax that's deep in the trim. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Wipe the trim with a dry microfiber cloth to get rid of the eraser shavings. Once you've erased the trim and don't see white wax, take a clean microfiber cloth and brush it over the trim. Keep wiping until you've gotten rid of the eraser shavings. [4] X Research source Microfiber cloth does a great job of catching all the dust, wax, and shavings so you get them completely off of the trim."

      "content": "Buy a wax removal product at your local auto parts store. If the toothbrush and eraser didn't take off the wax, look for a product that's designed to clean wax and dirt from your car's plastic trim. Most of these come in a spray bottle so they're easy to apply. [5] X Research source Choose a product that's not oil-based since oil won't penetrate the wax. Instead, look for something that contains a solvent, such as mineral spirits, which will break down the wax."

      "content": "Spray the remover carefully onto the wax-coated trim. If you're going to be cleaning all of your car's trim, work on 1 side or area at a time so the cleanser doesn't drip off or dry before you can scrub it. [6] X Research source You can also use this method to spot-clean the trim if you notice dirt or grime buildup. If you accidentally get the remover on your car's paint, wipe the product off with a wet cloth. The longer the product stays on the paint, the harder it may be to remove."

If your product didn't come with one, use any small bristle brush like an old toothbrush. Then, scrub the brush back and forth across the trim so the product lifts the wax. Work the toothbrush into the crease to remove trapped wax. [7] X Research source"
