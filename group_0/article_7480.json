      "content": "Share a church-specific joke with your congregation. As a church leader, it never hurts to inject a little humor into your sermon. Start Sunday morning by telling a Christian joke or funny story that will resonate with people of the same faith. A stranger asked the pastor to pray for their hearing. He put his hands on their ears and prayed. Then, he asked if their hearing was better. The stranger told him they wouldn’t know until Monday when they went to court and appeared before the judge! A Sunday school teacher asked a child, “Why do we have to be quiet in church?” The child replied, “Because people are sleeping.” A pastor received a complaint letter from a member of his congregation. He removed the letter from the envelope. There was one word on it: “Fool!” “Hmm,” the pastor said, “they signed the letter, but what’s the complaint?” A person was stranded on an island for years before being rescued. Their rescuers noticed they had built three huts. “One was my house, and one was my church,” the person told them. They asked what the third hut was for. “That was my old church, before I changed denominations.” Why were the birds upset? The pastor gave the church’s nest egg away to the poor. At Sunday school, a teacher told their students about the commandment to honor your father and mother. Then they asked, “Is there a commandment that teaches us how to treat our brothers and sisters?” An eager student answered: “Thou shall not kill.” A child was in church with their mother when they started to feel sick. “Can we leave now?” They asked. “No,” their mother said. “But I’m going to throw up,” the child insisted. Their mother told them to go throw up outside behind a bush. The child left and returned a few moments later. “How did you go outside so fast?” their mother asked. “I didn’t have to go outside,” the child said. “There’s a box in the lobby that says ‘For The Sick.’” What do you get when you cross the Easter Bunny and a stressed-out pastor? An Easter basket case. A child was late to Sunday school for the first time. The teacher asked them if anything was wrong. “No,” the child said, “I wanted to go fishing, but my dad told me I needed to go to church.” The teacher was impressed. They asked the child if the father had explained why it was important to go to church instead of going fishing. “Yes, ma’am,” the child said. “It’s because there’s not enough bait for the both of us.” On Sunday, a mother woke up her son and told him it was time to go to church. “I’m not going to church today,” he said. “Why not?” she asked. He said, “Two reasons. The people there don’t like me and I don’t like them.” She replied, “I’ll give you two better reasons why you should go. First, you’re sixty years old. Second, you’re the pastor!” A pastor wanted to skip church. They told their assistant they were sick. Then they drove to a golf course in another town where no one would see them. They teed off at the first hole and a huge gust of wind came, pushing the ball across the green for a hole in one. In Heaven, an angel asked God, “Why did you move the ball?” God smiled and replied, “Who’s he going to tell?” A woman told her pastor, “I’m so sorry my husband walked out of your sermon.” “It did confuse me,” the pastor replied. “He meant no disrespect,” she said. “He’s been sleepwalking ever since he was a child.” A pastor was repainting their church. They started to run out of paint, so they decided to add some paint thinner to the can. They continued painting, but noticed the thinned paint looked different. They wondered aloud what to do. A voice came from the sky and said, “Repaint and thin no more!” (Repent and sin no more!)"
