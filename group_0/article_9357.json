      "content": "Cut a piece of watercolor paper into a square. Tear off a piece of watercolor paper, which is sturdy enough to withstand watercolor and acrylic paint. Measure the size of your paper and use a ruler to cut it into a square if it's a rectangle. For example, if your paper is 12 by 16 inches (30 cm × 41 cm), cut it down to 12 by 12 inches (30 cm × 30 cm). [1] X Research source If you can't find watercolor paper, use paper that's designed to withstand paint, such as canvas paper."

      "content": "Make a dot in the center of the paper. Lay a ruler horizontally on the center of the square and make a small mark in the middle using a pencil. Then, turn the ruler vertically so it's lined up with your mark and make a small dot in the center. [2] X Research source The small dot will be the center of your color wheel."

      "title": "Use a compass",
      "content": "Use a compass to make a small circle 2 1 ⁄ 2 inches (6.4 cm) away from the center. Attach a pencil to a drawing compass and stick the other leg of the compass on the center dot. Extend the pencil leg of the compass so it's about 2 1 ⁄ 2 inches (6.4 cm) from the dot. Then, slowly rotate the compass to make a small circle. [3] X Research source If you don't have a drawing compass or don't need your color wheel to be precise, you can draw the circle freehand."

      "content": "Make another circle that's 5 1 ⁄ 2 inches (14 cm) from the center dot. To create another row for your color wheel, make a slightly larger circle beyond the small one you just made. Adjust your compass so it's 5 1 ⁄ 2 inches (14 cm) from the dot and rotate it to make a circle. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Draw the outer circle 8 1 ⁄ 2 inches (22 cm) from the center. Move the leg of your drawing compass so it extends 8 1 ⁄ 2 inches (22 cm) from the middle of the color wheel and draw the largest circle. [5] X Research source This will be the border for your color wheel. You should now have 3 rings for the color wheel that you'll divide into spaces."

      "content": "Write the numbers 1 through 12 clockwise around the outside of the wheel. Use your pencil to write 12 at the top of the outer ring and 6 near the bottom of the ring. Fill in the rest of the numbers so they're evenly spaced just like on a clock. [6] X Research source Writing the numbers will make it easier to evenly divide the wheel into triangular spaces."

Line up the other end of the ruler so it passes right between the 6 and 7. Then, use your pencil to draw a straight line through the center of the color wheel. [7] X Research source The line should go through the center dot you drew in the middle of the color wheel."

Then, draw another line across the wheel. Keep doing this until you've divided the wheel into 12 triangular spaces.

Move around the color wheel clockwise and list every color. To make a classic color wheel these colors should correspond with the numbers you wrote for the segments: [9] X Research source 12 - Yellow 1 - Yellow-green 2 - Green 3 - Blue-green 4 - Blue 5 - Blue-violet 6 - Violet 7 - Red-violet 8 - Red 9 - Red-orange 10 - Orange 11 - Yellow-orange"

Experienced painters might choose watercolor or oil paint, for instance, while kids or beginners might like acrylic or tempera paint.
