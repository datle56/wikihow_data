      "content": "Do push-ups to strengthen your triceps, shoulders , and chest. Push-ups are the bread and butter of home workouts. Make sure your form is good to get the most out of it. Your spine should be straight and in line with your bottom, which isn't sagging. Your palms are generally a little wider than your shoulders, but you can go wider for a better chest workout and narrower for a better arm workout. In addition, you should mix in incline and decline push-ups for better overall muscle growth. Incline push-ups work different muscle heads. To do them, simply plant your arms on a low coffee table or chair so that you're angled up. Decline push-ups require you to place your feet 1–2 feet (0.30–0.61 m) above your hands, then perform normal push-ups. Remember to keep your head up and spine straight. Each set should be eight to twelve reps. You might try doing up to three sets."

      "content": "Do handstands against the wall to build your shoulders and back. Not for the faint of heart, handstands are nonetheless a great multi-muscle workout. To get into position, crouch with your back to the wall. Plant your hands on the ground and \"walk\" your feet slowly up the wall. From there, use your toes for balance, and slowly lower your head to the ground, pushing back up to complete one rep. Try to get three sets of ten in. Once you have mastered two-handed handstands, aim to progress to one-hand handstands and no-hand handstands. Practice makes perfect! If you're too nervous for this, you can cheat with a high table. Place your feet on the table with your thighs and torso hanging over the edge, enough that you can place your hands on the ground. Then do a push-up with your head hanging straight down. This is often called a pike push-up."

      "content": "Do dips to work out your arms. For good dips, you'll need a sturdy bench, table, or chair roughly 1–2 feet (0.3–0.6 m) above the ground. Place your hands behind you on this bench so that your butt is in the air and your knees are bent 90 degrees. With your feet firmly on the ground, lower your butt to the ground until your arms are bent at roughly 90 degrees. Push back up. Repeat for three sets of up to 15-20 reps."

However, instead of placing your palms on the ground, rest on your forearms. Tighten your butt muscles and straighten your spine -- you should be able to rest a broom between your neck and butt. Hold this position for one minute, rest, and repeat two more times. [1] X Research source Side planks are when you open your body, resting on one forearm and the outside of the same foot. Again, keep your spine straight by focusing on keeping your butt up. Plank to Push-up: Start in a plank position with your arms shoulder width apart and your feet hip-width apart. Move down onto your forearms so that you are now in a forearm plank, then lift yourself back up to a full plank position. Do 12 reps in each set.

While most people don't equate building muscles with cardio, there is a variety of exercises you can string together to build lean, powerful leg muscles. Take 5-6 exercises and perform each one for 60 seconds. Rest for 30 seconds, then move on to the next one. After you finish all six exercises, rest for 4-5 minutes, then repeat 2-3 more times. Your legs will burn, but you'll quickly whip them into shape: Jumping jacks Lunges Burpees -- do a jumping jack, then drop into a push-up. Repeat. High Knees -- bouncing from toe to toe lift each knee as high as possible. You want to touch the floor as little as possible. Lateral Jumps -- jump to one side, landing on one foot, knee bent, then explode back and onto the other foot. Oblique twists Box jumps or simple plyometric workouts. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Push yourself so that the last 2-3 reps of every set are difficult, but not impossible. If you really want to gain muscle, you're going to need to push yourself. Your own body is the best indicator of your workout, so keep working the muscle until it is tired. You should be struggling slightly at the end of each set, and the last 2-3 exercises you do should require full concentration and effort. Make goals in advance. If you decide to do three sets of twenty ahead of time, you're more likely to finish the set while you're sweating. Then, if it is too easy, you can always add more. Pushing yourself is different from courting injury. If your joints, bones, or muscles hurt, as opposed to just feel sore or tired, you should stop and rest."
