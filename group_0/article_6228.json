      "title": "Gather your supplies.",
      "content": "Gather your supplies. You'll be doing a lot of walking while looking for Latias, so it's highly recommended that you stock up on Max Repels. These items will keep wild Pokémon from attacking if they are lower-level than your lead Pokémon. If you've already used your Master Ball, you'll need lots of Ultra Balls."

      "title": "Get the right Pokémon to lead your party.",
      "content": "Get the right Pokémon to lead your party. Latias is incredibly fast, and will run at the first opportunity. You'll need a Pokémon that will be fast enough to act first, as well as have an ability that can keep Latias trapped. This isn't as important if you have a Master Ball. A Level 35-39 Wobbuffet is one of the most popular lead Pokémon due to its Shadow Tag ability. This will keep Latias from escaping, and you can swap out to one of your fighters. Another popular choice is a Level 39 Golbat with the Mean Look ability. The Golbat will usually be able to act first, and the Mean Look ability will keep Latias from running. Give your starting Pokémon the Quick Claw. This will increase the chances that you will have the first attack."

      "content": "Get a few Pokémon that can take Latias's health down. One of the best moves for lowering a Pokémon's health without knocking it out is False Swipe. This will damage the opposing Pokémon, but will not lower its health below 1. This makes the Pokémon much easier to capture. If you're using the Master Ball, you don't need to worry about lowering Latias's health."

      "content": "Trade with a friend for a boost (optional). If you have a friend with Latias, trade with them and then trade the Latias back. Adding Latias to your Pokédex will allow you to track it on the map, making it easier to find."

Latias appears at random around Hoenn, and changes locations every time you enter a building or move to a different area. You can speed up the hunt by finding a place that allows you to fight and change locations quickly. A popular spot is the tall grass outside of the Safari Zone."

      "content": "Use a Max Repel. If your lead Pokémon is Level 39, the Max Repel will keep all Pokémon Level 39 and lower from attacking you. Since Latias is Level 40, this increases the chances that you'll face Latias in a battle (if it's in the area). [1] X Research source"

If after that many encounters you still haven't seen Latias, there's a good chance that it's not in your area."

First, Latias's location will be shown on your map after you've encountered it once. Second, Latias will not regenerate health between fights, meaning if you lowered its health significantly the first time, you don't have to worry about doing it again."
