      "content": "Determine your wallpaper type. Figure out what kind of wallpaper you have on your walls. Vinyl wallpaper is not difficult to clean. Coated fabric wallpaper is sometimes covered with an acrylic or vinyl covering that is easily washable. Plain paper wallpaper should not get wet. If possible, you should spot-clean it. [1] X Research source You can scrub vinyl wallpaper, but you need to make sure that you don’t clean with anything abrasive. You wouldn’t want to use a rough sponge, for example. Clean walls that don’t have protective coating with a dry sponge. A dry sponge, which contains no moisture, gently gets rid of the dirt on your wallpaper."

      "content": "Clean the wallpaper. Mix a small amount of dish soap, about two table spoons worth, with warm water in a bucket. Use clear soap to avoid staining the wallpaper with colored detergent. Dip a soft cloth or sponge in the cleaning solution. Wring out the excess cleaner into the bucket. Test the cleaning solution by dabbing a bit of it on an inconspicuous area. If it doesn’t damage the wallpaper, start the cleaning process. Wipe the surface from the top to the bottom. Clean in the direction of the vertical seams. Clean one section at a time in a circular motion. Don’t overuse soap. Using a large amount of soap will make dirt stick to walls. You may not want to use scrubbing pads because they are usually too harsh for wallpaper Testing the cleaning solution in a small, hidden area prevents you from damaging the entire wall in case the cleaner turns out to be destructive. The surface near the baseboards is rarely noticeable to others, and is a good spot to test."

Don’t use too much water; you don’t want to end up with damp walls. With a terry-cloth towel, dry the surface immediately after to prevent the wallpaper from soaking up too much moisture and tearing."

      "content": "Use a vacuum cleaner. The most efficient method for removing dust from your walls is vacuuming. [2] X Research source Attach a wall brush extension to your vacuum before you start. Depending on the length of your extension, you may want to use a ladder to reach the higher spots of your wall. This extension will keep you from scratching your walls. Begin at the top of the wall and do a few sections at a time. Gently brush until you have completed the entire wall. As long as you don’t rub your vacuum on the wallpaper, you can generally use the vacuum on fabric wallpaper."
