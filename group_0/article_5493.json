The four-number cycle (0-5-3-1) of the Century Table repeats itself indefinitely, as shown in the table by the 0 for century 2000. So the value for the 3300s would be 5. This value for any century can instead be computed by multiplying 5 times the difference between the (2-digit) century and the highest multiple of 4 in it. For example, the 3400s would be 5 X (34-32) = 10 (and 10, when reduced by the 7s in it, equals 3). This formula could even be extended further to encompass and compute the entire Year value in one felled swoop, but that formula, at its simplest, would be too complicated to carry around in one’s head and then perform the calculation quickly and precisely, which are the goals of the process explained here. Note: This process can be used in reverse to find either the month, day, or year if any one of them is missing but the Day-of-the-Week is known.\""

Non-leap years will be referred to throughout the guide as “normal years.” The Gregorian calendar repeats exactly every 400 years. Note that the Gregorian calendar has been reformed in the past and that this algorithm only applies to the Gregorian calendar in its most recent state. For more information on this reform and its consequences for calculating the day of the week, refer to the “Julian calendar” section of the Wikipedia article entitled “Doomsday rule”: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule#Julian_calendar . In this guide, the notation “C.E.” and “B.C.E.” will be used. “C.E.” means “Common Era” and is equivalent to “A.D.” “B.C.E.” means “Before the Common Era” and is equivalent to “B.C.” For more information refer to the Wikipedia article entitled “Common Era”: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era . Think of C.E. years as positive and B.C.E. years as negative (but subtract one from them first). For example, think of 1670 C.E. as 1670, but think of 1540 B.C.E. as -1539. Note that there is no year 0 in the Gregorian calendar, so you must subtract 1 from 1540 before placing a negative sign in front of it. For a more detailed explanation, see the Wikipedia article entitled “Astronomical year numbering”: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_year_numbering . In this guide, the formats mm/dd and mm/dd/yy will be used to represent dates in a compact form. For example, 8/6 is equivalent to August 6th, 7/24/1670 is equivalent to July 24th, 1670 C.E., 12/6/534 is equivalent to December 6th, 534 C.E., and 10/23/-1889 is equivalent to October 23rd, 1890 B.C.E. Note that the algorithm is based heavily on the Doomsday Algorithm, which is easy-to-use (requiring only knowledge of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), requires very little memorization, and can be extraordinarily fast with practice. The Doomsday Algorithm was developed for many years by John Horton Conway [2] , a renowned mathematics professor at Princeton University, who took up day-of-the-week calculation as a hobby. At the time that he taught me the algorithm, he could calculate the day of the week in his head for ANY date on the Gregorian calendar in 3 seconds flat. Watch this performance by Arthur “Art” T. Benjamin [3] , the “Mathemagician” and a math professor at Harvey Mudd College, if you doubt that the algorithm can be performed this quickly: https://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/arthur_benjamin_does_mathemagic.html . The day-of-the-week calculation is one of his later “MathMagic” tricks. While some have never met anyone who is that fast after first learning the algorithm, you can drastically improve your speed with practice. The Doomsday Algorithm relies on a branch of mathematics known as modular arithmetic [4] . The algorithm only works for the Gregorian Calendar, but similar tricks could be developed for any calendar system. This guide does not assume a mathematical background; for those with more mathematical sophistication the Wikipedia article entitled “Doomsday rule” [5] and the Advanced Tricks for Greater Speed section of this guide would be more appropriate. There are lots of examples throughout the guide intended to clarify various aspects of the algorithm; feel free to skip them if you already understand the concepts they illustrate. All of the days of the week mentioned in the examples are correct, but you shouldn't worry if you don’t know how they were calculated while reading the guide for the first time. There is also some deliberate repetition to hammer in some of the subtler concepts that you may wish to skim over if you already understand them. [5] X Research source"

February has 28 days during a normal year and 29 days during a leap year. Leap day, that is, the day that only exists during a leap year is February 29. There is a useful mnemonic to distinguish between months with 31 days and fewer than 31 days. Hold out your right hand. Tap the knuckle of your index finger and say “January.” Tap the gap/dip/valley between the knuckles of your index and middle fingers and say “February.” You can remember that January has more days than February because your knuckle is taller than the gap. Next, tap the knuckle of your middle finger and say “March.” Notice as you continue that all of the months with 31 days are on knuckles, while all of the months with fewer days are in gaps. You’re probably wondering: “What do I do once I get to July?” because July is on the knuckle of your pinky. Just go back to the beginning; tap the knuckle of your index finger again and say “August.” Continue from here to get to the rest of the months."

      "content": "Days In any given year (even a leap year), “Doomsdays” are all on the same day of the week. Here are some easy-to-remember Doomsdays: 4/4, 8/8, 10/10, 12/12, 5/9, 9/5, 7/11, and 11/7. A mnemonic for the last four Doomsdays in the list is: “9 to 5 job at a 7-11 gas station.” For example, in the year 2000, April 4, June 6, July 11, and November 7 are all Tuesdays. (Important note: this does not mean that April 4, 2001, was also Tuesday. April 4, 2001, was a Wednesday.) You can add or subtract 7 from any Doomsday to get another Doomsday. For example, 5/9, 5/16, and 5/23 are all Doomsdays. You don’t have to just add or subtract 7 at a time though; you can use any multiple of 7. For example, 9/5 and 9/26 are both Doomsdays, because of 5+7*3 ≡ 26. Another easy-to-remember Doomsday is 3/0. No this is not a typo; 3/0 is simply another way of thinking about the last day of February. Unlike 2/28 or 2/29, 3/0 is always the last day of February, regardless of whether or not it is a leap year. The world can even think of months as having negative days. For example, 8/8 and 8/-6 are both Doomsdays. To convert 8/-6 into a normal date, simply add the number of days in the 7th month (July). Use the knuckle trick from the previous paragraph to determine that there are 31 days in July. So, 8/-6 is the same as 7/25, because -6+31 ≡ 25. We may also think of months as having days greater than 31. For example, 10/10 and 10/34 are both Doomsdays. To convert 10/34 into a normal date, simply subtract the number of days in the 10th month (October). Our knuckles tell us that October has 31 days, so 10/34 is 11/3 because 34-31 ≡ 3. We can even write June days as March days. For example, 6/6 and 6/-64 are Doomsdays. May (month 5) has 31 days, so 6/-64 ≡ 5/-33. April (month 4) has 30 days, so 5/-33 ≡ 4/-3. March (month 3) has 31 days, so 4/-3 ≡ 3/28. Thus, June -64th is equivalent to March 28th, which is a Doomsday. Be careful to account for leap years when using these tricks to determine Doomsdays in January or February. For example, in ANY year, 3/0 and 3/-14 are both Doomsdays, but in a leap year February has 29 days, so 3/-14 ≡ 2/15, while in a normal year February has 28 days, so 3/-14 ≡ 2/14. Thus, February 15th is a Doomsday during leap years, but February 14th is a Doomsday during normal years. You have to be careful when going from March to January as well. Leap year: 3/-42 ≡ 2/-13 ≡ 1/18; normal year: 3/-42 ≡ 2/-14 ≡ 1/17."

This is why Sunday is both 0 and 7. Monday could be thought of as -6, 8, 71, etc. Throughout the guide you will see (and have been seeing) congruence symbols, ≡, rather than equals signs, =, because 71 does NOT equal 8, but they are equivalent to determine the day of the week. While finding a day of the week we are only interested in the remainder when numbers are divided by 7. All of these congruences are thus “modulo 7,” abbreviated “mod 7.” Numbers are congruent modulo 7 if their remainders are the same when they are divided by 7. This is equivalent to the earlier point that you can add or subtract multiples of 7 as you wish. For example, 1 ≠ 8, but 1 ≡ 8 (mod 7). More examples of how modulo behave are -15 ≡ -1 ≡ 6 (mod 7) and 4 ≡ -3 ≡ 7004 (mod 7). The notation “(mod 7)” will be left off throughout the guide, because all congruences are assumed to be modulo 7. If you know that August 8, 1953, is a Saturday, then you can quickly determine that August 4, 1953, is a Tuesday, because four days before SIXAday is TWO’Sday. That is, 6-4 ≡ 2. Likewise, if you know that 9/5/1776 is a FOUR’Sday, then you can quickly see that 9/7/1776 is a SIXAday, because of 7-5 ≡ 2 and 4+2 ≡ 6. Remember that you can add or subtract any multiple of 7 to a Number-day. If you know that 10/10/-2543 is a SIXAday, then you can quickly determine that 10/2/-2543 is a FIVEday, because of 2-10 ≡ -8 ≡ -8+7 ≡ -1, and 6+(-1) ≡ 5. Once again, remember to watch out for leap years, like 18,400. If you know that 2/28/18,400 is a ONEday, then you can quickly determine that 3/3/18,400 is a FIVEday, because of 2/28/18,400 ≡ 3/-1/18,400 and 3-(-1) ≡ 4 and 1+4 ≡ 5."

If you subtracted 100 once, then the Century-day is Sunday; if twice, then it’s Friday; if thrice, then it’s Wednesday; if four or more times, then you messed up because one of every four Century-years is a Big Tuesday-year. For example, the Century-day of the 1800s is Friday, because you subtract 100 twice to get 1600, which is a Big Tuesday-year (because it’s divisible by 400). The pattern looks like this: 1600 ≡ TWO’Sday ≡ 2, 1700 ≡ Sunday ≡ 0, 1800 ≡ FIVEday ≡ 5 ≡ -2, 1900 ≡ THREE’Sday ≡ 3 ≡ -4, 2000 ≡ TWO’Sday ≡ 2 ≡ -5, and so on.

The “Dozen-day” of any given year is the Year-day of the Dozen-year. The Dozen-day can be calculated by adding the Century-day to the result of the division by 12. For example, the Dozen-year of 1234 is 1224, because of 1224-1200 ≡ 24 ≡ 12*2, and no larger years that are still less than or equal to 1234 yield a positive difference with 1200 that is divisible by 12.

For another example, we can calculate the Dozen-day of -1713. We first need to find the Century-day of the -1700s. Since we must subtract 100 three times from -1700 to arrive at a Big Tuesday-year, the Century-day is THREE’Sday. Next, we must find Dozen-year.

Subtract 4 from the Quad-year, 1640, until you get to the Dozen-year. Multiply the number of times you subtracted 4 by -2, and add this result to the Dozen-day to get the Quad-day.

For example, if the date were 9/5/1642, you would already know that it was a Friday. If the date were 6/20/1642, then you would subtract 7 days twice to discover that 6/20/1642 is the same day of the week as 6/6/1642, which is a known Doomsday. This means that 6/20/1642 is also a Doomsday, and is, therefore, a Friday."

We know 4/4/1642 is a Doomsday, so we add 14 days to discover that 4/18/1642 is a Doomsday. Now we know that 4/18/1642 is a FIVEday, so we simply add 2 days to find that 4/20/1642 is a SE’ENday. Don’t forget that the nearest known Doomsday may not be in the same month. For example, 3/29/1642 is closer to 4/4/1642 than to 3/0/1642. Since 4/4/1642 ≡ 4/-3/1642 ≡ 3/28/1642, we know that 3/29/1642 ≡ FIVEday + 1 ≡ SIXAday."
