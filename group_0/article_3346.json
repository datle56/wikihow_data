      "title": "Mine ores.",
      "content": "Mine ores. You will need to find at least 5 diamonds, 64 iron, and several stacks of coal. You will need seven diamonds if you want a sword, pickaxe and an enchantment table, and even more if you want armor. Although, if possible, netherite is best. This step could take a very long time."

Nether Wart can be found naturally occurring in nether fortresses in two small patches alongside stairs going upwards."

Just place it atop the bedrock pillar, get somewhere safe, and then try to sleep when the dragon comes close.
