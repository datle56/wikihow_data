The land lines in Vietnam are generally 7 digits long. Thus, you would dial, 011-84-(area code)-XXX-XXXX. If you are trying to reach a mobile phone number, you will have to dial a special cell phone number after you dial the country code, followed by the 7 digit cell phone number. These special numbers are based on the cell phone carrier the person is using. The numbers can be [2] X Research source : 91(Vinaphone,) 90 (MobiFone,) 98 (Viettel,) 95 (S-phone,) or 96 (EVN-Telecom.)"

It is important to keep in mind the difference in time zones because it would be rude to call someone at 3 AM. It will also cost you money, as you may be charged for placing an international call even if the person you are trying to reach doesn’t pick up. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider buying an international calling card. Prepaid phone cards are available online or at many local stores, and make calling Vietnam much easier. A phone card can help you keep track of exactly how much your phone call is costing, without the nasty shock of a huge phone bill later. Services like Yahoo Messenger (popular in VN) or Gmail will allow you to talk for free but the other person in VN must be online and using that service at the same time for it to work. Both parties need a headset/mic or something built-in the computer to listen/talk. When choosing a phone card to call Vietnam, check to see how increments are billed. Some phone cards round up to the next minute, while others can round up to every 3 minutes, making the cost of a 4 minute call and a 6 minute call the same."
