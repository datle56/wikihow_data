Phones and tablets may be used in airplane mode during the flight at any time as long as they are secure. If the device transmits and does not have an airplane mode, then it may not be used. Should your phone or tablet fall between seats, alert a cabin crew for assistance. Don't try to retrieve it yourself as you could injure yourself, or cause damage to the phone in which it could emit smoke or even a fire. Laptops and large tablets need to be stowed away under the seat in front of you (or underneath your seat) during taxi, takeoff, and landing. Power banks may or may not be used while in flight depending on airline regulations requirements. They must always be in carry on luggage, never checked in. Radio equipment, including remote control toys, FM/AM radio, and walkie-talkies, may not be used at any time during the flight, as well as any transmitting device that does not have an airplane mode."

Fasten your seatbelt, and pull the mask towards you to start the flow of oxygen. Slip the elastic band over your head, and tighten using the straps on either side of the mask. Do not worry if the plastic bag does not inflate, just breathe normally. Remember to put your mask on first, before assisting anyone else with theirs."

Some life vests are designed for young children and infants. Never inflate your life vest while you're inside the aircraft. The location of life vests can vary depending on the aircraft and travel class. Most aircraft will have the lift vest stored under the seat in economy class cabins, and beside the seat in first class and business class. On some aircraft, it may be stored in an overhead compartment above your seat."
