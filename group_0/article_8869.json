      "content": "Get some light-colored sand. You can buy sand in hardware stores, art stores, and in aquarium-supply stores. If you already have access to sand, you can use that instead, as long as it is light enough. Try to get the lightest color of sand you can find; white would be the best because it will allow the colors to show up better. You can use this method to tint sand at the beach and make brightly colored sandcastles with it."

      "content": "Divide the sand into plastic zippered bags. You will need one bag for each color of sand that you will be making. Leave enough room in each bag so that you can shake the sand. How much sand you put into each bag is up to you. Anywhere between ¼ and 1 cup (95 and 379 grams) will be plenty. [1] X Research source Consider dampening the sand with water. This will make it easier to mix the food coloring into it."

      "content": "Add a few drops of food coloring into each bag. Plan on using 3 to 4 drops of food coloring for every ¼ cup (95 grams) of sand. If you used 1 cup (379 grams) of sand, 12 to 16 drops of food coloring will be plenty. [2] X Research source You can also use liquid watercolor, but you may need to add more than just a few drops. Liquid watercolor comes in small bottles and is already diluted with water. [3] X Research source Do not use liquid watercolor if you are doing this at the beach. Food coloring is safe for the animals, but liquid watercolor is not."

You can also gently squeeze and massage the sand through the bags. Keep doing this until the color is even. Add more food coloring if the color is too light for you. Keep in mind that the sand will dry lighter."

      "content": "Allow the sand to dry overnight. If you don't want to wait that long, you can dry the sand in a preheated oven at 200 °F (93 °C) for 5 to 10 minutes. When the sand is almost dry, take it out of the oven and let it finish air-drying for a few hours. Don't let the sand dry completely in the oven. If you do, the color may fade. Do not bake sand that's been colored with liquid watercolor."

Avoid getting the sand wet, however. Even though the food coloring will have stained it, there is a slight chance that it may come off on your hands if the sand gets wet. Do not put the sand in water or aquariums. It will bleed into the water."

If collecting sand from a beach, be wary of hazardous materials and waste. Though you will later sift the sand, try to pick out noticeable things like paper or large pebbles. Be very careful when collecting sand from a beach. Use rubber gloves as there may be broken glass or other hazardous materials. Store gathered sand in tightly sealed plastic bags. Hold the bags upside down and see if any sand leaks out. This will help you reduce unwanted sand in your car and house."

Place a bucket on the ground and put a sifter over top. This sifter could be an old sifter from the kitchen or fine netting, like a window screen, that is secured over the bucket using duct tape. If you are using a metal sifter from the kitchen, do not use it again for food-related preparation. Pour the collected sand onto the mesh of the sifter or screen. Shake the screen lightly so the sand will filter through into the bucket. You may need to occasionally clear the mesh of any stones, shells, or other debris.

You may need to add dye several times until it gets to the desired shade you like. The sand will dry lighter so do not worry if the dye is very dark. Dry tempera paint powder is a nice additive that helps create bright colors. Tempera powder can be purchased in most arts and crafts stores. Be cautious while handling dye as it can stain skin, clothing, and furniture."

If you are using a container with a lid, you will need a plastic spoon that you can throw away after you finish the project. Scrape the sides of the container to make sure you color everything. Seal the container and set the wet sand to the side to soak up the dye for at least an hour. For a storage bag, simply seal the bag tightly and massage the sand until the color is consistent throughout. Set the bag aside for at least an hour so the sand can soak up the dye."

You may wish to put paper towels over the plate before putting the sand down to help soak up any excess dye. You can also bake the sand to help speed up the drying process and further infuse the colors. Simply place the sand in a baking pan and bake on 200 °F (93 °C) for 15 minutes. Make sure you pull the sand out of the oven while it is still damp and let it dry naturally overnight; sand that has been baked completely dry can have faded and less vibrant colors."

For safety purposes, store sealed sand outside of the kitchen. You don't want to accidentally mistake it for a spice or cooking powder. Make sure you reseal the lids tightly after each sand art project. This will keep unwanted materials from ruining the color as well as prevent accidental spills inside the house."

Simply use a pencil to draw a design on plain white paper (a flower, for example). Once finished, place the paper on a tray to contain the sand you will pour on later. Use a cotton swab to apply Elmer's glue to the areas you will be coloring in with sand. Carefully pour the different colors of sand onto the glued areas. Let the sand settle, then hold it over a plate to collect loose sand. For the greatest effect, draw something with many colors and with contrasting colors (for example, a rainbow). This will allow you to utilize a lot of your sand colors and will produce a vibrant, lively picture."

To spice up a flower vase, imitate the way you created a sand drawing. Set the vase on some newspaper. Pour 1/4 cup of tacky glue into a plastic cup and dilute it with a teaspoon of water. Use a paintbrush to apply the glue to the outside of the vase. Sprinkle spoonfuls of colored sand over the glued surface, rotating the vase to spread the sand evenly. Let the vase dry for a few hours, then place flowers inside. Layering sand in its own vase is also a nice house decoration. This is very easy: just pour one color of sand into a vase or clear jar and form a layer. Don't worry about whether this layer is even or straight; making it wavy and uneven adds personality to the vase and gives it a more natural look. [14] X Research source Pour a different color of sand and form another layer. For the best contrast, avoid layering colors that look similar to each other, like purple and red. Continue this process until you reach the top of the vase. To give your vase a beach-like vibe, add some rocks and shells to the layers of sand."

      "content": "Create a sand candle. This is a nice twist on the layered sand vase and is great for adding uniqueness to plain white candles. Layer the colored sand one layer and color at a time, similar to how you would create a layered vase. Instead of filling the vase to the top with sand, stop a little past half-way. Place a candle into the middle of the jar and burrow it into the sand slightly so that it is nicely supported. Now when you light the candle, its light will reflect off the sand and create a warm, inviting glow. [15] X Research source"
