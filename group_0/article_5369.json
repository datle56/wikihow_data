In physics, there is a rule: you have to measure things in SI units which all the scientists in the world use. The SI unit for mass is kilogram or kg. [4] X Research source"

(While speed is just a scalar that has just a magnitude, velocity is a vector that has a magnitude and direction. However, momentum is not affected by direction.) You can calculate the velocity of an object by dividing the distance that the object traveled by the time it took to travel the distance. Again, you have to measure velocity in SI unit. The SI unit for velocity is m/s (meters per second). [6] X Research source"
