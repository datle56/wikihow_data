      "content": "Put a cleaning bag around the entire split A/C system. Surround your entire appliance with a new cleaning bag to prevent any dust or dirt from reaching the floor. They can be purchased online for under $20. Try to purchase a bag that comes with a cinch, so you can loosen and tighten its circumference. You can use an empty trash bag in lieu of a specialty cleaning bag."

      "content": "Remove the air filters from your split A/C. The long, rectangular pieces that rest at the front of the appliance are the air filters , and they have to be removed and washed to remain in top condition. Press a tab along the side of each air filter to loosen and remove them. Make sure to first shake the filters outside to remove any obvious dust and dirt before you start the cleaning process. If there are no obvious tabs that open the front of your split A/C, check the manufacturer’s guide for help."

      "title": "Rinse the removed air filters under running water.",
      "content": "Rinse the removed air filters under running water. Take the air filters to a sink or large basin and pour cool tap water over them. If your filters aren’t that dirty, rinsing them might be enough to remove the dust. If running water doesn’t seem to do the trick, use a sponge or cleaning pad to gently rub in a mild cleaning detergent. Then, rinse them off and let them air dry.

      "content": "Blow the dust off of the cooling fins. Add a thin, canister attachment to your air blower and use it to free the dust from the back of your split A/C. The cooling fins look like a series of metallic lines that are snug against the back of the A/C. Make sure that you blow over the entire surface area of the cooling fins. [6] X Research source A brush or canister vacuum attachment can also help with this part of the process."

Then, let the product sit for at least 20 minutes. The coils look like connected, rounded pieces of metal, and they can be found running across the center of the indoor unit. You can purchase evaporating cleaners online."

      "content": "Spray antifungal cleaner onto the coils to prevent mold. Use a can of antifungal cleaning spray to sanitize the back of your air conditioner, where toxins would most likely form. This cleaner helps prevent toxic particles and spores from growing in your appliance. Allow at least 5 minutes for the spray to set before you put the air filters back in. If you’re having trouble finding this spray at a hardware store, check online."

They should glide into place easily, but double-check your owner’s manual if you’re having any difficulties with the assembly process. These freshened air filters will ensure that only clean, cool air makes it through your A/C. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Clear out any clogs in the A/C by flushing out the drain lines. Avoid a drain line clog by disconnecting the hose or pipe that separates the indoor and outdoor units. Use a pressurized flush kit to force water or cleaner down the drainpipe. Let the drain line air-dry for at least 1 hour to make sure all of the water or cleaning fluid has evaporated. Reconnect the hose before turning on the A/C. If needed, feel free to flush water or a cleaning agent through the drain line both ways. You can purchase flush kits online that contain a pressurized nozzle."

Once the power is up and running, check your split A/C to see if cold air is coming out of it. Enjoy breathing in refreshing and clean air! You can also stick a wire or long piece of metal through the pipe to remove any clogs.

Since you’ll be rinsing off the fins of the AC with cold water, you definitely don’t want it to be hooked up. Your power system might be hooked up to a breaker, or it could have its own power source—regardless, flip or unplug this source so that the power is completely off. [9] X Research source Check your home’s schematics if you don’t know where the power source is. Generally, it can be found a few feet away from the unit outside."

The condenser fins are thin, vertical metal pieces that line the inside of the metal unit. Turn on the vacuum and suck out any visible dust and debris from the outdoor unit using long movements. Go horizontally and vertically in straight lines until no dirt or leaves are visible in your condenser.

If you want your condenser to be working at top quality, you want to be sure that all of the fins are straight and functioning properly. [12] X Research source You can also purchase specific tools from a home improvement store that are designed to straighten out the A/C condenser fins."

Before you can clean out the fins, you need to remove any electrical units—specifically, the fan. Use a wrench or screwdriver to remove any bolts or screws securing the fan in place before you lift it out of the metal unit. The fan is wired to the condenser, so you won’t be able to remove it completely.

The rinsing process allows the fins to be as clear and clean as possible, so your condenser can run efficiently. Let the inside of the outdoor unit dry completely before you do anything else. [14] X Research source Use a sprayer attachment if you want to get a finer or stronger mist from the hose. Try not to apply too much water pressure to the fins."
