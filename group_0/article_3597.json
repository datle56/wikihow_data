If your character has at least 70% Looks, you should be able to increase it over the course of your character's life. However, if your character's look stat is very low, consider rolling a new character until you get one with good looks. To increase your Looks stat, get successful plastic surgery, go to the gym, cure any of your illnesses, and go to the salon or spa. [1] X Research source"

The answers don't matter a ton, but try to pick the most professional responses to each question. Make sure to read what each client asks your character to do when the answers are Happily agree to do it and Say it's beneath you . Sometimes the best answer is to say it's beneath you if the client is asking your character to do something gross or rude."

To do this, go to the job screen and tap on your career at the top of the page, then tap Clients . Select one of the clients and tap Inquire about a gig . Try to do gigs with clients that have a high reputation bar. These gigs usually pay better and will look better in your portfolio. Do as many gigs as you can in one year.
