      "title": "Embrace a buzz cut.",
      "content": "Embrace a buzz cut. Use clippers to buzz your hair tightly to your head. This makes areas of baldness less obvious and is a good option if you’re balding near the crown of your head or around your hairline. This is a very wearable style if you’re nervous about shaving your head completely. [1] X Research source You can do one short length all over or you can ask your barber to go a little tighter on the sides. Most people who buzz their hair like to start out with a number 2 blade with a guard on their clippers. You can then go shorter (a lower number blade) to your taste. [2] X Research source This cut works great for round and oval face shapes or those with long faces. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Try the “Roger Sterling.”",
      "content": "Try the “Roger Sterling.” Have your barber cut your hair tightly on the sides, but a short to medium length on top. Then, create a part on top to naturally hide some hairline recession. The effect is one of a very deep part, rather than balding. This style is best if you have lots of hair on top, but have a receding hairline. [7] X Research source This cut is great for square and rectangular faces, much like Roger Sterling’s.

      "title": "Avoid long hair, which attracts attention to your baldness.",
      "content": "Avoid long hair, which attracts attention to your baldness. The greater the difference between the longest and shortest hairs on your head, the more noticeable any areas of baldness or thinning will be. Avoid longer hairstyles, instead opting for short styles that deemphasize bald spots. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Volumize thinning hair with texturizing spray or volumizing powder.",
      "content": "Volumize thinning hair with texturizing spray or volumizing powder. If your hair has just begun to thin, use texturizing spray or volumizing powder to give the illusion of thicker strands. These products separate your hair less, helping to hide areas of thinner growth. Texturizing and volumizing products should be applied per the manufacturer’s directions on dry hair. [10] X Research source Most texturizing sprays are applied much like hairspray, a fine, dry mist you can work through your hair evenly or concentrate in areas you want more texture. [11] X Research source Apply volumizing powder to your roots and work through for oil absorption and lift."

      "title": "Swap shampoo for a cleansing conditioner to keep follicles clear.",
      "content": "Swap shampoo for a cleansing conditioner to keep follicles clear. Many regular shampoos can clog your hair follicles if used too frequently. To keep your hair follicles clear in order to allow new growth, switch to a cleansing conditioner, such as Biolage. This will cleanse your hair while keeping healthy, natural scalp oils. [12] X Research source Use the conditioner much as you would a shampoo. Work a dime-sized amount into your hair then rinse as normal. Additional conditioner is not required. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid a comb-over style.",
      "content": "Avoid a comb-over style. Trying to camouflage your bald spot by combing your hair over it simply never works. It draws more attention to your baldness, isn’t convincing, and doesn’t look attractive. Avoid any creative combing to cover thin areas. Ultimately, this will be more attention grabbing than baldness, which is at least natural. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid alcohol-based styling products.",
      "content": "Avoid alcohol-based styling products. Alcohol-based styling products remove moisture from your hair and can leave your already thinning strands prone to breakage. Opt for moisturizing products when possible to keep the hair you do have strong and in good condition. [15] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Part your hair in the direction opposite your natural hair growth.",
      "content": "Part your hair in the direction opposite your natural hair growth. Parting your hair against the way it prefers to grow creates volume and an illusion of fullness. If your hair naturally likes to lay against your scalp to the left, for example, try parting to the right for some face-framing lift. This technique will make your hair appear thicker.

      "title": "Grow and experiment with facial hair.",
      "content": "Grow and experiment with facial hair . Attract attention to your face rather than your head by growing some classic facial hair. Stick to timeless styles, such as mustaches and goatees in shorter lengths, for a trim and polished look. Avoid very long facial hair, such as a long beard, as this can emphasize the lack of hair elsewhere. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Embrace accessories to accentuate your appearance. Some accessories simply look better with a bald head, so try experimenting with piercings, clothing, or even tattoos. Accentuate your newfound baldness with a bold pair of earrings or a printed scarf. You may find that you can sport more adventurous accessories near your face now that you don’t have to style your hair. [18] X Research source Statement necklaces and large, colorful earrings can make a bald head look stylish and chic. Bold eyeglasses or an interesting necktie are also great options."

      "content": "Avoid hats, which can clog your hair follicles and prevent hair growth. Let the sweat glands on your head breathe by foregoing hats. While it’s tempting to cover up your baldness, wearing a hat all the time can clog your hair follicles and keep new hair from growing. An occasional winter hat to stay warm is all you need.
