While there’s nothing about missed payments on EOS’ website, most gyms restrict members' access to amenities or even freeze their accounts. Additionally, some gyms charge late fees while others send your account to collections for outstanding dues. If you have an overdue payment, this may damage your credit score. To avoid this, contact your local EOS if you’re worried about missing a payment. If you’re unable to pay your membership, temporarily freeze your account until you’re in good standing. It’s only $5 per month for up to 3 months. You'll still be charged if your annual fee is due during your freeze. [7] X Research source"
