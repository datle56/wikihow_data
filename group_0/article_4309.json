      "content": "Wait for the water to heat to the desired boiling stage. There are 4 main stages water goes through as it heats up to boiling temperature. [5] X Research source Quiver: Tiny bubbles appear at the base of the pot but do not rise. The surface quivers slightly. This happens at about 140–170ºF (60–75ºC), a temperature good for poaching eggs , fruit, or fish. Sub-simmer: At this stage, a couple of little streams of bubbles rise, but most of the water is still. The water temperature is around 170–195ºF (75–90ºC), and can be used for stew or braising meat. Simmer: At the simmer stage, small-to-medium bubbles break the surface often, all across the pot. A simmer ranges from 195–212ºF (90–100ºC), making it perfect for steaming veggies or melting chocolate, depending on how healthy you're feeling. Full, rolling boil: At this stage, you see steam and constant movement that doesn't stop when you stir the water. It takes about 5-10 minutes to reach a rolling boil on high heat. This is the hottest your water gets: 212ºF (100ºC). Cook pasta at this temperature."

      "content": "Alternatively, use a kettle to boil water. Fill the kettle at least halfway full. Too much water may boil over and spill out of the kettle. If you don’t put enough water in, it may boil away and damage the kettle. Then, place it on the stove and turn the burner on high heat until it reaches a full boil (usually about 5-10 minutes). [6] X Research source If you have a whistling tea kettle, wait for it to make a high-pitched whistle to let you know the water is boiling. If you have an electric kettle, simply fill it about half-full, place it on the base, and flip the switch or turn the dial to “on.” The kettle automatically turns off once the water starts to boil."

Microwave for 1 minute. If the dish is hot after the minute is up, it is not microwave-safe. [7] X Research source For increased safety, use a container with a scratch or chip (in scientific terms, a nucleation site) on the interior surface. This helps the water bubble, reducing the risk of an (already unlikely) \"superheated\" explosion of hot water.

Test the water’s temperature by holding your hand over the top of the cup. The water is ready when it's steaming and too hot to touch. Put it back in the microwave for another minute if it’s not hot enough. [10] X Research source If the water is still cool after the first couple minutes, increase the length of each session to 1½-2 minutes. The total amount of time depends on your microwave's power and the amount of water you're boiling. Don't expect a \"rolling boil\" in a microwave. The water still reaches boiling temperatures, but it’s less obvious. For maximum safety, look up recommended water heating times in your microwave's manual."

A large pot filled with water takes longer to boil than a smaller one. [18] X Research source Your altitude also makes a difference. The higher the elevation, the thinner the air. With fewer air molecules holding the water down, water molecules can break away and enter the air more easily. The water boils sooner, but the low temperature makes it harder to cook food. You don't need to worry about this effect unless you're at 2,000 ft (610m) or higher."

Make the water boil faster by trapping the heat inside the pot with a lid. Shallower, wider pots have more surface area in direct contact with the burner, which may help the water boil more quickly. [19] X Research source Choose a pot made of thinner, lighter materials like aluminum or copper for faster boiling times. When cooking, cold or room-temperature food lowers the water temperature and might reduce the boil to an earlier stage. That's fine; just leave the heat on high or medium until the water returns to the correct stage. [20] X Research source"

Once it’s at the right boiling stage, reduce the heat to medium (for boiling) or medium-low (for simmering). After the water is at a rolling boil, more heat only makes it boil away faster. [21] X Research source Check on the pot occasionally for the first few minutes to make sure the water is stable at the stage you want it to be. When making soup or another dish that must simmer for a long time to cook, leave the lid slightly ajar. Closing the lid completely raises the temperature too high for these recipes. Salt has almost no effect on the boiling temperature. Add it only to flavor the food – especially pasta, which absorbs the salt along with the water. [22] X Research source You might notice a bunch of bubbles rise up as soon as you put the salt in. It's a fun effect, but it doesn't change the temperature."
