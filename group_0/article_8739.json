In the iPhone Storage menu, you can view a breakdown of how storage is being used on your phone, as well as a list of apps ordered by how much space they are using. According to Apple and Mobile Phone Repair Specialist Josef Storzi, the easiest way to delete apps is to simply press and hold an app icon on your Home Screen, then tap Remove App > Delete App in the context menu. However, deleting apps through iPhone Storage has the advantage of showing you which ones take up the most space. While you’re in the iPhone Storage menu, check the Recommendations section for any other ways you can quickly free up space. For example, you might see an option to review and delete downloaded media you don’t need."

They’ll be permanently deleted after 30 days, or you can open the folder and delete them immediately to clear up space. Another way to free up space on your iPhone without actually deleting any pictures is to enable iCloud Photos . Just keep in mind that if you delete photos that are stored in iCloud from your iPhone, they’ll also be deleted from all other devices logged into the same Apple Account. You can also merge duplicate photos with just a few taps if you have iOS 16 or later. You might be surprised how many duplicates you have cluttering up your gallery!"
