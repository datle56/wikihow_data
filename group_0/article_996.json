      "title": "Hold the stand upright so the longer beams are flat on the ground.",
      "content": "Hold the stand upright so the longer beams are flat on the ground. The shorter beams on the stand are designed to hold your keyboard so you can jam out without them getting in your way. The longer beams are designed to keep the stand stable while you play, so rest them flat on the ground. Some simple stands may have beams that are the same length. If that’s the case, choose either end to place against the ground."

      "content": "Pull out the clutch in the center of the stand. The clutch is the locking mechanism in the center of your stand. It looks like a knob, handle, or lever, depending on the design of your stand. Take hold of the clutch and pull or rotate it to disengage it from the locking mechanism. Some stands may have a spring-loaded clutch, so you’ll need to hold it open to make your adjustments. While the design of the clutch may vary from stand to stand, it needs to be disengaged from the locking mechanism so you can open the stand and make your adjustments."

      "title": "Stretch the stand open until the top beams are the height you want them.",
      "content": "Stretch the stand open until the top beams are the height you want them. If you’re playing your keyboard seated, open the stand until the top beams are just above your knees so you can comfortably sit behind it. If you’re playing your keyboard while standing, then open up the stand so the upper beams are in line with your hips so you can easily reach the keys with your hands. You may find a different height is more comfortable for you, so feel free to adjust the stand according to your needs!"

      "content": "Slide the clutch into one of the slots to lock the stand in the open position. Hold the stand open and insert the clutch into the slot on the locking mechanism to hold the stand open at your setting. Make sure the clutch is fully inserted into the slot so it won’t fall open when you put your keyboard on the stand. Some stands may have a clutch that needs to be rotated to lock the stand open or a lever that needs to be squeezed until it’s locked. Whatever version you have, just make sure it’s fully locked!"

      "content": "Wiggle the stand to identify which foot needs to be adjusted. The feet of your keyboard stand are the round grips on the ends of the lower beams that help stabilize the stand. If your keyboard stand is shaky or unstable, place your hands on it and give it a good wobble. Look for which foot is uneven with the rest to identify which needs to be adjusted. It’s important that your stand is completely stable so your keyboard won’t potentially slide off of it. Usually, you only need to adjust 1 of the feet to stabilize the stand, but sometimes multiple feet need to be adjusted."

      "content": "Lift the stand and rotate the foot on the beam to make adjustments. Once you’ve identified which foot needs to be adjusted, lean the stand to raise the foot off of the ground. Then, rotate the foot clockwise to raise it or counterclockwise to lower it."

      "content": "Place the stand upright and shake it to see if it’s stable. Rest the lower beams on the ground so they’re flat and give the stand a good wobble. If it’s stable, you can place your keyboard back on it and play it without any shakiness. If the stand is still unstable, make additional adjustments by rotating the feet as needed until it is stable. Make small adjustments at a time and check the stand until it’s nice and stable. Test the stand by playing a song or two. Adjust as necessary."
