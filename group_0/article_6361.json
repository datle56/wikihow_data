      "content": "Buy a silver nitrate solution or stick. To treat small wounds that won't heal properly, silver nitrate is the safest and most common form of cauterization. Purchase silver nitrate in liquid or stick form from a pharmacy or online. Before purchasing, consult a doctor or pharmacist for advice on what strength of silver nitrate to use. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Silver nitrate will remove dead skin from the wound area, allowing it to heal properly. Silver nitrate solution is available over the counter in concentrations ranging from 0.5% to 50%. Silver nitrate sticks have the strongest concentration at 75%, and should only be applied to the specific area to be treated."

Wet your hands, apply an antibacterial soap, and scrub them for at least 20 seconds before rinsing them. Dry your hands on a clean towel and put on latex or nitrile gloves to reduce the chance of infection.

Clean away any liquid or debris coming out of the wound, then let it air dry. [3] X Research source Cleaning a wound from the outside toward the middle may spread bacteria into it. You can make your own saline solution or purchase it from a pharmacy."

      "content": "Use petroleum jelly to confine the wound area. After you clean the wound, remove your gloves, wash your hands, and put on new gloves. Silver nitrate treatment is a mild form of cauterization, but it will still harm healthy skin if it comes into contact with it. Apply petroleum jelly to the area of skin surrounding your wound with a clean gloved fingertip or gauze pad. Be sure that all surrounding skin is protected so that you can apply silver nitrate without worry.

      "content": "Apply silver nitrate as directed. Always follow a doctor's or pharmacist's instructions for applying silver nitrate to your wound, which will vary depending on how bad your wound is and the type of application that you use. Silver nitrate sticks should be dipped in distilled water to activate them before use, while a silver nitrate solution should be applied to a cotton ball or gauze pad. When applying silver nitrate directly to the tissue, gently rub and rotate the tip of the applicator along the tissue. As a general rule, 2 minutes of contact time on the wound should be enough to treat it.

Try putting pressure on the wound and applying a tourniquet to stop the bleeding. If neither of these options help to slow down the bleeding, opt to cauterize the wound before you lose too much blood. [8] X Research source Note that cauterization is an incredibly painful procedure and should only be considered in a life or death scenario. Do not attempt cauterization if you have a way to call for medical assistance."

      "content": "Find a metal cauterizing tool. Find a piece of metal that is sturdy enough to withhold intense heat without becoming brittle. The item should be small enough that it doesn't exceed the size of the wound by much. A kitchen knife is an ideal choice since it has a handle, which will make it easy to heat over a flame. A pair of metal scissors could also be a good cauterizing tool."

Do not continue heating past the point that you see a hint of red.

      "title": "Apply the knife to the wound area in small bursts.",
      "content": "Apply the knife to the wound area in small bursts. Avoid leaving the heated surface of the knife on your skin for too long as it will burn into your healthy skin tissue. Apply the knife to the wound surface in short bursts of 1 to 2 seconds each. As soon as you see no more bleeding, assume that the wound is closed and stop cauterizing it. Cauterizing causes the coagulation of blood, which in turn stops bleeding. Cauterization should be done quickly, so there should be no need to re-heat the knife during the process."

After sealing the wound, douse it with rubbing alcohol if you have it. [13] X Research source Keep in mind that this should only be done in emergency situations. Rubbing alcohol is not generally used to clean wounds and can actually slow the healing process. However, it can be used to clean a wound in this scenario. [14] X Research source"
