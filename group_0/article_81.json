      "content": "They put others before themselves 100% of the time. Enneagram Type 2w3 (The Host or The Hostess) is known for being selfless, and they have a natural desire to help other people. Because of this, a common stereotype is that they always put others’ emotions above their own, and that they tend to repress their own needs in order to take care of loved ones. [1] X Research source Is this stereotype accurate? While this can be the case for an unhealthy 2w3, it’s definitely not true for all of them. Many 2w3s have done the work to recognize their own needs and create healthy boundaries with the people in their lives, so they’re able to help others without harming themselves. In other words, 2w3s are naturally helpful and caring, but they’re also able to strike a healthy balance between altruism and self-care if they work at it."

      "title": "They’re bad at standing up for themselves.",
      "content": "They’re bad at standing up for themselves. A 2w3's basic desire is to be loved and accepted, and their basic fear is being unwanted and alone. [2] X Research source Because of this, some people think that 2w3s will do whatever others want them to do to avoid criticism or rejection. In other words, people assume that 2w3s are obsessed with being liked, to the point that they become doormats or pushovers. Is this stereotype accurate? It’s true that 2w3s crave love and connection, and because of this, they sometimes go along with what others want because they want to make them happy. When a 2w3 is healthy and self-aware, however, this doesn’t need to be a bad thing. They’re able to recognize when it’s important to put their foot down, and when it’s harmless to let another person have their way. On the other hand, if a 2w3 is struggling with insecurity or low self-esteem, they might be a pushover at times because they’re afraid of being abandoned. Ultimately, the truth of this stereotype depends on the person. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "They’re always timid, sweet, and kind. Because Type 2s tend to be caring and openhearted, some people assume that they’re always mild-mannered and soft-spoken. When describing this personality type, people often mention traits like “gentle,” “nurturing,” and “patient,” for example. [4] X Research source Is this stereotype accurate? It’s true that many 2w3s tend to be naturally kind and caring people. However, it’s important to remember that not all 2w3s are the same, and they each have unique and complex personalities. For example, if a 2w3 went through some tough experiences that required them to learn how to stand up for themselves, they may have a more bold or outspoken personality than typical 2w3s. Their wing in Enneagram Type 3 also brings a bit more of an ambitious and goal-oriented energy to the Type 2 personality. As a result, some 2w3s can come across as determined or even hungry for the spotlight, rather than gentle or timid. [5] X Research source"

They’re generous with their time and resources, and they’re always eager to support their loved ones, lend a hand to a stranger, or volunteer for communities in need. [6] X Research source If you’re going through a breakup, a 2w3 will be a shoulder to cry on. If you’re stressed out, they’ll surprise you at work with a latte from your favorite coffee shop. If you’re lonely, they’ll drop everything and head over to your place. In other words, you can always count on a 2w3, and they tend to be pretty incredible friends!"

As a result, some 2w3s struggle with confidence and self-image, and they have deep anxieties about whether or not they're worthy of love. This can make them pretty harsh critics of themselves. [13] X Research source Tips for Growth: If you’re a 2w3 who’s too hard on yourself, try reciting positive affirmations for a few minutes every morning before you start your day. This is a great way to show yourself some love and kindness, while also reminding yourself of all your amazing qualities. For example, you could recite something like, “I’m a kind, capable, and unique person,” “I’m worthy of love and acceptance,” or “I am trying my best, and that’s enough.” [14] X Research source"

In these cases, a 2w3 may prioritize others’ needs and emotions so much that they neglect their own, which isn’t healthy in the long run. [15] X Research source Tips for Growth: Set aside designated time for self-care in your schedule. This will help balance your desire to help others with your own needs. Self-care looks different to everyone, so feel free to personalize this time! For example, you could set aside 30 minutes every evening for a relaxing activity like journaling or reading, or you could de-stress with an invigorating exercise class a few times per week. [16] X Research source Or, you could go all out and schedule a weekly self-care Sunday , which is an entire day dedicated to resetting and recharging before the work week. Activities could include things like taking a bubble bath, spending time in nature, participating in fun hobbies, and more."
