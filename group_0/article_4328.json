      "content": "Boo is a dating app that pairs users up according to personality. In addition to creating a standard dating app profile, where Boo really differs from other popular dating apps is in how it uses personality quizzes to pair users up. Boo users take a personality test based on the MBTI (or Myers-Briggs Type Indicator ) and the Big Five (OCEAN) personality model to get a sense of their personalities, strengths and weaknesses, and values. The app purports to pair users up with other users with compatible personalities. Boo‚Äôs interface is also unique in that it mimics a social media app like Twitter or Reddit, which allows users to share memes and chat with one another in a more natural way than other dating apps typically allow. Boo matches users according to personality; for instance, someone who is an INFP (that is, Introverted, iNtuitive, Feeling, Perceiving) may be paired up with an ENFP (Extroverted, iNtuitive, Feeling, Perceiving), ESFP (Extroverted, Sensing, Feeling, Perceiving), or INFJ (Introverted, iNtuitive, Feeling, Judging). The MBTI is a popular personality test developed by Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers during WWII, inspired by the work of psychologist Carl Jung. [1] X Research source The Big Five (OCEAN) personality traits are a psychological model for understanding basic human behavior and personality. They include Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Take Boo‚Äôs personality test, then meet like-minded users. After making a profile, you‚Äôll be prompted to take either the quick 5-question personality test or the more thorough 30-question test (or, if you already know your MBTI, you can input it directly). Both tests are based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and the Big Five personality type model. Based on your result, Boo matches you up with like-minded users, whom you can chat with, ‚Äúlike,‚Äù or ‚Äúpass‚Äù on. [3] X Research source There are 16 possible different results, each describing users‚Äô basic personality traits and values, strengths and weaknesses, and world views. Boo also provides an overview of the different personalities, including those you‚Äôre more likely to be compatible with based on your type. For example, the Guardian personality type (the MBTI INFJ) is introspective and idealistic, while the Rebel (MBTI ESTP) is the exact opposite. They thrive on excitement and are quick to jump into action, and they interpret the world by engaging directly with it, rather than studying or contemplating it. [4] X Research source"

Boo tries hard to match users up with compatible partners by asking specific questions about users‚Äô tastes, values, preferences, history, and more. Because of this, the app has been viewed by some users as an efficient and effective means of meeting potential dates. [5] X Research source On the other hand, some users may find the amount of info Boo asks of them to be overwhelming and intrusive. Due to Boo‚Äôs relative newness on the dating app market, some users have found it difficult to meet matches in their area. But this may change as the app continues to grow and attract more users."
