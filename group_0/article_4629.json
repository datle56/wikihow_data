      "content": "It’s expressive, bold, and unique compared to older styles. Gen Z prides itself on being different and defying cultural norms. They’re also the first generation to have grown up entirely online, so when a new trend catches on, it spreads fast . The broccoli cut was popularized on platforms like TikTok, and when it didn’t resemble anything the Millennials, Gen Y, or Xennials wore, it spread like wildfire. [1] X Research source The broccoli cut is also very versatile. Depending on how much energy you spend on styling , it can look very formal and clean, messy and erratic, or something else entirely. Zoomers also tend to not be as self-conscious or serious as other generations, so the funny things you can do with the broccoli cut are actually an upside, not a drawback. [2] X Research source The name refers to the fact that the sides and back are shaved, with all the volume on top—kind of like a broccoli floret."

      "title": "Shave the sides and back short and leave “too much” on top.",
      "content": "Shave the sides and back short and leave “too much” on top. Ask for a side shave with a 0, 1, or 2 guard on the clippers depending on how short you want to go. On the back, you can either ask for a graduating fade if you don’t want it to be uniform in the back or shave it the same way. Leave it long up top. It should look a little bit like a bowl cut where the hair on top of your head is puffy, voluminous, and fresh. [3] X Research source The top is where you have a ton of optionality with the broccoli cut. You can leave the hair naturally messy, style it to stick up straight, or curl and twist it for the traditional broccoli cut."

      "title": "Opt for a broccoli mohawk for a little more edge.",
      "content": "Opt for a broccoli mohawk for a little more edge. Instead of shaving everything leading up to your hairline, shave a little further up and leave the hair running along the center to create a mohawk . This version of the broccoli cut is a little crisper, edgier, and sharper than the traditionally-messy broccoli cut. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Try braiding the hair up top for a tighter look.",
      "content": "Try braiding the hair up top for a tighter look. If you’ve got natural hair and you’re looking for a protective style , braid the hair you’ve got left up top. You can experiment with different braid styles until you’ve got the slick vibe you’re looking for. You can even dread the hair if it’s long enough."

    {
      "title": "Soften your look up by tapering the sides instead.",
      "content": "Soften your look up by tapering the sides instead. The traditional broccoli cut requires a straight, uniform shave that ends at the hairline. But if you want a little more volume and texture, try tapering the sides and back . This will give you a fuller look that won’t look quite as “youthful” as the traditional broccoli cut.

    {
      "title": "Perm or curl your hair for the curliest version of the look.",
      "content": "Perm or curl your hair for the curliest version of the look. If you don’t have naturally curly hair and you want the traditional broccoli cut look, you can either hit up a local hair stylist and ask for a perm , or use a curling iron to curl your hair . This will give you the curly top broccoli head look most often associated with this style. You don’t have to do much of anything to the hair up top if you’ve already got naturally curly hair and you want the typical zoomer perm."

      "title": "Sweep the hair into a modern side quiff for a more dramatic vibe.",
      "content": "Sweep the hair into a modern side quiff for a more dramatic vibe. Work some gel or mousse into your hair and brush or comb it up and to one of your sides. Use your hands or styling tools to layer different tracts of hair in similar, but slightly different, directions. Once you’ve created an expressive, colorful side-quiff style that looks good to you, you’re good to go. You can even experiment with gently twisting the ends of your hair for a more sweeping look."

      "title": "Brush the hair back to convert it into a slick undercut.",
      "content": "Brush the hair back to convert it into a slick undercut . The really cool thing about the broccoli cut is that it’s versatile. If you get tired of the zoomer perm look, work some pomade or styling cream into your hair and comb it backward. This will give you the classic and crisp undercut look, which is a classic. It’s also a little more “professional” than the broccoli cut, which is good if you work in a more formal setting."

      "title": "Tie the top into a bun for a cleaner vibe.",
      "content": "Tie the top into a bun for a cleaner vibe. If the hair on top is long enough, tie it into a small top knot with a hair tie. This will keep the hair out of your face, and your hair won’t bob or move around the way it normally might with the broccoli cut. This is also a good way to add to the verticality of your look if you want to create the impression that you’re a little bit taller than you are."

It’s a grungy throwback reminiscent of 60s Americana, and it was popularized by Miley Cyrus, Billie Eilish, and Kurtis Conner. It’s a great unisex option that can be styled up or down to give you as much volume and drama as you want. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "The middle part While it isn’t a single particular hairstyle, parting your hair in the middle is an especially popular option among Zoomers. It’s transgressive since parts are traditionally placed on one side of the head or the other, and it creates the freedom to play with all kinds of unique, symmetrical styles. [7] X Research source"

You can braid your entire head to go for a free-flowing quasi-dreadlock look, or use a pair of baby braids to frame your bangs.
