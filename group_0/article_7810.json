House cleaning professional Filip Boksa says the most effective way to clean tile grout is to mix ½ cup (136 g) of baking soda, 1 ⁄ 4 c (59 mL) of hydrogen peroxide, and 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of dish soap. Pour the ingredients into a small bowl and mix with a spoon. Baking soda is alkaline, so it won’t harm your grout. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply the mixture to the grout and let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes. After you mix the solution, Boska says to spread the mixture into the grout and allow it to work its magic for 5 to 10 minutes. He also recommends using “a grout brush to scrub the mixture into any cracks or fissures in the grout.” If you don’t have a grout brush , use a regular soft-bristled cleaning brush , an old toothbrush, or an abrasive sponge. To clean your grout without scrubbing, simply make sure the baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, and dish soap mixture covers the grout and let it sit for 10 minutes."

After the mixture sits, Boska says to “rinse off [the grout] with clean water.” Dip a mop in clean water and scrub over the mixture to remove the leftover baking soda and hydrogen peroxide. If you don’t have a mop, use a damp rag or towel to clean up the grout. If the tiled area is on the wall, use a small cup of water or a shower head to gently rinse off the homemade cleaner."

Spray the mixture directly onto the grout and baking soda and let it sit for 5 minutes or until the mixture stops bubbling. [8] X Research source Grout is made of mostly cement and can be dissolved by acids, like vinegar, over time. This is why it’s best not to use vinegar by itself to clean grout. [9] X Research source However, baking soda is a base, which means it cancels out the acid in the vinegar. [10] X Research source The vinegar is diluted with water so the combination is more basic, and it shouldn't harm the grout."

Dip a grout brush into the bleach solution and scrub the area. [15] X Research source Rinse with clean water. When using bleach in a small area, Willatt says to keep “the window open or the door open,” “protect your eyes” with safety goggles , and “make sure you're wearing gloves.” Avoid using chlorine bleach after or before the vinegar method. These substances can combine to make chlorine gas, which is highly dangerous."

      "content": "Regularly vacuum grouted floors instead of sweeping. While brooms and rags might push the dirt deeper into the grout, a vacuum sucks it directly up out of the area. The next time you’re quickly cleaning your floors, run the vacuum over any tiled areas to help reduce grout staining. [17] X Research source To keep tiled walls clean and prevent mold and soap scum buildup, run a squeegee over the area after it gets wet. [18] X Research source You can also mop tile floors with warm water and a few drops of dish soap. Try not to use too much soap, or the residue can attract dirt after the solution dries."

To apply it, clean your grout using one of the steps above and wait at least 45 minutes for it to dry. Follow the instructions on the sealer—usually, you use a sponge or cloth to apply the sealer evenly to the grout lines. [19] X Research source Let the sealer sit for 10 minutes, then use a dry cloth to clean up the excess. Apply a second coat, then test the sealer with a drop of water—if the water doesn’t bead up, apply a third coat. Apply a penetrating sealer to grout in damp areas, like bathrooms, and use a membrane-forming sealer in dry rooms, like the kitchen. Some sealers need 24 hours to cure before you can safely walk on it or use the shower, while others require up to 48 hours."
