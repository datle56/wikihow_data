      "content": "Make the first move. Take the initiative and introduce yourself to a Cancer woman. “Cancer is definitely on the shy and passive side, so they would like their partner to be the initiator,” explains Eyedealism. [1] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 7 September 2022. Try not to be overly aggressive by using intimate pickup lines or invading her space, though. As a sensitive and romantic water sign, Cancer women tend to respond better to a more sincere and respectful approach. A simple hello and genuine conversation can go a long way! For example, if you’re at a party or social gathering and you see her grab one of the snacks, you could say, “Are those good? I’m starving. My name’s Mark, by the way.” If she’s not doing anything in particular, just start simple. Say, “Hi.” If she says hi back, ask her how her day is going."

      "content": "Choose activity-based dates. Take your Cancer woman to a movie, a paint-and-sip event, or another date activity where she is not the sole focus of attention.

[2] X Research source Also, if the conversation lags, you can comment on the activity at hand to get it going again.

      "content": "Show vulnerability. When she asks you questions, don't just give short answers. Instead, try to open up and share things about yourself, and ask questions about her life in return. Like all water signs, Cancers are known for being sensitive and emotional, and they’re looking for a partner who can match this energy. [4] X Research source If you show her you can be vulnerable , she’ll feel more comfortable doing the same with you, which will bring you closer together. For example, if she asks how you got into teaching, rather than simply saying, “I like it.” You could say, “I really want to make a difference for kids. My dad wasn’t always around growing up, and I had a teacher who made a really strong impression on me during that time.” If she mentions that she's going through something difficult, tell her that you're there for whatever she needs. For example, say something like, \"I'm so sorry you're dealing with that—it sounds really tough. What can I do to help? I'm here for you.\" Cancers are also cardinal signs , which means that they can be pretty intense. In fact, Eyedealism calls Cancer “the most intense water sign.” [5] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 7 September 2022. If she’s serious about you, she’ll want to connect with you in a super deep, meaningful way, rather than just making small talk."

      "content": "Be patient if she takes a while to open up. Try not to be put off if a Cancer woman dodges your questions at first. Table the topic for now, and circle back to it when you know each other a bit better. Cancers are protective and naturally shy, so it may take a while for her to get comfortable talking about more serious things with you. [6] X Research source For example, if she avoids a personal question, say, “No problem! We don’t have to talk about anything you don’t want to talk about. I want you to feel comfortable.”"

If you've been seeing each other for a while and you want her to go all-in on a relationship with you, show her how serious you are with some traditionally romantic dates. Eyedealism recommends something like “an intimate corner of a dimly lit restaurant with soft music playing,” for example. [11] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 7 September 2022. Romantic gestures like sweet love notes or a fresh bouquet of flowers are also great ideas."
