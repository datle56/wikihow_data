      "content": "Keep an eye on them all the time; you never know what they might try to attempt. Don't even leave the room for a second. You would be surprised what kind of mess a toddler can make in the time that you take to use the bathroom. If you are going to get something then take the toddler with you. Keep anything dangerous away from his/her reach. [1] X Research source Toddlers love to get into mischief (terrible two's) and you never know what they will do if you leave the room."

      "title": "Give them snacks in between meals.",
      "content": "Give them snacks in between meals. Toddlers need to eat more often than adults, because of them growing, so give them a snack if they need it. You might give them a drink of juice, water, or milk. Some kids might eat animal crackers or fruit snacks. Watch them when they eat. Learn how to get things out of little children's mouths if they are choking. [2] X Research source Don't let the child graze on snacks the whole time you're watching them. They still need to eat three regular meals a day, with two snacks in between. Talk to the parents if you're not sure what or how much to feed them. [3] X Expert Source Andrea Rudominer, MD, MPH Board Certified Pediatrician & Board Certified Integrative Medicine Doctor Expert Interview. 6 May 2020. Do not feed the child anything they are allergic to. Their parents should tell you beforehand if they are allergic to anything. Make sure that the snacks are not too big that they could choke on, nor too small that they could swallow without chewing it. If the parents don't mention anything about allergies, ask them about it. Because of their limited experiences, toddlers sometimes mistake boredom or sadness for hunger. To determine whether a toddler is genuinely hungry or mistaken, entertain them. If they forget about food, then they were just bored, but if they keep demanding food, then they're genuinely hungry."

      "content": "Check their diaper regularly: Change it promptly if it needs it. The smell is usually a strong indicator. If the child is recently toilet trained, ask regularly whether he or she needs to use the bathroom and watch for signs of needing to go. If you wait until the child tells you they have to use the bathroom, it might be too late, and then you have a mess to clean up. [4] X Research source Signs that a toddler needs to use the bathroom include holding their privates (if they need to pee) or their butt (if they need to poop). Being squirmy or distracted can also be a sign, though it's not a given, since many toddlers are naturally squirmy with short attention spans."

If you can't get those, offer to color on the band-aids when a kid gets hurt. Make sure you have all the important stuff. Call this box the Boo-boo Box. Don't make a big deal about an injury, just say, \"Uh-oh! Let's get you a band-aid!\" This way, they will laugh and be happy."

They will teach you CPR and useful information if something bad happens. They can also teach you a lot about how to deal with kids effectively and play with them well. These classes are usually cheap and will look impressive to any parents looking to hire a babysitter. [6] X Research source"

Don't break any rules the parents have, such as bed times and whether or not they can have junk food before bed. Not only is this bad for the kid, but you might even get caught if the child knows how to talk at all. If the child claims \"Mommy or Daddy always let me _________\" don't believe them. Children like to test limits to see if they can get their way, so they may lie about what their parents allow as a way of testing limits. [7] X Research source"

You should also be respectful of the rest of their home, and not go digging in drawers, cabinets, or closets. You never know when a family has a nanny-cam too, so be careful!"

Be creative! Sometimes bringing over some of your old toys will keep them happy. The toys may be old to you, but the toddler will be excited to have toys that are new to them. [8] X Research source Be prepared to change games multiple times. Kids at that age have a very short attention span."

Make a game out of crossing the street safely remember to say to the toddler, \"Look left and right. No cars, we can cross!\" Eventually, you'll have the toddler saying it with you! You can hold hands and go for a walk too if they're able to walk, but this should not be for much more than to the end of the street and back. [9] X Research source Another option is to run around and be crazy with them, but this should be done strategically. You have to spend hours doing this if you're going to do it before putting them down for bed. Doing just a little bit of crazy play before bed makes them more hyper. Doing a lot for an extended period of time will make them hyper very briefly before they just collapse from exhaustion. Bring out your artistic side. Color with crayons. Ask the kid to draw a picture of their family, pet, or their favorite toy. They will enjoy telling you about the things that they like. You can also give the child building bricks or blocks. Help them learn to build different kinds of towers and knock them down, or he or she may act upset if it falls down, but just help them, a little, to build it again."

Put the toddler on your lap to read the story. They love cuddles! Goodnight Moon, Green Eggs and Ham, and Are You My Mother? are good book choices for most toddlers. [10] X Research source Show pictures in a book that has pictures of farm or zoo animals. Say, \"Do you see the doggy? I see the doggy! Where's the horse? There's the horse!\" Kids love to show what they know, and will soon be pointing them out to you. Describe an animal and ask what sound it makes. Examples could be cows, horses, and pigs. Start being a little bit silly. Make animal sounds or noises for any books with animals. Get the child to make the sounds too."

What toy is red? Show me.\" so that they can practice identifying colors.

This helps because if there are many toys to choose from at once, they'll only play with the pile for a few moments and get bored and the house will be messy. Ask the toddler to help you clean up, and make a game out of it. Thank them for helping, this will make them feel good and want to help again. [11] X Research source If there is only one toy, they'll stick with it until they get bored, and you can hand them another one, but later offer 2 or 3 related toys because sometimes they tend to play with more than one toy at a time."

It is okay to \"pretend anger\", playfully, as if insulted or pretending amusement, etc. Be a clever actor, but not too silly, be kind of serious, and use the pretending to teach. [12] X Research source You can show hurt feelings from a child's actions or words, however. Realize that though they may say anything, they usually don't mean it (since many toddlers like trying to shock adults), and they usually get over it very quickly. Just pretend shock, giggle and chuckle at their smarting off or their cute actions, they should cooperate (better than if you were to have a war of wills and serious words). Happily explain what you really mean, in a gentle way, but don't be surprised that they make a game of touching things and looking at you to see how you react, just say \"no-no\". Try to give an alternative activity."

If the toddler wakes up and starts screaming or crying for their mom or dad, just sit with them and softly say, \"shhhh\" and tell them, \"It's okay; I'm here.\" If they mention wanting Mommy or Daddy, tell them that when they wake up, their Mommy will be there. They need to know that everything will go back to normal soon. Don't bring up their parent if they don't though. That will only upset them. [14] X Research source You can also try singing them lullabies and rock them on a rocking chair."
