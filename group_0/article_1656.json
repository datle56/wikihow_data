[1] X Research source [v160969_b01]. 10 February 2021. Don’t stare or hold eye contact for too long or it can come across as creepy. Just glance over, make eye contact, maybe flash a little smile, and go back to talking to your friends. [2] X Research source If you make eye contact and the girl looks uncomfortable or turns her back to you, those are probably signs that she’s not interested in talking to you. If she also makes eye contact and smiles, chances are that she is interested. [3] X Expert Source Joshua Pompey Dating Coach Expert Interview. 27 November 2019."

      "content": "A simple hello is much better than cheesy lines or superficial compliments. Walk up to the group, say “hi,” and introduce yourself. Make sure you’re saying hello to the whole group and not just zeroing in on the girl you’re interested in. Saying hi to everyone may help you make a good impression. [4] X Research source For example, say something like “Hi ladies, my name is Josh, how’s your night going?” Always approach a girl from the front so she can see you coming. Coming up from behind is creepy and threatening.

Stand close enough to the group so you look interested and open to a conversation, but not so close that you’re violating their personal space. Keep your palms open and your head raised so you look relaxed and approachable, too. [5] X Research source Try not to cross your arms when you approach—this can make you look closed off."

Just be you and try your best to let your normal personality shine without trying too hard to impress the girl. [7] X Research source There’s no “rule” for how to show confidence. If you’re normally a pretty funny person, you might try to make the girl and her friends laugh. Just stay away from topics like politics, religion, etc. If you’re a naturally more reserved person, you can show confidence simply by carrying on a conversation with the girl.

If your approach seems to be going well, as in the girls aren’t ignoring you and seem interested in talking, wave at one of your friends and motion them over to join you and the gang. Say something to the group when you do this, like: “Hey you guys should really meet my friend Ben, he’s right over there.” Then give Ben the signal to come on over!"

[11] X Research source Try saying something like: “Hey, what are you drinking, a margarita? Can I buy your next round?” You can also offer to buy her friends some drinks, too.

If the bar has activities, like a pool table, darts, or another bar game, ask her if she wants to play with you. Or, if the bar is too loud and you’re having a hard time hearing each other, ask if she wants to go to a quieter part of the bar with you and talk. For example, you might say something like: “Hey, do you like pool? I just noticed there’s a table over there, want to play a match with me?” Or, you could say something like: “Hey I really want to keep talking to you but it’s hard to hear you right here by the bar, want to go sit at that table over there with me for a bit?”"

If the conversation turns awkward or, even worse, there’s just awkward silence, wish the group of girls a good night and leave. If the girl is interested in you, she’ll probably look for a way to come talk to you later. [13] X Research source Remember that not everyone goes out to a bar to meet potential love interests. They might be having a reunion between close friends, celebrating something special, or consoling a friend over a breakup, for example. If at any point during the interaction the girl says “no” to something, respect that. If someone says “no,” it means “no,” plain and simple."
