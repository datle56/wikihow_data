They allow you to see temperature changes in your environment so that you can look for hotspots. The theory is that ghosts and poltergeists can cause unexplainable changes to the air around them.

Geiger counters measure radiation in Becquerels (Bq) or Curies (Ci).

[16] X Research source The witnesses will give a good sense of what you should spend your time focusing on.

      "content": "Look for logical causes that explain the phenomena. People are flawed. Our observational abilities aren’t perfect, and there are all kinds of different potential reasons someone might believe they’ve experienced something paranormal. Begin every investigation by assuming there’s a non-paranormal explanation and seek to explain it. This way, you’ll quickly rule out any non-starter cases. [17] X Research source Strange noises may be explained by house settling, animals in the walls, or changes in weather causing building materials to crack. Poor central air systems, inefficient ductwork, and drafty windows can explain temperature changes. Gas leaks, carbon dioxide, and radon can warp someone’s experiences and make people think they’re seeing or hearing things that aren’t there. Dementia, Alzheimer’s, vision problems, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia can all cause people to see, hear, or experience things incorrectly."

If you can experience something firsthand, you may get all of the evidence you need right there! [18] X Research source Use your notes from the witness to guide your interactions here. If they mention feeling like something was angry, you might say, “Hello, I know you’re upset, but I’m not here to hurt you.” Try asking for proof. You might say, “If you’re here, can you give me sign? Can you make a noise or knock something over?”"

If you spot any strange readings that cannot be explained by logic or science, it is possible that you’ve encountered something paranormal. [19] X Research source A hot air duct or an increase in electromagnetic waves around a radio are probably not paranormal events. It’s important to take all of your evidence into account, though. If you’re performing a larger investigation, it may be helpful to take notes or build a map of the site."

[20] X Research source It is perfectly okay to have an inconclusive investigation. If your client is paying you, type up a short report explaining everything you experienced and measured."
