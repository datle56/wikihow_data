More likely than not it will be a .mov, .avi, or .mp4 file. You do not need to adjust the movie file at all. Simply place it in its own folder, unless it’s already in one. You need the movie file in a folder by itself, with the .SRT file you will download, for your video player to add the subtitles. You cannot add subtitles to a DVD without advanced software. This method works for movie files you have on your computer because you purchased or downloaded them."

For example, if you want Indonesian subtitles for X-Men: First Class , you might search for \"X-Men: First Class Indonesian Subtitles.\" You can find .SRT files on websites such as OpenSubtitles or SubSource . Subtitle files will usually end in the extension .SRT, and are simply the words and the times that each title needs to play during the movie. Some older subtitle files might end in the extension .SUB. Make sure you avoid any pop-ups and only download .SRT or .SUB files. If you feel unsafe on a site, leave and find another. These files are small and not likely to contain viruses. [1] X Research source"

Repeat across the movie, marking \"Complete\" when finished. Download the .SRT file and place it in the same folder as your movie."

The drawback to this format is that the movie will need to be saved as a separate file and you will not be able to turn the subtitles off. They will now be part of the movie."

      "content": "Be thoughtful when creating translated subtitles. As anyone who has ever used Google Translate can tell you, translations are as much an art form as a science. If you're subtitling the scene itself into the original or a new language, there are several considerations you need to come up with for each line: What is the goal of the dialogue? Regardless of the words they use, what feeling is the character trying to get across? This is your guiding principle when translating. How can you fit the subtitled words within the time the character is speaking? Some writers will display a few lines of dialogue at once, starting a little early and ending late to give viewers a chance to read everything. How do you handle slang and figures of speech? Look up the meaning of foreign expressions and slang. They often do not translate well, so you'll have to substitute slang or figurative language from your native language."
