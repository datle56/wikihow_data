A part-time employee that works 20 hours a week counts as 0.5 FTE. If you add all of the weekly hours of your employees and divide it by the hours in the workweek, you’ll determine how many full-time equivalent employees your business has. [1] X Research source You can find the FTE for any amount of time. To get FTE for the year, divide the total annual hours worked by 2080, which assumes a 40-hour workweek for 52 weeks of the year. To calculate for the month, divide by 173.33, which is equivalent to 2080 hours divided by 12 months. You can also use an online calculator if you don’t want to manually calculate FTEs. For the most accurate FTE calculation, hire a tax lawyer or accountant to calculate them for you."

One works 15 hours a week for 30 weeks, and the other 2 work 20 hours for 40 weeks each. The first employee works: 15 hours x 30 weeks = 450 hours. The second and third employee work: 20 hours x 40 weeks x 2 employees = 1,600 hours. Add the hours together: 450 hours for 30 weeks + 1,600 hours for 40 weeks = 2,050 part-time hours for the year."

Full-time employees usually work 40 hours each week for over 120 days a year, but it also includes anyone who works more than 30 hours weekly. Add all of the hours from full-time workers together to use for your calculation. [3] X Research source Example: You have 6 full-time employees working 40 hours a week. 40 hours x 6 employees = 240 weekly hours. Multiply the hours by 52 (weeks in a year) to determine full-time annual hours: 52 weeks x 240 hours = 12,480 annual full-time hours. If your business has a 32- or 35-hour workweek, then multiply the number of employees by that amount instead of 40."

Since each full-time employee counts as 1 FTE, they should each get a similar amount of work done during the day. If there are full-time employees getting less work done than others, then they aren’t working as effectively and can use improvement. [7] X Research source Example: If a full-time employee and part-time employee are getting the same amount of work done, then the full-time employee is only working with an efficiency of 0.5 FTE. The full-time employee either needs additional tasks to fill their time or to be talked to about their performance."
