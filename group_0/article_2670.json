Many goths listen to many other different genres, too, but there are certain ones which are considered goth whereas others are considered goth-friendly. It doesn't mean you can't listen to them, it just means that you won't make you \"goth\" if you only listen to those goth-friendly genres. Musical goth characteristics include an echoing tribal beat, 4 / 4 post punk beat or drum machine, funeral synthesizers, flanging guitars that produced cold and brittle effects, distorted guitars, a prominent lead bassline and deep eerie baritone vocals, usually in men.

Learning and listening to the most popular goth bands are good, and they will definitely earn you goth points on your goth card (see \"goth slang\") but finding underground or local goth bands is something you should definitely do, too. Most people stop at the most popular goth bands, but the most recent and underground ones deserve some recognition, in order to keep the goth scene alive. Check the \"goth/alternative rock\" sections of Discogs, Bandcamp.com, Last.fm and Soundclick.com and see what you can find. Be warned, though, because a lot of music is usually mislabelled and is actually metal, EBM or electronic which are separate scenes/genres of music. Ask other goths for their Last.fm, personal goth playlists and Bandcamp profiles. Use dark/alternative radio stations to find other goth/alternative bands such as nightbreedradio.com, and deathrockradio."

The deathrock revival of the 00s showed bands dressing more colourfully and adding into their sound, but not in a way that changed it into something completely different. All Gone Dead are a good example of this. Darkwave bands mixing minimal wave into their music has become more prevalent, bands such as Boy Harsher, Hante and TRAITRS being a good example of this. Check out some of these modern bands on Bandcamp and YouTube. Bands include: NU:N Lebanon Hanover Ash Code She Past Away Drab Majesty Boy Harsher TRAITRS Cold Cave Hante Angels of Liberty Grooving in Green Delving into modern artists means you have more chance of seeing them live as they are more likely to be active.

They had their creativity and what they found in local thrift stores to work with, meaning there was no \"set\" goth style (although it ended up looking similar in the end). As punk is DIY, that means goth is too, and will always be a big part of it. Start experimenting with clothes yourself, and make sure they are cheap enough so that if you mess up, you aren't too bothered about it. There are several goth DIY tutorials on YouTube and on blogs to follow if you have no ideas. Meanwhile, some simple tips include: Buy or paint patches of your favourite band/anything from Etsy.com and eBay and sew them onto your jacket/garment of clothing. Buy or make your own goth band/logo pins and do the same to them as you did with the patches. Learn how to make jewellery, you can even sell it and begin your own business. Cut up old clothes with patterns on and stitch patches onto clothes. Tartan or leopard print patches look great against black jackets. Buy some safety pins and get creative with them, use them to pin jackets together or simply make patterns on your clothes. Bleach clothes to create permanent patterns in them. Clothes that have creative distressing, whether that's rips, tears, or just unique necklines, can contribute to your goth look.

Creating a space for yourself will put you in a headspace where youâ€™re better shielded from the negativity of others.
