      "content": "Understand how the chickenpox virus spreads. The virus is highly contagious and spreads in the air through particles that come from the lesions (sores) on the skin or from the upper respiratory tract. You can also get the virus if you touch the open lesions on an infected person and then touch your face, nose, or mouth. The disease takes 10 to 21 days (15-16 days, on average) after exposure to develop. If you’re in close contact with someone who has chickenpox and you don’t have immunity, there’s about a 90% chance you’ll get it. The person with the virus is contagious from 1 to 2 days before the rash breaks out on the skin and will continue to be contagious until ALL the lesions have crusted over. This typically happens around 5 days after the rash first appears. Some people who get vaccinated may suffer from breakthrough varicella, which is a mild form of the chickenpox that includes a rash of less than 50 lesions and a slight fever. These individuals are also contagious. However, those with breakthrough varicella are only one third as contagious as those who were not vaccinated."

      "content": "Wear a mask to protect yourself from droplet transmission. Take precautions when caring for an individual with chickenpox to reduce the risk of droplet infection. Wear a facemask to prevent secretions from entering your mouth and nose. A facemask should always be worn before being in the same room with the patient and a new mask should be used each time you wear one. Wear gloves, a gown, and goggles or a face mask if the individual is sneezing, coughing, or producing a lot of nasal secretions. Droplets from a sneeze can travel through the air for up to 200 feet, so it is crucial to protect yourself. [1] X Research source The varicella zoster virus is spread through droplet transmission or from direct contact with the individual or touching objects or clothing that were in contact with the infected individual. Droplets may come from a sneeze, cough, speaking, nasal secretions, and saliva."

If you don’t remember whether you had the chickenpox or not, you were born after 1980, and you do not have family members who can remember, your doctor can draw a blood titer. This is a blood test that measures the antibodies in your blood for the chickenpox virus.

Although most research has been done on vaccinations prior to exposure to the virus, vaccination after exposure does offer some effective protection. However, it is important to get the vaccine within 3-5 days of exposure to the illness for the best results. If you have not had the chickenpox nor received the vaccination, speak with your physician about being vaccinated. Some people who get the vaccine will get a mild case of chickenpox with fewer blisters than normal and often no fever at all.

Let your doctor know if you have any serious health conditions, such as heart disease or a history of blood clots or stroke.
