Then remove the tuning slide (or both if you have a Bb/F trigger trombone). Now you should have four (or five) parts in the water. Include the mouthpiece and you will have five (or six.)"

Spray the tuning slide with the penetrating oil and let it sit for a few minutes, before wiping away as much \"gunk\" as possible. If the horn has not been cleaned in a while, you may have to repeat this process several times. [4] X Research source"
