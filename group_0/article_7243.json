This means that if your smartphone supports HDMI Alt mode, you can connect your phone to a TV, monitor, or projector using a USB-C to HDMI cable. You do not need to use an adapter. Due to the popularity of DisplayPort technology (and the prevalence of HDMI-out ports on laptops), HDMI Alt Mode will not be around for much longer.

      "title": "Use a USB-C to HDMI cable.",
      "content": "Use a USB-C to HDMI cable. Simply connect the USB Type-C end to the charging port on your phone, then connect the HDMI end to an HDMI port on your display or TV. If you're connecting to a TV, use the remote control to select the HDMI source to mirror your phone's screen . If you don't have a USB-C to HDMI cable, you can use an adapter. The adapter will either have an HDMI cable attached to it, or an HDMI port that allows you to connect a separate HDMI cable. This allows you to connect your phone to a display using standard HDMI and USB Type-C cables. If you have an older phone that has a Micro USB port instead of a USB-C, you'll first need to check to make sure your device supports MHL. If it does, then you can use a Micro USB to HDMI adapter to connect your phone to an HDMI-enabled display."
