      "title": "Get into an active stance so you can move around easily.",
      "content": "Get into an active stance so you can move around easily. Keep most of your weight on the balls of your feet and bend your knees slightly so you’re able to move around quickly. Turn your body to the side so your dominant side is furthest from your opponent. Keep your hands level with your cheeks so you’re able to throw punches quickly while also being able to defend yourself. [1] X Research source You can choose to keep your hands in open palms or make fists in your neutral stance. Avoid tensing your body up since you won’t be able to maneuver as effectively. You may also stand with your dominant side closest to your opponent, but you may not be able to throw a punch as well."

      "title": "Make tight fists that are in line with your elbows when you punch.",
      "content": "Make tight fists that are in line with your elbows when you punch. Curl your fingers so the tips dig into the center of your palm. Try to make the front of your fist as flat as you’re able so you don’t hurt yourself when you throw a punch. Wrap your thumb around the bottom of your fist and apply pressure to make your fist tighter. Keep the back of your hand in a straight line with your forearm to keep the wrist locked. Don’t wrap your fingers around your thumb since you may end up hurting yourself when you throw a punch . Avoid bending your wrist when you make a fist or else your punch won’t be as powerful when it lands and you could get a sprain."

    {
      "title": "Aim for vulnerable areas to hurt your opponent more.",
      "content": "Aim for vulnerable areas to hurt your opponent more. The most vulnerable places on the face include the eyes, ears, and nose. If you want the fight to end quickly, direct your punches toward these areas to hurt your opponent and make them less able to fight back effectively. If you have trouble hitting your opponent in the face, try going for their neck or throat to stun them. [2] X Research source You should always respect your opponent - don't use any dishonorable tricks, don't fight dirty and never attack them from behind. Make sure it's a fair fight. Try kicking your opponent in the crotch or their knees to help take them down faster so you’re able to get away."

    {
      "title": "Throw a jab with the arm that’s furthest from your opponent.",
      "content": "Throw a jab with the arm that’s furthest from your opponent. Start by holding your fists up so they’re level with your cheeks. When you throw the punch, quickly extend your dominant arm and twist your palm so it faces down. As your arm goes forward, rotate your dominant shoulder forward to get more power from your punch. Aim for your opponent’s nose, eyes, or jaw to stun them. [3] X Research source Alternate which hand you jab with to get off multiple, rapid hits. Keep your other hand in front of your face so you can block your opponent if they try to hit you."

    {
      "title": "Practice throwing hooks so your opponent doesn’t see the punch.",
      "content": "Practice throwing hooks so your opponent doesn’t see the punch. Hooks are powerful punches that you throw from the side to catch your opponent off guard. Aim for your opponent’s cheek or jaw when you throw the punch. Make sure to lock your wrist so the back of your hand stays in line with your elbow to get the most power. [4] X Research source Put your hands up with open palms to make it look like you don’t want to fight anymore before throwing a hook with the arm you have out in front. This can be a great way to surprise your opponent and stun them."

    {
      "title": "Try a headbutt to stun your opponent.",
      "content": "Try a headbutt to stun your opponent. If you’re close enough to your opponent, you may be able to land a headbutt in order to daze them. Quickly tilt your neck back before slamming it forward into your opponent’s nose or the space between their eyes. Use the top of your forehead since it’s the strongest spot and will hurt you the least. [5] X Research source Headbutts are illegal in most official fights, such as mixed martial arts. Headbutting someone could also knock them unconscious."

    {
      "title": "Watch your opponent so you can anticipate their movements.",
      "content": "Watch your opponent so you can anticipate their movements. Always keep your eyes on your opponent, specifically watching their eyes and their arms. Pay attention to their movements so you can guess where they plan on punching you. If you need to look somewhere else, quickly glance away before returning your gaze back to your opponent. [6] X Research source While it’s important to always watch your opponent, be aware of your surroundings so you don’t get backed into a corner or trip on something."

    {
      "title": "Stand with your body turned to the side so you’re harder to hit.",
      "content": "Stand with your body turned to the side so you’re harder to hit. Stand so the non-dominant side of your body faces your opponent with your shoulder out in front. Keep your chest and hips facing toward the side since that gives your opponent fewer opportunities to punch you. Shift your weight onto the balls of your feet so you can easily move around and dodge hits if you need to. [7] X Research source Avoid standing with your body square to your opponent since they will easily be able to punch your chest or stomach. Crouch down slightly to make it more difficult for your opponent to hit you. However, keep in mind that when you’re crouched, your opponent may be able to kick or knee you in the face easier."

    {
      "title": "Guard your face with your hands and arms so you can block punches.",
      "content": "Guard your face with your hands and arms so you can block punches . Keep your hands up near your cheeks so you can react quickly when they throw a punch. When you see a punch coming toward your head, raise your forearms in front of your face to block their fist easier. Tense up your arms to brace yourself better and prevent them from making solid contact. [8] X Research source Make sure you’re still able to see your opponent while you’re blocking or else they could get a punch off that you aren’t expecting. Tuck your head down when you’re expecting a punch to help protect sensitive areas, like your eyes and nose."

    {
      "title": "Push your opponent away to get more distance between you.",
      "content": "Push your opponent away to get more distance between you. When your opponent is in between punches or after you land a punch, open your fists and push your opponent away as hard as you can. This can help you get back into an optimal stance and prepare for the next punch while your opponent tries to recover. [9] X Research source Aim to push your opponent by their shoulders or chest so you can throw them off balance. Take the opportunity while your opponent’s trying to recover to land another punch so you can get a leg up on the fight."

    {
      "title": "Roll your body away from a punch to help deflect it.",
      "content": "Roll your body away from a punch to help deflect it. You won’t be able to block every hit, so you will have to take a few punches . When you get hit, twist your body in the direction your opponent’s punching so you don’t get hit as hard and their fist rolls off your body. Always turn your body away from the hit rather than into it, or else you’ll get hurt more often during the fight. [10] X Research source If you’re unable to turn away completely, you may try ducking from side to side to make it harder for your opponent to hit you."

    {
      "title": "Never run away like a coward.",
      "content": "Never run away like a coward. Instead, talk your opponent out of fighting and convince them to change their life - they may even become your friend in the future, so be respectful. [11] X Research source It’s okay to yell out or call for help if you need it. Contact police or law enforcement if you’re worried about your safety after the fight."
