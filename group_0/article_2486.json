      "title": "Get in the right frame of mind.",
      "content": "Get in the right frame of mind. Pit bulls are known to be stubborn, so you will have to be firm and consistent when getting them used to bathing. Set aside enough time for the bath, since you will be less stressed if you are not pressed for time. Maintain control of the situation and let your pit bull know that you are in charge. [2] X Research source It is easier if you can get your pit bull used to baths when they are young."

      "title": "Introduce your dog to the bath routine.",
      "content": "Introduce your dog to the bath routine. If your dog runs away and hides when it is bath time, you will need to approach the situation with a calm demeanor and incorporate lots of rewards and treats. [3] X Research source Be calm; talk with your pet in a reassuring voice. If you are low key and not agitated, your dog is more likely to remain somewhat calm as well. Coax your pit bull into an empty tub and reward them with a treat. It is useful to do this for a few times a day in the week leading up to the bath. Let your pit bull just spend time in an empty tub."

      "title": "Select an appropriate shampoo for your pit bull.",
      "content": "Select an appropriate shampoo for your pit bull. Do not use human shampoo for your dog, because ingredients in them (like fragrance) can irritate your pit bull’s skin. [4] X Research source Read all instructions on the shampoo to see whether it needs to be diluted. You can also check the label to see how long the shampoo should remain on the dog before rinsing. [5] X Research source Ask your veterinarian for recommendations on shampoos that would work well for your pit bull. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Put on old clothes. Odds are, you will get as wet as your dog during the bath. If you have on old clothes, or even a bathing suit, you will be happier after the bath."

      "title": "Gather your supplies and prepare the bathtub.",
      "content": "Gather your supplies and prepare the bathtub. The whole bathing process will go more smoothly if you have everything you need and aren’t rushing around trying to find extra towels or dog shampoo. Have extra towels nearby and lining the floor, so no one slips during or after the bath. Place a non-skid mat in your tub so your dog doesn’t slip and get hurt during the bath. Keep your dog’s brush and shampoo within reach, so your pet doesn’t escape the tub while you go searching for the shampoo. Stock some treats in the bathroom to use as rewards during the bath."

      "content": "Take your dog for a long walk or run. After vigorous exercise, your dog won’t have as much energy to resist a bath. Additionally, if they are hot and sweaty, they may welcome a bath. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Brush your pit bull thoroughly. Although brushing your pit bull should be a regular part of your grooming routine, it is also important to brush your pit bull right before bath time. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source This pre-bath brushing will help remove any dead hair. Matted hair will hold onto water and not dry well, resulting in irritated skin. By brushing before the bath, you can eliminate this issue. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove your dog’s collar and put a leash or tether on your dog. A leather collar can shrink when wet and irritate your dog’s skin. You can replace it with a temporary nylon collar. Leashing your dog will keep them in place and help prevent them from escaping. This will help keep things less messy, and it can prevent injury from a wet dog running around the bathroom or house. [10] X Research source If your dog tends to bite when in the bath, consider using a muzzle at bathtime."

      "title": "Protect your dog’s ears and eyes.",
      "content": "Protect your dog’s ears and eyes. Water can irritate the delicate membranes in a dog’s eyes and ears. Keep this in mind as you’re bathing your pit bull. Because pit bulls are prone to ear infections, you need to keep their ears dry. Place a cotton ball in each of your pit bull’s ears to keep out water. Be sure the cotton balls are large enough not to be caught or lost in the ear canal. [11] X Research source Avoid spraying water directly on your pit bull’s head. This will help keep your dog’s eyes, mouth, and ears dry during the bath as well."

      "content": "Saturate your dog’s skin. Use a detachable shower spray nozzle or pitcher to completely wet your dog’s skin from the neck down (thus avoiding the eyes and ears).

      "content": "Rinse thoroughly, since any soap left on the skin can be irritating. Watch the water as it goes into the tub, and rinse until it runs clear. Rinse your dog’s head first, making sure to cover their eyes with one hand to prevent water from getting in them. If your dog is really muddy or dirty, you can repeat the shampoo step."

      "content": "Dry your dog and reward them for finishing the bath. After you’ve both survived the bath, you can relax and enjoy your fresh-smelling pit bull. Use your hands to squeeze or pat away excess water from your pit bull’s body. Gently remove the cotton balls from your pit bull’s ears, and dry them to remove any lingering water. Wrap your dog in a large, absorbent towel to thoroughly dry them. Some owners use a pet dryer or blow dryer on a low setting, but you must take care to watch the heat so your dog isn’t burned. Give a few treats and kisses for their good behavior in the tub. You can also crate your dog on a towel to help them dry without getting water all over the house. [14] X Research source"
