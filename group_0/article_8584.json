Vacuum the encasement area, then take out the air filter. [1] X Research source If the system isn’t turned off first, it will suck in debris during the cleaning process. Use a step ladder if the vent is up on the ceiling or a high wall. If you’re cleaning a portable air conditioning unit, be sure to unplug it. While the following steps are the general instructions for cleaning a home HVAC air filter, always check the instructions for your specific air filter model to ensure you clean it correctly. Make sure that your filter is reusable and washable."

Add some mild liquid detergent to 2 cups (470 mL) of warm water in a bowl. Stir the solution. Wet a cloth in the solution and wash both sides of your filter. Rinse the filter with water, and let it dry completely. [4] X Research source After the final rinse, shake off any excess water before setting the filter out to dry. Wash your filter with a soap solution if it’s been exposed to grease, smoke, or pet hair. If you’re cleaning an HVAC filter, you can use try white vinegar and water. Fill a bucket with equal parts hot water and white vinegar and allow your filter to soak for an hour. Then, rinse it with clean water. [5] X Research source"

[9] X Research source Don’t put the filter back when it’s still wet! This can damage the vehicle’s engine. Washing is riskier than vacuuming alone because of the serious damage it can cause. Drying time can take up to 24 hours, so make sure you give it enough time to dry completely before you need to use your car again."

After the rinse, the filter should dry in about 15 minutes, but allow it to sit longer if it isn’t thoroughly dry. Coat the filter thoroughly with a thin layer of air filter oil . Wipe off any excess oil from the cap and bottom lip of the filter. Allow the filter to sit for 20 minutes to absorb the oil. [11] X Research source"
