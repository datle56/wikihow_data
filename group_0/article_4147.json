While many banks (including PNC, Chase, and Bank of America) offer Zelle's services through their own app, they do not allow you to block other users. To use Zelle through the Zelle app and not through your banking app, connect your debit card rather than your bank account when first registering with Zelle. [1] X Research source If you are being overwhelmed with unwanted requests from another Zelle user via your banking app, consider contacting your bank's customer service line. You may also opt to deactivate \"Pay with Zelle\" entirely. Consider blocking another user's phone number entirely if you continue to receive unwanted Zelle requests via your banking app."
