Do this by placing all of your N64 ROM files in a single directory, and then click \"File\" â†’ \"Choose ROM Directory\" in Project64. You can right-click a game in your ROM directory list and select \"Edit Cheats\" to add cheats without having to start the game. You can't enable cheats until the game is running."

Expand the tree to see all of the available cheats. Selecting a cheat will usually provide a brief description and what it's used for. This isn't guaranteed for all cheats.

This is a common way to use a cheat that is slightly modified for similar items. For example, a (=> ?) cheat might modify your character's inventory, and each variable is a different piece of equipment. If you don't select the variable before trying to use the cheat code in the game, nothing will happen. Each variable should have a brief description when you open the list. The first few characters are the part of the cheat code that refers to that variable, and can be ignored when browsing the list."
