      "content": "The X Media Studio is a built-in tool to manage your X accounts. It is especially handy if you run multiple accounts that produce monetized content. There are five tools included in the X Media Studio: [3] X Research source Library: The Library allows you to see all of the media content that's been posted on your account. This includes videos, GIFs, and images. You can also use the media library to upload media that you can post to your X account. [4] X Research source Analytics: The Analytics tool allows you to see various analytic data for your posts and media. This includes total views, organic views, promoted views, video completion rate, average watch time, country of viewership, and platform of viewership. [5] X Research source Producer: Producer allows users to go live on X using streaming software and external cameras (i.e. not your phone camera). Producer also saves your past broadcasts and includes some analytics for your broadcasts. [6] X Research source LiveCut: LiveCut is a video editing tool included with Producer. LiveCut allows you to take clips from current or past live broadcasts and edit them so you can post them on your X account. [7] X Research source Monetization: The X Media Studio has two ways to monetize your videos: Amplify Pre-roll and Amplify Sponsorships. Amplify Pre-roll allows you to add pre-roll ads to your videos, as long as your content is brand-safe. Amplify Sponsorships is a program that connects you with advertisers who want to advertise to your audience. In both cases, you'll need to work with your X account manager to learn more.
