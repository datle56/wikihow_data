      "title": "Decide how often to clean the bowl.",
      "content": "Decide how often to clean the bowl. The main way to keep a fish bowl clean is to change some of the water in it. However, this process can stress or even kill the fish by disrupting the bacterial and chemical contents of the water. Follow this guide to keep your bowl contents healthy without changing the water unnecessarily often. Do also keep in mind that round containers such as bowls have been known to stress fish out and shorten their life. Yes, they can survive in a bowl, but they will not be truly happy. : [2] X Research source Clean 0.5 gallon (2 liter) bowls daily, 1.5 gal. (6 L) bowls three times a week, and bowls 3 gal. (12 L) and up twice a week. Ammonia levels rise quicker than you may know it. If your bowl has a filter, then you can cycle the bowl (which might be hard considering bowls are tiny and not humane), then you can clean the bowl once a week. Don't ever clean the bowl once a month. If the bowl is big enough, then you can keep the betta fish in the bowl while you clean it and change 50% of the water. Doing that will help the betta fish to not be stressed. There are not a lot of filter options for small fish tanks, so they usually require more frequent upkeep than large fish tanks."

      "title": "Choose new water.",
      "content": "Choose new water. During the cleaning and water change, you'll remove about 20%–25% of the water in your fish bowl. The replacement water should be prepared at least 30 minutes in advance, to allow time for treatments to work. You may use tap water, distilled water, or rainwater, but be sure to follow the advice below to make it safe for your betta. Leave this out at room temperature in a clean, soap-free container while you clean the tank. Do not use rainwater in an area with acid rain."

      "title": "Add a dechlorinator to tap water.",
      "content": "Add a dechlorinator to tap water. This is sold at pet stores as \"dechlorination tablets\" or \"water conditioner,\" and are used to break down chlorine and other chemicals harmful to fish. Add this to the tap water, following the instructions to treat the amount of new water you are adding. This usually takes at least 30 minutes to take effect. [3] X Research source Skip this step if using distilled water or rainwater."

      "title": "Add aquarium salt (optional).",
      "content": "Add aquarium salt (optional). Aquarium salt for betta fish or goldfish can be added but is never recommended for long term use. Aquarium salt is not in fish's wild habitat, so is not recommended. This step is only recommended if the water in the bowl is 100% distilled water. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Check the temperature.",
      "content": "Check the temperature. Betta fish are tropical fish, and prefer temperatures around 74–82–F (23-28ºC), or just a little warmer than \"room temperature.\" If the new water is not near this temperature, or if it feels colder or warmer than the water in the fishbowl, leave it in a warm room until it reaches a safe temperature.

      "title": "Move the betta if the bowl is small.",
      "content": "Move the betta if the bowl is small. Leaving the betta in the tank is usually best for the fish. However, if the fish bowl is too small to easily reach in and clean without hitting the fish or blocking its access to the air, move the fish before cleaning. Transfer some water from the fish bowl to a clean, soap-free container, then use a fishnet to transfer the betta. [7] X Research source Leave at least 3 inches (7.5 centimeters) of space above the water level in the new container, so the betta cannot jump out."

      "content": "Scrub the inside with a brand new sponge or cloth. Even tiny traces of soap or other substances can harm your fish. Use a brand new sponge, or a cloth that has recently been through a washing and rinsing cycle and not used for any purpose since then. Rub the inside of the bowl in circular motions to remove slime and dirt. A sponge attached to a handle may be the easiest tool to use. You can use the same sponge to clean off rocks and other decorations too."

      "content": "Return the betta to the bowl. If you removed the betta fish for cleaning, use a fishnet to transfer it back into the bowl. If you are worried that the water temperature has changed, or if you accidentally changed more than 50% of the water, instead transfer the fish and the water it's swimming in to a small plastic bag. Float this bag on the surface of the bowl for 15–20 minutes, then let the fish swim into the bowl and remove the bag."

      "content": "Use this method only when absolutely necessary. You do not need to do a major cleaning unless the bowl has developed slime or grime you cannot scrub off, or if the water has become permanently cloudy. The more involved the cleaning is, and the more water you replace, the more stressed your fish will be. If the fish bowl is an adequate size for your betta fish, at least 3 gal. (6 L), you will only need to clean it this way once or twice a year."

Use tap water treated with dechlorination tablets, freshly collected rainwater, or distilled water treated with aquarium salts. Check the water temperature to make sure it matches the water in the fish bowl. See the preparation section for more information on preparing aquarium water."

Even if the water looks filthy, do not transfer your betta to a container of new water. The shock could kill it. Keeping the old water also insures that you will still have useful bacteria in your fish bowl, which will break down otherwise harmful chemicals produced by your fish's waste."

Float the betta fish and the water it's been swimming in inside a small plastic bag, on top of the bowl water. After 15 minutes, pour a little of the bowl water into the bag. After 30 minutes, let the betta swim out of the bag into the rest of the bowl, and remove the bag."
