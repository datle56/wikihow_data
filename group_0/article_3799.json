      "content": "Start by researching. If you don't have a favorite anime series or movie, find out what that is first and then surf the web for fan sites so you can learn more about it and find out about similar anime. Go a little further in your research than just the plot or characters. If it's a historical anime, research the period in history. Find out what genre it is too. Wikipedia has a good article that breaks down the different anime genres."

      "content": "Consider buying some. After you have an idea of the anime you like, start investing some serious time into it...and cash. Most rental stores have an okay selection of anime now, and often Adult Swim has a decent anime lineup, but you'll probably have to buy most of what you watch (or, if you're lucky, you can borrow from or trade with friends). Price shop as much as possible, and go for box sets whenever you can. Don't forget about graphic novels!"
