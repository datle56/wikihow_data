      "title": "Heat up your silicone bakeware before cleaning.",
      "content": "Heat up your silicone bakeware before cleaning. For extra tough greasy stains, it can be beneficial to heat your silicone bakeware up in the oven before cleaning. Preheat your oven to 350 °F (177 °C). Once the oven is fully preheated, put the silicone bakeware into the oven for ten minutes. This will help heat up the food stains that are stuck on the bakeware and make them easier to clean.

[8] X Research source Additionally, using cooking sprays with silicone bakeware will contribute to the sticky, greasy mess you have to clean up later and cause more damage to your pan over time."
