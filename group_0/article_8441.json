      "content": "Remove all fur from the brush or comb. Before preparing your cleaning solution, pick out visible hairs and dirt from the brush’s pad and bristles. You can do this with your thumb and forefinger, or with an old toothbrush or comb. Don’t worry if you can’t dig out every last speck of visible dirt or dander. The soak will loosen up and extract most things, so just aim to remove the most glaring clumps of hair and buildup."

      "title": "Prepare a solution of water and vinegar or shampoo.",
      "content": "Prepare a solution of water and vinegar or shampoo. Depending on your preference, you can add vinegar or pet shampoo to a large mixing bowl of warm water. A vinegar-based solution should contain equal parts vinegar—either white or apple cider varieties will do—and water. If you're using shampoo, you only need to add two or three generous squirts to a bowl full of water. When choosing a pet shampoo, check the label in order to avoid harmful ingredients such as carcinogens, tar, propylene glycol, or perfumes. If possible, opt for an organic shampoo with few ingredients. [2] X Research source"

[4] X Research source Pet brushes and combs are generally made of plastic, but if you own one with a fabric pad, don’t soak the entire head of the brush. If you do, moisture can accumulate in the fabric and eventually cause mold. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Rinse with clean water. After soaking, your brush or comb will still have some residual dirt or hairs clinging to the bristles or pad.

While vinegar and shampoos have some antibacterial properties, you should apply a separate, stronger disinfectant if you’re worried about germs, viruses, or other bacteria. You can buy aerosol, enzymatic, or essential oil disinfecting sprays from the store, or you can make your own solution with water and 10% bleach. If you have a lot of tools to clean, you might want to consider purchasing an ultraviolet light. Since UV light kills bacteria, you can lay all of your implements under the light to dry rather spraying each one individually."

      "content": "Inspect brushes and combs for signs of wear. Even the most diligently cleaned brush or comb will eventually show signs of wear and tear.

      "content": "Store tools in a dry, warm space. You probably know that you should keep brushes and combs away from chewing, playing animals, but keeping them out of reach from your pets isn’t the only criterion for safe storage. Your grooming tools also need a warm, dry area to reside in between use, as cold temperatures keep germs alive longer, and moist conditions promote the growth of mold. If you live in a particularly humid climate, you might want to purchase a dehumidifier to keep your brushes dry. Just be aware that dehumidifiers can corrode a rubber pad, so opt for hard plastic brushes if you’re going to use one."

Some owners prefer to do so after every use, while others prefer a weekly or even biweekly schedule. Whatever schedule you decide on, be aware that you’ll need to clean your brushes more frequently any time your pet is experiencing a skin irritation, pest problem, or other virus."
