The cup will either be a separate part, or listed separately on the jockstrap packaging. Cups should hold your genitals completely, comfortably, and snugly. Leg straps should be tight enough to prevent twisting. Many brands of jock make use of brand-particular size ranges, so be sure to check the size range. In most cases, though, you can expect: [4] X Research source Small sizes to range between 20 and 26 in (50.8 and 66 cm). Medium sizes to range between 26 and 32 in (66 and 81.3 cm). Large sizes to range between 32 and 38 in (81.3 and 96.5 cm). XL sizes to range between 38 and 44 in (96.5 and 111.8 cm).

For low-contact activities where you still want some protection, you might use a soft cup or flex cup, which are more comfortable. Depending on the jockstrap you buy, you'll likely have two styles of cup to choose from: The traditional protective cup is an upside-down pear-shaped, hollow, plastic cover. This style is ideal for most genital sizes and shapes. The banana cup has a longer up-and-down shape than the traditional cup. This style is most suitable for larger genitalia, especially genitals that are longer than average."

Because hockey players wear so much padding to keep warm and protect themselves from damaging hockey pucks, hockey jocks often have special clips or garters to help hold up socks and keep your gear tight to your body. Two common other varieties of jock include: Swim jocks, which generally have a narrower waistband than traditional kinds of jockstrap. Windproof jocks, which include a layer of cloth or fabric to provide additional protection against wind and cold in winter sports. [10] X Research source"
