      "content": "Pull away the caulk. You might be able to pull it away by hand, but since gutter caulk can be thick, you may need to grip onto it using needle-nose pliers. Either way, most of the old caulk should come up."

Follow by scrubbing the area with a solution made with 1/3 cup (80 ml) bleach and 1 gallon (4 liters) of water. Cleaning the area will remove any fungi or decayed leaves that may have worked their way into the cracking caulk."

      "title": "Let the area dry.",
      "content": "Let the area dry. Before applying new caulk, the area should be completely dry. Allowing the area to air dry is best, but if rain, other precipitation, or humidity threatens to create a problem, dry it out by hand using a clean, dry towel. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a silicone caulk.",
      "content": "Use a silicone caulk. Silicone caulk maintains its integrity in sunlight and extreme temperatures better than latex caulk and it also lasts longer under most circumstances. [5] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 30 July 2021. Moreover, silicone caulk also works better in gaps that expand and contract, which gutters often do in response to changes in temperature. If you have white gutters, use a white caulk. If your gutters are painted in another color, choose a clear caulk. [6] X Research source If possible, go with a caulk that is specifically formulated for gutters. Gutter caulks are designed to work in the conditions gutters face, and as such, they last much longer than non-gutter caulks. Don't use caulk that's labeled for interior use, like your kitchen or bathroom. [7] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 30 July 2021."

      "title": "Roughen the surface.",
      "content": "Roughen the surface. Rub the edge of the seam with sandpaper or a wire brush using steady, even pressure. Caulk, especially silicone caulk, adheres better to a surface that is slightly rough and uneven than it does to a perfectly smooth surface. The gutters do not need to be jagged, but it helps if the metal is a little coarse."

      "content": "Apply the caulk in a straight, small bead across the seam. Start at the front of the seam and gradually pull the trigger of the caulking gun. As you squeeze, a small dot of caulk should emerge from the nozzle. Drag the nozzle down the length of the seam, applying even pressure on the trigger to maintain the same size dot along the entire seam.
