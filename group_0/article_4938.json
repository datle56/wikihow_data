Give the department the address of your property so they can tell you where the edges of your property line are. They will also let you know if there are any rules for your fence, such as the maximum post height allowed. [1] X Research source Take notes while you’re on the phone so you don’t forget any of the regulations you need to follow. Most fences don’t require a building permit, but ask the zoning department if you need one."

Tell the companies that you plan on digging on your property and give them your address. Within the next 2–3 days, workers from the utility companies will come to your property and paint lines on the ground where there are pipes or wires underground.

Make a copy of the property survey and draw the layout for your fence on it with a pencil and straightedge. Draw the fence design proportionate to the rest of the property survey so you can see how long it will be and how many materials you need. [3] X Research source If you don’t have a copy of your property survey, talk to the attorney or realtor that closed the sale of your home. If you aren’t able to make a copy of your property survey, place a piece of tracing paper over it before you start drawing."

      "content": "Drive stakes into your yard for the corners and end posts of the fence. Look at the plan for your design and locate where your fence has 90-degree corners or comes to an end. Push a wooden stake into the ground so it’s 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) past where you want the center of the post. Extend a measuring tape from the stake to the nearest corner or end post and push in the next stake. Continue around the perimeter of the fence design placing stakes.

Loop a piece of mason string, which is a long spool of thick cord, around the stake so it’s 6 inches (15 cm) off the ground and secure it with a knot. Pull the string tight and extend it to the nearest stake marking a corner or end post. Cut the piece of string so you have 3 inches (7.6 cm) of excess and tie it tightly around the second stake. Continue tying new pieces of string between the stakes so it’s taut. [5] X Research source You can buy mason string from your local hardware or home improvement store. If you don’t have mason string, you can also use twine instead. Keeping the string 6 inches (15 cm) off the ground will help you measure your posts to ensure they are the same height."

Then measure 4 feet (1.2 m) down the piece of string perpendicular to the first one and place a piece of tape on it. Extend your tape measure between the pieces of tape to see if it measures 5 feet (1.5 m). If it doesn’t, move the corner stake over by 1 ⁄ 2 –1 inch (1.3–2.5 cm) before checking the measurement again. [6] X Research source The distance between the pieces of tape should be 5 feet (1.5 m) since the corner and the pieces of tape form a right triangle, which you can easily calculate the side lengths using the Pythagorean theorem. The theorem states a 2 + b 2 = c 2 , where c is the longest side opposite of the corner. If the sides a and b are 3 and 4 feet (0.91 and 1.22 m), then the equation would be (3) 2 + (4) 2 = c 2 . Simplify the equation to 9 + 16 = c 2 . Take the square root of each side to get √(9 + 16) = √c 2 . Simplify the equation to √25 = c. This means that c should equal 5 feet (1.5 m)."

Continue working around the perimeter of the string and adding new stakes for each of the fence posts.

      "content": "Buy outdoor-treated posts and boards for your fence. Avoid getting lumber that hasn’t been treated for outdoor use since it’s more likely to rot or deteriorate. Use 4 in × 4 in (10 cm × 10 cm) fence posts that are around 6–8 feet (1.8–2.4 m) long depending on the height for your fence. Choose 2 in × 4 in (5.1 cm × 10.2 cm) or 2 in × 6 in (5.1 cm × 15.2 cm) boards that are 8 feet (2.4 m) long to span horizontally between your posts. If you can’t afford all of the materials for your fence, buy enough to work on a 8–16 ft (2.4–4.9 m) section at a time. Divide the perimeter of the fence by 8 feet (240 cm) and multiply by 3 or 4 to find the total length of boards you need for the rails. For example, if the perimeter of your fence is 100 feet (30 m), then 100/8 = 12.5, which means you need 13 boards for 1 rail. To make a fence with 3 or 4 rails, you would need 39 or 52 boards respectively."

Then add 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water for each 50 pounds (23 kg) bag of concrete you used. Pour the water slowly so it soaks into the concrete powder and starts setting. [13] X Research source Buy quick-setting concrete from your local hardware store. To fill a hole that’s 30 inches (76 cm) deep and 12 inches (30 cm) wide, you usually need 4–5 bags that are 50 pounds (23 kg), but it will depend on the instructions on the label."
