If you act judgmental or with a dismissive attitude towards other people, they will most likely return the same negative feelings towards you. Making others feel welcomed and appreciated will go a long way towards your success in making friends. [1] X Expert Source Sirvart Mesrobian, PsyD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 13 July 2021. Interact with strangers nicely and calmly, request favors patiently, respond to others promptly and remember your pleases and thank-you's. Remember that everyone you're interacting with is human, too. Just because you're paying someone to wait on your table doesn't give you the right to be rude; treat them like you'd want to be treated if you were in their position. As J.K. Rowling put it, \"It's easier to see what someone is really like by how they treat their inferiors, not their equals.\""

[2] X Expert Source Sirvart Mesrobian, PsyD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 13 July 2021. If you always criticize yourself and seem to be unhappy with who you are, you run the risk of people feeling the same way about you. After all, if you aren't pleased with yourself, why should others be? The other side of the coin is just as bad -- too cocky and people will think you like yourself so much that no one else needs to. The aim is contentment, not excessive pride."

Usually, people can tell when someone is lying and fake; insincere people are not well-liked. People you want to be around should not tolerate liars. When someone asks, \"Does this make me look fat?\" (yes, it's a clich√©, but it's a classic example), make your comments gently, framed in a way that is unlikely to upset them. If you know your fashion, tell them WHY. They're sure to trust you knowing that you were honest and appreciate that you're helping them. It is a trickier idea to be brutally honest with someone who does not solicit your advice. Bringing up a comment like that can either generate appreciative responses or offended looks, depending on the person's personality, so judge the situation at your own risk. You should probably avoid initiating negative comments, no matter how truthful, with people whom you are not closely acquainted or good friends with."

When we humans engage in conversation, most of us are looking for someone to be genuinely interested in what we have to say -- the input of the other is secondary. Don't think you're being boring! You're letting the other person feel good about themselves. [3] X Expert Source Sirvart Mesrobian, PsyD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 13 July 2021. It's important to listen actively, though. If someone is going on and on about the most effective way to wash their dog, glazing over, while tempting, is not being a good listener. Try to engage your entire self at all times -- your eyes, the nodding of your head, commenting and questioning, and the positioning of your body -- it should all be focused on them."

A social jiu-jitsu master has someone walking away after a conversation feeling good and not realizing they didn't learn a dang thing about the other person because they were talking so much. Be that person. Ask who, why, or how. The other will feel appreciated, liked, and go on a spiel that takes the pressure off you. And they' ll like you for it.

If Jill from the office says, \"God, I just spend hours on this freakin' Powerpoint,\" jump in! Ask her what it was for, why it took longer than normal, or how she did the research.

Hearing our own name activates a region in our brains that remains dormant at any other sound [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source and we love it. Our names are our identity and conversing with someone who uses it makes us feel like our identity is acknowledged. So the next time you're speaking to that acquaintance, slip their name in. Odds are they'll feel a bond to you that may not exist otherwise. This is fairly easy to do. The most obvious way is to add it on to your greeting. \"Hey, Rob, how are you?\" is much more personal than, \"Hey, how are you?\" And if you're close enough to Rob to say, \"Hey, Rockin' Robby D! How are you, man?\" that works, too. Apart from greetings, it can be inserted casually just about anywhere. Initiating a conversation -- \"What do you think of this for my desktop, Rob?\" -- or just as a comment, \"Rob, you're being ridiculous again.\" Rob will practically feel like your best friend."

So know who you're dealing with. What do they like? What do they seem to value? What interests them? If you want to be genuinely liked ( being popular and being liked are not the same thing), you're in luck: generally, humans all like the same qualities. And no, wealth and attractiveness aren't high up on the list.

While it's very important to put in effort, put it in where it's due. Relationships are a give and take. If you're constantly the one making the effort, sending the texts, going out of your way to be nice and friendly, take a look at the situation. If there's an explanation (the person is going through a hard time, they work 60 hours a week, etc.), then you may have to do the brunt of the work.

If once in a while people have to laugh at you, great! If you can laugh too, you're good to go. That shows you're down-to-earth and not overly concerned with your image -- two very good things.

Think of happy thoughts or past moments that did make you grin to help trigger a genuine smile. If nothing else, people will be wondering what the heck you're smiling about!

If someone is saying something offhand, it's fine to lapse (you don't want to start a staring contest), but if they really care about the topic at hand, give them your attention. You'd want it, too! Some people have issues with eye contact -- they just can't really do it. If this is you, try tricking yourself and looking at the bridge of their nose or their eyebrows.

However, as it's supposed to be subconscious, don't mess with it too much -- you could become preoccupied! This is generally good when working with peers -- not when you're working with superiors. Recent research has said that the adverse effect can take place -- feelings of coldness, etc. -- when the two subjects aren't in an appropriate scenario (dealing with money, job issues, and so forth).

Show that you're not challenging the other person. Think of greeting someone. In that video where Bill Clinton and Nelson Mandela meet (two people that have the right to think they're each a pretty big deal), both show deference -- a slight lean-in and step forward, using the free arm for extra touch, smiling.

If you want to form a more concrete bond with someone, find small opportunities for touch. Appropriate touch, of course! A brush of the arm or shoulder or even a high-five. Those small moments get turned into connections when touch is added. Think of someone walking up to you and saying, \"Hi! How are you?\" Now imagine that same person walking up to you and saying, \"[Your name]! How are you?\" and lightly touching your arm as they pass.

And you've probably been around the opposite too -- people who make you feel appreciated and are quite clearly glad you're there. Which do you like more, even if you can't explain it? You can't expect people to like you if you can't say the same for yourself. Odds are you do like the people you want to like you (why else would you care?) so make it clear!

You probably know someone like this who you can emulate. This is very much so a 24/7 thing. It's gonna be hard to be positive in front of people when you're negative by yourself. You have to train your brain to have certain habits -- positivity being one of them. Try to always think positive even when you're alone; that way it can become old hat in no time. Know when to commiserate. There is a certain level of bonding that can be had over group complaining. Talking to your coworkers about how terrible the new boss is will foster friendship -- but if it's all you do, you'll be associated with negativity.

As long as you still feel you're being yourself, you're only building on your character, improving it. It may be scary, but it'll be worth it. There's a difference between wanting people to like you and needing to be liked in order to be happy. Your self-image should not be based on the approval of others; that will leave you hurting in no time. But if you are comfortable with yourself and just want to be well-received, that's respectable.

That personal negativity isn't becoming on anyone. So leave it at the door. It's not good for you and it's not good for your friendships. Insecurities are what we call the feelings we get and the behavior we display when we're uncomfortable with ourselves.

The simplest way to start is to stop. Stop the negativity in its track. When you catch yourself thinking something bad about yourself, don't finish the thought.

Everyone else wants to, they're just complacent. If there's someone you'd like to be friends with, start talking to them. It could be just the thing they were waiting for. It's impossible to be liked if you're not really a factor at all.
