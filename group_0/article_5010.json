These benefit the most from retaining walls [1] X Expert Source Agustin Renoj Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 13 January 2021. . Signs of soil erosion include exposed roots, patches of dead land, landscape changes (more bugs or worms, more rocks, soil that is suddenly denser and harder), and clumps of grass floating in nearby water. Just avoid locations where water tends to ooze up or stand—these are not good choices as the water will rot your wall and ruin it rather quickly. Select a location where the excavated soil will be roughly equal to the backfill material needed behind the wall."

      "content": "Clear and rake the area where you want to build your wall. Start by removing any garbage and rocks. Afterward, remove any plants by digging in a circle around the roots, taking care to cut through as many as possible. Once you've cut them, jam the shovel underneath the plant's roots and lever it up and out of the ground. After the area is clear, rake it smooth. Continue raking the soil until it's level. Destroy as many roots as you can to prevent them from regrowing."

      "content": "Purchase your wood pieces from a home hardware store. Determine how many 4 by 4 inch (10 cm × 10 cm) posts—spaced 3 feet (0.91 m) apart—you need for your retaining wall and purchase them from a local home hardware store. Afterward, purchase 2 by 6 inch (5.1 cm × 15.2 cm) boards to extend between your posts. Either have the staff cut your wood to size or purchase larger pieces to cut them to size on your own. Give yourself an additional 18 inches (46 cm) on top of your post height to go in the ground. If your retaining wall is going to be 40 feet (12 m) long, you need 14 posts—40 (length of the wall) divided by 3 (space between each post)—for your wall. If it's going to be 5 feet (1.5 m) tall, make sure your posts are 5 feet (1.5 m) tall with an additional 18 inches (46 cm) on top. In the previous example, if your wall is 5 feet (1.5 m) tall, you need to stack 10 pieces of 2 by 6 inch (5.1 cm × 15.2 cm) boards vertically—5 feet (1.5 m) divided by 6 inches (15 cm)—to create the height of the wall. Ask the staff to cut you 10 pieces 3 feet (0.91 m) long for every 2 posts."

      "content": "Cut your wood posts to length if they aren't already. If you didn’t get your wood pieces cut at the home hardware store, cut your posts to the size with a circular saw . Hold each piece of wood still with your non-dominant hand and guide the saw forward with your dominant hand. Apply downward pressure to each wood piece as you cut to keep it steady. After you're done, set your posts aside for later. [2] X Research source Let the shortest piece of your wood hang to prevent jamming."

      "content": "Mark your post hole locations on the ground with chalk. Each post should be 3 feet (0.91 m) away from each other—start by marking the first post location with chalk at one end of the wall. Now, move in 3 foot (0.91 m) increments along the line until you reach the end. [3] X Research source Use a taut string and stakes or a snapped chalk line to help you create a straight line. If you need to extend your wall with another post to create the final 3 feet (0.91 m) then do so. Space your posts 16 to 18 inches (41 to 46 cm) apart for load-bearing walls, which are walls that support something aside from their own weight such as a roof."

Once it's loose enough, dig out the middle with a trench shovel. Continue loosening and digging into the soil with each of your shovels. [4] X Expert Source Agustin Renoj Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 13 January 2021. [5] X Research source Call your local utility services number at least 3 to 4 days before digging to ensure it's legal and won't damage underground structures, such as power, sewer, water, or gas lines. Consider renting heavy equipment to dig your trench. Saw through large roots with a reciprocating saw or using the tip of your trench shovel. Use a steel bar to loosen rocks."

Do this as quickly as possible and make sure that they're perfectly vertical. If you have to, hold them in place with your hands until they settle into a vertical position. Make sure that they remain in place after letting them go. [7] X Research source You can also place 2 by 4 inch (5.1 cm × 10.2 cm) boards on either side of the posts to hold them in place."

Take care to ensure that the leftmost and rightmost part of each board aligns with the vertical center line of each post they connect to. If your boards are shorter than the length between your posts, cut them so that they sit in the middle of each post. Place 16 penny nails or deck screws between each deck board to space them enough for expansion."
