      "content": "Wear protective gear when handling bleach. Put on rubber gloves and safety goggles if you’re concerned about splashes. Wear old clothes you wouldn’t mind getting bleach on. A white t-shirt is a good choice since a bleach stain is unlikely to show up. Or you can cover your clothes with a plastic apron. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Ventilate your workspace. Open any doors or windows to create good airflow while you’re working. If your eyes are watering, you’re using too much bleach. Step away to get some fresh air and then dilute the bleach with more water. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep bleach and ammonia separate. These two chemicals create toxic fumes when mixed together. Do not combine them, and thoroughly wash any container that held one before filling it with the other. [4] X Research source The same applies to vinegar and rubbing alcohol, both of which should never be mixed with bleach."

      "title": "Check the tags of any item you intend to bleach.",
      "content": "Check the tags of any item you intend to bleach. If it says “no bleach,” do not attempt to bleach it; the garment could be ruined. If it says, “only non-chlorine bleach when needed,” this implies that non-chlorine bleach is safe occasionally, but continuous use could damage it. [5] X Research source If there are no words on the tag, look for a triangle shape with an open center. This is the symbol for an item that can be bleached. [6] X Research source Also look for the fabric composition of the item. If it’s cotton mixed with spandex, wool, or silk, avoid bleaching it since these materials can be ruined by bleach."

      "content": "Fill a bucket with cold water. Pour in enough water that the item can move freely in the solution. Be sure to either measure the water as you’re adding it or use a bucket with measurements up the side so that you know how much bleach to add."

      "content": "Pour in the bleach. Use ¼ cup (60 mL) of bleach for every gallon (3.8 L) of water. Stir with an old spoon you can dedicate just to laundry purposes. There are a variety of bleaching agents, such as sodium bisulfite and titanium dioxide. [7] X Expert Source Robert Shapiro Laundry Specialist Expert Interview. 24 August 2021. Use chlorine bleach if the item is white and non-chlorine bleach (sometimes called oxygen bleach) if the item has color. [8] X Research source You can also use regular chlorine bleach on a colored garment if you’re trying to lighten the color of the entire item. You should be very careful while using Clorox. Even if it splashes on a garment by mistake, it will pull out the color of that garment automatically. [9] X Expert Source Robert Shapiro Laundry Specialist Expert Interview. 24 August 2021."

      "content": "Soak the cotton item in the bleach solution. If you’re just pre-soaking the material to remove stains before washing, only leave it in the solution for about 5 minutes. You can add a few minutes to that time if you’re working with really tough stains.

Pour detergent into the drum or its own dispenser, place laundry in the drum, and pour bleach into its dispenser.

Detergents have special enzymes that can be deactivated by bleach if the two liquids are mixed together. Waiting 5 minutes allows the enzymes to dissolve in the water first. [14] X Research source Use about ½ cup (120 mL) of bleach for a full-sized load. If there are any items with color in this load, use only non-chlorine bleach."
