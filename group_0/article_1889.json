How will your relationship change once you make your romantic feelings clear? Did you become friends with her in the first place because of a romantic interest? Think the scenario through to the end and make sure that you're okay with both possibilities (her saying yes and her saying no)."

      "content": "Consider her feelings. As her friend, you have the advantage of knowing what’s going on in her personal life. If she’s going through something difficult or if she’s just broken up with her long-term boyfriend/girlfriend, it’s not the right time to ask her out. If she’s specifically mentioned recently that she doesn’t want a boyfriend/girlfriend, respect her feelings. If it's not the right time for her, you are much more likely to get rejected. Instead, be a good friend to her – that’s what she needs right now. She’ll appreciate and remember it. Catch her in a good mood. When a person is happy, they tend to react more positively to new things."

You don’t have to be over the top with your flirting. It can be as simple as telling her she looks pretty in a new dress, or touching her lightly on the arm when you’re talking to her. [2] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 November 2019. How does she react to the flirting? What’s her body language? Is she facing you directly and looking into your eyes? Is she smiling at you? Does she look comfortable and happy? Look for positive body language like uncrossed arms, facing you directly, leaning in closer to you, smiling, laughing and meeting your gaze."

Before you make the leap, you want things to feel pleasant and low pressure for her. If you begin by acting strangely or in an unusually shy manner, she’s going to pick up on that immediately. Awkwardness might set in. To avoid this, start with a fun conversation, make her laugh, and let your personality shine. [4] X Research source Once she’s smiling and engaged, then escalate the romance. Flirt with her in a very obvious way, get a little closer to her, and get ready to make your move."

      "title": "Ask her out in person.",
      "content": "Ask her out in person. It’s tempting to ask someone out through text or social media. However, it’s better to do it face to face so that everything is interpreted the way you want it to be. She will see your facial expression, hear the tone of your voice, and understand clearly what your intentions are. If you send her a casual text asking if she wants to hang out that night, the implication will be that you’re just friends. This ends up keeping you in the Friend Zone, which is precisely where you don’t want to be. Have the conversation somewhere you both feel comfortable, like one of your usual hang out spots or during a lunch break."

She will take her cues from you, so remember to stay calm and keep it positive."

      "content": "Be direct. You don’t have to make a big production out of it, but it’s important that she knows that you want to go out with her, not hang out with her. Being completely passive when you have feelings for someone is one of the major reasons why people end up permanently in the Friend Zone. [5] X Research source Say something like, “I really love hanging out with you and I’m starting to have feelings for you as more than a friend. I’m hoping that maybe you’re starting to feel that way, too. I think it would be awesome to take you out on a proper date.” By keeping your feelings to yourself, you might miss your chance with her completely."

Instead of saying, “So, would you like to go out some time?” ask her out for a specific day and activity. Your first date doesn’t have to be anything super formal. Even something as simple as, “Would you like to see the new exhibit at the Contemporary Art Museum with me this Saturday?” will work. Try to pick something that you two have never done together before, so that it has a completely different vibe from one of your regular hang out sessions. If you choose an activity that you already regularly do together, she might not completely realize your intentions. [7] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 2372 wikiHow readers about which first date they’d like to go on the most, and only 8% said going rock climbing . [Take Poll] So, suggesting a more casual activity, like grabbing coffee or seeing a show, might be more fun for her."

Say something like, \"I have feelings for you, but I don't want that to make you feel anxious or uncomfortable. Your friendship is important to me. Please tell me if this conversation makes you feel awkward at all.\" Make sure she knows that whatever her answer is, you’re going to be ok with it.

Grace, maturity and confidence are all highly attractive qualities. Just because she doesn’t feel romantically about you now doesn’t mean she’ll always feel that way, so keep a positive attitude. However, if she does say that she might have feelings for you in the future, don't put your love life on hold. Her saying this is essentially a \"no.\" You should pursue other people if you want to and should not count on her feeling differently in the future. At the very least, she will appreciate this as your friend, because it enables you both to continue your friendship."
