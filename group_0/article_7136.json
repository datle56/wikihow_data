After demonstrating your interest in a vehicle, express your interest in the car to the salesperson and indicate that you have a few reservations. Indicate that the dealership's willingness to pay for the VHR would ease your remaining concerns about making the major purchase. [8] X Research source When talking to the salesperson, you could say: “I really love this car, but I have a few reservations. My last car was in the shop all of the time and I want to make sure this vehicle doesn't have a long history of repairs. In order to commit to the car, I need to see a detailed vehicle history report. This would really ease my concerns. Would you be willing to provide me with one?” Wait until you are close to purchasing the car to request a VHR. A dealer is unlikely to run these reports on a number of vehicles. Even if you’re buying the car from a private seller rather than a dealership, they may be willing to purchase a full VHR and share it with you."

However, this is a relatively new resource, and less has been written about the validity of VehicleHistory.com than the other sources.
