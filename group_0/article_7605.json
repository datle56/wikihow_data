      "content": "Get out your aquarium vacuum. There are two tools aquarium hobbyists will use for cleaning their gravel. Aquarium siphons usually have a thick, plastic tube or \"siphon\" with a thin, flexible, tube attached to one end. Some of these may have a priming ball attached to one end. Plastic, flexible tubes can also be used to clean gravel. These are ideal for smaller tanks."

      "content": "Start the vacuum by submerging it. Slowly lower the entire siphon into the tank so that all of the air gets out of the tube. Cover the end of the tube with your thumb and take it out of the tank; keep the other, open, end submerged. Place the covered end in a bucket. If you release your thumb, the water will begin to flow; if you cover the end again with your thumb, the water will stop."

      "title": "Start the vacuum with a priming ball.",
      "content": "Start the vacuum with a priming ball. Some aquarium vacuums come with a rubber ball attached to the end of the siphon. Stick the end of the siphon into the aquarium and lower the end of the tube into a bucket. Plug the end of the tube with your finger, and squeeze on the priming ball. Slowly let go of the ball, but keep the end of the tube plugged. Water will begin to fill the siphon, sort of like an eyedropper or turkey baster. When you unplug the end of the tube, water will start to flow into the bucket."

Instead, they need to be hooked up to a water faucet. Simply plug the end of the Python vacuum to your water faucet and place the entire vacuum into the aquarium. When you turn the faucet on, the vacuum will begin to siphon. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the end of the vacuum into the gravel.",
      "content": "Place the end of the vacuum into the gravel. Simply stick it straight down, as far as it will go. Your thumb should still be blocking the end of the tube, and that the end of the tube is in the bucket. Once you let go of the tube, dirty water will start flowing out. If you have very fine-grit gravel, such as sand, don't stick the vacuum all the way down. Instead, place the mouth just over the top of the sand. Vacuuming is okay for freshwater tanks, but it's not a great option for saltwater aquariums, especially ones with sand. If you use a vacuum in a saltwater tank, you'll end up disturbing the bacteria in the sand and destroying your tank's micro-ecosystem.

In that case, vacuum every few months to clean up the build-up. [4] X Expert Source Aaron Bernard Fish & Aquarium Specialist Expert Interview. 17 July 2020."

Dirty water will flow out of the end of the tube and into the bucket. The gravel will shake and rattle inside the tube.

When you recover the tube, the gravel will settle once again. If the gravel starts to go too far up the vacuum, just cover the end of the tube and let the gravel settle. Then, uncover the tube and let the water flow again. If you are using a Python, or a similar type, simply turn the water off the stop siphoning."

When the water runs clear again, cover the tube back up and carefully lift the vacuum out. If your tank has any caves, rocks, logs, and other nooks and crannies, be sure to give those special attention. These areas tend to get the most waste. If your tank has any live plants, leave a 2 inch (5.08 centimeters) radius around the stems. Plants love organic waste. If you remove this waste, the plants won't have anything to eat."
