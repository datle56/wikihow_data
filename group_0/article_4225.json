[3] X Research source Be extra gentle if your piercing is new and healing (especially in the first 2-3 weeks when the piercing is tender) or you’ll cause pain and discomfort. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose this option if you can comfortably press down on one nostril.",
      "content": "Choose this option if you can comfortably press down on one nostril. Blowing out your nose one nostril at a time can reduce the overall pressure through your nasal cavities. Press gently on one nostril with your finger and blow through the opposite nostril. Then, switch nostrils and clear the other one out. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Clear out your nose with saline spray or decongestant.",
      "content": "Clear out your nose with saline spray or decongestant. If you find yourself having to frequently deal with allergies or a cold, consider buying a spray to avoid the excess nasal pressure that can come with blowing your nose. [6] X Research source Shake the nasal spray, tilt your head down, and spray into your nose, aiming towards your ear. [7] X Research source For instance, to spray your right nostril, aim the spray slightly towards your right ear. That angle prevents you from spraying too far into your nose, where the nasal spray might cause the tissue to thin and bleed."

      "content": "Take a hot shower or breathe in steam from a bowl of hot water. Inhaling steam provides warmth and moisture, which offer short-term relief for your mucous membranes. You can even add chamomile or peppermint oil to the water for a more relaxing experience.

      "title": "Pick this option if you’re prone to allergies or are getting sick.",
      "content": "Pick this option if you’re prone to allergies or are getting sick. Wearing a retainer instead of a ring will allow you to blow your nose without worrying about the tissue making contact with your jewelry or getting in the way when you blow. [9] X Research source Pick an L-shaped piece (or a retainer with two flat bars for a septum piercing) that sits inside your nose for a snug fit. [10] X Research source When you need to blow your nose, flip the inside bar so that it points upright and sits against the inside of your nose. That way, the jewelry won’t get full of mucus or hit with the pressure of your exhale. You can flip the bar back down if it’s more comfortable for you, or leave it up until your allergies/cold improves. Only use this option if your piercing has healed enough to change out your jewelry."

      "title": "Leave your nose ring in to clean it.",
      "content": "Leave your nose ring in to clean it. Use a saline solution to clean off any bacteria and built-up mucus. Make sure your saline solution has 0.9% sodium chloride as the only ingredient (this is a standard saline solution). You can use a cotton ball and the solution to swab off any remaining crusted-on mucus. [11] X Research source Leaving the jewelry in will prevent the hole from closing up. This is particularly crucial if you got the piercing within a year and it’s still healing. Create your own saline solution by mixing 8 fluid ounces (240 ml) warm distilled water with 0.5 tsp (2.5 g) salt. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Soak a cotton ball in saline solution.",
      "content": "Soak a cotton ball in saline solution. Then, gently swab your piercing area with the cotton ball. It might sting a little, but that’s normal, especially for piercings that are still healing. [13] X Research source Don’t use hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol to clean your piercings since that will irritate the skin and slow healing."

      "title": "Wipe the swab around the outside of the piercing.",
      "content": "Wipe the swab around the outside of the piercing. The skin around your piercing might collect crusted fluid or mucus (especially if it’s still healing). Instead of using your fingers, use a cotton swab to gently poke away the debris. [14] X Research source You can also use non-woven gauze."

      "content": "Cover your pillow in a clean t-shirt every night. When you’re sick (or when your piercing is healing), regularly wash anything that comes into contact with your nose piercing to prevent infection. To avoid washing your pillowcase daily, just cover it with a clean t-shirt and change the shirt every night. [15] X Research source"
