      "title": "Insert plugs into all the emitters.",
      "content": "Insert plugs into all the emitters. Emitters are the holes in the tubing of your drip system. Your system should have come with plastic black or green plugs that fit inside of the emitter holes. Press the plugs into the emitters along the length of the tubing. Unscrew the cap at the end of the mainline if it isn’t removed already so that water can flow out of it freely. [2] X Research source Plugging up the emitters will increase the water pressure and help loosen clogs. If you lost the plugs that came with your system, you can purchase new ones through the system's manufacturer or you can purchase 3rd party drip irrigation plugs online."

      "content": "Examine the water for dirt or bacteria buildup. The water should run clear after about 10 seconds. If the water does not run clear and looks brown, you most likely have bacterial buildup in your system. Flushing the system with hydrochloric or phosphoric acid can remove these buildups. No water should be coming out of the emitters during this time if you plugged them all up correctly."

      "title": "Put 3-4 drops of muriatic acid on clogged emitters.",
      "content": "Put 3-4 drops of muriatic acid on clogged emitters. You can purchase muriatic acid online or at some hardware stores. Wear rubber gloves, protective eyewear, and long clothes when handling the acid. Use the dropper to suck up a small amount of acid and drip the acid on the clogged emitters. Once you've done that, turn on the system again to see if the acid cleared the clogged emitters. If the emitters aren’t producing any water, they are clogged. [5] X Research source Carefully handle the acid so you don't spill it and make sure that it doesn't come in contact with your skin. If it does, rinse the affected area for 15 minutes with cold water. If the acid fizzes, you’ll have to do an acid flush to remove any mineral buildup inside of the tubing. One of the most common types of clogs are calcium carbonate or magnesium carbonate buildup. You can flush the system again with water to wash away any residual acid."

Purchase a wash or neutralizer for acid in case you have an accidental spill. Keep the amount of exposed skin to a minimum. [6] X Research source You can purchase safety equipment and neutralizer online or at some hardware stores. If you accidentally spill acid on your skin, you should rinse it thoroughly with the neutralizer and seek medical attention if burning persists."

Place the test end of the pH test strip into the solution. If the pH isn’t low enough, continue pouring small amounts of acid into the bucket until it reaches the desired pH. [8] X Research source The low pH of the acid and water solution will remove mineral buildup inside of the tubing."

In some systems, there is a special flush tube that is there to specifically flush your system with chemicals. If your system has this, use that tube instead.

Make sure to store the hydrochloric or phosphoric in a well-ventilated area away from flammable materials and other acids. It's best to label the cabinet or area so that other people know that acid is in the container. [11] X Research source Hydrochloric and phosphoric acid are highly dangerous if ingested or spilled and should be kept away from children and animals. If you need to dispose of the acid, take it to a disposal center or neutralize it with sodium hydroxide before pouring it down the drain. Never pour active acid down the drain or it can destroy your pipes. [12] X Research source"
