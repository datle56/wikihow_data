      "content": "Identify bed bugs by their eggs, casings, and stains. Keep in mind that dead bed bugs tend to leave red-brown stains when they’re squashed on a mattress or section of bedding. Additionally, look for tiny white eggs or light yellow casings, which are other prominent signs of bed bug activity. Living bed bugs are small and brown, and may be found crawling around the sleeping areas.

      "content": "Examine the bare mattress and box spring for bugs. Pull off any bedding and sheets, including any elastic bedding that goes around the mattress. Look for any visible signs of bed bugs, such as eggs or the bugs themselves. Additionally, search for hard leftover casings that were shed by the bugs, or red-brown splotches on the mattress, which are both telltale signs of an infestation. [4] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Even if it seems tedious, it’s better in the long run if you examine all 4 corners of the mattress. Look carefully at the seams of the mattress, as this is a popular hiding place for bed bugs. To get a closer look beneath these seams, lift them up with the thin edge of a credit card.

      "content": "Inspect the bedding and sheets for bed bug activity. Pull off the quilt or duvet and look for staining or other signs of bed bugs.
