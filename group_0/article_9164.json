These ports are usually labeled \"HDMI.\" If there is more than one port, each will be labeled with a number (e.g., HDMI 1 , HDMI 2 ). Some TVs also have HDMI ports on the front or side panel."

      "content": "Get the right HDMI cable. If the device has the same size HDMI port as your TV (Type A/13.99 mm x 4.45 mm), you'll just need a standard Type-A HDMI cable, which has the same 19-pin connector on both sides. However, some devices (often cameras and portable media players) have smaller HDMI ports, which means you'll need a different type of cable: [1] X Research source Type C/Mini-HDMI: This type of HDMI port is often found on somewhat older DSLR cameras and camcorders. The dimensions are 10.42 mm x 2.42 mm, which is a lot smaller than Type A. If your device has this port, you'll need a Mini-HDMI-C to HDMI-A cable . Type D/Micro-HDMI: Even smaller than the Type C, this 6.4 mm x 2.8 mm port is commonly found on small recording devices such as the GoPro and some smartphones. You'll need a Micro HDMI-D to HDMI-A cable in this situation."

You should only be able to insert the HDMI plug into the port in one direction. Never force the cable plug into the port since doing so could damage both the cord and the device."

If you're using Windows , press ⊞ Win + P to open the Windows Project panel, and then select an option for displaying the screen on the TV. If you want to mirror the desktop, for example, select Duplicate . If you have a Mac , the screen should automatically be mirrored on the TV. If the dimensions look funny, navigate to Apple menu > System Preferences > Displays > Display and select Default for display . If you need to enter a specific resolution, chose Scaled instead and enter that resolution now. [2] X Research source"

If your TV has HDMI but your gaming system , computer, or other gadget does not, you can usually still connect with an adapter that converts an existing port to HDMI Type A (standard). You can find HDMI adapters/cables for the following port types: DisplayPort: This type of port supports both digital audio and high-resolution video when converted to HDMI. Look for ports labeled \"DP\" or \"DisplayPort\". If you have a DisplayPort on your laptop or tablet, you'll need a DisplayPort-to-HDMI-A cable or adapter. [3] X Research source Some devices, including the Microsoft Surface, have a DisplayPort Mini port rather than the standard size. You'll need a DisplayPort Mini-to-HDMI-A cable or adapter in this case. DVI: DVI outputs do not transmit audio, but you can get high-quality video using a DVI-to-HDMI-A cable or adapter. Note that there are different DVI port sizes, so you'll need to make sure you get the right cable. Count the number of pins in your DVI port and compare it to available cables and adapters. VGA: If you have an old-school VGA port , you won't get the best picture quality on your TV, and definitely no audio. However, you can still connect the device using a VGA-to-HDMI-A converter or adapter."

You can usually find a cable that has an HDMI-A plug on one side and a DVI, DisplayPort, or VGA plug on the other. You'll just need to make sure the non-HDMI size matches up exactly with the port on your device. Another option is to purchase a smaller adapter/converter. With an adapter, you'd plug a standard HDMI cable into the HDMI end, and a standard DVI, DisplayPort, or VGA cable into the other side. This means you'd need two different types of cables plugged into one adapter. The HDMI cable must also be long enough to reach from the device to the TV. Choose a cord that is slightly longer than necessary to minimize the strain on the cord and both devices."

If you bought an adapter, plug the other side of the HDMI cable into the HDMI side of the adapter, and then connect that adapter to the device using the appropriate cable (DVI, DisplayPort, or VGA) for that device. Do not force the plug into the port. It should only fit one way, and if it doesn't fit at all, you may have the wrong type of cable. If using an adapter for VGA ports, you will likely need to match the color of each adapter plug to the corresponding audio and video ports on your computer."

[5] X Research source If both your input device and TV have the appropriate ports, you might be able to directly connect the two devices using a separate stereo cable. Alternatively, you can use an audio cable to redirect audio from your input device to a separate nearby set of speakers previously hooked up to your TV."
