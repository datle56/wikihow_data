      "content": "Let him know right away that you’re apologizing. Saying “sorry” at the top of your apology is important because it sets the tone of your conversation. Think of these first few words as the launchpad for the rest of your apology. [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Begin with something simple like: “ I’m so sorry that I’ve been moody lately.” “ I want to apologize for acting so distant this week.” “ I couldn’t be more sorry about the way I treated you last night.” “ I want to apologize for the bad joke that I made. It wasn't appropriate humor, and I honestly didn't mean to hurt your feelings. If you’re apologizing over text, start with a preface like “I wish I could say this in person. I apologize for being moody” or “I’d rather tell you this face to face, but I’m sorry about the way I’ve been acting.”"

Just saying “I’m sorry” doesn’t show your boyfriend that you get how he feels or how you impacted him (which is what you want to do!). Keep the focus on your actions—things like “I’m sorry you felt mad” or “I’m sorry you misunderstood me” don’t get to the heart of the issue.

      "content": "Tell your boyfriend what made you moody without making excuses. Explaining why you felt off or lashed out is helpful, but trying to justify your behavior is not—it puts the blame on him or some other factor instead of yourself. [4] X Research source A good apology doesn’t use “if” or “but” statements (“I’m sorry I was moody, but it’s only because of work” or “I'm sorry if I made you upset”). [5] X Research source Instead, try: “I’m sorry I’ve been moody lately. Work has been really stressful lately and I’ve been taking it home with me, which is unfair to you.” “I apologize for yelling at you last night. My parents have been on my case all week and I just feel so tense all the time.” “I’m so sorry for being unpredictable lately. I had a huge falling out with Katie on Tuesday and the drama of it all has been getting to me. It’s not your fault.”"

This is your chance to show him how much you really care, and it's even more important than saying “I’m sorry.” He’ll be more ready and willing to accept your apology when you show that you understand the effects of your moodiness on him (remember, your apology is about him ).

I know you must feel so confused and hurt when I say mean things.” “I apologize for being so withdrawn and ignoring your calls yesterday. I’ve been going through a hard time lately and I can’t help but shut down sometimes. I can imagine it makes you question how I feel about you.” “I want to say sorry for blowing up after dinner last night. It wasn't your fault, I’m just really on edge right now because of my roommate situation. I know it was embarrassing for me to yell in public and I’m sure I ruined the night you had planned for us.”"

It can feel uncomfortable to ask, but it gives your boyfriend the chance to accept your apology, bring up his feelings, or continue the conversation. It also shows you’re humble and that you don’t demand or expect automatic forgiveness. [7] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If you're truly sorry, chances are he can't wait to put this all behind you!

Say what you need to say in simple terms—you can elaborate more later if you need to. [9] X Research source A full apology (in person or over text) might look like: “Hey, I’m so sorry for being moody today. I’m just exhausted from working overtime and my fuse is short. I know you’re probably confused and worried about me. I promise I’ll work on balancing work better so I can be in a good mood when we’re together. I hope you can forgive me.” “I want to apologize for giving you the silent treatment. I’m just really upset that I didn’t pass the bar exam and I’m taking it out on you, which is completely unfair. I completely understand why you’re angry and hurt by it. Do you forgive me?” “I’m sorry for being moody this week. I haven’t been able to get any down time since I got back from my trip and it’s getting to me. You’re frustrated with me and worried that I’m not acting like myself, and I appreciate that.

      "content": "Be sincere and let your apology speak for itself. An honest apology doesn’t have any agenda other than to repair the damage done by your words or actions. Your boyfriend shouldn’t feel like you’re trying to get him to change his mind, take blame, or manipulate his feelings. To be sincere, keep your explanations brief and all about you (not what your boyfriend might have done). [10] X Research source Your explanations might sound like: “I’m still just upset about losing my scholarship.” “I’ve been feeling down and moody since my parents split up.” “I’m still adjusting to my new work schedule and I’m so stressed out.”"

      "content": "If you’re apologizing in person, show him you’re sorry. Make eye contact and nod along as he responds to you to show you care about what he’s saying. Mirror his position—if he’s standing and facing you, stand and face him back so your shoulders are parallel. If he’s sitting down, sit down beside him. [11] X Research source Your tone is important too. Speak low and softly to sound even-tempered and sincere. Some affectionate touching, like a hug or holding hands, can help show that you mean what you say."

Other times, you’ll have to work together to come up with a solution that works for both of you (think of it as a learning opportunity). Just by asking, you’re showing interest in him that lets him know you care.

Here are a few ways to tone down moodiness: [15] X Research source Schedule some quiet or alone time for yourself to give your mind a break. Meditating, reading, or a bubble bath are great ways to take a breather. Go for a walk or run to work out some nervous energy. Even just a casual stroll will help clear your mind. Show yourself compassion. Acknowledge that you’re not in a great mood and try to imagine how that might impact the people around you, including your boyfriend."
