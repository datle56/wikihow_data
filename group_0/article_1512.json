This way, you’ll have everything you need and won’t need to scramble once you’ve got your turtle out of its aquarium. Consider: Picking a spot on the floor, so that turtle-dropping danger is minimized. Lay out a clean towel to absorb any medicine or turtle droppings. Place your turtle eye medicine on the towel. Place some turtle treats or food on the towel to distract your reptilian friend."

      "content": "Get your turtle to stick its head out. One of the biggest challenges of applying medicine to your turtle is getting it to cooperate. Since turtles can just retract their heads into their shell, this could be a problem. Try to tease your turtle out of its shell with food. Wait until your turtle’s head is completely out of the shell and he or she is eating. If your turtle is not cooperating at all, put it down and try again in half an hour. Be very gentle and do not hurt your little friend. Remember, that he or she does not really know that you’re trying to help. Be very considerate. [2] X Research source"
