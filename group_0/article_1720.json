      "content": "It might take some time for these two to open up. Virgos often struggle to be vulnerable, so they need to know someone well before they let their guard down. Two Virgos will understand each other's need to take things slow, and their relationship will move at a very authentic pace. Once they get to know each other, they'll realize just how caring and loving their partner really is. Virgo's are mutable signs, which make them open to changing their mind and listening to their partner's perspective."

      "title": "These two both enjoy experimenting and trying new things.",
      "content": "These two both enjoy experimenting and trying new things. Virgos may be rather practical and reserved in their day-to-day life, but they often possess a secret uninhibited side in the bedroom. As a caring and attentive sign, a Virgo will want to please their partner first and foremost. Ruled by Mercury, the planet of communication, two Virgos will also have no problem talking openly about their needs and fantasies.

      "title": "They might need to work on being less critical of each other.",
      "content": "They might need to work on being less critical of each other. Virgos may be skilled communicators, but they're also often perfectionists. They may be prone to critiquing their partner or their relationship constantly. To make sure neither partner feels attacked, they'll need to remember to bring up the positive stuff, too. This will help both partners feel loved and appreciated To avoid getting too critical, Virgos might benefit from practicing gratitude. Writing down all the things they love about their partner or their relationship will help them stop overthinking and critiquing unnecessarily."

      "title": "Virgos are known for being loyal and honest.",
      "content": "Virgos are known for being loyal and honest. Their shared values will help them navigate a committed relationship fairly easily, and it's unlikely that either partner will struggle with infidelity. The sign of Virgo is associated with acts of service, so they'll likely show their commitment through consistently being there to help their partner. As mutable signs, it's possible that Virgo's feelings might change or waver at a moment's notice. To maintain trust, they'll have to be direct and open about how they're really feeling."

      "title": "Pros:",
      "content": "Pros: Virgos value stability in their romantic relationships, and they'll find just that with another Virgo. They'll understand each other's need to take things slow and will be happy to do just about anything to make their partner happy. Since they share solid communication skills, they'll be able to work through conflict gracefully (as long as they keep their inner-critic in control). Together, they'll accomplish their goals and give each other the consistency they need. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cons:",
      "content": "Cons: This pair might struggle if they place too much value on perfection. Virgos notice all the details, which makes them prone to noticing and critiquing everything that's going wrong in their relationship. To make things work, they'll have to choose their battles wisely and let the small stuff slide. If they do that, they'll remember why they fell in love with their partner in the first place."
