      "content": "It could indicate an issue with your vehicle that comes and goes. This is known as an intermittent fault, and it’s a sign that the problem is borderline. Something is close enough to wrong that it occasionally triggers the light, but the problem occasionally recedes to the point that the ECM doesn’t register an error. [1] X Research source Check engine lights do not just go away on their own. The odds are very high that an intermittent fault will eventually turn into a solid check engine light, so it's still important to address the issue even if the light occasionally goes off. For example, a loose gas cap is a common cause of a check engine light (air gets in the fuel, which throws the air-fuel-spark mixture off). If it’s only slightly loose and letting air in for short bursts, the light may turn on when air is coming in, then off when there isn’t enough air coming in to mess with the ratio."

      "content": "A blinking check engine light may indicate a serious problem. A solid check engine light could be caused by something as simple as a loose gas cap, but a flashing check engine light is a bigger deal. The flashing is designed to get your attention, so do not ignore a blinking check engine light. [2] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source On some modern vehicles, the check engine light will change colors instead of blinking. If it goes from yellow to red, it means the same thing as a blinking check engine light."

      "content": "Use an OBD-2 scanner to scan your car’s computer for errors. Locate the OBD-2 port in your vehicle. In most cases, it’s under a dashboard panel below the steering wheel. Plug the OBD-2 scanner into the 16-pin port and turn your car on. Then, press the “run” or “scan” button and wait for the scanner to return an error code . [3] X Research source That error code will tell you what specifically is wrong with the vehicle so that you can get it fixed. If the check engine light doesn’t go away after you resolve the problem, don’t worry. You just need to reset the check engine light by completing a full drive cycle ."

      "title": "Engine misfire",
      "content": "Engine misfire This is far and away the most common cause of a blinking check engine light. A misfire occurs when one of the cylinders in your engine doesn’t fire (or fires incorrectly). This causes your engine to lose a portion of its power and makes it difficult for your vehicle to maintain speed. [4] X Research source This is usually caused by an electrical or mechanical failure, although a misfire can occur so long as there’s a problem with the air/fuel mixture. The cost to repair a misfiring cylinder can range from $100-1,000 depending on the underlying cause. It could be a bad spark plug, a dead ignition coil, ignition system failures, or a crack in your vacuum hose."

      "title": "Bad sensors",
      "content": "Bad sensors This is a best case scenario since it means nothing is physically wrong with your engine. The engine control module (ECM), engine control unit (ECU), and mass airflow sensor (MAF) are all responsible for monitoring your engine and the fuel/air/spark that powers it. If one of those sensors has gone bad though, it can trick your vehicle into thinking something is actually wrong. [5] X Research source Replacing and resetting these sensors can run anywhere from $500-1,200 depending on what needs to be replaced."

      "title": "Catalytic converter issues",
      "content": "Catalytic converter issues Your catalytic converter is located under the vehicle between the engine and the exhaust pipe. Its job is to soak up the toxic fumes created by your engine so that you don’t pollute the environment. If that converter is damaged or bad though, those fumes have nowhere to go. If they back up into the engine, it will trigger a flashing check engine light. [6] X Research source If your catalytic converter is bad, you may smell rotten eggs in or around your car. This is the sulfur your converter would normally be shielding you from. Catalytic converters can run up to $2,000 depending on what kind of model your vehicle needs."

      "title": "Overheating",
      "content": "Overheating If you haven’t changed the coolant in your vehicle or your engine thermostat has gone bad, the excess heat in your engine can cause the check engine light to come on and start blinking. Do not continue driving if your engine is running hot and the check engine light is blinking, as this is a sign your engine may catch fire. If you just need a coolant flush, it’ll only cost $100-150. If your thermometer needs to be replaced, it may cost a bit more but it shouldn’t be too expensive."

      "title": "Transmission problems",
      "content": "Transmission problems The transmission is responsible for transferring energy from the engine to the wheels. If it’s not doing that properly, it could create a power differential that puts strain on your engine. If this strain becomes intense enough, it could lead to misfires, engine problems, and all sorts of issues that cause your check engine light to blink. [7] X Research source Transmission problems are tricky and often require a specialist. Depending on the underlying problem, this could run anywhere from $100-200, to $6,500 for a transmission rebuild."

      "content": "No, it’s generally not recommended to continue driving. There are a handful of potential causes for a flashing check engine light that aren’t a big deal, but the issue could be more serious, and it's not worth the risk. If you keep driving and ignore the light, you could be causing irreparable damage to your engine. Even worse, if your engine was misfiring because you don’t have enough oil, your car could catch fire. [8] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Unless you’re very close to your mechanic and can get there fast, your safest option is to pull over and call a tow truck to take you to the mechanic. If you do choose to drive to a mechanic, stay in the slow-moving lane on the right, put your hazards on, and be ready to pull over at a moment’s notice. Your car could stall out or die soon."
