      "content": "Take your cat to the vet. If you notice any common symptoms associated with a respiratory foreign body, or you believe your cat may have inhaled a foreign object, you should take your cat to the vet immediately. If left untreated, a foreign body in the respiratory system could cause an infection or lead to chronic lung disease. In some cases the foreign object may travel through the body, causing severe complications and even death. [3] X Research source Your vet will need to run a number of tests in order to rule out other possible illnesses and to find the exact location of the foreign object."

      "content": "Have your cat examined. Your vet will likely need to administer a number of examinations in order to determine the exact location of the foreign object. An examination can also provide your vet with more detailed information concerning the type of object that has been lodged in the respiratory system. Your vet may administer any of the following tests: [4] X Research source A complete blood count (CBC), biochemical profile, and urinalysis. An x-ray of the throat and chest. Skull/nasal radiographs. A scope may be used to evaluate the nasal cavity, trachea, and bronchi. A CT Scan or MRI may be useful in some cases."

      "title": "Remove the object manually.",
      "content": "Remove the object manually. This is often done by administering a local anesthetic and then reaching in and grabbing the object from the throat or nasal cavity. This type of removal is only possible if the object is visible and easily accessible. [5] X Research source In some cases, you may be able to do this without the help of a vet, if you are able to see the object and are certain you can remove it completely and without causing any damage to the nasal passage. It is safest to let the vet do any removal, however."

      "content": "Flush the respiratory tract to remove the object. Your vet may be able to encourage the foreign object to dislodge itself, by flushing the respiratory tract.

      "content": "Retrieve a foreign body using an endoscope. To remove a foreign body using an endoscope, the vet will place a flexible tube called an endoscope into the cat’s mouth and down into their throat. They may try to pull out the object. Typically the object will be removed using forceps or a balloon catheter. [7] X Research source This procedure will typically only work if the object is lodged in the throat. If the lodged object is sharp, a protective tube can be placed down the cat’s throat to protect the esophagus while the object is retrieved."

      "content": "Remove a foreign body through surgery. In severe cases, the foreign object may be lodged deep within your cat’s internal respiratory system. In these instances, the vet may need to complete a surgery to remove the object. In most cases, your cat will be put under general anesthesia. [8] X Research source There are always risks when your cat undergoes surgery, especially when the cat is under anesthesia. Talk to your vet to understand the risks and benefits of surgery for your cat."
