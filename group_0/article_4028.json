      "content": "Gather your supplies. You will have to get yourself an apple cider vinegar bottle, or either grape vinegar, this will work fine too (both can be commonly found in supermarkets), and some steel wool, which you can find in a hardware shop (Common nails, needles and pins work fine too! You just need to be careful when handling them.). Then you will need either matcha (green tea powder you can find in most Asian groceries, or either make at home; in this case, you will have to be careful to make a very thin powder) or gallnut (also known as tannins) powder. The choice is up to you, green tea powder is easier to find, gallnut powder is proved to prevent some strains of streptococcus bacteria, but both will work fine for the mixture."

This is ferrous acetate; despite the scary name, this liquid isn't harmful for humans. To alleviate the bad smell you can correct the liquid with cinnamon or another spice powder depending on your tastes. [1] X Research source"

Pick up a soft paint or calligraphy brush and soak it in your ohaguro stain mixture; then put it on your teeth in front of a mirror, trying to be precise, just not to waste it, as it can be easily washed away from your gums, tongue and palate. Achieving a deep black will require a few layers. Once you will have achieved the shade you like, rinse your mouth with water until it's free from residues. [3] X Research source"
