      "content": "The gesture is believed to be taught to children by their parents. Although the origins of the 3-squeeze handhold are not known, it’s believed that this gesture may be an instinct-based method of communication between a parent and child. Many families have reported participating in this exchange with loved ones, beginning in childhood. Most commonly, the parent squeezes their child’s hand three times as a sweet and intimate gesture of reassurance. Over time, this gesture is either explained or understood to mean that each squeeze corresponds with a word in, “I love you.” [4] X Research source Research has shown that children with affectionate and attentive parents tend to be happier and lead more successful lives as adults. They are also more likely to pass on similar loving behaviors to their own future children."

      "content": "\"Three Squeezes\" by Jason Pratt This children’s book, aptly titled “Three Squeezes” was written by author Jason Pratt in 2020. Pratt was inspired by two people in his life that were unable to verbally communicate their love— one very young and one very old. He wrote this book in order to show the world that love can be demonstrated in many different ways, and squeezing is one of them. The story showcases the bond between a father and his son, as they face life together at every stage. [7] X Research source An excerpt from the book reads, “When you could neither talk nor stand/ life’s hourglass still filled with sand,/ I gently held your tiny hand/and gave it three soft squeezes.”"
