      "content": "Search for the record you’re applying for. Type in a key word into the search bar, then click the red “search” button. Use actual key words and not superlatives. For example, if you’re trying to break the record for walking down a runway in the highest high heels, search for “high heels” instead of “highest.” [3] X Research source If your record spans multiple topics, like high heels and walking, start with the more detailed one. In this case, it would be \"high heels.\""

      "content": "Meet the minimum requirement if you’re applying for a new record title. New record titles are records that have not yet been recognized by Guinness World Records. If you submit a new record title that meets all of the Guinness World Records standards and formatting criteria, they will establish a minimum, based on their research, that you must beat to officially have broken the new record. For example, if you’re applying to break the record for the longest amount of time spent in a VR headset, Guinness World Records may do some research and say that 20 hours is an appropriate benchmark. You'll have to beat that to claim the world record."

      "title": "Avoid records that don’t meet the Guinness World Records formatting criteria.",
      "content": "Avoid records that don’t meet the Guinness World Records formatting criteria. Every type of record, whether it has to do with food or art or extreme sports, has a specific format that needs to be followed. Guinness World Records will only accept records that follow the proper formatting. For example, the record of most food served in X amount of time is formatted so that X can be 1 hour, 8 hours, 12 hours, or 24 hours. Therefore, if you submitted an application for the record of serving the most food in 15 hours, you wouldn’t be following the formatting criteria and your application would be rejected."

Claiming that you ate 700 marshmallows in ten minutes when you were younger isn’t something that can be verified (unless you have it on tape).
