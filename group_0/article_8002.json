      "title": "Fill your bathtub with warm water and add 2 cups (473 mL) of chlorine bleach.",
      "content": "Fill your bathtub with warm water and add 2 cups (473 mL) of chlorine bleach. Lift up the bath mat so it isn’t stuck to the bottom of the tub anymore (this lets the water circulate around the underside where debris and mold can accumulate). [1] X Research source Then, fill up the tub with warm, not hot, water and measure out your bleach once it’s full of water ( adding bleach right away can make a more potent solution and cause dizziness or breathing problems). If you prefer, wash your bath mat in a clean utility sink or other large container instead. Add 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of chlorine bleach for every 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water for normal cleaning, or 1 c (240 mL) of bleach for every 5 US gal (19 L) of water for heavier cleaning. [2] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source For a natural alternative, sprinkle 1 cup (272 g) of baking soda over the mat, then add 1 cup (237 mL) of white vinegar or hydrogen peroxide to the bath water instead of bleach. [3] X Research source Warning: Do not make a diluted bleach solution with hot water. Hot water may intensify fumes as bleach is added. [4] X Research source Warning: Wear protective eyewear and gloves when working with bleach. Prop open a window or door to ventilate the space and avoid inhaling bleach fumes. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Let the mat soak for up to 3–4 hours if it’s extra dirty. To eliminate mold and mildew or get rid of bad odors, leave the rubber bath mat to sit in the diluted bleach for up to a few hours. This helps kill bacteria and loosen stuck-on debris that may be clinging to the suction cups or other areas. Keep your windows open for ventilation the whole time it’s soaking. [6] X Research source If you’re just going for a light or maintenance cleaning, leave the mat to soak for about 10–20 minutes."

      "content": "Scrub the mat with a cleaning brush or scouring pad to remove dirt and debris. After the soak, put your gloves back on and give the mat a good scrub to get rid of stains, sticky spots, or any debris still clinging to the rubber. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Rinse the mat and air dry it when you’re done cleaning. Remove the bath mat from the bathtub and set it out to dry on the back of a chair or outdoors in the sun. Drain and rinse the bathtub to remove any dirt and scum that collected from the cleaning. [8] X Research source Do not put the bath mat in the dryer as the heat will warp it. Sunlight is a natural deodorizer and can help prevent future mildew buildup and kill some odor- and mildew-causing bacteria (especially those that are not normally exposed to direct sunlight).

      "title": "Place the rubber bath mat into the washing machine with a few old towels.",
      "content": "Place the rubber bath mat into the washing machine with a few old towels. A bath mat can be washed in a washing machine just as you would a load of clothes. To improve the cleaning process, add sturdy laundry items that can handle chlorine bleach, like white towels, or some old towels or garments you don’t mind getting potentially stained by bleach. [10] X Research source Do not add delicate laundry items or garments that can be damaged by bleach (like wools or silks). The other laundry items act like gentle scrubbers to help loosen debris and clean your bath mat (and can help dampen the noise from washing a hard mat, too). Have a fabric bath mat? Whether it has a rubber bottom or not, fabric bath mats can go in the washer too. Use cold water, a mild detergent, and vinegar or bleach to remove stains and odors. [11] X Research source You can also use your dishwasher to clean rubber as an alternative. [12] X Research source If you have the option, avoid the very hottest setting (although most dishwasher temperatures are set by the manufacturer)."

      "content": "Wash the mat on a warm, gentle cycle with detergent and ½ cup (118 mL) of bleach. Run the washer as normal with your bath mat and towels. [13] X Research source Make sure to use a gentle cycle if possible; washing rubber bath mats on the normal or heavy-duty setting may weaken or damage the material over time. If you don’t want to use bleach, try ½ cup (118 mL) of white vinegar instead for a natural solution. Bleach is helpful for cleaning up deep stains, smells, or mold. If you’re just doing a routine cleaning, you can probably skip the bleach altogether."

      "content": "Remove the mat and hang it over a chair back or clothesline to air dry. [14] X Research source Always air-dry a rubber bath mat since the heat from the dryer can cause the rubber to warp or crack. If you’re in a hurry, hand-dry the mat with a clean rag or cloth."

      "content": "Clean your bath mat once a week to prevent mold or mildew buildup. A regular cleaning schedule means bacteria can’t hang around long enough to make your rubber bath mat gross or odorous. If you have a large family or your shower is getting used very frequently (AKA, more people are leaving and potentially stepping on germs), you may want to clean it more often.

      "title": "Hang your bath mat to air dry after each use.",
      "content": "Hang your bath mat to air dry after each use. Hang it somewhere high and away from the moisture of the tub; over the shower curtain rod or on a dedicated towel bar (not a bar where you’d also hang clean towels) are great options! Letting the water dry away each time leaves less opportunity for mold and mildew to grow. [16] X Research source Avoid leaving the mat to dry over the edge of the tub, since this is still in the “moisture” zone."

      "title": "Keep your bathroom as ventilated as possible.",
      "content": "Keep your bathroom as ventilated as possible. Stagnant, humid air contributes to bacteria growth (on a bath mat or anywhere else in your bathroom). So, keep your exhaust fan running whenever you shower or bathe and leave it on for about an hour afterward to keep air circulating. If your bathroom has a window, leave it cracked open whenever you can (try all day in spring or fall, or just a few hours a day in the winter). [17] X Research source If you live somewhere with hot and humid summers, using the AC instead of opening windows can help cut down on indoor humidity in your bathroom. Good ventilation will also help prevent mold and mildew growth in other areas of your bathroom, too!"

      "title": "Bath mats combine warm moisture and debris like skin cells to fuel mold growth.",
      "content": "Bath mats combine warm moisture and debris like skin cells to fuel mold growth. Think about the underside of your rubber bath mat: it’s frequently warm and wet, collects debris like hair, soap scum, skin cells, or bacteria, and doesn’t get good air circulation very often. These are all prime ingredients for mold or mildew growth! Leaving the mat to sit for too long in these conditions without cleaning makes it a “dream home” for mold colonies. [18] X Research source Because mold spores travel by air, a moldy bath mat might lead to mold growth in other areas of your bathroom, too (especially if it’s not well-ventilated or frequently humid)."
