Doing simple things such as paying your bills on time, cleaning up after yourself if you make a mess, and going to work or school on time can help you feel more responsible and self-reliant.

Try to be well-rounded and keep up with information about what is going on in your place of business or school, your town, your state, your country, and the world. For example, knowing that a local ordinance determining whether backyard chickens can be kept in your area is coming up for a vote can give you the opportunity to lobby and vote for the ability to keep chickens for fresh eggs."

You should also try to set goals for yourself. Try setting short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals, then be realistic about what you need to do to meet those goals. Seek out a career counselor if you are not sure what you’d like to do with your life. Career self-assessments can be found online. Many websites like this one can offer helpful guidance. Most schools have career centers or guidance counselors available to all enrolled students. These resources can help you shape a vision for your future."

While it is important to be considerate towards other people, it is not necessary to give up your ability to make your own decisions. For example, if you are looking for a place to live with a roommate, be sure you are making decisions based on what is best for you. If you prefer to rent a house and have a bit more independence than an apartment building, stick to your preference and do not allow your roommate to talk you into something that you don’t want to do. It can also be common for some people to allow their spouses or significant others to make all the decisions in their relationship, from where to go out to eat to where to live and what kind of car to buy. Changing the dynamic of such a relationship may strain the relationship, but having a part in the decision making at both daily and long-term levels can give you greater control of your life.

Experts say your total monthly long-term debt payments should not exceed 36% of your gross monthly income (i.e., your income before taxes, health insurance premiums, etc. are taken out). [6] X Research source Long-term debt includes your mortgage, auto payments, student loans, and of course, credit cards. If you exceed 36% of your gross monthly income, create a plan on how you will pay down the debt, starting with the credit lines with the highest interest rates. Possibilities include transferring balances to a lower interest rate credit line, re-designing your monthly budget to allocate more funds to debt servicing, or consolidating debt into one payment with a low interest rate. For example, if you own your own home and can re-finance, it may be possible to use the equity in your home to pay down your debt without opening another line of credit."

[8] X Research source If you don’t know where your money goes each month, go through your living expenses (rent/mortgage, utilities, insurance, taxes) along with how often you eat out, what you buy, gas purchases and entertainment expenses. A sample monthly budget may look something like this: Mortgage/Rent: $1,000 Car payment: $400 Gas/Electric: $200 Water: $30 Cell Phone: $100 Television/Internet: $100 Food: $800 Entertainment: $150 Homeowner’s/Renter’s Insurance: $300 Health Insurance: $300 Car Insurance: $100 Gas for vehicle: $200 Child Care: $600 Credit card payments: $200 Other Expenses (may include child support, alimony, activities or classes, property taxes, or additional utility services such as trash/recycling pick-up or a “land line” telephone bill.) Seeing the expenses as compared to your monthly income on paper may create more of awareness about what you can and cannot afford.

Consult your vehicle manual and ask a trained professional for a demonstration. Discover how an engine and belts work. Being able to examine and know when a belt is about to blow or if you could be experiencing engine trouble can save you not only time but money.

For example, as a couple’s child grows, both parents must develop their own relationship with the child and their own parenting style while also co-parenting, especially on larger issues that require both parents to work through (e.g., going to college).

Use music to stimulate your emotions. When you are ready to go, just write. Do not worry about perfect grammar, spelling, or word choice.
