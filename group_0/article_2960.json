Token grunge girls were all over 90s TV shows. For example, Angela Chase and Rayanne Graff from My So-Called Life were always covered in plaid. Try to stay away from bright colors, focusing more on earth tones and darker colors, such as brown, red, burgundy, black, gray, mustard yellow, and dark green. The plaid shirt should always be oversized and even have holes in it. Try looking at thrift stores or second-hand stores for flannel shirts. These shirts will often have a worn, faded look, which is exactly the kind of plaid you want as a grunge girl. If you buy your plaid new, avoid tight-fitting or girly fit shirts. The grunge look is unstructured and loose. Try looking in the men's section or go a size or two larger than you normally buy. You can wear the shirt either as an overshirt with another shirt underneath or tied around your waist. Avoid wearing it buttoned up. This is more grunge boy than grunge girl. If you want something plaid that is slightly more girly, look for a checkerboard plaid dress that you can wear over ripped jeans."

The clothes are worn, large, and comfortable because you don't care about many things anymore. Don't rush around and stress about anything. A grunge girl is content to just sit around and listen to some good music. She is not typically high strung or obsessive. She lets things happen as they happen without much though or care."

Although grunge girls don't care, they get an attitude with people when they try to make them conform or join things. Don't listen when people tell you to do something. Just tell them you want to sit and listen to your music all day long. Do what you have to do in life, but get an attitude with others when they interact with you. The way Courtney Love, Liv Tyler, and Drew Barrymore acted in the 90s provide perfect examples for the grunge attitude. Their lack of respect for authority and snarky attitude led them to constant trouble and even some arrests. This doesn't apply to your grunge friends. They understand your carelessness and apathy for the world, which means you don't have to get an attitude with them to get your point across."
