      "content": "Discuss the dynamic with your partner. Dominance and submission is a sexual kink based on some degree of power exchange between the two partners. Typically, one partner (the submissive) gives up all or most of their power to their partner (the dominant), who then takes care of them and directs them during a sexual scene. [1] X Research source Some dominant and submissive relationships go beyond the bedroom, but it's usually best to experiment with power exchange in the bedroom first, then gradually expand that dynamic if it suits you. It's helpful to talk about how far you and your partner want the power exchange to go. Regardless, always allow your partner to choose safe words and gestures that will stop play if things go sideways for them. You'll probably also find it beneficial to read about dominance and submission practices in the kink community. Reading and discussing with your partner can help the two of you come up with ideas as well."

      "content": "Set the protocol for your dynamic with your partner. In normal social situations, you're likely to use more formal manners in some contexts than others, and it's exactly the same way with D/s relationships! Some couples want a more formal, high-protocol dynamic, while others have something more casual. [2] X Research source If dominance doesn't come naturally to you but you want to be more dominant, using some high-protocol elements can help you feel more dominant. For example, you might have your partner address you as \"Master.\" You and your partner can also set rituals to get in and out of the headspace of your dynamic. For example, you might have your partner kneel before you and kiss your feet. If your dynamic doesn't extend beyond the bedroom, these rituals can serve as a sort of light switch to turn the dynamic on and off."

      "content": "Plan how the sexual scene will play out. As a dominant, make sure you have a good understanding of your partner's limits so you can plan a scene within those. Then, discuss the scene with your partner so they can help you plan for any possible issues. [3] X Research source For example, many D/s scenes revolve around your partner asking you for permission to do something. If they do it without permission, they would be \"punished\" in some way. The point of these conversations is to discuss what rules are considered fair by both of you and what punishments are okay. If your partner wants to be surprised by the scene, just mention anything that might present a safety concern for them. For example, if you plan to blindfold your partner, you'd want to make sure that they wouldn't accidentally hurt themselves while they couldn't see."

      "content": "Add props or accessories to spice things up. Being dominant in bed actually has nothing to do with whips and chains—even if these kinks are pretty closely associated. But if you and your partner are interested in experimenting with bondage or kink play, go for it! Sometimes, accessories and props can help you and your partner better get into the right headspace for the dynamic. [4] X Research source For example, you might have your partner wear a collar while you're in a scene to symbolize that they belong to you. Ultimately, you and your partner get to decide what dominance and submission means for you and what other activities it includes."

      "title": "Familiarize yourself with any props you'll be using.",
      "content": "Familiarize yourself with any props you'll be using. This is for your partner's safety as well as your own. Make sure you're proficient at handling anything you're going to use and can anticipate how your partner will respond to it. This allows you to have more control over the scene. [5] X Research source For example, if impact play is part of your scene, test the implements by hitting your own arm at different levels of intensity so you know how they feel. Your personal knowledge allows you to safely escalate the intensity of the scene in a way that's pleasurable for both you and your partner. If bondage is part of your scene, make sure you have whatever you need to quickly extricate your partner in an emergency."

      "content": "Direct the action of the scene. This is ultimately what a sexual dom does, once all of the negotiating and planning is out of the way. Scenes involving dominance and submission are rarely spontaneous (especially at first) because of the potential safety issues involved. [6] X Research source After you and your partner have been in the dynamic for a while, you can start being more spontaneous because you'll be more familiar with each other's boundaries and preferences."

It also doesn't mean that you can tell them to do whatever you want or punish them if they refuse. You have a power exchange , which means your partner can withdraw from that exchange at any point. They entered into that exchange because they trust you to respect their boundaries. [7] X Research source Typically, you'll also have a safeword in place in case something happens that neither of you anticipated in advance or your partner just gets overwhelmed in the moment."

      "content": "Engage in aftercare following every scene. Talk to your partner about what this looks like for them, because different people have different needs. People might also have different aftercare needs depending on the type of scene. [8] X Research source For example, some people might want to cuddle together after a scene, while others need to get something to eat or take a shower. Aftercare is super important to reinforce your emotional connection with your partner."

      "content": "Stand up straight and don't be afraid to take up space. Dominance is a social trait, meaning it's something you can only do when you're out around other people. [9] X Research source Stand and walk with good posture and take up space. You'll exude confidence and people will take notice. For example, when you walk into a room, you might stride to an empty chair, making brief eye contact with each person you walk past and nodding to them. Always walk into a room as though you belong there, without hesitation. Wherever you are, occupy that space as though you're entitled to every bit of it."

Enunciate your words clearly and speak loudly enough that everyone who needs to hear you can hear you. Avoid up-talk or filler words that can make you sound less confident. [10] X Research source If you replace basic filler words like \"um\" with a phrase such as \"you see,\" your speech will sound more intentional even though the phrase serves the same function. You might also repeat back a paraphrase of what the other person said. It shows that you're listening and allows them to correct any misunderstanding while also giving you time to think about a confident response. It also helps to simply pause and collect your thoughts before saying what you're going to say. This also provides space to make sure the other person has finished talking."

      "content": "Look after your physical appearance. This doesn't mean that you have to look like a fashion model, but dominant people tend to be well-groomed and appropriately dressed for the occasion. And studies show dressing to impress gives your self-esteem a boost as well, so you'll not only look more dominant, you'll feel more dominant too. While looks aren't everything when it comes to being dominant and appearances can be deceiving, you'll often get a lot further if you look the part. For example, suppose your manager needs someone to make a presentation to a client at the last minute. If you came to work wearing a suit instead of jeans and a t-shirt (or had a suit on hand), you'd be ready to take the lead."

      "content": "Adopt a growth mindset. A growth mindset just means that you believe your abilities and behaviors aren't fixed for life. Rather, you can change them if you want. This mindset is crucial if you want to become more dominant—especially if dominance doesn't come naturally to you. [13] X Research source It might seem like a really basic thing but you can't really change anything about yourself without believing that it's possible!"

      "content": "Look for opportunities to exercise more control. For a dominant person, the drive for control goes hand in hand with the drive for power. The more control you have, the more power you have over various parts of the whole. [14] X Research source Every decision that you give to make unleashes an opportunity for you to exert your control and express your dominance in the process. The best part is that you can do this without even taking charge! For example, if your partner wants to remodel the living room, you might say, \"Before we pick new furniture we need to paint. I'll pick out the paint and we can go from there.\""

Being dominant means not compromising your values, which means when you see something going on that isn't in line with your values, you say something about it . This assertiveness is what sets a dominant person apart from a bully.

A person who is domineering acts only for themselves, while a person who is dominant acts for the good of everyone involved."

[16] X Research source When your emotions are starting to overwhelm you, excuse yourself and do some deep breathing exercises to calm down before you react to the situation. If you seem to be in control of your emotions , people will find it easier to rely on you—especially in a crisis situation."

      "content": "Convince rather than ask. When you ask someone for permission to do something (or to do something for you), you're giving them the upper hand because they have the power to say no. If you want to be dominant, look for ways to \"make them an offer they can't refuse\"— be persuasive , and don't take no for an answer! [17] X Research source If you feel intimidated by this, don't be! Sometimes people will back down the second they're challenged—and even if they don't, you're still not in any worse position than you were before. At the same time, be empathetic and take other people's perspectives into account—they'll actually be more willing to go along with what you want if they feel heard."

      "content": "Assign people tasks to get the job done. A dominant person leads, which means they're typically going to get others to do the lion's share of the work. That doesn't mean they won't roll up their sleeves and pitch in when necessary, but they also know that teamwork makes the dream work. [18] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source To act more dominant, simply tell people what to do, rather than asking them if they'll do something or asking generally what people are willing to do. For example, if you've got a few people together to set up for a party, you might say, \"Okay—Laura, set out the chairs. Mike, work on the sound system with me. The rest of you can take care of the food.\" If someone doesn't want to do something you've told them to do, they might refuse, but that doesn't put you in any worse of a position than you were before. Often, though, people will just go along with whatever you say."

You'll always feel comfortable with your decisions and you'll be able to make them very quickly—which is a common ability with dominant people. [19] X Research source For example, you're offered a promotion but it would require you to move away from your hometown where all of your family lives. If family is one of your core values, you wouldn't even have to think about this—your family comes first."

      "title": "Do what you say and say what you mean.",
      "content": "Do what you say and say what you mean. People with dominant personalities tend to be very direct and straightforward. Because they're not worried about pleasing others, they feel free to tell it like it is—even if that honesty might upset someone. If they say they're going to do something (or not do something), others know they can count on that. [20] X Research source Be careful not to over-promise—make sure whatever you tell people is something that will be relatively easy for you to deliver. Over time, you'll build a reputation for being an honest and reliable person."

      "content": "Prepare for things that could foreseeably happen. A big part of being dominant is not being caught unaware. After all, it's pretty hard to dominate in a situation you weren't prepared for. But the more you're prepared for, the more control you have. And everyone will benefit from lower stress because they know that if something happens, you're ready. [21] X Research source For example, you might book a backup indoor venue in case the event at the park gets rained out. This is often as simple as having a charger handy in case someone's phone dies or having an umbrella in case it rains. Look for little ways you can prepare for something that will likely happen. If something happens once, prepare so that it won't be a problem if it comes up again."

      "content": "Take responsibility when things don't go according to plan. A dominant person wants to show that they are in control, which means they don't blame other people when things go awry. Instead, they analyze and learn from their mistakes so they can prevent a similar outcome next time. [22] X Research source Don't go overboard, though! Only take responsibility for things that were within your control to do differently. There's no need to accept the blame for something that wasn't your fault or that you couldn't have reasonably done anything to prevent."

But when they lose, they know how to look back at their performance and figure out what they need to improve on so they can come out on top next time. [23] X Research source Dominant people are authentically proud of their accomplishments and victories and openly celebrate their strengths—so don't be shy about celebrating something you did well."

A dominant person isn't one to sweep something under the rug or keep kicking a can down the road—no, they're going to deal with a problem efficiently as soon as it presents itself so they don't have to deal with it anymore. [24] X Research source Instead of ignoring a problem and hoping it will go away, be more dominant and take steps to resolve it. For example, if you notice your car making a funny noise, you might take it to a mechanic and get the problem fixed rather than waiting until your car breaks down. Doing this also allows you more time for planning so you can be more in control. If the car repairs are more than you can afford but the mechanic says you can drive the car for another month without making the repair, that means you've got time to save money instead of having to take out a costly emergency loan. This is even better if it's a problem that no one else has noticed yet—then you can really be the hero who saves the day!"

This doesn't mean that you can't have a drink every now and then, but alcohol and recreational drugs cause you to lose control, and that's the last thing a dominant person wants to do. Plus, being in control allows you to step in if others have gone too far and need help. [26] X Research source This self-control is what sets a dominant person apart from an abusive person. An abusive person often has a lack of self-control and seeks to control the people around them as a result. Research shows self-control combined with grit (pursuing a goal despite setbacks) is likely to lead to success.

      "content": "Decide and act quickly. People with dominant personalities don't spend a lot of time analyzing all of the possible outcomes before making a decision—they simply pick what they want and go with it. They don't doubt themselves or question their ability to make the right choice. [28] X Research source A lot of this comes from self-confidence—when you feel confident in yourself and your abilities, you don't second-guess yourself. Dominant personalities also aren't afraid to take risks. They aren't afraid to go all-in on an out-of-the-box idea that has the potential to pay off big.

[31] X Research source So if you want to encourage your partner to be more dominant in your relationship, praising them when they exhibit dominant behavior is a great place to start. For example, you might say, \"I loved the way you took over back there, you saved us a lot of hassle! You're really good at that.\" With frequent compliments like this, your partner will start to feel more comfortable expressing more dominant behavior."

Power is different from social rank or status, which you can get without doing anything.

For example, you might have power in high school because you are a member of a varsity sports team. But after you graduate, you'll no longer have that power.
