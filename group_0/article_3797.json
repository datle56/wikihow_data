[1] X Research source Some states recognize online ordinations as legal, while others only consider you a minister if you have a congregation. Look up your state's laws, or call your county clerk for more information. Some states require minister licensing, which is the process of registering as clergy with the state. Here are some general guidelines [2] X Research source : The legality of online ordination has been the subject of recent court cases in a variety of states. Laws regarding this issue are constantly evolving, so it's important to have up-to-the minute information about whether you'll be able to legally perform different ceremonies where you live. [3] X Research source Organizations such as prisons and hospitals that allow outside ministers to visit and minister to their clients, inmates, and patients have the right to refuse recognition to certain ministers. Many federal institutions, especially those addressing the needs of veterans and the military, do not recognize online ordinations no matter how legal they may be."

      "content": "Consider the online option carefully if you truly want to be a minister. Getting ordained online offers an alternative to traditional ordination routes. If you feel you've been called to serve as a minister, you might find it more fulfilling to undergo formal training. That being said, attending seminary school does require time and money. Getting ordained online tends to be relatively inexpensive, and will allow you to perform weddings and other ceremonies. However, each denomination has their own requirements, so online ordination doesn't guarantee you will be eligible to serve as a pastor in every traditional church. If this is your goal, you may use your online ordination to begin your own church or consider looking into seminary programs that may better suit your needs. Some online churches are non-denominational or interfaith and open to people of any religious background. If you are actively involved in another religion, be sure to check that becoming a non-denominational minister will not affect your standing in your religion."

      "content": "Find an organization that suits your needs and your beliefs. Do some research to find an online ministry you can see yourself joining. Some organizations simply send you ordination papers, while, others provide training as to how to perform weddings and other ceremonies. Make sure that whatever you choose is an incorporated and legitimate service. [5] X Research source Some sites are quite religious, while others are purposely unaffiliated with any particular religion. Choose a service that will send you a hard copy of your credentials, with an original signature and a seal. Additionally, find out if they'll send a letter of good standing or a wallet card. [6] X Research source Free ordinations will usually provide a certificate to be printed from your browser. A higher-quality version, often with a gold seal will normally have to be ordered for a nominal fee. Donâ€™t be fooled by sites that say a church must be a tax-exempt organization to be valid. This is not true. It is totally up to the organization to decide if they wish to apply to the IRS for tax-exempt status. Some organizations choose to keep government out of religion through the payment of taxes."
