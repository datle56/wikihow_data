      "content": "Avoid situations that trigger your emotions if you can. Notice what makes you feel upset, angry or frustrated. Think of how you could minimize these triggers in your life, then take precautions to help you stay out of these situations. [1] X Research source Let’s say you notice that you become upset when you’re hungry, when you feel rushed, and when someone uses your personal items at school or work. You could avoid these triggers by carrying snacks, giving yourself extra time in your schedule to get tasks done, and keeping your personal items stored away when you aren’t using them. You won’t always be able to avoid your triggers. For example, getting a last minute assignment might make you upset, but you can’t stop your boss or instructor from giving you one. When this happens, relax your system by breathing deeply , counting to 10, or thinking of something that makes you happy."

      "content": "Use positive self talk to help you process your emotions quicker. Catch your negative or anxious thoughts when they happen. Then, question the accuracy of that thought.

If your mind wanders, pull it back to the moment. Don’t think about anything but what you’re doing. [3] X Research source Keeping your mind on what you're doing and not on how you feel can help you control your emotional response. Additionally, it helps calm down your body's natural reaction to emotions like stress or anger, such as tensing muscles, feeling a knot in your chest, or feeling like you need to cry. Let's say you're upset over feedback you received on an assignment. Instead of thinking about how you feel, name the actions you're taking. Say to yourself something like, \"I'm turning on my computer. Now, I'm opening the file that holds my presentation for next week. I'm reviewing the slides I already have. Now, I'm creating a new slide.\""
