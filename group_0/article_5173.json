      "content": "Brick-and-morter stores occasionally sell their testers. There's no harm in finding a fragrance you like and offering to buy the tester at a department store like Macy’s or Sephora. However, many larger chain stores have policies against selling fragrance testers. Try asking to buy testers at a smaller store, which may be less strict about reselling their tester bottles. While this is a legitimate way to purchase testers, each store may only have one or two testers at a time."

      "content": "Testers are the bottles on display at retailers. Brands offer testers to stores to allow customers to smell or try on fragrances before they buy. They contain the same product as the retail fragrance, but the tester bottle and box may not have the same print quality and packaging extras like foiling and paper stock. [2] X Research source Depending on where you buy the tester bottle, it may not be completely full when you receive it. Online discounters are more likely to have new tester fragrances that have not been used."

      "title": "Packaging is the main difference between testers and retail bottles.",
      "content": "Packaging is the main difference between testers and retail bottles. Only the boxes and bottle presentation are different. [3] X Research source Tester fragrances are sold in less expensive packaging than the retail version. The packaging of a fragrance can cost up to 6 times more than producing the actual product. Tester bottles may be the same basic shape as the retail bottles but have plain black instead of metallic ink and come without a cap. Tester products often come in plain, unbranded boxes. If there is branding, it’s basic black and white without the high-end texture or shape of retail packaging. Manufacturers mark fragrance testers by laser etching on a printed label or on the bottle’s bottom stamp. [4] X Research source You may see labels like “Tester” or “Not for Sale.”"

      "title": "There’s no difference in the quality of the fragrance in tester bottles.",
      "content": "There’s no difference in the quality of the fragrance in tester bottles. The perfume brand uses testers to entice you to buy their products, so it’s exactly the same as what you would buy in a retail store. If they used a different formulation in the tester, you may be less satisfied with your purchase. Industry insiders claim the perfume in testers is most likely mixed in the same batches as the retail versions. Some believe testers contain stronger fragrances to make customers more likely to buy, but this is a myth. [5] X Research source Fragrances often become fuller as they age. As a tester bottle sits on the display shelf, the alcohol in the perfume naturally evaporates, making the concentration stronger. This is called maceration. [6] X Research source Macerate your new tester or retail bottle of fragrance by spritzing 5-10 times into the air. Make sure you press down the atomizer all the way. Then place the bottle in the original box (if you have one) and store it in a cool, dry place for about a month. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Testers aren't usually sold for profit because they're made for marketing. If a retailer allows you to buy a tester, it may be used, or it may come in different packaging than the retail fragrance. In many cases, the cost to make a perfume is only a fraction of its retail price. The high price tag is the result of research and development, and marketing. [8] X Research source The retail price of a fragrance also covers commissions for salespeople, the manufacturer’s profit, the retailer’s profit, and any celebrity licensing or endorsement fees.

      "content": "You can buy a tester to try a fragrance for a cheaper price. Many feel buying tester bottles is a great way to experience higher-end fragrances that they may not be able to afford otherwise. Others may feel that buying testers makes it harder to determine if they have received an authentic product. Fragrance testers are sold through what is known as the grey market. This is when authentic items are bought and sold by a distributor that doesn’t have a direct relationship with the brand. Authentic grey market fragrance testers may have been imported from a country that sells the original at a lower price or purchased as overstock from authorized retailers. [10] X Research source While buying grey market fragrances from reputable sellers is legal, some prefer to support the brand by purchasing from them directly or from an authorized retailer."

While you can purchase bulk quantities of fragrances, including testers, from a wholesaler, they usually only give special discounts to distributors. They also often require minimum order quantities or dollar amounts. These distributors primarily sell only to businesses, not directly to the consumer. If you are planning to open a retail perfume shop, try networking with professionals in the industry."

      "content": "Get free samples from retail shops, online retailers, or manufacturers. If you’re just getting into perfumes, you may not know how to find perfume samples . Most stores that sell fragrances have small sample vials of around 2mL that they give to customers for free. This allows you to test out a perfume at home to see how you like the scent, longevity, and projection over the course of several days. Stores, brands, and online retailers often have a limit on how many free samples they will give to each customer. However, they may give more if you make a purchase."

Discount fragrance retailers often have manufacturer-packaged samples for sale that cost as little as a few dollars. These samples are bought from wholesalers on the grey market, much like fragrance testers. Department stores like Sephora and Ulta sell sample sets of their most popular fragrances. These sets often come with a voucher that’s redeemable for a full bottle of one of the fragrances included in the set."

      "content": "Blind buy fragrances with caution. Blind buying a fragrance is when you purchase a full bottle without testing it first. People usually blind buy after hearing multiple positive reviews for a new or trending fragrance. It’s very common to be disappointed when you buy a fragrance without testing it out first. If you don’t like a perfume you’ve blind-bought, give it away, swap it for something you like better, or sell it on eBay it to recoup some of your money."

If you really want to purchase a fragrance without testing it first, gather as much information about its scent profile and performance as possible before you buy.

Then go to the manufacturer’s website of the perfume you want to blind buy and see what notes it includes. Try to find fragrances with notes you already like. Look for flankers of fragrances you already like. Flankers are fragrances that share some of the notes with a popular perfume. The manufacturer uses one of their best-selling fragrances as inspiration for a new perfume that has a similar scent profile with a few changes to make it unique."

      "content": "Spray it on a tester strip. Most stores have paper strips available near their tester bottles. Spritz the fragrance onto the tester strip and take it with you to see if you still like the scent after a little time has passed. Only smell a few fragrances at a time. If you smell too many different strong scents, you may overwhelm your senses and go nose blind. That means you may not be able to smell all of the notes. Fragrance departments often have a small container of coffee beans on their counter. Take a moment between spritzes to smell the coffee bean to help your nose reset. If there aren’t any coffee beans available, smell an unperfumed section of your skin or clothes to help your senses adjust. [13] X Research source"

This tells you if it will work well with your body chemistry and lifestyle before you pay. [14] X Research source When you spray a fragrance on your body, your temperature, what you ate that day, and – most importantly – the pH level (or acidity) of your skin makes a difference in how it smells. [15] X Research source When testing a fragrance, don’t wear scented lotions or body sprays. The scents of these products change the scent of the fragrance you’re testing. It’s a good idea to smell fragrances before you spray them on your skin. Many people are sensitive to some of the commonly used perfume notes and may get a headache."
