If the ports match the cable that came with your Wii, then it can hook up to your Wii without any adapters or plug-ins. Connect the Wii cables to the same colored ports on the TV. This means that the yellow cable plugs into the video port, and the red and white cables plug into the audio ports.

Make sure the product listing specifies that the HDMI adapter is for Wii, as a non-Wii specific adapter will mostly not fit into the port on the back of your console. Since many smart newer TVs, like the Samsung Smart TV , only have an HDMI port , this is the best option to connect your Wii to a TV. If you're looking to connect a Wii to your TV without AV cables, this is your answer."

Many modern TVs, like LG, Vizio , and Hisense, offer component ports. Nintendo sells a Wii Component Video Cable, which is more likely to work for you than a 3rd party video cable."

For example, there will be a group of two ports on your TV and a matching group of two jacks on your component cable that you can match up and connect. Once you have the jacks plugged into the corresponding ports on the TV, you can plug the other end of the component cable into your Wii."

Fortunately, the Wii doesn't support higher than 720p resolutions anyway!"
