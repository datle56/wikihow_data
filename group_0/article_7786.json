If you’re using the water filter, remove it from inside the reservoir. Then, attach the screened intake cap to the water reservoir. If your ice maker has a side tank, simply remove it from your machine while you clean. If you have any ice inside the bin, pour it into a bowl and stash it in your freezer while you clean."

Then, unhook the top of both hoses and lay them in your sink. Simply remove the plugs from the ends of the hoses to allow any remaining water to drain out of your machine. [1] X Research source Alternatively, set a bowl or bucket below your machine and lay the hoses inside to drain the water. Ensure you’re positioning the drain hoses below the ice maker, as you need gravity on your side to drain the water."

Simply fill the water reservoir to the max line with water (about 5 cups (1.2 L)). Then, add 1 tsp (5 ml) of bleach. During the cleaning cycle, the bleach solution runs through your machine to sanitize the parts and clear out any debris. Feel free to slide the ice bin back over the water reservoir or keep it removed from the machine. Note : It’s okay to use regular tap water or distilled water to clean out your machine."

After the vinegar runs through your machine, it drains back into the water reservoir. Running the vinegar back through your machine 2 more times helps ensure all of the mineral buildup gets dissolved.

[14] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Geological Survey U.S. government agency responsible for conducting scientific research on the nation's land, natural resources, and natural disasters Go to source Depending on your water hardness, you may need to clean your machine every few weeks or every few months. [15] X Research source If your water is very hard (>10 grains per gallon (gpg)): Descale every 2 to 3 weeks. If your water is moderately hard (4-10 gpg): Descale every 1 to 2 months. If your water isn’t hard (0-4 gpg): Descale every 2 to 4 months. Test your water for hardness if you’re not sure whether your tap water is hard or soft. Tip : Use distilled water in your ice maker if you have hard water or don’t want to descale your machine as often. Distilled water is purified water that has no excess minerals."
