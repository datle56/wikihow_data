      "content": "Get a pen (red works best as it blends best with skin tone) and write little notes on any area of skin on your body. The ankles are good if you wear jeans and can cross your legs. The wrists are good if you can write on your veins with blue pen. On the inside of your thighs you can write formulas if you wear shorts. One of the best places to put notes are on your hands, for several reasons: 1) You will be using them during the whole test, 2) It is easy to hide with another hand or a shirt sleeve. Write short notes on the lines and wrinkles of your palm, the sides of the fingers, or the little piece of skin between your fingers."

I'm pretty sure that what you just asked me to do is illegal for a teacher to ask. It's very personal, by the way.\" Look shocked or else they will be very suspicious."
