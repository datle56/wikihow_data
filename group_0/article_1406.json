Next, take out a clean spoolie, and comb the hair on your eyebrows, following the direction that they are naturally growing in. For most people, this would be straight up on the inner corners, outwards along the arch, and down towards the tail end.

      "content": "Apply eyebrow pencil or powder , if needed, then comb them back into shape with a spoolie. Filling in your brows is completely optional. If you already have thick, full brows, you probably don't have to do this. Start with a medium taupe shade; it works well with dark and light-colored eyebrows without appearing too pale or too dark. If your eyebrows are red, consider a light, reddish brown pencil or powder instead. [3] X Research source Fill in your brows using short, hair-like strokes instead of simply coloring them in. This helps mimic the texture of brow hair and provides better visual density. Use a lighter shade if you have very dark eyebrows. Never use straight black. Instead, opt for a very dark brown or charcoal. It will look softer, more natural, and less harsh. [4] X Research source Vary the shades on your brows. You can stick with the same color, but use a lighter hand towards the inner part, and concentrate the product towards the ends. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply clear brow gel following the direction your eyebrow hairs are growing in. You can use the spoolie that came with your tube of clear brow gel, or you can use a new spoolie. Following the same technique as before, comb the spoolie upwards at the inner part of your eyebrows, straight towards the arch, and back down towards the tail. If you applied eyebrow pencil or powder, it might be a good idea to dip your brush in brush cleaner and wipe it off with a clean towel before each application. This way, you won't risk tinting the clear gel with any residual eyebrow pencil or powder."

Stay within your eyebrow, and don't let the brow gel extend past the hairs. Outline from the inner corner of your eyebrow all the way to the outer corner. [7] X Research source Use a brush with stiffer bristles, like the kind you'd use to apply lipstick. Avoid brushes with soft bristles, like an eyeshadow blending brush. Avoid applying too much.
