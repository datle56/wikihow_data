      "content": "Yes, apple cider vinegar can be used to clean many household surfaces. Thanks to its acidic and antibacterial properties, apple cider vinegar safely and effectively breaks down dirt and disinfects hard surfaces like countertops, stovetops, sinks, faucets, refrigerators, walls, etc. Before using apple cider vinegar to clean these surfaces, however, mix it with an equal amount of water. Some surfaces are not safe to clean with apple cider vinegar. Avoid using ACV on hardwood floors, wood cabinets, waxed wood furniture, and natural stone countertops (marble, granite, quartz, etc). [1] X Research source Also, steer clear of metals like copper, aluminum, and cast iron— the vinegar can strip away protective coatings on these metals and cause them to rust. [2] X Research source Be careful not to get the vinegar on the areas of your dishwasher or washing machine that have rubber lining. The acid can break down the rubber seal over time, damaging your appliance. [3] X Research source"

[29] X Research source Apple cider vinegar also isn’t particularly effective when a disinfectant needs to be left to sit on a surface to fully kill the bacteria, since the acidity in ACV may began to eat away at the surface if left too long. Essentially, you need to do a deep clean of your home and want to make sure you kill as much harmful bacteria as possible, you may want to use a commercial all-purpose cleaner.
