Making a crazy cool outfit is the most important part of going to an ABC party, but here are a few things to consider while you're planning your look: Go for a mix of style and comfort. A bathrobe or towel is comfy, but isn't very creative. On the other hand, a comic book dress is super cool, but might be uncomfortable all night. Try to find something both interesting and comfy to wear for a few hours. Wear layers. Wear multiple layers of your material, or wear some fitted clothing underneath. This will keep you warm and keep you covered in case your costume starts falling apart. Try not to overthink it. ABC parties are all about fun! Once you make an outfit, stop stressing over the look and enjoy yourself."
