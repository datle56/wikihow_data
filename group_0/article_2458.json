      "title": "Locate the diamonds on the table.",
      "content": "Locate the diamonds on the table. On any regulation pool table, you’ll notice a series of light-colored dots running down the length of the rails. These are known as “diamonds,” and they’re an integral part of establishing precise angles. No matter where on the table you’re playing from, you can use the diamonds to sink bank shots with accuracy and consistency. The basic idea behind the diamonds is they help create “mirrored” angles. If you shoot the object ball into a diamond at a 45 degree angle, it should bounce off the rail at 45 degrees in the opposite direction. [1] X Research source Lining up your shot with the diamonds will only work if you’re able to shoot straight and smooth, so be sure to practice your stroke to ensure success."

    {
      "title": "Number the diamonds along each rail.",
      "content": "Number the diamonds along each rail. Beginning with the foot rail, count each diamond up from 1 (starting at the corner pocket, which is the imaginary first diamond). Do the same for the longer side rail. You should end up with two separate ranges of numbers, typically 1-5 and 1-9. [2] X Research source The exact number of diamonds on the rails may differ depending on the size of the table—a 9’ regulation pool table will have 5 diamonds on the foot rails and 9 on the sides. It’s not important for a table to have a certain number of diamonds. What is important is knowing how to use the diamonds that are there to determine your most promising shooting angle."

    {
      "title": "Assign a number position for the cue and object balls.",
      "content": "Assign a number position for the cue and object balls. Take note of where each ball is in relation to the diamonds you just numbered. For instance, if the cue ball is sitting in front of the corner pocket, it would be at diamond 1. An object ball just short of the far side pocket would be at diamond 4. Balls resting between diamonds can be assigned an intermediate number, such as 3.5. Assuming you’re attempting a bank shot from one end of the table to the other, use the foot rail diamonds to determine the position of the balls in play."

    {
      "title": "Split the difference to target the right diamond.",
      "content": "Split the difference to target the right diamond. In the example just described, the position of the object ball (diamond 4) minus the position of the cue ball (diamond 1) equals 3 diamonds' length. Divide this number in half to find the halfway point between the two balls (1.5 diamonds' length away). [3] X Research source You’ll need to aim for the imaginary diamond at the halfway point (diamond 2.5) in order to achieve a perfect mirrored angle and pocket the object ball. Once you’ve discovered the correct angle, all you have to do is bank the object ball straight into the diamond and let physics take care of the rest."

      "title": "Add and divide the ball positions for precise kick shots.",
      "content": "Add and divide the ball positions for precise kick shots. First, find the numbered positions of the cue and object balls and add them together—using the example positions, this gives you 5. Then, divide this number in half to get 2.5. This will tell you exactly where to hit the cue ball in order to get the object ball moving in the right direction. [4] X Research source A kick shot (also known as a “lag” shot) is when you bank the cue ball before it strikes the object ball. This type of shot is useful when there are other balls in the way of a more direct shot. Kick shots can be tricky because if your margin of error is even a little bit off, the cue ball will strike the object ball at the wrong angle, throwing off your shot."

      "title": "Pay attention to the placement of the cue and object balls.",
      "content": "Pay attention to the placement of the cue and object balls. It’s important to observe where the balls are in relation to one another in order to select the right pockets for reference. Plan out your shot ahead of time by selecting a target pocket that you want to sink the object ball in. Generally speaking, the best target pocket is the one that’s closest with the least amount of obstructions. When sighting your shot, use the diamond that’s an equal distance between the cue ball and the target pocket."

    {
      "title": "Draw a line from the mouth of the target pocket.",
      "content": "Draw a line from the mouth of the target pocket. Imagine that the line extends from the opening of the pocket straight to the opposite rail. This is what’s known as the “cross pocket line.” Make a mental snapshot of this line and hold it in your mind. The cross pocket line is the one you ordinarily use to line up straight shots. If you need help visualizing the line, try laying your cue across the table at the appropriate angle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw a second line from the object ball to the opposite pocket.",
      "content": "Draw a second line from the object ball to the opposite pocket. This line, also called the “ball pocket line,” will run from the center of the object ball to the pocket mirroring the one you’re targeting. If you’re shooting for a corner pocket, for example, the ball pocket line should be drawn at the other corner pocket on the same end of the table. By using opposing pockets to draw your lines, you’re effectively sectioning off the table to create a central focal point."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aim for the spot on the rail where the lines intersect.",
      "content": "Aim for the spot on the rail where the lines intersect. The cross pocket and ball pocket lines will form an “X.” Draw one more short line from the middle of the X directly to the opposite rail. This is the “bank point line,” and it indicates where you should aim to set up a proper mirror angle and sink a difficult bank shot. After you’ve found the bank point line, you can set up your shot the way you normally would, only with a definite visual guide in mind. Use the diamonds to keep track of the position of the blank point line. Picturing cross pocket lines is a quicker, simpler way to calculate angles during competitive play than counting diamonds."

      "title": "Apply English as needed.",
      "content": "Apply English as needed. Whether you’re using the diamonds or cross pocket lines, there will always be some degree of inaccuracy. By striking the cue or object ball forcefully at either edge, you can generate a little English, or lateral ball spin. English is useful for helping overcome imprecise angles and making sure that the ball enters the pocket from just the right direction. [5] X Research source English refers to the left or right rotation of a ball, and is not be confused with topspin. [6] X Research source A good example of when English might be necessary is when you have the angle of your shot zeroed in but striking the ball directly would cause it to deflect off the rails."

      "title": "Hit the cue ball with an appropriate amount of force.",
      "content": "Hit the cue ball with an appropriate amount of force. Striking a ball with medium-to-high force causes it to skid rather than roll, which results in a truer banking angle. It also eliminates other factors that can interfere with your shot, like friction and drag from the felt. A gentler stroke, on the other hand, will give you more control over cue ball spin and English, which can come in handy for delicate shots. [7] X Research source The power you put into your stroke will usually be determined by the distance between the cue and object balls, and between the balls and the rails. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Try kick shots when other shots are blocked.",
      "content": "Try kick shots when other shots are blocked. Sometimes, you won’t have a clear path to a straight or banked shot. In these situations, banking the cue ball off the rails allows you to bypass obstacles and sink a ball in the process. It will then be a cinch to pull off shots that wouldn’t otherwise be possible. [9] X Research source Kick shots are also a good way to avoid fouls, since they don’t require you to risk contacting the other player’s balls. Unless you excel at kick shots, it’s typically safest to use them as a last resort."

      "title": "Practice.",
      "content": "Practice. When it comes to getting a feel for the table, there’s no substitute for simply playing more. Even if a shot makes sense to you on theoretical level, you might have to attempt it dozens of times before you get the hang of it. This is especially true of bank shots, which force you to analyze the table and showcase impeccable technique. [10] X Research source Make use of drills designed to refine your ability to size up bank shots on the fly. [11] X Research source Start challenging players who are more skilled than you to gain crucial experience."
