      "content": "Get a lint-free cloth and a cleaner. Avoid paper towels and facial tissues; they are too rough and leave lint. Use a microfiber towel, eyeglass cleaning cloth, or disposable lint-free cloth instead. As for cleaners, use one of the following: Distilled water: Safest option. Use distilled (or reverse osmosis) water, as tap and filtered water have minerals that could cause buildup. Diluted isopropyl alcohol: Somewhat safe. Diluted isopropyl alcohol works well, but it can cause plastic trackpads to break down faster. Electronics & eyeglass cleaner: Somewhat safe. These cleaners are usually alcohol-based, so they can cause deterioration. They can also cause some trackpads to not work properly after cleaning them. Glass cleaner: Safe for glass trackpads only. If you use glass cleaner very sparingly on plastic trackpads, they will likely be okay, but repeated use is not recommended."

      "content": "Unplug your laptop and turn it off. To avoid any potential damage to your laptop, turn it off before cleaning the trackpad. Before you begin, determine what material your trackpad is made of, as this determines what products are safest for it. Check your laptop's documentation or the manufacturer's website to see what material your trackpad is made of. If you can't find what material your trackpad is made of, use the safest/mildest cleaning products listed above ."

      "content": "Apply a small amount of your chosen cleaner to your lint-free cloth. Never spray or pour water or liquids on your laptop. The liquid could seep inside your laptop and cause damage to the internal components. Your cloth should be slightly damp, not dripping wet. If you get too much cleaner on the cloth, squeeze or wring it out until it's damp."

      "title": "Clean up any spills immediately.",
      "content": "Clean up any spills immediately. Lint-free cloths are recommended, but you can use a paper towel to blot up any liquid you spill on your laptop. Avoid using a wiping motion, which may push the liquid around and lead to more liquid getting inside your laptop. Allow your laptop to dry for 24 to 48 hours before using it again."

      "title": "Use isopropyl alcohol for sticky messes.",
      "content": "Use isopropyl alcohol for sticky messes. If you have a sticky residue on your trackpad, use a cotton swab and diluted isopropyl alcohol to clean it up. A cotton swab helps target the stickiest areas and keeps liquid from getting inside your laptop. After cleaning up the stickiest part of the mess, follow the steps in the section above to clean the entire trackpad."

      "title": "Shininess on your trackpad doesn't necessarily mean it's dirty.",
      "content": "Shininess on your trackpad doesn't necessarily mean it's dirty. If you've had your laptop for a while, the shininess on your trackpad is likely just worn from you using it. To determine if the shininess is oil or wear, wash and dry your hands thoroughly, then swipe your finger across the trackpad. If you don't feel any residue on your finger, the shininess is due to wear. The shininess could also be due to wear, but it could still feel oily if the plastic of your laptop trackpad is breaking down . If this is the case, you can still clean it like normal but avoid using alcohol-based cleaners to keep the trackpad from breaking down further."

      "content": "Some trackpads might not work correctly if you use an electronics cleaner. Depending on what material your trackpad is made of, it may not detect your finger if you use a cleaning wipe (usually marketed as electronics cleaner or eyeglass cleaner). If you clean your trackpad with one of these products and it stops working, use a small amount of isopropyl alcohol on a lint-free cloth to remove the cleaner residue."
