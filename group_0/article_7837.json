      "content": "Take your can of compressed air and spray all over the laptop. Concentrate the most on the fan, processor and memory.

If you turn it in any direction and orientation, the compressed air will actually spit out the hydrogen and it will turn into ice. Get a strong nozzle to pinpoint the direction that the air is coming out of, always aiming it into open vent ports."
