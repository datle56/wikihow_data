Use a pencil to draw the shape of the chair's seat directly onto the wood. Make the seat U-shaped where the flat side is the front and the curve is the back. Be sure the chair is perfectly symmetrical or else it won't balance well. [1] X Research source You can find templates for chair seats online or you can design your own. Make a cutout of your seat on a sheet of paper so you can trace it onto your wood. Cherry is a great type of wood to use due to its color and durability."

      "content": "Cut the shape of the seat out using a band saw or jigsaw . Turn on your saw and guide your piece of wood slowly through the blade. Cut just outside of your pencil lines so you can still sand and shape the sides of your chair. Cut off any pieces of wood that aren't a part of your seat design and throw away the scraps. [2] X Research source Wear safety glasses whenever you work with power tools to prevent anything from getting in your eyes. You may also use a handsaw if you don't have access to power tools."

Put a dot on the point with a pencil to mark where to drill your hole. Make 4 more dots to the left of your first mark each 2 1 ⁄ 4 in (5.7 cm) apart from one another. Then go back to the first mark you made and make 5 dots going along the right side of the seat. [3] X Research source Don't put a dot directly in the middle of the chair, since a spindle will go there eventually and would make a person sitting down uncomfortable."

Make sure the hole goes all the way through to the other side of the seat. Continue drilling holes on each of your marks so they're angled toward the back of the seat.

Make the holes on the back legs 15 inches (38 cm) from the front and 5 inches (13 cm) from the center of the seat. Use your drill press with a 1 in (2.5 cm) bit to make your holes. Angle the front legs to the sides and front of the chair by 5 degrees each. Angle the back legs 20 degrees toward the back of the seat and 5 degrees to the side. [5] X Research source For example, when you're drilling the left legs, make the hole for the front leg angle to the left side and toward the front of the seat. For the back leg, angle the hole toward the back of the seat and to the left side."

Dig the blade into the top of your seat and pull it toward you at an angle to dig out the shape of the seat. Work from the back of the seat toward the front to curve the area where you'll sit. You can dig up to halfway through the thickness of the wood to shape your seat how you want it. [6] X Research source Leave 2 in (5.1 cm) on the left, back, and right sides of the seat flat since that's where you'll be placing the spindles for the back and arms.

Once you've carved out the majority of your seat and you're happy with the shape, go over the seat with 320-grit sandpaper to get rid of any rough edges or burrs. Wipe the sawdust off your chair occasionally with a clean shop cloth so you can see any rough areas. [8] X Research source You can also use an electric sander, but it may leave marks on your chair.

Push the ends of the wood onto the grips of the lathe to secure it in place. Set the flat edge of a scraping lathe tool on the guard in front of the lathe and press it into your wood. Work across the entire surface of the wood while it spins so it becomes cylindrical. Periodically stop the lathe and check the thickness of your legs with a caliper. [10] X Research source Lathes can be purchased online or from hardware stores. When you first start shaping the wood, your scraper tool may meet some resistance. Use your nondominant hand to support the top of the tool so you can hold it sturdy. Always wear safety glasses while you use a lathe so you don't get sawdust in your eyes."

Look for wood that's sturdy and flexible, such as white ash, to use for your spindles. Cut the blanks to size using your bandsaw. In total, you'll need 16 spindles varying in different lengths for the supports on your chair. [12] X Research source Make 10 of your spindles 29 in (74 cm) long for the back of the chair. Use 2 spindles that are 9 in (23 cm) long for the front supports on the arms. Cut 2 spindles to 10 in (25 cm) long for the center arm supports.
