      "title": "Breathe from your diaphragm",
      "content": "Breathe from your diaphragm . When singing, you must take deep breaths and breathe from your diaphragm or abdomen. This will ensure that you are not keeping too much air in your throat and placing strain on your voice. To ensure that you are breathing with your diaphragm, try the following exercise. [1] X Research source Stand up straight and place your hands around the sides of your waist (between your pelvic bone and lowest rib). Then, take a deep breath in and try to make your fingers expand. Alternatively, you can lie on your back on the ground and inhale. Try to make your stomach, not your chest, rise when you inhale. This will help you learn what it feels like to breathe from your diaphragm."

      "title": "Practice combined breathing.",
      "content": "Practice combined breathing. When you are singing, you want to try to inhale through both your nose and mouth. If you only inhale through your nose, you will struggle to intake enough air. Similarly, if you only breathe through your mouth, you will put strain on your vocal cords by drying them out. This can impact the quality of the sound you produce. Practice breathing in through both your mouth and nose while you sing."

      "title": "Control your release.",
      "content": "Control your release. Another important aspect of singing and breathing is slowly exhaling. This will allow your tone to remain even while you sing. To practice controlled breathing, take a deep abdominal breath, then release your breath and make \"a “ssss”\" sound. Continue to exhale for approximately ten seconds. Continue to practice this technique and work on creating a consistent “ssss” sound throughout the entire exhalation."
