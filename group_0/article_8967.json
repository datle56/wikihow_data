      "content": "Buy a point-and-shoot digital camera for a user-friendly option. Point-and-shoot digital cameras are the most basic option available. They tend to be very small, lightweight, and relatively cheap. While point-and-shoot digital cameras contain only the most basic functions, they are very user-friendly and can capture quality images for personal use. [1] X Research source Point-and-shoot digital cameras generally cost anywhere from $50 to $500. While there are plenty of point-and-shoot cameras on the market that can capture great personal images, these cameras don’t allow for the creative control and quality needed for professional use.

      "content": "Get a zoom compact digital camera for a more powerful zoom lens. Zoom compact digital cameras are similar to point-and-shoot cameras in that they are small and generally affordable. Yet, unlike the most basic compacts, zoom compacts have a manual zoom option in addition to the basic automatic zoom. This allows users to capture clearer images at greater distances. Like point-and-shoot compacts, zoom compact digital cameras don’t usually have an interchangeable lens option. Zoom compacts are great for personal use but are not for professional photographers. Most zoom compacts have a zoom range of 28-300 mm. [3] X Research source These digital cameras usually cost between $150 and $500. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Try an advanced compact if you are an experienced hobbyist. Unlike point-and-shoot or zoom compacts, advanced compact digital cameras have both automatic and manual exposure and focusing modes. While more complex than most point-and-shoot and zoom options, these cameras are easy to use if you are a knowledgeable, more advanced hobby photographer. Advanced compact digital cameras generally take higher resolution pictures than other compact options. While most point-and-shoot cameras have a resolution of about 20 megapixels, for example, most advanced compacts have a resolution of about 45 megapixels. [5] X Research source Many advanced compacts can support an external flash connection, giving you more control over what your images will look like. Advanced compacts generally cost about $400 to $1,000. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Select a mirrorless camera for a compact with more creative control.",
      "content": "Select a mirrorless camera for a compact with more creative control. Mirrorless compact cameras are named as such because they do not contain an internal mirror to reflect light to the sensor. Instead, the light goes in through the lens and hits the sensor directly, enabling users to get a digital preview of the image on the rear LCD screen. [7] X Research source While mirrorless options are often as small, lightweight, and, in some cases, affordable as other compacts, many of these digital cameras have the capabilities required for professional use. [8] X Research source Many mirrorless compacts enable you to have full creative control with manual modes, interchangeable lens, external flashes, large sensors, and a resolution of up to 45 megapixels. [9] X Research source Be aware, however, that external lenses and flashes cost a minimum of $100. Mirrorless digital cameras usually cost between $400 and $4,000."

      "title": "Buy a DSLR for excellent image quality.",
      "content": "Buy a DSLR for excellent image quality. Like some mirrorless compacts, digital single lens reflex (DSLR) cameras are great for hobbyists and professionals alike. The majority of professional photographers choose DSLR cameras because they have the capability of supporting a wide range of lens and flash options and can support a large, full-frame sensor. [10] X Research source Many professionals, however, are gravitating towards mirrorless compacts for their smaller, lightweight style. A large, full-frame sensor uses more light to create an image, which allows the camera to record more image information and ultimately produce better, clearer images. [11] X Research source There is a very wide range in the quality of DSLR cameras and their corresponding parts, so make sure that you research the specific camera you are interested in. DSLR cameras can cost anywhere from $400 to $3,000. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Invest in a medium format if you need the highest quality available. Medium format cameras offer the highest image quality available and with it, the highest price tag. For most professionals, the resolution and sensor size available with medium format cameras is unnecessary. If you work for a magazine or in advertising, where highly sophisticated imaging may be required, however, a medium format digital camera might be worth the investment. Medium format cameras range anywhere from about $7,000 to well over $50,000. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Determine the sensor size you need to get the image quality you want.",
      "content": "Determine the sensor size you need to get the image quality you want. The sensor is the element inside the digital camera that determines how much light it uses to create a picture. [14] X Research source In general, the larger the sensor, the better the image quality will be. If you are a beginner and are looking for a digital camera for personal use only, the small sensor on most basic compact cameras (about 1/2.7 inch or 5.37x4.4-mm) should suffice. If you are a professional photographer, however, you will likely need to look for at least a 1-inch or 12.8x9.8-mm sensor. [15] X Research source Assessing the size of the sensor can be difficult because there is no uniform form of measurement. For example, a digital camera with a good-sized sensor might describe the sensor as 1-inch or 12.8x9.8-mm. [16] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source The best way to interpret what this means is to use the internet to consult a conversion chart, which is readily available on many websites. [17] X Research source While advertisers tend to focus on megapixels as the barometer for image quality capabilities, the physical size of the sensor actually matters much more than the megapixel count. [18] X Research source For example, a basic beginner’s compact point-and-shoot digital camera may have the same megapixel count as an expensive DSLR, but the image quality will not be the same because the DSLR will likely have a much bigger sensor."

      "content": "Get a longer optical zoom to capture longer range images. An optical zoom lens uses real optics to make objects that are far away look closer. [19] X Research source When you are comparing digital cameras, consider how many long-range images you will need to take. If you plan to use your camera for images of the moon or sporting events, for example, you will likely want to choose a camera with at least a 24x optical zoom lens. [20] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source While some basic point-and-shoot cameras may have a long-range optic zoom lens, you will likely need at least a zoom compact digital camera if you determine that you want to be able to get good quality long-range images. While increasingly rare, some cameras do still come with a digital zoom lens instead of an optical zoom. Digital zoom lenses tend to produce images that are grainier and less clear than images produced with an optical zoom lens. [21] X Research source Nowadays, though, the majority of even the most basic point-and-shoot cameras come with at least a 3x optical zoom lens. Still, it is worth it to check."

      "content": "Invest in an external flash for more control over lighting. Most digital cameras these days come with built-in flashes with adjustable brightness that are perfectly sufficient for beginners and even more advanced hobbyists. If you are looking to take high-quality indoor photos and have more creative control over the lighting, however, you will want to select a camera with an external flash attachment capability. [22] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source External flashes are usually sold separately and can cost anywhere from $12 for a basic compact to several hundred dollars for a DSLR."

      "content": "Select a digital camera with a manual mode to control the exposure. When comparing digital cameras, assess how much control you want to have over the light conditions (controlled by the ISO), depth (determined by the aperture), and shutter speed. Most digital cameras come with an automatic mode where the camera determines the ISO, aperture, and shutter speed for you. However, if you want more creative control over how your image turns out, you will want to choose a digital camera that also contains a manual mode. Some more advanced compact digital cameras come with a manual mode option, while almost all DSLR and medium format cameras will have a manual mode option. [23] X Research source Digital cameras that contain a manual mode tend to be more expensive that those without it."

      "title": "Look for higher frame rate speed if you want more image options.",
      "content": "Look for higher frame rate speed if you want more image options. The frame rate is the number of images a camera can take in one second. While there are some very slow digital cameras on the market, it is generally recommended that you choose a digital camera that takes at least 5 frames per second. [24] X Research source That way, even if you are a beginner looking for a very cheap and user-friendly option, you won’t miss capturing any of life’s important moments. All digital camera types can come with high or low frame rate speeds, so it is important that you check the information for the particular model you are interested in. If you plan to take a lot of action images (such as your child playing soccer), you will likely want to select a camera that takes 10 to 25 frames per second. Be aware that these options might be a bit more expensive than the lower speed options. [25] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a mirrorless or DSLR for more video recording capabilities. While almost every digital camera (including basic point-and-shoots) can shoot HD videos, there are high-end mirrorless and DSLR cameras available that have the capability to shoot film-quality videos. These cameras contain higher frames per second rates (60 and up) and better video stabilization than most cheaper, more compact models. [26] X Research source If you are looking for a camera with high-quality video capabilities, pay closer attention to the frames per second rate than the resolution. Several compact cameras, for example, may advertise that they can shoot video at 4K Ultra HD resolution, yet may only record at 15 frames per second. [27] X Research source"
