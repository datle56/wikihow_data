      "content": "Find the length of each diagonal. The diagonals of a rhombus are the lines that connect the opposite vertices (corners) in the center of the shape. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular and form four right triangles through their intersection. [2] X Research source Let's say the diagonals are 6 cm. and 8 cm. long."

      "content": "Multiply the length of the diagonals. Just write down the length of the diagonals and multiply them. In this case, 6 cm x 8 cm = 48 cm 2 . Don't forget to square the units since you're working in square units. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Divide the result by 2.",
      "content": "Divide the result by 2. Since 6 cm x 8 cm = 48 cm 2 , just divide the result by 2. 48 cm 2 /2 = 24 cm 2 . The area of the rhombus is 24 cm 2 . [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Find the base and the height.",
      "content": "Find the base and the height. [5] X Research source You can also think of this as multiplying the altitude of the rhombus with the length of the side of the rhombus. Let's say the height of the rhombus is 7 cm and the base is 10 cm."

Just multiply sine (33) by 4 cm 2 to get the area of the rhombus. (2 cm) 2 x sine (33) = 4 cm 2 x 0.55 = 2.2 cm 2 . The area of the rhombus is 2.2 cm 2 . [8] X Research source"
