It might hurt just a little whilst you do it if you haven't done it for a while. Cuticles are a part of your skin. They protect your nail matrix, the portion of the nail that grows, from infection. Cutting your cuticles leaves your nail matrix open to infections. It can also cause deformities in the nail, such as ridges and discoloration. Instead of cutting your cuticles, push them back to give your nail an oval appearance. It also makes it easier to create a neat polish line. Use a cuticle pusher to carefully push the cuticle back towards your nail bed. Push in the sides of the cuticle as well. Remove any dry or damaged skin. Repeat on the rest of your nails."
