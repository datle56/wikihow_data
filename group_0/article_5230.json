      "content": "It’s illegal and impossible to skip a CVV code if a merchant requires it. The CVV code is a layer of security that proves you’re the authentic card holder when you make online or phone purchases (these are called card-not-present transactions). If you don’t provide the CVV when asked, the transaction is declined and you’ll have to either give the CVV code to continue or find another CVV-less method of payment, like a wire transfer or a money-sending app like Venmo. Ultimately, there is no legal way to make a purchase as yourself without providing your card’s CVV code."

      "content": "If a merchant doesn’t require a CVV code, the transaction is unsecure. You may occasionally find yourself on a website that doesn’t ask for a CVV code at checkout. Be wary of these—CVV codes have been around since the 90s, so these sites are either very outdated or a scam to get your personal information. Similarly, if a scammer has your other credit card information, like the card number and expiration date, they can still use your card to make purchases on sites like these even if they don’t have the CVV code. [1] X Research source If you’re setting up recurring transactions, the merchant may only ask for the CVV code for the first payment. All following transactions will be considered authorized. Watch out for software that claims to enable online purchases without entering a CVV code. These are usually malware schemes attempting to access your confidential information."

Banks or card issuers may give you your card with a temporary PIN, but in most cases, you’ll have to change it to a customized number of your choosing for security.

For card-present transactions (transactions where you physically swipe, insert, or tap your card), you don’t provide the CVV code separately since the card’s strip or chip provides the same information. The CVV code is necessary for card-not-present transactions, like online shopping or phone orders, where you can’t physically present your card to the merchant.

A phishing scam is an attempt to trick you into giving out your personal information through false emails or text messages that appear to be from legitimate sources. Scammers can collect credit card numbers and CVV codes, passwords, Social Security numbers, and more this way. To avoid falling for phishing scams : Be wary of entering personal information through links sent to you in emails. Visit the company’s website without clicking the link or contact them directly. Don’t call any phone numbers listed in a suspicious email. Look for signs of fraudulence in emails like typos, logos that don’t match the real company’s branding, and wrong URL extensions (like an email coming from a “.org” address when the company’s website has a “.com” extension)."

To avoid keylogging scams: Only enter credit card information on secure sites with a URL beginning with “https” and that show the padlock icon in the web address bar.
