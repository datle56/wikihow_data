      "content": "Capricorns are the most hardworking signs in the zodiac. [1] X Research source If you're the typical Libra, you might not quite understand Capricorn's drive. He seems stubborn and single-minded in the pursuit of his goals—he is a Goat, after all. But tell him you admire his tenacity and he might just turn to a stubborn and single-minded pursuit of you! In his mind, his work ethic is his most prized virtue. Mention it and you've found a way directly into his heart. He wants nothing more than to be admired for his focus and drive."

      "content": "A Capricorn guy tends to be cautious when it comes to romance. Starting a relationship means taking a risk, and Capricorns are one of the most risk-averse signs in the zodiac. As an outgoing, confident Libra, go ahead and make that leap he's hedging about—he'll thank you later. For example, you might say, \"Hey, I really like spending time with you. Wanna grab lunch sometime?\" If you have something special coming up, you might invite him along. He'll definitely enjoy getting to know you better through something you like. This doesn't mean you want to push him. Keep it casual and let the relationship bloom in its own time. Rest assured a Capricorn will do everything in his power to build a strong foundation that will keep you two stable in the future. You really need to cut to the chase with a Capricorn. Ask him directly what you need or want!"

      "content": "The typical Capricorn is a natural leader who loves to guide others. Libras have the reputation for being indecisive, but the truth is that you're not ready to make a decision until you've considered all the options. Your favorite Goat understands this and he'll be honored if you consult him about something important to you. For example, you might say, \"My company just offered me a promotion, but I'm not sure the added responsibility is worth the extra money. Would you mind taking a look at it and giving me your thoughts?\" Issues involving your career or your direction in life are areas where he'll likely be strongest and most comfortable guiding you. He's proud of his work ethic and goal-oriented lifestyle and feels he has a lot to offer here. Keep in mind that his advice is likely to be very practical and utilitarian. If you tend to be more artsy and whimsical (and many Libras are!), you might not be the biggest fan of what he has to say. Capricorns are very practical about the people they care about, and will be happy to offer help if you ask for it."

      "content": "A Capricorn typically wants a traditionally feminine woman on his arm. He's the strong, silent type—think Humphrey Bogart (himself a Capricorn) in \"Casablanca\"—and he prefers a soft, ladylike partner. Fortunately for you, as a daughter of Venus, you personify femininity. [2] X Research source There's no doubt he'll be interested when you saunter into any event dressed to the nines—and he'll definitely want to have you next to him. Traditional femininity extends beyond your attire to your behavior as well. Ever the gentleman, the Capricorn guy will open doors and pull out chairs for you. Accept his chivalry with ladylike grace and poise. Manners and social protocol also tend to be very important to Capricorn guys. As long as you're always polite, he'll be proud to spend time with you."

      "content": "Capricorns tend to be pretty pessimistic and can use an encouraging word. Luckily, you Libra ladies are known for being happy and optimistic. You'll see the silver lining in his brewing cloud—all you have to do is point it out to him. If you lift him up, he'll know that he needs to keep you close. For example, if he's frustrated about a coworker and convinced their project will be a bust, you might remind him how he always comes through in a pinch and assure him that he'll get the work done that needs to be done."

      "content": "Your Capricorn man wants to take the lead in a relationship. This likely suits you just fine—especially if you're the typical Libra woman who struggles to make decisions. Relieved of that pressure, you can just relax and have a good time, which is something you're definitely good at. [3] X Research source For example, you might say, \"So, where are we going to dinner on Friday night?\" This tells him that he's in charge and you're content to go along with his decision. If you have ideas for things you want to do, suggest them in a subtle way, then let him make the final plans. For example, you might say, \"I heard there's a new impressionist exhibit at the gallery downtown. That's always been my favorite style—I'd love to go.\""

      "content": "A Capricorn typically doesn't play games with romance. Libras tend to be pretty flirtatious and take things lightly, which usually isn't going to go over well with a Capricorn. Ultimately, though, you're both looking for the same thing—you're just going about it in different ways. Let him know that while you do flirt and have fun, you don't take love lightly. Treat feelings and emotions as serious and important things as well. Give them gravity instead of tossing them out in an offhand or joking way. If you're after an exclusive commitment or looking forward to being a wife and mother, it will thrill him to hear you talk about that."

      "title": "Capricorn guys are focused on action and results rather than talk.",
      "content": "Capricorn guys are focused on action and results rather than talk. As a Libra lady, you love to talk, and you likely have a thousand different ideas and things you want to do. Just because you talk about them doesn't mean you're actually going to do them—but that doesn't make any sense to a Capricorn guy. You'll impress him if you keep your ideas to yourself until you're ready to take action, then follow through immediately. For example, if you tell him that you want to start a new exercise program, he'll naturally expect you to start immediately. If you don't actually start for several months, he might start to think you don't mean what you say. With a more creative project, remember to give him updates on steps you're taking towards your overall goal. He'll be impressed with how you break it down into manageable chunks so you can make steady progress."

      "content": "Capricorns are never in a rush when it comes to matters of the heart. He might come across as cold and unemotional initially, but he's really not. Goats take emotions very seriously and are cautious about expressing them. Since Libra ladies tend to wear their hearts on their sleeves, this might be hard for you to understand at first. Don't worry—as you get to know him, it'll make more sense. When he does tell you how he feels, treat what he says seriously and respond in kind. He'll be relieved to know that you aren't taking things lightly. Keep in mind that Capricorns are very practical about their love, and he may not express his affection in a \"mushy\" way."

      "title": "A Capricorn will put in the effort if he knows what's expected of him.",
      "content": "A Capricorn will put in the effort if he knows what's expected of him. Capricorn and Libra are slightly mismatched in terms of what they typically want out of a relationship. You can overcome this, though, if you let him know what you need. Your Capricorn guy's goal-oriented work ethic will kick in and he'll do everything he can to be the partner of your dreams. For example, Libra ladies tend to be more clingy than a Capricorn would normally like. But if you state clearly the type of reassurance you need from him, he'll know what he needs to do. And since you have the reassurance you need, you won't feel as though you have to cling to him—a win-win for your relationship! You might say, \"I know you need your space, but when I'm apart from you I worry. Could you text me occasionally to let me know I'm on your mind?\" Reader Poll: We asked 1250 wikiHow readers how they would handle a Capricorn who doesn’t prioritize their relationship, and 53% said they would communicate their feelings and expectations clearly and assertively.

      "content": "While you have different work styles, you can balance each other out. As a Libra woman, you love balance, so this is a great fit for you. Unfortunately, you and your Capricorn guy both want to be leaders. To avoid squabbles, make sure each of you has a clearly defined role in the project before you begin. [4] X Research source Projects with a short scope and duration, like putting together a piece of furniture, are great to take on early in your relationship so you can learn to work together as a team. Generally, it works best if you put your artistic sensibilities to work on the aesthetics of the project while he takes on a more utilitarian, workhorse role."

      "content": "Capricorn easily gets locked into a routine and needs you to shake things up. He tends to be pretty regimented. It's not that he's afraid to try new things—he just needs a bit of a nudge. As much as you Libra ladies enjoy new adventures, you're just the person to coax him out of his comfort zone. [5] X Research source For example, if you both enjoy reading, you might suggest that you both read the same book and discuss it together. An intellectual Goat will enjoy that level of conversation and it'll give you a little break from the boring routine. If you're both fairly active and sporty, you might try a new sport together. Learning something new together will strengthen your bond."
