There is no exact way to hold the egg. Simply hold it in whatever fashion is comfortable for you. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Tap the egg on a firm surface. Do not tap the egg on the side of a bowl or dish as the shell may shatter and get into the bowl. Instead, give the long side a few firm taps on a hard, flat surface. Your kitchen counter should work fine. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Find the indentation of the egg.",
      "content": "Find the indentation of the egg. Turn the egg over to look at the crack you made. There should be a sideways crack running down the egg and a small indentation near the center of the crack. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Take two eggs in either hand. If you feel comfortable using your non-dominant hand, you can crack two eggs at once. Secure an egg in either hand. Hold the eggs in whatever fashion is comfortable for you, but make sure your pinky and ring finger touch the bottom of the egg. [5] X Research source You may have to hold your egg slightly differently in either hand, which should not affect the process of cracking the eggs."

      "title": "Crack the eggs in your hands.",
      "content": "Crack the eggs in your hands. Tap either egg against a firm surface, like the kitchen counter. A few firm taps should make the eggshells crack slightly. Crack the eggs at the same time. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Pry the eggs opened. Hold the egg over a bowl. Keep your index and pinky finger on the base of the egg to keep it steady. Then, use your remaining fingers to pull the egg apart and release its contents into your bowl. [7] X Research source The technique will take practice, as it's tricky to crack an egg with a single hand. You may break some eggs in the process."

      "content": "Use your dominant hand for the most part. Unless you want to crack two eggs at once, always use your dominant hand. It will be much easier to maneuver the egg using your dominant hand. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove any bits of shell. Even with the best technique, shells can fall into the egg whites and yolk. To fix the issue, wet your fingers. Place your fingers into the egg whites and yokes. The water will naturally attract the bits of shells. [9] X Research source"
