Scammers may contact you with promises of risk-free business opportunities, given that you have a routing number beginning with specific numbers such as \"073\".

Scammers will then file a fraudulent U.S Unemployment claim listed with your routing and account number. When proven as fraud, Cashapp will be forced to return the thousands of dollars drawn from your own bank account, most likely putting your account balance in the negatives."
