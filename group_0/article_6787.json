      "title": "Discover an issue that you are passionate about.",
      "content": "Discover an issue that you are passionate about. It can be small -- trying to get people to clean up after their animals, for example -- or large -- trying to eliminate the sales tax on groceries in your state. Keep in mind that the smaller the issue, the better chance you have at making a difference. Local government necessarily includes fewer people, and because you are one of those people, your voice can make a difference in a way that it can’t among the millions on a state or national level."

    {
      "title": "Know what level of government is responsible for the law.",
      "content": "Know what level of government is responsible for the law. Is it a national law? Then you might want to enlist the help of a Senator or Congressman. Is it a state law? Then your state house representative or a state senator is the person to see. Finally, if the law is a county or town ordinance seek out the local councillor, supervisor, mayor, or county executive."
    },
    {
      "title": "Read the laws governing your issue.",
      "content": "Read the laws governing your issue. How old is it? Which person or group was responsible for writing it or changing it last time? It is important to know the history of the law so you have a better idea about how to change it. Knowing how it was made or changed before tells you who needs to be involved this time. If it was a vote by the city council before, chances are it will be changed by a vote by the city council again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk to the people or group that made or changed the law last time.",
      "content": "Talk to the people or group that made or changed the law last time. Ask them about the feasibility of your idea. Can they change or repeal it in the same way? If not, what will be different this time? If it was a ballot measure (this is only true for some states), ask how to get your changes on the ballot again. You’ll need to know when to file your measure and how many signatures (often 1,000+) it will take to get it back to the voters. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Learn how city government works.",
      "content": "Learn how city government works. Towns and cities have different governing structures, so if you’re working on changing a local law, figure out how yours works. Most have a mayor and some kind of city council. Some also have other positions within the city government, including city managers and commissioners. Some states allow you to file local or state referendums as a citizen, but most states do not. If you are in a state that does not, you need to get the city council or mayor to support your idea and bring it to a vote. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "File an initiative or referendum if you’re in a state where citizens can.",
      "content": "File an initiative or referendum if you’re in a state where citizens can. Check to see you your state is one of them. In these states, you can file your intention to have your law on the ballot, then gather signatures, and finally file the petition with the signatures with the law. Then it will be put on the ballot. In most states, it’s not quite this easy. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Go to community meetings if you can’t file a referendum.",
      "content": "Go to community meetings if you can’t file a referendum. This is a way for you to bring up your issue to local lawmakers. Check your city to see when there are meetings for constituents to bring up issues. You usually have a limited time to speak, so be prepared and be professional. You might have to go to many meetings before people begin to take you seriously, but this is an important step."

    {
      "title": "Research the mayor and council members.",
      "content": "Research the mayor and council members. Look at their websites. See what kinds of laws they have promoted in the past, and if yours might fit in. If you are going to change a local law, you need support from someone in the city government. If you don’t want to approach the mayor directly, choose the council member from your district or one you think will be sympathetic to your cause. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Meet with your chosen lawmaker. Tell them about your pattern of attending community meetings. Lay out your ideas for a law change. Bring copies of your proposed changes to share with the lawmaker. Ask their opinion on the feasibility of your goals. Listen to their suggestions. If they say that they need a petition with signatures from citizens showing support for your idea (probably at least 500 signatures), that’s your next step. Or they might like it just as it is and say that they will take it to the rest of the council. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Wait for the lawmakers to take action.",
      "content": "Wait for the lawmakers to take action. Once you have presented the law and anything else they have asked for (like a petition), you have to wait and see what happens. The city council might choose to vote on your idea soon, or it might have to wait behind other outstanding business."

      "title": "Try again.",
      "content": "Try again. If your law doesn’t go anywhere the first time, talk to more constituents, make allies, and do the process again. This time, think about getting the media involved, having meetings specifically about the issue, and put up signs to help raise consciousness about the idea. [6] X Research source"

You then collect 1,000+ signatures of registered state voters on the petition. Finally, you file the signatures along with the law. The attorney general reviews it all, writes the title of the measure, and it will be on the next state ballot. [7] X Research source"

Read articles from the newspaper (searchable easily online) to find out what kind of a lawmaker they have been and if you think they would be sympathetic to your idea. You will also want to know their political party and their record of voting -- these two items together can tell you a lot. You want to choose the one you think would be the better fit for your campaign -- approach him or her first. [9] X Research source"

Their email address is going to be on their website -- all state representatives would have this. Explain to them that you are a constituent interested in trying to change or pass a law. Send them an example of the text of the law you think you want to create. Ask to meet with them about the feasibility of this law. Even if you think one of your representatives would be a better choice, if your first choice doesn’t respond go to your second representative. [10] X Research source"

What do you do in his or her constituent community? Call for an appointment. Keep calling -- it will often take a long time before anything will be available for you. Persistence can pay off. Write a clear and concise email about your proposed law. Make it personal -- talk about why you want this so badly. Be sure to include your address and phone number so the legislator can choose the best way to contact you. Donate to the legislator’s campaign. Many legislators are more willing to make time for people who have donated money to them than other constituents. [12] X Research source"

[13] X Research source Show the legislator your proposed legislation. Be clear and professional. Make arguments that are not personal and would resonate with many of his or her constituents. Don’t take up too much of the legislator’s time. He or she is constantly being asked for things and often he has no idea about what the issue is about. Bring information to leave for him and an extra copy for a staffer."

      "content": "See the issue from the legislator's perspective. Sometimes his or her goals are different from your own. Even though you are a constituent, you and your representative might be on opposite ends of the ideological spectrum. When lobbying your legislator to change the law, you have to see how it matches the legislator's goals, values and constituents. If he or she ran on a platform of support for the Second Amendment, gun control is probably not an issue that they are willing to pursue. It is always good after you have had the meeting to send a thank you letter and a reminder of what you talked about. [14] X Research source Write a short note with your name and address clearly stated. Tell the legislator that “it was wonderful to meet you and discuss X.” Remind them nicely that you will continue to contact them about the issue"
