Lines are open Monday through Friday from 8:00 am to 7:00 p.m. and Saturday from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. This number is free to call from all UK landlines and mobiles. [4] X Research source You do not have to give any reason why you wish to cancel. You simply have to give a clear statement that you wish to cancel and provide information about yourself and your subscription. You can use the model form, available at https://www.experian.co.uk/consumer/product-factsheets/CreditExpertBRSOctober2017.pdf , so you know what information you'll need to provide. You can also print this form, fill it out, and mail it to Experian Limited, Lambert House, PO Box 7710, NG80 7WE."

They will likely try to convince you that you want to keep the service. Do not give them reasons or chit-chat with them. Simply tell them that you want to cancel your subscription. If they try to misdirect you or refuse, repeat that you want to cancel your membership. If you continue to have difficulty, ask to speak to their supervisor. After they've canceled your membership, ask for confirmation of the cancellation in writing. You may also want to contact the credit card that you were using to pay for the subscription and let them know that you've canceled the subscription and further charges are not authorized."
