      "content": "Dial 1-714-830-7000 to call the Experian corporate office. Experian doesn’t technically have a customer support department, and the number listed on their website for customer service is simply an automated system for victim assistance. If you want to speak with a person, you can get personal assistance by dialing the Experian corporate office and getting redirected after their automated system can’t find your information. The automated system will fail to find your information even when you enter it correctly, so don’t hang up or get frustrated if the menu prompts fail to identify you. This number will help you reach someone to assist you with your questions or concerns, but it is advertised on their corporate website as their office number. The corporate office is available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST."
