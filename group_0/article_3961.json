      "title": "Traditional Bicep Curl",
      "content": "Traditional Bicep Curl To do a basic bicep curl , stand with your feet hip-width apart with your knees slightly bent and your back straight. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with arms by your sides and your palms facing outward (an underhand grip). Bend your elbows and bring the dumbbells up toward your chest. Pause at the top of the move, then slowly lower your arms back down. [1] X Research source Do 3 sets of 8–10 reps. Increase the weight or add another set to increase the difficulty. Form tip: Don’t push your upper arms back as you curl the weights upward. Part of the bicep it targets: Short head"

    {
      "title": "Alternating Bicep Curl",
      "content": "Alternating Bicep Curl Use the exact same form as you would for a traditional bicep curl. But instead of curling both arms at the same time, curl one arm, then the other. [2] X Research source Do 3 sets of 8–10 reps. Benefit: If you’re a beginner, this can be a good way to slow down and really feel the isolation of that bicep muscle because you’re only working one arm at a time. Part of the bicep it targets: Short head"

    {
      "title": "Concentration Curl",
      "content": "Concentration Curl For a concentration curl , start in a seated position with your feet planted firmly on the floor and your knees at a 90° angle. Hold a weight in one hand and brace your elbow on your inner thigh for support. Bend your elbow and curl the weight in toward your shoulder, pressing your arm down into your leg as you lift the weight. Pause at the top of the curl, then lower the weight back down. [3] X Research source Do 3–4 sets of 12–20 reps each. If that’s too easy, personal trainer Landis Owens recommends doing up to “20 reps in each set. You might get to the third set before you actually start feeling the activation of the bicep.” Form tip: Perform this move with slow, controlled movements—don’t use momentum to swing the weight. [4] X Research source Benefits: Concentration curls are a great way to isolate the bicep—keeping your elbow on your thigh means your bicep has to do all the lifting without momentum or help from other parts of your body. Part of the bicep it targets: Short head"

    {
      "title": "Preacher Curl",
      "content": "Preacher Curl To do a preacher curl , sit at a preacher bench with your upper arms fully extended but resting on the pad. Hold a weight with your palms facing upward, then slowly curl the weight up to your shoulders. Squeeze your biceps at the top of the move, then slowly lower your arm back until your arm is extended again. [5] X Research source Do 4 sets of 8–10 reps each. Increase your set to 10–12 reps if that feels too easy. Form tip: Keep your wrists straight throughout the curl. It may help to use a lighter weight while you get used to the exercise. If you don’t have a preacher bench: Rest your arm against the back rest of an incline bench. [6] X Research source Benefits: Because your upper arm is supported, preacher curls allow you to curl slowly, so you can increase the time your bicep spends under tension—making the workout more effective in less time. Part of the bicep it targets: Short head"

      "title": "Spider Curl",
      "content": "Spider Curl For spider curls , set an incline bench to 45° and lie down on it face-first. Hold a weight in each hand with your palms facing outward in an underhand grip. Flex your elbows to lift the weights all the way up to your shoulders, then lower them with control. [7] X Research source Do 3 sets of 10–12 reps each. But because you won’t have much leverage, it can help to use a lighter weight for spider curls. Benefits: Resting on an incline bench in this way means you won’t be able to use momentum to lift the weights, so it’s very effective at isolating your biceps. Part of the bicep it targets: Short head"

      "title": "Incline Dumbbell Curl",
      "content": "Incline Dumbbell Curl Sit on an incline bench that’s set to 45–60°. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing forward with your arms hanging down toward the floor. Without moving your upper arms, curl the dumbbells up to your shoulders, then slowly lower them back down to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 10–12 reps each. Form tip: Try to avoid moving your elbows during the curl. Benefit: The incline dumbbell curl is one of the most effective ways to target the long head of your bicep. It also improves the range of motion for the exercise because you can move your arms behind you, which can be difficult to do from a standing position. Part of the bicep it targets: Long head"

      "title": "Hammer Curl",
      "content": "Hammer Curl Start in a standing position with your feet hip-width apart. Hold a weight in each hand with your palms facing together in a neutral grip. Curl the dumbbells up toward your shoulder, keeping your palms toward each other through the entire curl. Pause at the top of the curl, then lower your arms to the starting point. [8] X Research source Do 3 sets of about 12 reps each . Once that feels easy, increase the weight or add another set. Benefits: Hammer curls work the long head of your bicep, plus your brachialis and brachioradialis—so they’re good for your biceps and your forearms. They’re also easier on your wrists than some bicep curls. Form tips: Keep your elbows close to your sides for this curl. Make it harder: For more of a challenge, alternate curling one arm, then the other. Or, increase the amount of time you pause at the top of the curl so your bicep spends more time under tension.

But instead of dumbbells, use a barbell or an EZ bar . [10] X Research source Do 3 sets of 6–12 reps. Choose a weight that’s just challenging enough but doesn’t cause you to lose your form. Form tips: Don’t move your upper body or use momentum to swing the barbell. If you’re curling with a barbell, use a wider grip to target the short head of your bicep and a narrower grip to target the long head. Part of the bicep it targets: Both heads"

      "title": "Cheating Barbell Curl",
      "content": "Cheating Barbell Curl A cheating barbell curl uses the same form as a regular barbell form, but in this variation, you use a heavier weight. Keep your knees slightly bent and push your hips backward as you hold the barbell with an underhand grip. Then, thrust your hips forward to give you a little momentum to bring the barbell up to your chest. Use a controlled motion to lower the barbell back to the starting position. [11] X Research source Do 3 sets of 6–12 reps. Form tip: Keep your core tight, elbows close to your sides, and wrists fixed throughout the curl. Benefits: Because you’re using a heavier weight, this curl gives your biceps and forearms a great workout—and it also works out the back and shoulders. Part of the bicep it targets: Both heads"

Bring the weights one-third of the way up to your shoulders 7 times, then bring it two-thirds of the way up to your shoulders for another 7 repetitions. Finally, bring the weight all the way up to your shoulders through the full range of motion for the last 7 repetitions, for a total of 21 reps.” Repeat the 21 repetitions for a total of 3–4 sets. Benefits: Morris says, “21s are a way to manipulate repetition so you’re really burning the bicep at both heads.” 21s are sometimes also called 7-7-7s. Part of the bicep it targets: Both heads"

I recommend either single arm curls or turning your arm laterally so your palm comes up to the side of your shoulder.” Do 2–3 sets of 10 reps each. Benefits: Resistance bands provide constant tension throughout the entire curl, giving your bicep a more complete workout. [14] X Research source Part of the bicep it targets: Both heads"

Start with your arms fully extended, then slowly curl the bar in toward your chest. Pause and contract your bicep at the top of the curl, then straighten your arms again. [15] X Research source Do 3–4 sets of 10 reps each. Form tip: Bend your knees slightly, and use a weight that you can lift comfortably without jerking on the bar. Benefit: Cable curls are excellent for getting a consistent amount of tension through the whole range of motion. You can also target different parts of the bicep by using different pulley attachments with the cable machine. Part of the bicep it targets: Both heads"

Form tip: Wrap your thumbs around the bar to secure your grip.

Repeat with the other dumbbell. [18] X Research source Do 3 sets of 8–10 reps. Note that one rep consists of both arms. Form tip: Don’t touch the dumbbell to your shoulder or rest it against your side—your biceps should support the whole weight of the dumbbells through the whole move.

      "content": "Zottman Curl The first part of a Zottman curl is the same as it is for a traditional bicep curl—hold the weights with your palms facing out, then curl them up to your shoulders. But once you reach the top of the curl, rotate your wrists to an overhand grip, with your palms facing toward you. Lower the weights with this grip, then rotate to an underhand grip before beginning the next rep. [19] X Research source Benefits: Zottman curls are especially effective at building bigger forearms, and rotating your grip allows you to effectively work your biceps and forearm muscles in the same curl.

[20] X Research source Benefits: This is a great way to end a workout because it really takes your muscles all the way to fatigue. [21] X Research source Use regular bicep curls for this, or switch it up with another variation if you want."

      "title": "Using different types of curls will balance your bicep development.",
      "content": "Using different types of curls will balance your bicep development. The bicep has two heads—a long head that runs along the outside of your arm and a short head on the inside of your arm. Traditional bicep curls primarily target the short bicep head, but varying the curl can allow you to target both of these heads for more even muscle growth. [22] X Research source Working the short head of your bicep will add width, and working the long head of your bicep will add height. [23] X Research source Bicep curls also work the brachialis —the muscle that runs under the bicep— and the brachioradialis —your forearm muscles. By mixing up your bicep curls, you’ll be able to target these muscles, as well as the smaller stabilizing muscles in your arm. Adding in bicep curl variations will also help challenge you during a workout, which could help prevent you from plateauing."
