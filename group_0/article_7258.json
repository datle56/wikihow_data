      "title": "Feel the paper and assess its texture.",
      "content": "Feel the paper and assess its texture. U.S. currency is printed on special paper made of 25% linen and 75% cotton, which gives it a very distinct texture (and also makes it more durable). [1] X Research source A real $1 bill should feel crisp and slightly rough to the touch. If it feels smooth or glossy like regular printer paper, it may be a counterfeit. Evaluate the thinness of the paper, too. Legitimate bills will generally be thinner than regular paper because of the printing process. You can compare a dollar bill to a regular piece of paper to see if it is thinner or not."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check for raised ink.",
      "content": "Check for raised ink. Run your finger over the bill to feel the ink. Real U.S. bills are made using a process called Intaglio printing, which causes the ink to have a slightly raised texture. [2] X Research source If the ink on your bill feels entirely flat to the touch, this could be a sign that it’s a fake. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for blurry images, borders, or text.",
      "content": "Look for blurry images, borders, or text. Genuine U.S. bills feature very detailed fine-line engraving and micro-printing. [4] X Research source This means that all the designs and text should be incredibly neat and sharp. If you notice any ink bleeding, blurriness, or errors in the images or writing on the bill, these could definitely be signs that it’s a counterfeit. [5] X Research source Low-quality counterfeits often don't get all of the details right. Comparing the bill in question to a known good one dollar bill might help you spot anything off."

    {
      "title": "Look for the Treasury seal.",
      "content": "Look for the Treasury seal. Real one dollar bills will have a green treasury seal to the right of the portrait under the text, \"ONE\". The treasury seal should be clear and sharp. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Check for the Federal Reserve Bank seal.",
      "content": "Check for the Federal Reserve Bank seal. This seal is black and should be positioned to the left of the portrait. The letter inside of it corresponds to the Federal Reserve Bank that distributed the bill. Like the treasury seal, it should be clear and sharp. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Compare the serial numbers.",
      "content": "Compare the serial numbers. If you have multiple suspicious one dollar bills, compare the serial numbers on them. Serial numbers are never repeated, so if you have multiple bills with the same serial number, they're all fake. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for the tiny red and blue fibers.",
      "content": "Look for the tiny red and blue fibers. Real dollar bills have very small red and blue threads embedded in the paper. You have to look very closely to see them, and they are difficult for counterfeiters to copy. [9] X Research source If your bill doesn’t have these fibers distributed randomly throughout the paper, it’s likely fake. If you look at legitimate bills with a magnifying glass, you'll see that the fibers appear to be slightly raised. However, when counterfeiters try to replicate the fibers, they'll usually be flat on the paper. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Check the portrait on the front of the bill and the vignette on the back.",
      "content": "Check the portrait on the front of the bill and the vignette on the back. The $1 bill features a portrait of George Washington on the front and the Great Seal on the back, and this design hasn’t changed since it was first issued. [11] X Research source If the designs on your bill differ from these at all, this indicates that it’s a counterfeit."

    {
      "title": "Check for security features that should only be present on larger bills.",
      "content": "Check for security features that should only be present on larger bills. Higher value bills often have security features like a security thread, color-changing ink, and watermarks to help distinguish them from counterfeits. These features are not present on real $1 bills, so if you see any of them, your bill is likely fake. [12] X Research source Watermarks only appear on U.S. bills worth $5 or more. Color changing ink is only used on bills worth $10 or more. Vertical security threads are only present on bills worth $5 or more. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a counterfeit detection pen. Counterfeit detection pens, while not foolproof, can still detect counterfeit bills in some cases. Directions for how to use a pen varies by manufacturer, but they will all come with instructions for how to use them."

    {
      "title": "Remember the customer.",
      "content": "Remember the customer. If possible, delay whoever gave you the counterfeit money, so that you can remember as much about that person’s appearance as possible. Take note of any accomplices or companions. Write down their license plate number if applicable. Remember that the person who gave you the counterfeit bill might not be the original counterfeiter. They might be an innocent person who thought the bill was real."

      "title": "Avoid handling the one dollar bill.",
      "content": "Avoid handling the one dollar bill. Carefully place it into a protective covering, such as an envelope or sandwich bag. This is so that the authorities will be able to gather as much information as possible from the bill. This will also help you know which bill is the counterfeit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give the bill to the authorities.",
      "content": "Give the bill to the authorities. Make sure to only give the bill to a police officer or U.S. Secret Service special agent. When asked, give them as much information as possible about the bill. Will banks exchange counterfeit bills? No, you will not be financially reimbursed for the counterfeit money, and banks will not exchange the fake bill for a real bill. [14] X Research source This is to prevent counterfeiters from receiving money for free if they claim they were given counterfeit money."
