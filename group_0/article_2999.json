      "title": "Opt for clothing that covers your body from the shoulders to the knees.",
      "content": "Opt for clothing that covers your body from the shoulders to the knees. When you’re dressing conservatively, it’s important not to show too much skin, especially your shoulders, cleavage, midriff, and upper legs. If the weather is hot, opt for loose, flowy clothing to help keep you cool, rather than skimpy clothing that will leave you exposed. [1] X Research source Short sleeves are usually fine when you’re dressing conservatively, but if you’re in doubt whether that’s appropriate, opt for an elbow-length or long-sleeved shirt to be on the safe side. In some places, skirts that stop just above the knee are considered conservative. However, in some cultures, showing your knees or even your ankles would still be considered revealing. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Add layers if you need a little more coverage.",
      "content": "Add layers if you need a little more coverage. If you’re concerned that your favorite clothes show too much skin, mix-and-match them with layering pieces to help you cover up. Layers are also good if your clothing is sheer or transparent. [3] X Research source For instance, you can wear a cami underneath a V-neck shirt to ensure you don’t show too much cleavage, and a long tank top is a great option if you think your shirt might ride up and expose your midriff. You can also layer a lightweight shirt, blouse, or scarf over a pretty spaghetti-strap dress to cover your shoulders and chest."

    {
      "title": "Avoid wearing clothes that fit very tightly.",
      "content": "Avoid wearing clothes that fit very tightly. Sometimes, you can show too much of your figure even when you’re completely covered up. If you want to dress conservatively, avoid styles that fit tightly around your bust, waist, or hips. However, you don’t necessarily have to wear shapeless, baggy clothes, either. Instead, stick to styles that skim lightly over your figure. Not only will this be more comfortable and modest, but it tends to be a more flattering look, as well. If you’re wearing leggings, yoga pants, or another style of pants that fit snugly to your body, opt for a long tunic or a blouse that covers your crotch and rear."

    {
      "title": "Wear mostly neutrals with a few pops of colors.",
      "content": "Wear mostly neutrals with a few pops of colors. Dressing conservatively typically means gravitating toward tasteful neutral shades like black, white, beige, tan, blue, gray, and ivory. However, if you love bright colors, you don't have to stop wearing them! Just wear one brightly-colored piece at a time, and keep the rest of your outfit toned down. [4] X Research source For instance, if you’re going to work, you might wear a grey blazer, slacks, and shoes, with a magenta blouse. On the other hand, you might opt for a white blouse and add color with a statement necklace, instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your accessories minimal.",
      "content": "Keep your accessories minimal. If you want to look conservative, don’t pile on all of your accessories at once. Instead, stick to 2 or 3 pretty pieces when you’re getting dressed, like a string of pearls, a simple ring, and a nice watch. It’s okay to use bold jewelry to add pizazz to your outfit, but stick to one statement piece at a time. If you’re wearing a chunky, colorful necklace, for instance, you might skip wearing earrings, or just wear a pair of subtle studs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stick to practical footwear.",
      "content": "Stick to practical footwear. For the most part, it’s prudent to avoid stiletto heels or flashy footwear that’s hard to walk in. Instead, opt for tasteful flats or low pumps, although ankle and knee-high boots can look conservative depending on how the rest of your outfit is styled. [5] X Research source For instance, knee-high boots would be the perfect way to complete a fall outfit if you were wearing a knee-length skirt, dark tights or leggings, and a sweater."

      "title": "Wear your hair well-groomed in a classic style.",
      "content": "Wear your hair well-groomed in a classic style. There’s no one perfect haircut that will make you look conservative, but avoid getting a severe cut, like a close-cropped style or a style that’s shaved on one side. However, styles like a sleek, straight bob, loose waves, a low bun, and long curls can all be well-suited for a conservative girl, as long as you keep your hair clean and neatly styled each day. [6] X Research source If you color your hair, opt for natural-looking shades, including highlights, rather than bold colors like green, pink, or purple."
    },
    {
      "title": "Opt for light, tasteful makeup if you wear any.",
      "content": "Opt for light, tasteful makeup if you wear any. You won’t look very conservative if you wear a full glam look in the daytime. Instead, stick to a simple routine, such as concealer, tinted moisturizer, mascara, blush, and lip gloss. [7] X Research source It’s okay to wear a little more makeup for special occasions. For instance, you might add eyeshadow, eyeliner, and lipstick to your normal makeup routine if you’re going on a date or attending a wedding."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cover up any tattoos if you have them.",
      "content": "Cover up any tattoos if you have them. Visible tattoos don’t look very conservative, so if you already have them, try to cover them with makeup or your clothing. If you don’t have any tattoos, or if the ones you have are easily covered, avoid getting anything new that would be hard to cover up, like tattoos on your hands, face, forearms, or chest. [8] X Research source For the most part, visible piercings wouldn't be considered conservative. However, a small, tasteful nose ring might be an exception, depending on your personal style."

      "title": "Go to bed early",
      "content": "Go to bed early and rise early each day. If you want to live a conservative lifestyle, it won’t do to stay up all night partying (or watching cat videos). In order to be at your most productive during the day, go to bed at a reasonable hour, and try to stick to the same bedtime each night. Then, wake at the same time every morning, even the weekends. [9] X Research source Keeping a regular routine will help you sleep better at night."

      "title": "Eat a healthy diet",
      "content": "Eat a healthy diet full of lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables. You can apply conservative living to everything, even to the way you eat, so try to avoid making a habit of binging on indulgent treats. About half of what you eat should be nutritious fruits and vegetables like leafy greens, avocados, apples, and legumes. Another quarter should be lean proteins like chicken, turkey, tofu, and fish, and the final quarter should be whole grains, like wheat bread, quinoa, and brown rice.

      "title": "Avoid drinking alcohol excessively, if at all.",
      "content": "Avoid drinking alcohol excessively, if at all. Drinking too much alcohol can be bad for your health, but it can also lead to reckless behavior and a lapse in judgment. If you want to maintain a conservative lifestyle, it’s important to avoid this loss of control. If you do want to enjoy any alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation. [11] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source For instance, if you have a glass of wine with dinner, ask for a glass of water after you finish it. If you’d still like another glass when you finish the water, then it’s fine."

      "title": "Take dating slowly.",
      "content": "Take dating slowly. To be conservative in your romantic life, take your time before committing to a relationship with another person. Make sure that you only date someone because you really like them and can imagine yourself being with them in the long term. Also, avoid rushing into a physical relationship with anyone to avoid the appearance of being promiscuous. If you’re already in a relationship, take some time to evaluate whether the two of you have the same long-term goals and values."

      "title": "Consume thoughtful media that promotes family values.",
      "content": "Consume thoughtful media that promotes family values. These days, it can be hard to avoid depictions of sex and violence in TV and movies, and social media can be full of a steady stream of content that’s opposed to a conservative lifestyle. Try to tailor what you’re watching and consuming so you’re only taking in wholesome entertainment, as much as possible. [12] X Research source . For instance, you might unfollow anyone on your friend list who regularly posts memes that you find offensive. You might also avoid watching movies that are rated R, especially if they got that rating because they’re bloody, have foul language, or are filled with nudity."

    {
      "title": "Be prudent with your finances.",
      "content": "Be prudent with your finances. Being financially conservative is smart for everyone, but it can be hard to do. Make a budget and stick to it. Each time you get a paycheck, pay your bills before you make any purchases, so you’ll know exactly what you have left over. Then, set aside a little of what’s left in a savings account so you’ll be prepared in case of an unforeseen emergency. [13] X Research source Also, try to get in the habit of limiting any unnecessary purchases."
    },
    {
      "title": "Understand that you don't have to support every conservative cause.",
      "content": "Understand that you don't have to support every conservative cause. You can consider yourself politically conservative without necessarily agreeing with everything that would be considered conservative. There’s no one right way to be a conservative, so take some time to learn about different issues, and evaluate your beliefs to determine which ones you support, as well as which ones you don’t. For instance, social conservatives typically believe that abortion should be restricted or banned, and that gay marriage should not be legal. However, you can be politically conservative—which means you believe in things like less government interference and a free market economy—without necessarily being a social conservative."
    },
    {
      "title": "Champion causes that promote individual liberty.",
      "content": "Champion causes that promote individual liberty. Political conservatives believe that your individual freedoms are the most important thing that needs to be protected. That means you would oppose any laws that allow the government or other people to infringe on your freedom. [14] X Research source For instance, most political conservatives oppose strict gun control laws that might impede the 2nd Amendment right to bear arms."
    },
    {
      "title": "Support initiatives that limit the government's role.",
      "content": "Support initiatives that limit the government's role. One of the most universal beliefs among conservatives is that a smaller government is more efficient and effective. This might mean limiting laws that regulate environmental policies, for instance, or supporting privatized healthcare."
    },
    {
      "title": "Study and support the free market system.",
      "content": "Study and support the free market system. If you’re an economic conservative, you believe that a free market promotes competition. You likely also believe that such competition leads to a healthier economy, with more jobs overall, as well as a higher standard of living for society as a whole. This would also involve being against social programs that inhibit a free market, like universal healthcare."
    },
    {
      "title": "Emphasize personal responsibility over social support or government regulation.",
      "content": "Emphasize personal responsibility over social support or government regulation. In addition to having individual liberty, as a conservative, you will also likely believe that each person should be responsible for their own actions. This might mean holding people accountable for things they’ve done wrong, but it also might mean being opposed to certain social programs. For instance, you might support the death penalty for certain crimes, but you might be against programs that allow people to stay on welfare for long periods of time. You might also oppose amnesty for immigrants who came into the country illegally, even if you support immigration reform that would allow people an easier path to become citizens of your country."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place a high priority on traditional values.",
      "content": "Place a high priority on traditional values. Typically, conservatives see themselves as being responsible for holding up traditional morals and conventions. For instance, you might be opposed to abortion or gay marriage, or you might support legislation limiting the kind of content that can be shown on websites that cater to young children. [15] X Research source You might also oppose any interpretations of the Constitution that you don’t feel accurately represent the Founding Fathers’ original intent."
