The player chooses 1 card from their hand to play face-up on the table and adds the value of the card to the total count. At the beginning of a round, the count starts at 0. However, some cards have special effects or count as a different value than what’s printed on them. The card values and effects are: [4] X Research source Ace: 1 or 11 (the player gets to choose one or the other) 2: 2 3: 3 4: 0, and the player turn order reverses 5: 5 6: 6 7: 7 8: 8 9: 0 10: 10 or -10 (the player chooses one or the other) Jack: 10 Queen: 10 King: the total immediately jumps to 99 (or stays at 99 if it’s already there)"

A player places a 10 down from their hand and chooses to subtract 10 from the total count. They say, “89” out loud and draw a new card."

When a player plays a card that makes the total count go above 99, then the round immediately ends. [5] X Research source Strategy Tip : Try to save 4s, 9s, 10s, and kings in your hand, especially if the count is close to 99. These cards either keep the total the same or reduce the total so you’re less likely to go over. Strategy Tip : Try to raise the total to 99 early on in the round to catch other players off guard and force them to lose a round. If the draw pile runs out of cards, shuffle the discard pile to make a new draw pile. The total count remains the same."
