      "content": "Heat 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of butter or cooking oil in a nonstick skillet. Swirl the butter or oil to coat the entire surface of the skillet evenly. Once it begins to sizzle slightly, it will be hot enough to add the Canadian bacon. [1] X Research source If you’re looking to cut calories, choose a lighter oil like olive or canola."

      "title": "Place the bacon slices flat against the skillet in a single layer.",
      "content": "Place the bacon slices flat against the skillet in a single layer. Lower each slice carefully to avoid being splattered by piping hot butter or oil. Once they’re nestled at the bottom of the skillet, press them lightly with the back of a fork or spatula to make sure they’re resting directly against the cooking surface. [2] X Research source Use a pair of tongs to place the bacon slices in the skillet if you’re worried about getting burned. You should be able to fit 2-3 slices of Canadian bacon in a standard 12 inches (30 cm) pan, depending on how large they are. Most types of Canadian bacon are about as big around as a silver dollar.

      "title": "Fry the bacon for 1-2 minutes.",
      "content": "Fry the bacon for 1-2 minutes. Exact cooking times will vary based on how thick the bacon is cut. In most cases, it will only take a minute or 2 to sear the first side to a crisp brown finish. Particularly thick slices may require the full 2 minutes in order to get the right color. [4] X Research source You can also leave the slices in the skillet for a little longer if you like your Canadian bacon a little extra dark or crisp."

    {
      "title": "Turn the bacon and continue cooking until lightly brown.",
      "content": "Turn the bacon and continue cooking until lightly brown. Use a fork, spatula, or tongs to gently flip each slice. They’ll need another 30 seconds to a minute on the second side, although it may not take them quite as long to finish frying since they’ve already been partially cooked. [5] X Research source Watch out for pops and splatters as you’re turning the slices. Thinly-sliced cuts of meat like Canadian bacon sometimes have a tendency to curl when cooked with intense heat. You can prevent this by using a bacon press, or by dipping each slice in cold water before you throw it in the skillet."

      "title": "Allow the bacon to rest for 1-2 minutes before serving.",
      "content": "Allow the bacon to rest for 1-2 minutes before serving. Transfer the slices to a clean plate or layer of paper towels to let them cool. After a couple minutes, they’ll have reached a safe temperature for eating. Dig in! Pair your Canadian bacon with other breakfast staples like eggs, grits, gravy, and tomato slices. Place your leftovers in an airtight storage container and put them in the refrigerator. When properly stored, the cooked bacon will keep for 3-4 days."

      "title": "Lay out your bacon slices on a microwave-safe dish.",
      "content": "Lay out your bacon slices on a microwave-safe dish. Ideally, you should select a dish that’s roomy enough to hold all of the bacon you plan on cooking at once. Be sure to leave 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) between each slice so they'll cook faster and more evenly. They'll take longer to heat up if they're overlapping. [6] X Research source While not a necessity (Canadian bacon is much leaner than regular bacon), a ridged bacon rack can come in handy for collecting the fat that drips out of the slices as they heat up. [7] X Research source If you’re preparing a large amount of Canadian bacon, you may need to do it in batches."

      "title": "Cover the bacon with a layer of paper towels.",
      "content": "Cover the bacon with a layer of paper towels. Use as many sheets as it takes to cover the slices entirely. They’ll help absorb excess grease and prevent splattering fat from making a mess of the inside of your microwave.

Go to source If the dish you’re using is on the smaller side, try stacking the bacon slices and paper towels in alternating layers."

      "title": "Microwave the bacon on 50% power for 30-60 seconds.",
      "content": "Microwave the bacon on 50% power for 30-60 seconds. Canadian bacon already comes par-cooked, which means you’ll just need to put it in long enough to warm it up. For 1-3 slices, set the cook timer to 30-35 seconds. For 3-6 slices, bump it up to 45-60 seconds to make sure it gets heated evenly. If you’re making more than 6 slices of Canadian bacon at once, increase the cook time by about 10-15 seconds per slice. Perform a quick touch test after the first couple minutes to see if the bacon is ready to eat. If it still feels slightly cool in the center, it may need an additional 10-20 seconds."

      "title": "Let the slices cool for about a minute before serving.",
      "content": "Let the slices cool for about a minute before serving. Since the microwave affords you more control over the temperature, you shouldn’t have to wait long. While your bacon is cooling, you can finish getting the rest of your meal together. Stash any uneaten portions of bacon in the refrigerator in an airtight container and try to consume them within 3-4 days.

      "content": "Arrange your bacon slices on a baking sheet in a single layer. Leave at least 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of space between each slice to promote even cooking. Depending on the size of the baking sheet you’re using, you may be able to prepare a dozen or more slices per batch. There’s no need to grease your baking sheet, as there’s enough fat in Canadian bacon to keep it from sticking. If you like, you can brush your bacon slices with maple syrup or sprinkle them with brown sugar just before they go in the oven to create a sweet-and-savory flavor."

If you’re broiling your Canadian bacon, place the baking sheet on the top rack instead. Set a timer to help you keep track of how long the slices have been cooking. [10] X Research source Add an extra 2-3 minutes to your total cook time if you prefer your Canadian bacon a little more done. If you're broiling your bacon slices, they'll only need 3-4 minutes on each side. Don't forget to flip them halfway through, as the broiler will only heat them on one side."
