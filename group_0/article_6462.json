      "content": "Chaldean Numerology uses math and astrology to discover people’s true selves. Chaldean Numerology originates from the Chaldean people who ruled Babylonia from 625 to 539 BCE. The ancient Chaldean people believed numbers, letters, and birth dates had vibrations that let out frequencies, which were then linked to the sun, moon, and planets. These connections help us better understand our life goals, personalities, desires, and purpose. Traditional Chaldean numerologists believed life was predestined, so you should use your legal birth name. However, recent schools of thought believe in using your preferred or commonly known name because that is reflective of your true self. [1] X Research source The Chaldean numerological alphabet system uses only 1 through 8 for their calculations. The number 9 is considered sacred. You'll only see 9 used if your name equals it."

In some cases, your single and compound numbers are compatible; in others, they’re not. Single and compound numbers are calculated by adding up each letter of your name. However, your compound number is the total sum of your name and your single number. Each of these numbers represents specific characteristics and how they relate to each other."
