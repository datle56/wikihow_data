      "content": "Gather the tools you need. You need compressed air and a screwdriver (only needed if you must use a screwdriver to open the computer case). A small vacuum might clean up the mess you make around the computer, but it should never be used inside it. If you're sensitive to dust or can't clean in a well-ventilated area, a dust mask is also a good idea. If you are concerned about electrostatic damage, purchase an anti-static wrist strap ."

      "content": "Open your computer case. Most machines have screws holding a side panel down. After removing these, you can then slip the side off your machine. This can vary depending on what case you are using. If you have a manual that came with the computer/case, reference it for the most accurate instructions on how to remove the side panel ."

      "title": "Begin dusting.",
      "content": "Begin dusting. Use your compressed air to blow out dust from the inside of your machine. It is usually a good idea to start on the upper region of the computer and then work your way down. In this manner, you can sweep out all the dust that settles on lower components in one run. Be thorough, but do not press on cords or components. Also, keep your air source at a moderate distance from the component you're working on. Make sure to hold your can of compressed air upright. If inverted, it can spray the liquid coolant inside, which can cause damage or injury. Do not allow the air to rotate the fans of your computer, as this might create a charge that could short out your components—or it could even break off a blade. Hold the fans when dusting them off to keep them from spinning."

      "title": "Make sure the heatsink and GPU fans are clean.",
      "content": "Make sure the heatsink and GPU fans are clean. The heat sink sits over the processor, and it is a collection of metal ridges that stick up away from the motherboard. The GPU fan is located under the GPU. If these fans do not function properly, the processor or GPU could overheat, resulting in degraded performance or permanent damage. Make sure to gently clean these fans out, and never turn your can of compressed air upside down. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Close your computer. After you've finished dusting, replace the side of your machine and any screws. Once the machine is tightly shut, return it to its usual spot and reattach the power cord and other cables. If you flipped the master power switch on the back of your machine off, be sure to turn it on again, or your machine will not start. A clean computer will run significantly cooler and last much longer than a computer clogged up with dust and debris."

      "content": "Use a microfiber cloth to clean the outside of your case. You can get the cloth slightly damp to wipe down any dust. If there are stubborn fingerprints or other greasy spots, use a little isopropyl alcohol to clean them off. If any alcohol gets inside your computer, allow it to dry fully before plugging it back in and turning it on. Use compressed air to clean out any of the fan vents or grills. If these are very dusty, you might want to clean them out before you clean the inside of your case, since all the dust will fall into the case. Learn more about cleaning a computer case ."

Use compressed air to dislodge any dust, crumbs, or debris from between the keys. You can also use a microfiber cloth to remove residue from the keys. If your keyboard is sticky or grimy, use a cotton swab dipped in isopropyl alcohol to clean it off. Make sure the swab is not dripping wet. Allow the keyboard to dry fully before using it again.

To clean it off, unplug it (or power it down, if it's a wireless mouse) and use a slightly damp microfiber cloth on the entirety of your mouse. Allow the mouse to dry before using it again. If there's any gunk stuck in the crevices around your mouse's buttons, use a toothpick to pry it out and compressed air to blow it away. Use a dry cotton swab to clean your mouse sensor, especially if you've noticed issues with your mouse tracking. Get some more mouse-cleaning tips from this wikiHow article ."

If there are stubborn marks or spots on the screen, you can use a little water—but never spray water or cleaner directly on the screen. Dampen your cloth, then buff out any marks using circular motions. Don't forget to clean the back of your monitor. It can get very dusty since it's out of sight and out of mind!

      "content": "How do I clean my computer without compressed air? If you don't have compressed air, get a small, soft, clean brush (like a paintbrush) and use that to dislodge the dust from the components. Allow the dust to settle at the bottom of the case. You can then use a slightly dampened paper towel to pick up the dust. Do not wipe the damp paper towel over any of the components, and allow your computer to dry before plugging it in and turning it on."

      "content": "Can I clean my computer outside? Since cleaning out a very dusty computer case can get messy, it's tempting to clean it outside. As long as the weather is nice, temperatures aren't extreme, and you have a clean, stable workspace (with no metal flooring or tables), you should be okay to clean your computer outside. Avoid taking your computer outside if it's raining, snowing, storming, windy, very hot, or very cold. Also, make sure no debris (such as grass or leaves) gets inside your computer."

Make sure your computer is off and unplugged when you do this, and only use a small amount of isopropyl alcohol—never let the alcohol flood or drip onto your components. Allow the computer to dry thoroughly before plugging it back in. If your computer is super dirty, you might want to take it to a computer professional for help."

      "content": "Can I clean the inside of my laptop? Yes, you can clean the inside of your laptop , but be careful if you do so. Laptops usually aren't made to be opened up, so try to clean the fans from the outside. If you choose to open it, open it very carefully, as it's easy to break parts inside the case by forcing the casing off. If your laptop is dusty, you might want to bring it to a computer shop for help."

      "content": "Should I open any computer parts to clean inside of them? No, you should never try to pry open any components inside your computer. This will likely damage them if you don't know what you're doing, and could hurt you—for example, trying to open the power supply unit (PSU) of your computer could cause injury and even death due to electric shock.
