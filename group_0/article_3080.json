      "content": "Be specific with the dates of arrival and departure. Don't keep your visit open-ended. Also, don't book an airline reservation before you first discuss it with your host. If your host has agreed to certain dates, don't try to add on to those dates without discussing it, and respect that your host may have to discuss your stay with their spouse or housemate. Avoid overstaying your visit. Even though you have been graciously invited into their home, your hosts may have rearranged their normal routines on your behalf. Their hospitality also requires their investment of time, energy, and money. If you are staying for a period longer than three days, consider putting the arrangement on a business footing, or finding ways to leave and stay elsewhere for a few days to give your hosts some private time.

Your host may not be ready for you and an early arrival could inconvenience them considerably. If, for some unforeseen reason, you caught an earlier connection or you had an extra day's vacation and want to arrive earlier, call them first. Avoid showing up later than you promised. This may upset many hosts who worry about what might have happened to you. If you are delayed for any reason, call them and explain."

      "content": "Be flexible with your time. The living space designed to accommodate you on a short-term, temporary basis is the full-time home of your host.

Don't leave a dripping faucet, and turn off the light when you're finished. Don't rummage around in their cupboards looking for a toothbrush or other essentials; instead, ask your host if they have any spares."

Remember that your hosts have probably already been shopping for extra groceries and spent a considerable amount of time and money to get ready for your visit.
