During this time, add a warm basin of water to your snake's cage. You can help your snake shed by placing a basin of warm water inside its enclosure. Your snake will be able to bath in the water, allowing its skin to come off more easily. [1] X Research source Pick a basin that is big enough to hold your snake's entire body. Add enough water that your snake can get its entire body wet. However, do not add so much water that your snake will be submerged under water when it enters the basin."

      "content": "Add coarse materials to the snake's container. Snakes can also rub skin off by crawling over coarse material. Uneven materials, like tree branches and stones, can be very helpful to shedding snakes. You can also use patches of tree bark, pine cones, and other coarse materials you find outside. [2] X Research source If your snake is rubbing its nose against objects in the cage, it is trying to get its skin off during the shedding process. If you notice your snake doing this, it is particularly important that you add coarse materials to your snake's cage."

      "title": "Manage the cage's humidity.",
      "content": "Manage the cage's humidity. Monitor the humidity in your snake's environment. You can get a device at a pet store, or a department store, that measures humidity in your snake's cage. During the shedding process, snakes need a cage that is between 50 and 70% humidity. If the humidity in your snake's cage is below this level, there are several steps you can take to improve humidity. [4] X Research source Add a large water dish to the cage. Cover the top of the cage. If you have a screen top on the cage, you can safely cover half the top to increase humidity. Try using orchid bark substrate, which refers to the bedding that lines the bottom of the cage. Orchid bark tends to hold more humidity than other products."

      "content": "See a vet in the event of an incomplete shedding. Despite your best efforts, your snake may not shed completely. If your snake does not finish shedding within one to two weeks, see a vet. A veterinarian can help remove the remaining skin and examine your snake. Usually, shedding problems are caused by a lack of humidity, but you'll want an exam to rule out any possible underlying health problems. Never try to peel off excess skin yourself, especially not skin around a snake's eyes or mouth."

      "content": "Foster a stress free environment. Stress is a possible cause for improper shedding. If your snake did not shed correctly, work on improving your snake's stress level. Make sure the snake has a quality environment, and limit handling your snake. [5] X Research source Keep the humidity level comfortable. You should also make sure your snake has a lot of hiding places in its cage. Snakes are solitary pets, and crave alone time. Keep boxes and enclosures in your snake's cage so it can get alone time. Do not handle your snake too frequently. Snakes may dislike being handled and, if handled too much, a snake may learn to think of you as a predator. Do not handle your snake for more than 30 minutes at a time, and only do so a few times per week."
