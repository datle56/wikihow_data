      "content": "Do the 30 circle test. You can do this test during dull moments at work. It helps you push yourself to think quickly and creatively. To start, draw 30 circles. From there, make as many circles into drawings as possible in one minute. You can do the test over and over again, trying to break your record each time.

Many people have a tendency to self-edit and pause to wonder if something is a good idea. The 30 Circle Test forces you to think fast, forcing you to experiment with ideas without rejecting them.

For instance, play word association games by writing down one word and then any words that connect to it. Use analogy to find similarities between two seemingly dissimilar things to break down and examine your associations with each. For instance, look for similarities between a textbook and an iPod. If you feel stuck, try some word association games or search for synonyms online. A similar idea is a game sometimes called \"Word Melt\", in which you change words into other words, by changing one letter at a time. For example — WORD → WARD → WART → WALT → MALT → MELT"
