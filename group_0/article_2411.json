      "content": "Rinse your ripe gem squash under cool water and dry it with a paper towel. Wash the gem squash under cool water. Use your hand or a gentle produce scrub brush to remove any dirt or grime from the skin of the squash. Then, dry the squash with a paper towel or a clean hand towel. [1] X Research source Make sure the exterior of the squash is completely dry before attempting to cut it, as the water will make the squash slick and hard to handle. Your gem squash is ripe if the skin is dull, dark green color, and if the skin cannot be easily chipped away with your fingernail. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Place the squash on a cutting board and use a heavy knife to slice it in half. Hold the squash still with one hand to keep it from rolling on the cutting board. Then, carefully, place your knife center of the squash and press down firmly. Keep your cut center to the squash to create 2 equal halves; otherwise, the pieces might cook differently. [3] X Research source Refrain from slicing away the skin on the gem squash if you are stuffing the halves and baking them. The skin will hold the baked squash and stuffing together."

But if you enjoy eating the squash plain, then leave the squash halves as is and don’t stuff them. Create a creamy corn filling to bake inside the squash. Sauté 1 ⁄ 4 US tbsp (3.7 mL) of olive oil, 1 clove of chopped or grated garlic, 2 thinly sliced spring onions, 1/2 cup (90 g) of fresh or frozen corn, 1/2 tsp (2.5 g) of ground black pepper, 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of ketchup, and 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of cream.
