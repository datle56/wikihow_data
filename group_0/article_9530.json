A zip wall is a specially made plastic sheet that zips open and closed. Hang the zip wall over the doorway that will act as the entrance and exit. This way, you can zip the door open and closed as you come and go, preventing dust from entering the rest of the house. [3] X Research source You should also place sticky mats by the doorway so the dust on your shoes can be contained on the mats and does not get in the rest of the house."

      "content": "Depressurize the area with a fan. Place a small fan near a window at the far end of the work area and face it outward. Make sure the fan and window frame are sealed with plastic. Tape the plastic to the sides of the fan so just the blades are exposed. Then, leave the fan on during construction to draw air into the work area and prevent dust from drifting into other areas of your home. Do not place the fan by an open window so it can blow the dust outside. This can taint the air outside and blow dust onto your neighbors."

It sucks in the dusty air, filters it, and blows it outside. Depending on how much dust you have, you may need to replace the filter regularly so the dust is safe to blow outside. [6] X Research source You can rent a portable air scrubber for $150-$200 USD a week. You can also invest in an air scrubber if you plan to do a lot of demolition and remodeling.
