Add your fruits or vegetables into the baking soda solution and give them a mix to ensure all of the produce is covered by the mixture. Then, leave the fruits or vegetables to sit for 12 to 15 minutes. After every 2 to 3 minutes, stir the produce so every piece is cleaned evenly. [5] X Research source Produce with soft exteriors, like berries, can get mushy when they’re soaked. To prevent mushiness, leave soft produce in the water for 1 to 2 minutes. Or, sprinkle them with baking soda as you rinse them under water. Remove fruits and vegetables like tomatoes and grapes from the vine before soaking them in the baking soda. Take off the outer leaves on vegetables like broccoli , lettuce, and cabbage before cleaning them. Do not cut into your fruit or vegetables before you clean them. Cutting off bruises or spots before the skin is clean can let bacteria get inside. [6] X Research source"

After your produce has finished soaking, take a few seconds to manually remove dirt on the surface of your fruit or vegetables. If you’re washing soft fruits or vegetables like berries, grapes , and leafy greens, just use your fingers to rub the produce. If you’re cleaning tougher produce like apples, carrots, or potatoes, scrub them with a soft-bristled brush. [7] X Research source"

Then, hold the fruit or vegetables under running, cool water to rinse off any remaining dirt or baking soda. This ensures your produce is clean and doesn’t contain a hint of baking soda. [8] X Research source If there is any baking soda left on your produce, they might taste slightly like baking soda, which has a bitter flavor. Just rinse your fruit or veggies off again to get rid of any residue."

Then, lay a second clean, dry towel on top to let your produce air dry before you cook with them or snack on them. Or, use your second towel to dry each individual piece off. [9] X Research source In general, only wash produce right before you’re going to eat it or cook it into a meal. Washing and then storing produce can encourage bacteria or mold growth that causes your fruits or vegetables to spoil faster. If you need to wash and then store vegetables or fruits, make sure they’re completely dry. Place them in airtight storage containers lined with paper towels to absorb excess moisture. Then, set them in your fridge away from meat and seafood."

      "content": "Baking soda removes pesticide residue and stuck-on dirt and debris. Fruits and veggies from the grocery store are often treated with pesticides that keep away damaging insects, but that you might not want to eat. Baking soda is a natural cleaning agent that decomposes and lifts off leftover pesticide residue on produce. [10] X Research source It also has abrasive qualities that scrub off dirt and other debris on the surface of fruits and vegetables. [11] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Vinegar is another common solution that’s used to clean produce. Unlike vinegar, baking soda is less smelly and doesn’t leave behind an aftertaste. Pesticide use is strictly controlled in the United States. If there is any pesticide residue on produce, it is below the regulated amount which makes it safe to eat. Still, it’s important to at least rinse off your produce to remove dirt and bugs.
