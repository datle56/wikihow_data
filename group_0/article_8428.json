      "content": "Apply mild detergent and water to food or drink stains. Old or new food or drink stains can be removed by putting 3 drops of mild, bleach-free laundry detergent onto a clean cloth, and adding a few drops of water to the cloth. Apply the detergent solution to the stain on the nylon, and allow the solution to sit for 15 minutes. Using a different clean, wet cloth, wipe the detergent from the stain. Use a dry cloth to blot the remaining moisture from the spot. The newer the stain is, the easier it will be to remove. Try to remove food or drink stains as soon as you notice them.

      "content": "Blot a grease stain with paper towels and solvent. First, get as much of the grease off the jacket as you can with dry high-absorbent paper towels. Keep blotting with the paper towels until no more grease soaks onto them. Next, in a ventilated space, spray a high-grade cleaning solvent such as Simple Green, some dish soap, or a stain remover such as Shout onto some paper towels and then dab at the stained area until the stain is gone. Wipe the area dry with some dry paper towels. Do not apply cleaning solvents directly to the nylon. Lightly spray paper towels with solvent and gently dab those onto the jacket. Wear gloves while working with cleaning solvents. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Freeze chewing gum with an ice pack or in the freezer. If you get chewing gum or another waxy substance onto your jacket, freeze it with an ice pack or put the jacket into the freezer until the gum is solid. Break the solid gum up into fragments and remove them with a scraping tool. You may need to repeat this process until all the gum is gone. After the gum is gone, remove any remaining stain from the jacket by using the process from step one for food and drink stains. [3] X Research source"

If the care tag says that the jacket can be dried in a dryer, put the dryer on the lowest temperature setting possible and remove it promptly when finished. Nylon does not take long to dry, so check it frequently and remove it as soon as it is dry. [12] X Research source"
