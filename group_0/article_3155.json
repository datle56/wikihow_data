      "content": "Don't worry about race and ethnicity––these don't matter. Even if you are not Asian, you can still be Kawaii. Being Kawaii is more than just about race or ethnicity. Your body shape doesn't matter either, Kawaii girls can be short, tall, flat, curvy, or skinny! Anybody can be kawaii."

      "content": "Get the attitude. Kawaii girls have sweet, nice attitudes that everyone loves! They giggle a lot, are super kind to everyone around them, never pick fights, and are just pleasant to be around! Kawaii is all about being adorable, so find things that you like. Hello Kitty is super adorable and loved by many so that's a good place to start. Don't just get something because it is Kawaii, get it because you like it. you can dress in themes of kawaii characters like any sanrio character( hello kitty, my melody, cinnamoroll,etc.) Rilakkuma, Doraemon,Pikachu, and more. pick kawaii characters you like and when you choose them, you don't have to stick to that same character all the time."

      "title": "Get the look.",
      "content": "Get the look. Here's where the innocent, lovable image comes in. Kawaii girls dress in bright, frilly clothes that just scream \"cute!\". Think outfits like floral, childish/elegant, scalloped designs, patterned overalls, balloon shorts with bows, etc. Go out shopping to find the most adorable clothing you can find. Look for color and cuteness, but, if you don't love it and don't think it would look good on you, put it back. Don't buy something you don't like just because it is Kawaii."

      "title": "Dress brightly and colorfully.",
      "content": "Dress brightly and colorfully. Put lots of key chains and things like that on your backpack or purse. Kid Robot has some Kawaii stuffed animals. Accessorize well and make sure your outfits look good together. Try finding old or used clothes and add lace, bows or other cute attributes. Many things that don't seem kawaii can look great with some changes. For example, you could add cute animal stickers to white sneakers. Try adding lace to a normal skirt."

      "title": "Do Kawaii makeup.",
      "content": "Do Kawaii makeup. Use black gel and/or liquid eyeliner, pink cream blush, sparkly pink lip gloss, and light concealer/foundation. You want a clean but innocent makeup look. Don't do anything sexy if you want to fully follow the kawaii style. Don't do smoky eye, for example."

      "title": "Get your nails done.",
      "content": "Get your nails done. Look videos up on Youtube if you want a good idea for DIY ideas. Often Kawaii girls wear fake, long and accessorized nails. This might be too much for you, so you got to find out what suits you. Neatly manicured nails are also good and can work in lots of looks. Try adding stickers to your nails. Just be careful not to paint over them. If would be best to add them after your nails are dry."

      "title": "Keep your eyes as large as possible.",
      "content": "Keep your eyes as large as possible. In pictures, Kawaii girls always have eyes wide open. You can lay an ice-cold washcloth on your eyes for about five minutes, then apply some pearly eyeshadow to under your eyes, on your crease. Big eyes are cute, but don't worry if your eyes aren't big. You could make your eyes appear larger by including lashes and applying eyeliner into a cat eye shape."
