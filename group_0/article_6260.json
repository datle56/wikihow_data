      "title": "Find a 12 by 15 inch wooden board.",
      "content": "Find a 12 by 15 inch wooden board. You can make a simple snail trap with wooden boards that you buy new or repurpose wooden boards you have lying around for the trap. Look for wooden boards that are at least 12 by 15 inches (31 cm by 38 cm). If you have a lot of snails in your yard, you may go for larger wooden boards to catch more snails."

      "title": "Raise the board off the ground with 1-inch runners.",
      "content": "Raise the board off the ground with 1-inch runners. You will need 1-inch runners to raise the board off the ground slightly. This will make it easier for the snails to crawl underneath the board and get “trapped.” Make sure the board is evenly lifted off the ground with the runners. You may need to use one runner on each end or under all four sides of the board. You can use 1-inch pieces of wood or stable objects that are at least 1-inch in height as runners, such as flat garden pots or pieces of plastic."

      "title": "Place the trap in a wet area in your yard.",
      "content": "Place the trap in a wet area in your yard. You should position the wooden trap in areas in your yard where you notice there are a lot of snails. Snails often gravitate to wet or damp areas in the yard, such as by a wet garden or a water feature. You may create several traps and place them throughout your yard so you have a higher chance of catching as many snails as you can."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get a deep plastic bowl or a plastic bottle.",
      "content": "Get a deep plastic bowl or a plastic bottle. You can make a trap to catch snails using a plastic bowl that has deep, vertical sides. The high sides will ensure the snails cannot crawl out once they have fallen into the trap. Alternatively, you can use a 1 liter plastic bottle to make the trap. Use scissors to cut off the top third section of the bottle, which contains the narrow opening. Invert the top section and insert it into the bottom section so the narrow opening is upside down, facing into the bottom section. You can then tape the two pieces together or piece holes in both pieces and secure them with wire. The shape of the plastic bottle trap will ensure the snails cannot crawl out or escape once they fall into the trap."

    {
      "title": "Fill the bowl with beer or a yeast solution.",
      "content": "Fill the bowl with beer or a yeast solution. Snails are attracted to fermented yeast and will eagerly head for a bowl of beer. You can fill your trap halfway with fresh beer to attract snails and cause them to crawl into the trap. Fresh beer of any kind will work, though darker brews like Stout or Guinness may be more effective. If you do not have access to beer or do not want to waste good beer, you can create a yeast solution to put into the trap. Combine two cups of warm water with two tablespoons flour, one teaspoon sugar, and ½ teaspoon of yeast. Mix the solution well and add it to the trap until it is half full."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the trap in your yard.",
      "content": "Place the trap in your yard. Once you have added the beer or yeast solution to the trap, you should place the trap in your yard. You can bury the trap in a wet spot in your yard, making sure the rim of the trap is raised 1 inch (2-3 cm) above ground level. This will ensure you catch snails only, rather than other bugs in your yard. Beer traps are most effective at attracting snails within an area of only a few feet so you should choose a spot in your yard that is full of snails or a spot where you have seen snails hanging around before. You may cover the trap partly with a stone or a small tarp that is raised just enough for the snail to crawl beneath and fall into the trap. This will prevent the trap from filling with water when it rains, as diluted beer or yeast is not as effective at catching snails."

    {
      "title": "Replenish the trap every day.",
      "content": "Replenish the trap every day. You will need to maintain the yeast trap by filling it with fresh beer or fresh yeast solution every day. The trap will not be as effective if the beer is old or diluted due to rain water. The liquid in the trap may also evaporate after a few days outside so you should try to top up the trap with fresh beer or yeast solution once a day."

    {
      "title": "Remove the snails from the trap.",
      "content": "Remove the snails from the trap. If you are trying to keep the snails in your traps alive, you should remove them from the bottom of the wooden trap by hand. Hold the snails by the shell and gently pull them off the wooden trap so you do not come in contact with the slimy mucus on the snail. This will also ensure you are move the snails to a different area safely. [1] X Research source Keep in mind if you use a beer trap, the snails will likely all be dead in the trap due to drowning. You may not want to use this trap if you would like to catch snails live."

      "title": "Keep live snails in an enclosure.",
      "content": "Keep live snails in an enclosure. Garden snails can make great pets for kids, as they are quiet, low-maintenance, and they are not expensive to feed or maintain. You will need a glass or plastic enclosure that has deep walls and a lid to keep your pet snail. [2] X Research source The snail may retract into its shell when you pick it up but if you place it in an enclosure that contains substrate and moss, it will often come out of its shell on its own."

    {
      "title": "Dispose of any dead snails.",
      "content": "Dispose of any dead snails. If you have any dead snails in your trap, you should dispose of them so the trap stays clean. You may scrape any dead snails off of your wooden trap with a shovel or a garden tool or crush any live snails with your foot. You should then set the trap back up so it can catch more snails. If you are using a trap made with yeast, you should fish out the snails and crush them. You should then replace the beer or yeast solution in the trap and set them up again so you can catch more snails."
