[1] X Research source “It may be your birthday, my love, but I somehow lucked out and got the best gift of all: you.” “I’ve never loved anyone like I love you, and I’m so grateful for you.

      "content": "Send a funny message if your girlfriend has a keen sense of humor. Is your girlfriend a hilarious person, always making you laugh? Does she prefer comedy movies to more dramatic genres? If so, a funny birthday message might be the perfect thing for her—so speak her language by cracking a silly (yet still sweet) joke . Plus, humor (and laughter) can help sustain relationships! [2] X Research source “Happy birthday to my incredibly lucky girlfriend. After all, you’ve got me as a partner!” “Happy birthday to a girl who’s not getting older, just more experienced at being amazing!” “I was going to wish you the best birthday ever, but you’re spending it with me—so it definitely will be!” “Happy birthday! Your beauty intensifies each year—just like your taste in partners.” “Happy birthday to the only girlfriend my mom has ever really liked.

I can understand why some people don’t believe me when I say that you’re my girlfriend because, in truth, I sometimes can’t believe it either!” “Please still love me despite how off-key I’m going to sing ‘Happy Birthday.’ I promise it'll be worth it!” “Happy birthday to the only person I can tolerate 24/7. I love you!” “How I got so lucky to end up with someone as beautiful as you, I’ll never know, but I’m certainly not complaining about it! Happy birthday.”"

      "content": "Include a short, thoughtful sentiment in a birthday card. If you’re not usually keen on talking at length (or want the pre-written message in your girlfriend’s birthday card to do most of the talking), short yet sweet birthday wishes can still show her how much you care. Just remember to say something more in person if you write a short note in her card (or vice versa if you plan to give brief wishes in person and write a longer card). “I’m so excited to celebrate my favorite person today. Let’s party!” “Today’s a special day because it’s the day you were born—and you’re one of a kind. HBD!” “Wishing my sweetie a happy birthday!” “You’re the icing to my cake. Happy birthday, darling!” “My world is better with you in it. HBD!” “You bring so much joy into my life, babe. Happy birthday!” “Your smile can light up the darkest room. Happy birthday!” “Happy birthday to my favorite person in the entire world!” “Thank you for being mine, and have a very happy birthday!”"

      "content": "Show your girlfriend you care with a longer, more sentimental message. Regardless of whether the relationship is fairly new or years in the making, heartfelt birthday wishes indicate that your girlfriend is truly important to you—and that the relationship is, too. So, get in touch with your sensitive side and connect with your girlfriend more deeply by opening up to her and sharing what’s in your heart.

May this birthday be your happiest yet—and may we celebrate many more together!” “You’re the most amazing woman I’ve ever met—and the sweetest, most caring person in my life.

      "content": "Start her birthday off right with a quick, cute morning message. Unless you live far apart, you’ll probably still see her later and give her even more birthday wishes—but you can still put a smile on your girlfriend’s face by sending her a quick “Happy birthday” message in the morning. Or, if you’re together that morning, offer a cheerful “Happy birthday” sentiment before going about the rest of your day! “Rise and shine—it’s your birthday! So psyched to see you later, babe!” “Good morning, babe! A special birthday breakfast delivery is on its way to you.” “Wishing I woke up with you in my arms, birthday girl! 😘” “Hope you got all the beauty sleep your heart desires, birthday girl.

Long-distance can be tough to manage, especially when it comes to birthdays—you may wish you could spend your girlfriend’s special day right beside her rather than miles away. [5] X Research source Still, an emotional sentiment in a birthday card (or spoken over a phone or video call) can remind your girlfriend that you care and want her to enjoy her day, even if you’re not there. “Happy birthday, sweetheart! You deserve to have the best day ever—I just wish I could be there for it.” “Sending you so many hugs and kisses, birthday girl. I love you!” “I wish I could tell you how much I love you in person today—but then again, I wish that every day!” “No matter how far away you are, you’re always in my thoughts.

      "title": "Let a new girlfriend know you look forward to more birthdays in the future.",
      "content": "Let a new girlfriend know you look forward to more birthdays in the future. If your relationship is relatively new, you might feel unsure how to address her on her birthday—especially if you really like her but maybe aren’t ready to say “I love you” yet. And that’s perfectly okay! With a simple yet sincere birthday message, you can still show a new girlfriend that you’re serious about the relationship and truly care for her . For example: “I can’t wait to celebrate you today! Happy birthday.” “Ready to pop some champagne tonight, birthday girl? I can’t wait!” “Asking you out was the smartest thing I’ve done all year. Happy birthday!” “I’ve got a super special date planned for today, birthday girl!” “The last few months have been so great—and I’m excited to celebrate. Happy birthday!” “Today’s all about you! Happy birthday to an awesome girlfriend.” “Happy birthday! The cake is on me later.” “Our relationship is new, but I’m excited to celebrate future birthdays with you too!” “Happy birthday! Let’s do this every year—what do you say?”"

      "content": "Include a few celebratory emojis in a cute birthday text. Presumably, you can also do something else for your girlfriend’s birthday (either send her a card and call her if you’re long-distance or celebrate in person if you live nearby), but texts are still a cute way to add to the birthday cheer! So, send your girlfriend a text (complete with emojis to add some color) and let her know how special her birthday is! “Enjoy your special day, babe! I’ll see you soon! 😘😍” “Happy birthday to my beautiful girlfriend! 🥳 May your day be filled with laughter and joy.” “Blow out your candles and make a wish, babe. 🎂 Happy birthday!” “Happy birthday to an extraordinary woman!

      "content": "Offer a blessing if you and your girlfriend have the same religion. Birthday wishes with religious sentiments in them can be super touching as long as religion is something you and your girlfriend share. Sharing blessings probably isn’t the best idea if your girlfriend isn’t religious—even if you are. However, when religion is something you have in common, feel free to incorporate it into a birthday card (or speech). “You’re in my prayers today and every day. I hope you get every blessing in life. Happy birthday!” “May your birthday be filled with happiness, peace, and blessings. I love you!” “I pray you get everything you want and more. You deserve the world. Happy birthday!” “I’m so grateful that God let our paths cross and brought you into my life. Happy birthday!” “My prayer is for God to grant you all of your desires today. Happy birthday, my love!” “May God always bless you—and our relationship. Have a happy day, birthday girl!” “God blessed me with the most wonderful girlfriend ever. Happy birthday!” “I wish you a blessed day, my love. Happy birthday!”"

      "content": "Use a famous quote to capture the depth of your feelings. Sometimes, it can feel like the world’s renowned writers, poets, and playwrights know your feelings better than you do! If a quote really resonates with you (and can help show your girlfriend how much you love her and wish her a happy birthday), why not include it in her birthday card? “Today you have added another candle of knowledge and wisdom to your life.
