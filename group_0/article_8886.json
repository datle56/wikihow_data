      "content": "White Pair white with bright yellow or a softer, pastel yellow for a clean, sunny look. Because white is neutral, it won’t compete with yellow as the focal point in a room or an outfit. The combination of white and yellow is popular in bright spaces of the home, such as kitchens or dining areas. [1] X Research source To use yellow and white in interior design, add yellow accents like throw pillows or flowers to white furniture. Yellow is a welcoming color when used in an entrance room, says Roland. To wear yellow and white, try a yellow top with white pants. For a more subtle look, wear a pale yellow coat over a white dress or find a white T-shirt with a yellow graphic."

      "content": "Orange When paired together, yellow and orange remind people of a beautiful sunset. The inviting, warm hues make for a strong duo in home decor. Use yellow and orange furniture to brighten up an otherwise neutral living room. [2] X Research source Pastel orange and pastel yellow are refreshing together, while deep orange and gold create a more mature look. For example, coordinate deep orange curtains and a golden yellow couch to add pops of color to your white-walled living room. Yellow and orange may be harder to wear together without clashing. Style them in a subtle way, such as stacking yellow and orange bracelets on your wrist."

      "title": "Blue",
      "content": "Blue Blue and yellow are a popular duo for a reason. The two colors are strong on their own, but the right shades also complement each other beautifully. In darker spaces, a rich blue flatters metallic yellow accents, such as gold picture frames or brass fixtures in a bathroom. [3] X Research source For a brighter combination, pair mustard yellow with pale blue in a bright space like a kitchen. Yellow also goes with turquoise, says Roland. To wear blue with yellow, try gold jewelry with a dark blue dress or top."

      "title": "Pink",
      "content": "Pink Pair soft shades of yellow and pink together for a soft look that feels fresh and feminine. Combine pops of bright yellow with baby pink for a modern design. If you want a less shocking look, pick a mustard yellow and a pale, almost beige pink. [4] X Research source For example, offset a cool pink wall color with a bright yellow coffee table in your living room. To style pink and yellow together, stick to patterns that incorporate both colors in pale shades for a flirty, feminine outfit. Kim suggests wearing pink shoes with a yellow outfit on warmer days."

      "title": "Black",
      "content": "Black Yellow and black are a surprising color combination, but in the right amounts, they can complement each other. Skip black-and-yellow patterns that resemble a bumblebee or taxi cab. Instead, add dashes of warm yellow in subtle ways alongside graphic black patterns. [5] X Research source In interior design, add a swipe of yellow around a bold black-and-white pattern for a dramatic look. For example, place a bright yellow bath mat near a shower with black-and-white tiling. Wearing black and yellow might not work as well as using the colors in design. If you want to blend the colors, carry a yellow bag or add a yellow headband to an all-black outfit."

      "content": "Green Put green and yellow together to evoke the beauty of the natural world. Pair pastel yellow and green together for a cleansing combination in a bedroom or living area. If you’d prefer a darker palette, use a sage green that goes with an earthy shade like dark yellow. [6] X Research source Bright green and bright yellow might feel jarring unless you’re going for a vibrant, tropical theme. Otherwise, stick to a light pale or pastel yellow or a dark yellow to offset the saturation of bright green. For example, pair a green easy chair with a dark yellow accent pillow or nearby lampshade. To wear green and yellow together, rock green sandals or heels with a yellow outfit for a vacation-ready summer look. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Red Red and yellow are too eye-catching colors that energize a space, outfit, or design when put together. Space them out with another grounding color to avoid reminding people of McDonald’s. Decide which of the two strong colors will be the star, and accent it with the other color in smaller amounts. [8] X Research source Pair lighter yellows with pink or pink-red, and darker yellows with crimson or maroon. In interior design, match mustard yellow with pink-red for an eye-catching detail in a space. For example, pair mustard yellow cabinets with a pink-red kitchen countertop. Wear the colors together by spacing them visually. For example, don a yellow dress and red heels or earrings."

      "title": "Wood browns",
      "content": "Wood browns Pair yellow colors and brown woods for an earthy combination that’s relaxed and grounded. Brown is essentially a combination of red, yellow, and black pigments, so it naturally complements yellow. In interior design, use yellow furniture or accents to brighten up rooms with wooden floors or highlight wooden furniture. [9] X Research source For example, place yellow books and knickknacks on an oak bookshelf. Wear earthy browns with pops of yellow in the fall for an earthy, autumnal fashion statement."

      "content": "Purple While purple and yellow seem like they go together because they’re complementary colors, try to avoid pairing them together. The colors are both strong and attention-grabbing, which means that together, they muddle the focus of a design, space, or outfit. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Magenta",
      "content": "Magenta Because magenta is saturated and almost fluorescent, it clashes with dark yellow, which is more subdued. [11] X Research source It’s also too bright to pair with bright yellow. Try either pastel pink and pale yellow or dark yellow and crimson red instead."

      "title": "Mint green",
      "content": "Mint green They’re both food-inspired colors, but mint green and mustard yellow aren’t an ideal combination. Mint green’s cool hue adds too much contrast to the warmth of mustard yellow. Mint green is better paired with white, while mustard yellow may work with a muted sage green. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider the lighting and function of a space. No matter what shade of yellow you’re using, the lighting of the room will affect its appearance. In a dark space, yellow appears closer to orange, while in a bright space, the light brings out white undertones and brightness.

Some, like tan, are calm and subdued. Others, like sandcastle, are muddy and earthy. Certain shades border on brown or orange. Consider all the options before you settle on one shade.

If you’re struggling to find just the right color to go with yellow, look to softer and darker shades of yellow. Whether you’re decorating a room or getting dressed, find kinds of yellow that flatter each other. Prevent monotony with different textures or materials."

      "content": "Think of the psychology of the shade of yellow you’re using. Each shade of yellow evokes a different feeling and has different symbolism or historic associations. For example, bright yellow is associated with happiness and energy, while mustard yellow is more cozy. Mustard yellow features in fine art, while bright yellow reminds people of school buses. [16] X Research source Before deciding which shade of yellow to use, think about what you want to make people feel in your space. Also consider the season when it comes to using yellow in fashion—bright yellow is more summery, while mustard yellow is a fall staple."

      "content": "Experiment with unexpected color combinations. While there are popular pairings of yellow and other colors, not every combination has been tried in every possible way. Don’t be afraid to experiment with yellow and colors you haven’t seen paired with it before. Vary the intensity of either shade and the amount present in a combination until you find the perfect duo. Study how to coordinate colors without making them clash. If you’re lost, consider consulting an interior designer or ask for advice at your local hardware store."

Undertones are different from your complexion—you can have a pale complexion and warm undertones, or a dark complexion and cool undertones. If you have cool undertones, you can be washed out by bright yellow. Go for pastel or pale yellow instead. [17] X Research source If you have warm undertones, bring out the warmth with gold or mustard shades. If your undertones are neutral, you can pull off practically any shade of yellow."

Wear neutral colors like white, beige, or black with yellow garments to balance the saturation and brightness of the color. In the fall, complement mustard yellow with earth tones like sage green or burnt orange. Denim is another easy option—simply throw on jeans with a yellow blouse or tee. [18] X Research source"
