    {
      "title": "Improve your control skills.",
      "content": "Improve your control skills. Watch YouTube videos on how to beat certain game modes or obbies if you are struggling, and see if you can use those same techniques on the game you are playing. Get tips from friends who are a pro at a certain game, or keep practicing until you get where you want to be. Playing an obby is a good way to practice your controls. You use the WASD or arrow keys to move, space bar to jump, and you can scroll or use the I and O keys to zoom in and out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice with obstacles.",
      "content": "Practice with obstacles. Play games involving obstacle courses or lots of weapons, such as Doomsday Brickspire. There are some rocket launchers that fire multiple rockets with spaces in between. Practice with admin, which some games offer for free or for the price of Robux. #*Don't panic or rage if you die. Keep your cool, and avoid saying offensive comments to other players. Being patient is a key part of becoming a pro Roblox player."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try some hand-to-hand combat.",
      "content": "Try some hand-to-hand combat. Wait to practice this until you are under attack. When you get cornered, turn around and slash quickly with your sword, or use another weapon such as a gun as quickly as possible. If you are an attacker, be on the lookout for pro players who are excellent at hand-to-hand combat."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid lagging on games.",
      "content": "Avoid lagging on games. Certain games might not work as well on certain devices, so avoid those games and play them on a device that doesn't lag. If you do lag or the game glitches (i.e. your screen starts spinning endlessly in circles), reset your character and see if the lag/glitch stops. If it doesn't, you can always leave the game and join a different server or play a different game."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be nice:",
      "content": "Be nice: It's the best way to get people to respect you. That includes the following: Don't try to roast other players if you did something worthy of praise. Don't bully other players, and stand up for players who are being bullied. Don't be inappropriate in any way (i.e. dress your avatar in an inappropriate manner, yelling words of profanity in the chat, or calling people names referring to sexuality or profanity). Don't use curse words."
    },
    {
      "title": "Help other people.",
      "content": "Help other people. People might want to become your friend more often if you are nice, and helpful. People don't want to be friends with people who say things like \"lol, figure it out yourself noob!\""

    {
      "title": "Get KOs.",
      "content": "Get KOs. Getting high scores at fighting games can make you a better Robloxian. But don't get many Wipeouts! You might be able to get badges for completing harder tasks or levels."
    },
    {
      "title": "Always use Shift-Lock.",
      "content": "Always use Shift-Lock. For straight, consecutive bar jumps, enable Shift-Lock and jump sideways."
    },
    {
      "title": "If you use a sword as a weapon, attack your enemy when the tip of the sword is closest to the enemy.",
      "content": "If you use a sword as a weapon, attack your enemy when the tip of the sword is closest to the enemy. However, don't take too long trying to figure this out, as the other player can attack you while you pause."
    },
    {
      "title": "Frequently move back and forth while in combat.",
      "content": "Frequently move back and forth while in combat. You can confuse the other players by moving frequently, as long as you can aim your weapon at the player and not miss them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Attack from behind the enemy.",
      "content": "Attack from behind the enemy. Always be ready to be attacked from behind by zooming out to see if anyone is behind you. Always go in the first person. If there are kill cams, use them to your advantage to see where the enemy killed you at. Don't blame your teammates; it is rare that they are that bad that you need to blame them for your loss, prevent fighting with them!"
