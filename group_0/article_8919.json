      "content": "Pick a name to match your style. Your rapper name may sound fairly different depending on where you come from and what sort of rapping you do. Your name should reflect how you want to come across: dangerous, or goofy, or thoughtful, or clever. Think about your identity. Consider the sorts of names that other rappers in your area use. You don't need to copy anyone else – but you might be wise to get familiar with the \"scene\" that you want to break into."

      "content": "Use your real name as a guide. Include the first letter of your name, or twist your name into something entirely different. Make your rapper name something that sounds like your real name, but differs enough to distinguish you. There is no right or wrong way to do this. Get creative! Consider Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers. His rapper name is based on his initials: \"M and M.\" [1] X Research source Lil Wayne's real name is Dwayne Michael Carter. He just took the \"D\" out of Dwayne to make it Wayne! [2] X Research source"

Snoop Dogg's mother was the one to bestow him with his rapper name: Snoopy (of Peanuts fame) was his favorite cartoon character growing up, and his mother started calling him after the character. When Snoop got into the rap game, he decided to use his childhood nickname to give himself a unique stage presence. [3] X Research source"

The people that you see everyday are the ones who observe and know you the best – so there's a good chance that they'll at least put you on track to finding your ideal rap name. Just say, \"I'm trying to come up with a good rapper name. Do you have any ideas?\" Look for perspective on how you come across. Ask, \"How do I come across when I rap?\""

Study the stage names of rappers that you admire, and think about why their name suits them so well. Use a similar structure or a similar lyrical device. Read about how famous rappers picked their names. [5] X Research source"

Say your name at the beginning of a rap to see how it sounds. If you reference yourself in the flow of your rap, make sure to refer to yourself by your new rapper name. Ensure that it's catchy – something that people will remember. Record yourself and listen over the tapes. If you like the way that it sounds, then keep it. If you don't like the way that it sounds, then try to come up with something else."

Try to stick to one \"stage name\" – but feel free to reference \"characters\" and versions of yourself when you rap. Eminem, for instance, often refers to himself as \"Slim Shady\" to express the rougher, meaner side of his personality. [6] X Research source"
