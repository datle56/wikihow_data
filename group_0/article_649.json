To apply to multiple pages, select the pages you want to inherit the page numbering, then hold down Option (Mac) or Alt (PC) as you click the parent page. Another way to apply page numbering to multiple pages is to click Apply Parent to Pages in the Pages panel, select the parent page, enter the page numbers (e.g., 2-50, or 3, 8, 9-20), and click OK . You should now see that all pages are numbered using the same stylization as the Parent page. The page numbers will always be accurate, as they are updated to reflect the page's actual number after any additions or deletions."
