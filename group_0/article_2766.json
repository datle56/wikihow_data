      "content": "Be confident . [2] X Expert Source Chloée Ohayon-Crosby Costume Designer & Wardrobe Specialist Expert Interview. 24 July 2020. For many people, being confident is easier said than done. Being confident means feeling secure in who you are and what your abilities are. If you're not already confident, there are ways to build your self esteem . As an example, if you struggle with negative self talk (those voices in your head that tell you you’re a loser, worthless, stupid etc.), work on countering that with positive affirmations such as “I am thoughtful” or “I am a good friend”. When you're confident, you don’t beat yourself up for making mistakes, and you don’t talk down to yourself. Confident people are able to celebrate the success of others, without feeling jealous or bad about themselves."

      "content": "Relax and live in the moment . It can be difficult to enjoy life when your mind is on the past or future. Instead of worrying about what you just said or what might happen next, so enjoy the moment you're in. If you’re nervous and unsure of what to say, a great way to connect with someone is to ask them questions. In particular, asking someone for advice about something, or encouraging them to talk about themselves, is a great way to get them to like you. [3] X Research source If you are relaxed and focused during your time with others, they will be more likely to enjoy your company and seek it out again."

      "content": "Be an active listener. If you’re talking to a guy you like (or anybody, for that matter), a surefire way to get them to like you (at the very least, as a friend) is to actively listen to them. Active listening involves the following steps: Don’t interrupt or judge the person who is talking. Nod your head or give short verbal signs (“yes”, “mm hmm”) that show you acknowledge what the person is saying. Paraphrase what they’ve said so that they know you’ve understood. Ask questions to signal you’ve paid attention and are interested."

      "title": "Be honest but respectful.",
      "content": "Be honest but respectful. Resist the urge to tell a guy what he wants to hear instead of what you really think. Just be sure to be respectful while you’re voicing your opinion. There’s no need to insult him or his ideas. You want him to like you for who you are, not for who you think he wants you to be. He might even appreciate that you have your own ideas and the courage to voice them. For example, if a guy asks what you think of a movie you didn't like, say what you really think instead of pretending you liked it just because you think he liked it. If nothing else, it'll lead to an interesting conversation."

      "title": "Share your passions and interests.",
      "content": "Share your passions and interests. When people talk about their passions, it's like they come more fully alive. Their excitement can be infectious, making them exciting and fun to be around. When you're talking to a guy you're interested in, don't be afraid to reveal a little about what's important to you. Don’t forget to ask questions about his interests, too. This will show him that you’re interested in getting to know him better, and could help him feel closer to you."

Being happy and fulfilled will make you more attractive to men. In addition, having hobbies will give you more to talk about and more opportunities to bond with your crush, if he shares any of your interests. You might even meet someone through your hobbies."

If you’re at a party, ask him if he needs a drink or some snacks; if you’ve recently talked about a concern of his, check in to see how he’s doing with that concern. Studies have shown that if you’re loving, supportive and stable, people are more likely to consider you as a potential mate, so take opportunities to show that you are all of those things.

      "title": "Be honest about who you are.",
      "content": "Be honest about who you are. Countless romantic comedies are built around someone saying they’re someone they aren’t, and their lie blowing up in their face. Don’t be that someone. If your ideal night is at home with pizza and Netflix, don’t tell your crush you’re a party animal. It will only be exhausting for you, and sad when you inevitably break up because all he wants to do is party and all you want to do is relax. If you love math and want to teach, don’t tell your adventure-seeking crush that your dream job is being a snowboarding teacher at a resort."

      "title": "Don’t change who you are for anyone else.",
      "content": "Don’t change who you are for anyone else. It can be fun and even healthy to step outside of your comfort zone — for example, by trying new hobbies or being more social — but always make sure that you’re doing it with a firm sense of who you are and what you want in life. Stay true to your beliefs and goals. The only good reason for changing who you are is if you are unhappy with who you are, and you want to change so that you’re happier with yourself. If being with a certain guy requires you to be someone completely different, you probably shouldn’t be with him."

Research shows that while physical elements play a key role in a man’s initial attraction to a woman, other factors are also important. These include humour, beliefs, and personality.

Studies show that other people see you as 20% more attractive than you see yourself. [7] X Research source Too many women judge themselves harshly instead of seeing their own beauty. Maybe you don't conform to conventional beauty standards, but who are those for, anyway? The beauty standards of today are different from those of the past and will continue to shift through time."

If you’re unsure of what your style is, seek inspiration in fashion icons and the people you look up to. It’s okay to experiment with different looks — it doesn’t mean you’re trying to be someone else, it’s about exploring how you express yourself. Play around with accessories, styles and colors you wouldn't normally choose. If they feel good, wear them out; if they make you feel like you're playing dress-up, keep experimenting."

Other studies have shown that men prefer women who wear less makeup (although to be fair, sometimes men think a natural look equates to no makeup). [10] X Research source If you’re not big on makeup but you’d like to try it out, you can start by keeping a natural look and just giving your face a healthy glow. You might top it off with some mascara and a natural-looking lip gloss. Ultimately it’s most important to do what feels good to you. If you don’t want to wear makeup, don’t do it. Make sure what you're doing to your face and body is what you want to do, also. Don't change the way you look just because you think a certain guy will like it more that way."

Much of what attracts men to women is related to a primal instinct wherein their mind views certain features as signalling a better ability to reproduce. Symmetrical, youthful faces signal fertility and health. [11] X Research source Studies have shown that men prefer women with childlike faces — big eyes, small noses, full lips, and a small chin. [12] X Research source You can use mascara and lip plumper to make your eyes look wide and your lips look full.

You can achieve an hourglass shape through exercises that build your bum and hips, and tighten your waist; certain styles of clothing; and/or by using a waist cincher, which is also known as waist training.

Take good care of yourself: eat well, exercise, sleep enough. And don’t beat yourself up if you have an off day or don’t look like a supermodel. If you’re trying to attract a man you’ll likely read all sorts of article that tell you what men like, and it will often be things that you don’t have.

Above all else, you need to feel good about how you look. If you do want to experiment with longer hair, consider trying clip-in hair extensions, which can be purchased at salons and beauty supply shops.

If you’re already talking to him, make eye contact at special points in the conversation, like while you're giving him a compliment.
