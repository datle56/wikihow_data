      "content": "Yes, address someone with a Ph.D. as “Dr.” Start your email with “Dear Dr. Jones,” or “Dr. Jones,” then start the body of your email in the next line. This rule applies regardless of what their degree is in. There is no need to include the addressee’s first name. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Address each professor separately using their title and last name. Strictly use their last names, and use “Dr.” for Ph.D. holders, or “Professor” for teaching assistants and other non-doctors. Separate their names with a comma. You can use the salutation “Dear” at the beginning if you’d like. If you aren’t sure who has a Ph.D. and who doesn’t, just use “Professor” for all of them. [2] X Research source You might write: “Dear Professor Jones, Professor Smith, and Professor Ali.” “Dr. Jones, Dr. Smith, and Professor Ali,” “Dr. Jones and Professor Smith,”"

      "title": "Write a name with a Ph.D. as “Dr. Jimmy Jones.”",
      "content": "Write a name with a Ph.D. as “Dr. Jimmy Jones.” If you’re want to write someone’s name and they have a Ph.D., put “Dr.” in front of their full name. If you’re addressing a Ph.D. directly or writing to someone who knows them, skip the first name and just write “Dr. Jones.” [3] X Research source You may have seen Ph.D. holders put “Ph.D.” at the end of their name. This is something authors do, but you shouldn’t need to write it this way."

      "title": "Address a professor as \"doctor\" only if they have a Ph.D.",
      "content": "Address a professor as \"doctor\" only if they have a Ph.D. You usually need a doctoral degree to be hired as a college professor, so many higher educators are indeed doctors. If you know that a college professor is a doctor, opt for “Dr.” instead of “professor” when you address them via email. If you aren’t sure or you know they don’t have a Ph.D., call them “professor” when you email them. You’re very unlikely to get into any trouble by referring to your college teacher as “professor,” even if they are a doctor. At worst, they’ll kindly correct you. In the United States, it is generally seen by most educators as socially acceptable to address a doctor who is also a professor as “professor.” It’s not technically correct, but you’re unlikely to offend any of your educators. As such, you can usually call a doctor a professor or Dr. in email. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Opt for “Mr.,” “Ms.,” or “Professor,” if you’re addressing a Ph.D. student.",
      "content": "Opt for “Mr.,” “Ms.,” or “Professor,” if you’re addressing a Ph.D. student. If the person is working towards their Ph.D. and they’re teaching a college course you’re enrolled in, you might write, “Dear Professor Jones,” or “Professor Jones.” If they aren’t a teacher, use “Mr. Jones,” “Ms. Jones,” or, “Dear Mr./Ms. Jones.” [5] X Research source A Ph.D. student is not a doctor yet, but they may still be a professor. “Professor” traditionally refers to tenure-track educators at the collegiate level, but there’s no harm or risk of offense by calling an adjunct instructor, lecturer, or TA, “professor.” [6] X Research source “Miss” has historically been used to address unmarried women, while “Mrs.” has referred to married women. These titles are going out of style since many people find them offensive, so you’re best off skipping these."

      "content": "The rules for addressing Ph.D. holders change from country to country. The rules covered thus far have applied specifically to the United States, but every country has their own quirks and guidelines here. Refer to your country’s guidelines or look online for a local example if you want to know the proper formatting. [7] X Research source For example, in Canada, you are not “officially” allowed to refer to non-medical doctors as “Dr.” You would address them as “Mr. Jones, Doctor of Mathematics.” This also applies to the “Jimmy Jones, Ph.D.” form, too. In the United Kingdom, for example, you don’t use any periods. Someone in the UK would write, “Jimmy Jones, PhD” without the punctuation."
