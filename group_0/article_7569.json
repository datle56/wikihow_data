      "title": "Include \"et al.",
      "content": "Include \"et al. \" in your in-text citation. When you paraphrase or quote the reference in your paper, add a parenthetical citation that directs your reader to the full Works Cited entry. Typically, this includes the last name of the first author followed by the phrase \"et al.\" Then, type the page number where the quoted or paraphrased material can be found. Place your citation at the end of the sentence inside the closing punctuation. [5] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source For example, you might write: \"The growth of cities has meant trees are more ornamental than natural (Pine et al. 72).\" If you mention the author's name in your text, you don't need to repeat it in your parenthetical citation. However, you still need to include the page number. Include the phrase \"et al.\" after the author's name in your text to ensure the other authors are acknowledged. For example, you might write: \"According to Pine et al., Christmas tree farms actually damage the environment (74).\""

[10] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source For example, if you had another book in your references written by Brown, Fall, and Light, you could have \"(Brown, Green, et al., 2020)\" and \"(Brown, Fall, et al., 2020).\" If the books were published in different years, the year of publication is enough to distinguish them.

Check with your instructor or supervisor to make sure they're okay with shortened footnotes. For the shortened format, simply omit the parenthetical with the publication information."
