A big crowd could drive the bidding prices up or cause you to lose out on a bid for a vehicle. Look for auctions that are situated in less populated areas or tend to fly under the radar.

      "content": "Research the vehicles listed online a few days before the auction date. Most auctions will list the vehicles that will be available at the auction a few days before the auction date. Look over each listing and identify which vehicles you are interested in bidding on. You should try to choose at least one to two vehicles in the event you lose out on a bid so you have a backup vehicle you can still bid on.

If you have your eye on a Mercedes-Benz CLK listed online, for example, you should note the details listed for the car. Then, you should research the market value of a used Mercedes-Benz CLK and determine how much you would be willing to bid for the car. Make sure you are clear on the maximum you would be willing to spend on the car as this can prevent you from overbidding in the chaos of the auction."

      "title": "Bring cash or proof of an approved loan to the auction.",
      "content": "Bring cash or proof of an approved loan to the auction. Police auctions will only take payment in cash or proof of an approved loan for the winning bid. If you are planning to pay with an approved loan from your bank, you will need to be able to cover a minimum deposit for the full cost of the vehicle. [3] X Research source You will also need to cover the cost of taxes, title, and registration fees. Cars sold at auction do not come with a warranty and are considered “as is” so you will likely need to purchase insurance and a warranty for the car once you buy it. You will also need enough money to cover the cost of towing the car from the auction and the cost of cutting new keys for the vehicle if it is sold without keys."

The vehicles appear at the auction untouched, which means they are in the exact state they were in when they were confiscated by the police. Be prepared for the vehicles to be filthy, damaged, or full of someone else’s stuff.

      "content": "Do not bid more than you can afford. It can be easy to get caught up in the chaos of bidding wars and quick sales at the auction, so focus on staying calm and not bidding more than you can afford. Remember your predetermined limit you set for yourself as you bid on the vehicles you are interested in and try not to overbid in an attempt to outbid someone else. [6] X Expert Source Bryan Hamby Professional Auto Broker Expert Interview. 11 June 2019. Avoid making quick, in the heat of the moment decisions and really be certain you want a vehicle before you start bidding on it.

      "content": "Check if there is a towing company on site. Depending on the condition of the car you bought at the auction, it may be drivable or it may require a tow to your home or to a car mechanic for a tune up. Most police auctions attract towing companies who know they will have customers who need their services. Look for a tow truck parked outside of the auction or ask the auction for a referral to a towing company located nearby. Some auctions allow you to store your purchased vehicle, for a fee, if you cannot pay for a tow or are planning to do maintenance on the car another time."

This will ensure the car is safe and ready for the road."
