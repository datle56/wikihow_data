      "content": "Make sure your face is clean first. Also, if there is any dry skin on the area you will apply on, moisturize it with a thin non-oil based moisturizer. Makeup looks unpolished on top of flakes. If you choose to use foundation, use a light and thin one. Before you start this, you should also have no makeup on as well. This includes face makeup and mascara, before you start the makeup fun! [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Dust on just a bit of a pink blusher on the apples of your cheeks. Not very much, you only want just a bit of color. Sixties makeup is all about the eyes, so use face makeup sparingly. Be sure to pick the right shade. Smile as you apply this. Start out by dabbing, and once you apply the desired amount while smiling, smear in with the clean brush or your fingers/hand. Make sure both the cheeks have an even amount. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Trace your natural crease shape with a darker matte brown color. Use a small and stiff brush to trace, an eyeliner brush will do. This will define your eyes more. Blend it well with a small fluffier brush, but keep it dark. [4] X Research source If you're going for a more theatrical Twiggy-like look, don't blend at all! Use a black gel liner, or liquid, trace your crease shape, let it set, and that's it. You can go back and refine the crease a bit, but keep it very sharp and neat looking."

This makes your lashes look thicker and longer. Do not try to put on too many layers of mascara as this may make your eyelashes clump together and look \"spidery\". If you are planning on drawing on your bottom eyelashes like Twiggy's, don't put on much mascara on your bottom lashes. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "You can also use false eyelashes, depending on whose look you're emulating. But generally, you should use eyelashes that are long and thick but still look somewhat natural. Use the appropriate eyelash glue. Some pairs of false eyelashes come with pre-packed glue but it is better if you buy a separate eyelash glue tube - the applicator is often 10 times more precise."

They should be spaced apart, shaped like upside down triangles, and they should be straight, not leaning in any particular direction. The last eyelash or two on your outer corner can go in that natural direction, though. [7] X Research source"

If you're going for dramatic then you can perhaps put on a bit of gloss. [8] X Research source Lipstick was quite bright or nude at the time, so red might be a bit too 1950s. If you don't like nude or light lipsticks, just wear a toned down lipstick close to your natural lip color."
