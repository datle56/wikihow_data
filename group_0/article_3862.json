      "content": "Benching means keeping someone on the sidelines as a potential partner. In the dating world, “benching” is similar to stringing someone along–a person might like them enough to keep texting and DMing, but they're not the person's first choice for a serious partner. The person being benched is given just enough time and attention to keep their hopes up, but they’re essentially a “backup” in case other dating options don’t work out. [1] X Research source ”Benching” in dating is a reference to “benching” in sports, which is when a player is not in the starting lineup and sits on the bench for most (or all) of the game. The player is on the sidelines watching, but isn’t allowed to participate–unless another player is injured or removed from the game. [2] X Research source In relationships, “benching” someone is considered cruel because it keeps the person in a prolonged state of uncertainty. They can’t move on because they’re holding out hope for a relationship, but in reality, they’re wasting their time–the other person doesn’t consider them a serious option. Benching is similar to both breadcrumbing and cushioning ."

      "title": "Sudden decrease in contact",
      "content": "Sudden decrease in contact One of the earliest signs of being benched is when the other person suddenly stops texting and calling as much. They typically won’t provide any explanation, or they’ll make vague or half-hearted excuses about their schedule being “packed” or work being “crazy.” Any conversations you do manage to have with them feel extremely one-sided. [3] X Research source Keep in mind there are lots of valid reasons why someone might not be texting you back . Being super busy isn’t always an excuse–sometimes people really are going through it or dealing with a lot in their lives."

      "title": "Sporadic communication",
      "content": "Sporadic communication As if the sudden decrease in contact isn’t jarring enough, someone who is “benching” you will often disappear for a while and then restart a text convo out of the blue–days, weeks, or even months later. They give you just enough attention to get your hopes up about making a real romantic connection, and then disappear yet again. [4] X Research source Pay attention to when they show back up–it’s not always random. For example, if you make it clear that you’re moving on or start going on dates with other people, this might trigger them to reach out. They don’t want to lose their backup option, so they’ll say or do just enough to get you interested again."

    {
      "title": "Noncommittal or vague plans",
      "content": "Noncommittal or vague plans During one of their sporadic communication phases, they’ll probably make loose plans with you (“We should get coffee soon”) or agree to hang out (“Let’s get together this weekend”) without ever really nailing down the details. Then, when you try to solidify a date or meet up with them IRL, they’ll flake out. This can be really hurtful and confusing, especially if it keeps happening repeatedly. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Lack of relationship progress No matter what you do, the relationship feels stalled–you’re treading water and nothing ever moves forward with them. Even when you do hear from them or see them, they always seem to disappear again, usually right after you start getting your hopes up. They may even claim they “just want to be friends,” but they’ll still flirt with you or say things that indicate a relationship might still be possible. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Tell them that you're feeling sidelined and see what they say. If the person is truly interested in having a romantic relationship with you, they won't be afraid to address your concerns. It can be a little scary to communicate openly about your feelings, especially if you're worried you won't like their answer, but it's the fastest way to get clarity on the situation. It's totally normal to feel vulnerable and it's okay to be nervous. When you're ready, you might say, \"Hey, I'm feeling a little neglected and confused right now. It would really help me a lot to know how you feel about me and if you're looking for a serious relationship.\""

      "content": "Be straightforward and upfront about what you want and need. If you haven’t told them that you’re looking for a serious commitment, they may think carrying on a casual relationship with you is totally fine. It’s best to be honest about what you want so the other person knows what's going on. You could say, \"I'm looking for a serious connection so that I can hopefully get into a long-term relationship with someone special. It's totally fine if you don't want a serious relationship with me, but I need to know.\" If they know you’re looking for a commitment and continue to “bench” you, that’s pretty unfair and toxic behavior."

There’s nothing wrong with giving someone a second chance (or even a third chance), but beyond that, you have to ask yourself–is this an unhealthy pattern that I want to continue? If you feel like you’re being benched, set a boundary and stick to it. You deserve someone who will be real with you! For example, let's say they've flaked on a date with you twice in a row. Promise yourself you’ll only give them one more chance. After that, it’s probably best to move on."

Because dating apps provide users with seemingly endless choices for potential dates, the act of swiping left or right on human beings can easily start feeling like you’re shopping for a new coat on Amazon. It’s not surprising, then, that this illusion of choice makes some people feel like potential dates are clothing items that can be tried on, worn for a while, returned and/or discarded. [8] X Research source Choice paralysis from having so many options could also be behind the \"benching\" phenomenon. Most people are on multiple dating apps and actively communicating across all of them can be pretty overwhelming."

This is awesome in some ways, but it also means that surface-level communication is the new normal. We all have people who we communicate with exclusively through silly videos, memes, and cat pics–and there’s nothing wrong with that!

For a person with low self-esteem, knowing they have an admirer (or several admirers) waiting in the wings can be a big ego boost.

That said, they eventually come to terms with being ghosted and move on. People who are being benched are constantly having their wounds reopened when the other person shows back up in their lives. They're offered a glimmer of hope and it can be really hard not to seize that once it's been offered. [12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Some people say benching is even worse than ghosting because at least ghosting is over quickly–benching goes on and on until you put a stop to it."

Breadcrumbing is when someone gives you just enough attention to get your hopes up, but not enough to connect on any real level. They might text you every few weeks, or like your stories on Instagram, but they just want your attention and nothing more. They don’t intend to start anything real with you.
