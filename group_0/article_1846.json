      "content": "Ask “What’s your number?” as the simplest approach . If a conversation is going well, you can simply ask your crush for their number. This shows that you’re interested in talking to them more and you’re confident that they would want to give their number to you. [4] X Research source Have your phone or a pen out and ready when you ask; this shows that you have no doubt about your crush giving you their number."

      "title": "Try “I have to go but I’d like to talk more.",
      "content": "Try “I have to go but I’d like to talk more. You should give me your number.” This approach lets the person know directly that you want to talk to them again, and also that you’re busy and organized. Have your phone or a pen ready to get their number quickly. [5] X Research source Text your crush right after you part ways. Say, “It’s me! Save my number.”"

      "title": "Say, “Let’s exchange numbers” if you mentioned plans or interests.",
      "content": "Say, “Let’s exchange numbers” if you mentioned plans or interests. This approach works best if the conversation headed toward things you both like to do or an event you both were going to. For example, you mention a party and your crush says they also want to go. You can say, “Let’s exchange numbers, maybe we can go together.” [6] X Research source Follow up with your crush soon after this conversation by texting them “Looking forward to that party” or something similar."

      "title": "Give them your number first if you’re too nervous to ask for theirs.",
      "content": "Give them your number first if you’re too nervous to ask for theirs. Say, “I’d like to talk to you more, let me give you my number.” This works well if your crush has their phone out already; you can hold your hand out as you say “let me give you my number” to enter your number in their phone for them. [7] X Research source Don’t grab your crush’s phone from their hand; this may come across as aggressive. If your crush seems reluctant to hand over their phone, just wait for them to respond. They will probably look down at their phone as they type and let you know when they’re ready for the number. If you do grab their phone, they might feel threatened or forced into the relationship."

      "content": "Smile and say “no problem” if they say no. Always remember that you want to date someone who’s interested in you, and if your crush isn’t, it’s better for you to know and move on. Don’t ask them again or try to pressure them, cry, or look embarrassed. Even if you feel embarrassed, try to shrug it off as no big deal. [8] X Research source Try not to worry much about being rejected. It happens to people all the time, and you will eventually find someone who is interested in you."

      "content": "Give them a genuine compliment before asking for their number. A great way to get your crush’s attention is by complimenting them. Tell them you like something that they’re wearing or something they did, then say something else to give them the chance to respond. If your conversation goes well, ask for their number at the end of it or next time you see them. [9] X Research source For example, say “I like those shoes a lot – my brother probably would too. Where’d you get them?” Or try, “You did a great job on that project. I can tell you worked hard on it. Maybe you can give me some pointers on public speaking sometime.” Reader Poll: We asked 600 wikiHow readers who've initiated a conversation with their crush, and 53% of them agreed that the best conversation starter is complimenting or commenting on a shared interest.

      "content": "Ask them to help you with something then ask for their number. This works well if you see someone out in public who you’d like to talk to. Get their attention by asking for directions or help getting something from a shelf. Try, “Excuse me, could you tell me how to get to the library?” or “Are you able to reach this for me?” After they help you, thank them and try starting another conversation and asking for their number if they seem interested in you. [10] X Research source If the person avoids you or helps you quickly then walks away, thank them and then leave them alone. Do not follow a person in public, or they may think you are harassing them."

If they smile, make eye contact, and answer your questions enthusiastically, these are all signs that they are possibly interested in exchanging numbers. [13] X Research source On the other hand, if your crush avoids eye contact, tries to walk away or look away from you, or doesn’t answer you or gives one-word responses, these are all signals that they may not be interested, unfortunately.

[15] X Research source If your crush starts liking and leaving nice comments back on your social media posts, it’s possible that they’re interested in you and you can confidently ask for their number.
