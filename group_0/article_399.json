      "content": "Try exercise or sport blowing off steam by forming a new habit : making a good habit can take a couple weeks, a month or more. Try working up from feeling down or working off energy or sublimating--elevating feelings by doing something like practicing on the piano--or be energetic playing vigorous sport. Whatever works well for you will be helpful, and some may be helpful in group activities. Keep it simple: Some people get satisfaction from Walking fast, jogging, Playing basketball, or swimming."

      "content": "Make small changes like improving your appearance and get yourself a treat when you have completed your goals. For example, you might overcome anxiety , cope with depression or stop being paranoid , if you could slowly open up to situations that challenge you somewhat, and slowly learn to conquer your them. You show courage and make effort and so, feel good about that! These may be called baby steps. Don't start big; start with simple and easy improvements. Don't try to do too much--that can lead to sore muscles or sore feelings."

Since you may not always pick up cues about other people's feelings, it's wise to ask if they are interested and have time to listen before launching into an involved discussion of complex topics. Don't be offended if people seem uninterested..."

If only a few words are clear, then it very well may be your imagination filling in things that were not \"heard.\" Doubt your negative interpretations of what you \"heard\" or saw; suspend judgment of subtle ideas or actions, and avoid groundless beliefs (unfounded opinions) or thinking that you have everything all figured out..."

A way to achieve relaxed eye contact is to look at the left eye of the person briefly and then shift to other right eye. That way you are not so uncomfortable--because you are controlling the way you look at people--without just staring."

Consider this as \" Service with a Smile .\" Don't glare and grimace at people- smile a little; if you're not sure if your brow is furrowed in a frown, casually touch your forehead to feel the wrinkles. Now take a deep breath, but let it out slowly, smile (Learn to laugh at yourself.) and relax . Don't wear a big grin all day or a \"never-ending smile\" either--try to wipe an uncomfortable grin off your face; relax a little do the deep breath again... Avoid erratic behavior--don't act shocked, shake your head, whirl about, giggle (for no apparent reason); Avoid rambling speech--get back on topic; Do not argue or accuse people of insults, etc. in a public place. Does it matter what strangers think? No! Will you be seeing them again--No! Let slights and insults drop; just let it go! Don't worry and don't react to strangers; if it seems that someone is confronting you or disrespecting you, just let it go. They don't matter."
