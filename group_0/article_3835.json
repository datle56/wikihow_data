Place your hands behind your head, then tighten your abs and pull in your navel, squeezing your core to lift your shoulders as you exhale. Lower yourself back to the floor and repeat for a total of 10 crunches. [1] X Research source Too challenging? Make the movement smaller, only lifting your shoulders slightly off the ground. Too easy? Lift your arms over your head during the crunch. Or, do bicycle crunches by touching your right elbow to your left knee and straightening your right knee as you lift. Repeat sides each time you do a crunch. What it works: Crunches are a great way to build core strength.

[3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Too challenging? It’s okay if you can only do 5–10 seconds at first—that’s normal, so keep practicing! But if you find it hard to hold a plank at all, try resting your knees on the ground. Too easy ?

Instead of pushing upward, inhale and pull your navel in so your pelvis tilts downward, then exhale and return your lower back to the floor. [6] X Research source Too easy? Rest your shoulders against a bench, block, or box that’s about 12–14 in (30–36 cm) off the floor. What it works: Glute bridges work your glutes and abs, and they help improve hip mobility."
