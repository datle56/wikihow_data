To select one of the variations that was suggested, copy and paste it into the box, and click Set Name. To try a different name, simply type the new name into the box again and click Set Name to see if it’s available. Once a name has been relinquished by a user, it will become available again after 35 days, so if you’re holding out for a specific name, be patient and keep trying. [2] X Research source"
