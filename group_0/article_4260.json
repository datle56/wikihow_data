      "content": "Disembark from your plane (if you arrived from a previous flight into this airport). Don't go too far. Once back inside the airport, you can ask airport workers to help you locate your gate. They will be knowledgable with both where you are, and where you need to be, despite your loss of finding the Plane Train."

      "title": "Look at your gate's terminal letter and number assignment.",
      "content": "Look at your gate's terminal letter and number assignment. Dependent on where you flew into, you could be in gates T, A, B, C, D, E (from west to east) or a separate International Terminal (that there only is a walkway to). Your gate will also have a number. Some airlines' mobile apps will even tell you which gate you arrived at; however, it's just as easy to look up to tell which terminal building you are in. Step to the side or sit down if needed to figure it out, or ask an airline attendant. Places such as near baggage claim in the T-terminal and many airport information desks still have terminal maps, but you can also find terminal maps within the airport's app through Wi-Fi or through your cell connection that are easy to use."

      "title": "Figure out your next gate ahead of time if you are planning to take a connector flight.",
      "content": "Figure out your next gate ahead of time if you are planning to take a connector flight. Many times before the Plane Train walkway, you can find the current timetable and gates information on the Departure screens. These are updated frequently and may be more up-to-date than your ticket or boarding pass. Continue watching for gate changes as you make your way to the plane train, because it's possible the plane might find another gate - in some instances. Plan ahead for changes and delays to happen, but don't let yourself linger in any spot for more than a few moments - especially in tight-connections."

      "title": "Walk quickly (but don't run) throughout the terminal.",
      "content": "Walk quickly (but don't run) throughout the terminal. Each terminal's Plane Train is at a point down a walkway midway between the one end of the terminal and the other, and you'll want to walk towards it. Use all moving walkways inside the terminal, to speed up your walking, if necessary - but keep moving."

    {
      "title": "Arrive at the walkway between the directions of trains.",
      "content": "Arrive at the walkway between the directions of trains. Dependent on which terminal you're in, the nearby signs will tell you which gates are in the Plane Train direction you are near, while on the other side of the Plane Train, the concourses will be going in the opposite direction. Plane Train signs are posted with a classic \"P\" above the doors leading you downstairs. There is a place next to the escalators (where there will be either a small shop or a major-known restaurant) where some people check their flight data. If you need to use an elevator, look for signs sending you to the elevator; you'll be able to cross over around the bend to send you on the right way to your terminal. The signs may be overhead or around the opposite escalator, so look accordingly."

Plane Train distances last between terminals in under two minutes, though there are spots where this will seem to take longer or take additional time to move between because of other stops. There are no physical seats on these trains. Hang onto the hanger bars as the train moves. Listen to the soothing voice overhead. Her helpful announcements will offer an audible guide to let you know what terminal you are approaching next. Although the train moves forward, it will feel like you are moving sideways from terminal to terminal."

Walk to a place inside the train where there are few to no people making their way in. When you get to the terminal, head down the hallways and up the escalators to find your gate. Watch out for your fellow riders. Wait for them to get out before you, unless you are holding up the line, or need to step aside to let the others go."

If you are in the T terminal, you need not worry about taking the Plane Train, as you'll have arrived in the center court of this Terminal building. For others, you'll need to look up at the boards in the Atrium portion as you enter to see for gate assignments. Although your ticket gives you some of the information, the most up-to-date data is available on these screens or your airline's app."

If your flight takes off from the T terminal, you don't have to walk too far past the security checkpoint, as your terminal is on either side of the main checkpoint. It's best to walk through either the North or South security checkpoints to get to your gate, and you won't have to travel on the Plane Train at all."
