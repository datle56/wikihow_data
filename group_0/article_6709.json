Talk to your doctor about options for FDA-approved bioidentical drugs and the potential side effects. Be aware that over-the-counter plant-derived progesterone creams and yam extract creams do not work the same, as they either have too little of the hormone to be effective or cannot be synthesized by the body and converted into progesterone. Products that are not FDA-approved are not regulated, meaning there is no way to verify that they actually contain what they claim on the bottle. More research still needs to be done on bioidentical drugs and the long-term risks."
