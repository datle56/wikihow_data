Below is a list of palm mounts your callus may be near and what they mean. Mount of Mercury : This mount is located beneath the pinkie finger and is related to your ability to think. A callus here may be a sign that you're feeling insecure about your intelligence level. It could also mean that you're a little too impractical or insensitive and should put your intellect to better use improving your life. Mount of Apollo : This mount, located beneath your ring finger, is associated with your outlook on success, happiness, and beauty. A callus here may be a sign that you've had one of these things ripped away from you recently and you're struggling to rebuild. It could also mean that you've been too extravagant with your spending or self-pampering and should consider cutting back. Mount of Saturn : This mount is found under your middle finger and is related to extra-ordinary tendencies, like having faith in fate or a tendency to dwell on morbid fantasies. A callus here may indicate the presence of doubt about your beliefs or a sign that you're spending too much time and energy thinking about imaginary scenarios. Mount of Jupiter : This mount is located under your index finger and is associated with leadership, organization, and authority. A callus here could mean that you've recently felt belittled or challenged, either by someone specific or by life knocking you down a peg. It could also be a sign that you're too caught up in your own ego and vanity, and need to give yourself a humility check."
