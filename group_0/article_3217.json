      "content": "Educate yourself about what it means to be a Shaolin Monk. Before you do anything, you need to read extensively about what it actually means to be a Shaolin Monk. This includes the duties, responsibilities, requirements, and other qualifications that Shaolin Monks must have. Kung Fu is studied, not to teach fighting, but to discipline the body and for the beauty of emulating the movements of the animals, which brings you into harmony with nature. There are many books you can read that will teach you about the philosophy, about Buddhism and about meditation. Understand the history of Shaolin Kung Fu, and its 1500 years of development. Know that not all Shaolin monks are the greatest warriors. They are essentially Buddhist monks who have studied the technique of Shaolin. Understand the strict requirements that Shaolin Monks are held to today. Understand the philosophy and spiritual aspects of Shaolin Kung Fu. [1] X Research source"

The martial arts aspects of Kung Fu are just physical manifestations of a complete spirituality that you will need to learn and live by as a Shaolin Monk. Shaolin Kung Fu is an outcropping of Buddhism. Shaolin Kung Fu requires intense training, self-control, and self-reflection. Shaolin Monks must possess a complete and utter dedication to their way of life."

      "content": "Alter your diet. You need to embrace a diet that is in line with Buddhism and Shaolin Kung Fu. These dietary requirements are part of both Buddhist belief and Shaolin commitment to self-control and self-restraint. They might be very challenging for many people. Reduce how much you eat. Avoid overeating at all costs. Eliminate meat completely from your diet. Cut out simple carbohydrates. Consume raw food. While some monks do this for every meal, you should begin with one meal."

These teachers will be your best resource for learning more about Shaolin Kung Fu and the steps you will need to take to get on the path toward being a Shaolin Monk. For those in the United States, there are a number of Shaolin temples and organizations that will be helpful. It is highly recommended that you talk to one of these teachers or monks before you continue your path to becoming a monk yourself. Consider: The USA Shaolin Temple in New York City. Other regional Kung Fu Centers. If you don’t have a practitioner in your area, you might have to travel."

Here, you will meet individuals who have trained as disciples of Shaolin. The masters at many temples in the United States received their training at the principle Shaolin in China.

China is the home of Shaolin Kung Fu, and as a result there are many Shaolin Temples there that take in students. Learning in China can be the best way to move toward becoming a Shaolin Monk. But consider the following: Training is full time. You won’t be able to work, socialize outside the Temple, or spend much time doing much else. Your life will be devoted to training. It could be costly to travel and train at a temple. There are a wide range of Shaolin Temples in China, varying on quality, so do your homework before you decide to make the trip."

Lay Monks may smoke or drink cigarettes sometimes. Lay Monks might even eat meat."
