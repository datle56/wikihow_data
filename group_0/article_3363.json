      "content": "Guessing the vowels first will help narrow down your future guesses. Every 5-letter word has at least one vowel, so vowels are a great starting point. Including at least three vowels in your first word can help you get the most yellow and green letters up front and make your next guesses easier. Even if your vowel-heavy word doesn't yield you any yellow or green letters, you'll be left with fewer vowels to try on your second guess.

      "title": "Your second guess is just as important as the first, so make it count.",
      "content": "Your second guess is just as important as the first, so make it count. Use your second guess to enter a word that has as many different gray letters as possible to eliminate or confirm as many letters as possible after two tries. The goal is to have a great set of letters to work with (even if they are yellow/in the wrong spots) so you can easily nail your third guess. Which words have your yellow and green letters, as well as several other letters that you haven't tried yet? For example, if your first word was Adieu and you didn't guess any of the vowels right, there must be an O in the word, and/or possibly a Y. A word like Brown, Spork, or Glyph would be a great second guess. [2] X Research source You can also plan your second word in advance just in case your first word doesn't give you any yellow or green letters. For example, if you used Cause as your first word and none of the letters were correct, be ready with a word like Bough or Phony that has none of the same letters. Some other helpful pairs: First word: Irate Second word: Clown First word: Alien Second word: Rough First word: Radio Second word: Black"

This would indicate that the word is trickier than a puzzle in which more people guessed correctly in 3 guesses or less. If a particular position has a higher gray or yellow rating, that letter is more troublesome for people to guess than the letters with a higher green rating.
