      "content": "Boil your water. Fill a large heavy pot 2/3 of the way full with water. Cover the pot and place it on the stove over high heat. Once the water has begun to boil add 1 tablespoon of salt to the water. Adding salt to boiling water not only adds some seasoning to the water, but it also increases the boiling point of the water. This in turn assists in cooking your food more efficiently! [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Cook your broccoli. Once your pot of water begins to boil, carefully place the cut broccoli into the boiling water. Begin counting blanching time once the water returns to a boil. For florets that are approximately 1½\" across, cook for about 3 minutes. Adjust cooking time accordingly for different sized florets. The broccoli can become tender with just about 45 seconds in boiling water, though. The broccoli should be bright green and firm (though slightly softened) when you remove it. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Cool your broccoli down.",
      "content": "Cool your broccoli down. Either remove the broccoli with a slotted spoon or small sieve or drain the broccoli in a colander. Immediately place the broccoli in the ice bath to stop the cooking process. Remove the cooled florets from the cold water after 30 seconds and strain them again in the colander."

    {
      "title": "Serve.",
      "content": "Serve. As with other vegetables, blanching your broccoli can be the primary cooking method or it can be the first step before sauteing or stir-frying. Secondary cooking methods (such as sauteing) primarily add flavor to vegetables and don't usually cook the vegetables as thoroughly as needed. Blanching is a great way to pre-cook vegetables to be added to sauté and stir-fry's."

      "content": "Prep for steaming. Fill a large pot with 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of water and bring to a boil. Place your vegetables in a stem basket that sits above the water line. Cover the pot and prepare an ice water bath, as above. Try to arrange the florets in a single layer to ensure the steam reaches all parts of the broccoli evenly."

      "content": "Time your steam cooking. When steam begin to escape, begin counting your blanching time. Steam blanching broccoli takes approximately 5 minutes. About half-way through the cooking time, remove the lid and make sure the broccoli is not clumping together and that it is all cooking evenly."
