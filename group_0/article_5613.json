Therefore, at 12:00 noon in New York City, it is 6:00 pm in Amsterdam. As you move west in the United States, add hours. 6:00 pm in Amsterdam would be 11:00 am in the Central Time Zone (GMT -6:00), 10:00 am in the Mountain Time Zone (GMT -7:00), 9:00 am in the Pacific Time Zone (GMT -8:00), 8:00 am in Alaska (GMT -9:00), and 7:00 am in Hawaii (GMT -10:00).
