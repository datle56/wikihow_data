      "content": "Attach the climbing wall to the existing framework in your home if you can. If you are a homeowner and want a permanent fixture for climbing, consider building your wall for added support. This makes it easier to build and design your wall since you have spatial restrictions. Look for a location in your home where you have enough space to maneuver and climb off the ground. [1] X Research source Consult with a contractor to make sure the existing structure can support the weight of your climbing wall while you or others are on it. A common place to build a climbing wall is in a garage, but account for any storage space you need or space to park your car. Check if there are electrical outlets in the space you want to build your wall. If so, make sure you can still easily access them if you need to."

      "content": "Build a free-standing wall if you can’t put in a permanent fixture. A free-standing wall doesn’t require anchor points or external support structures because they are already built in. Use a free-standing structure if you don’t want to damage any of the pre-existing walls in your home. You could also build a free-standing climbing wall outdoors. [2] X Research source A free-standing wall is best if you want to transport it or if you’re renting. Free-standing walls tend to cost and weigh more since you need to build supports that can handle the weight of the wall and the climbers. Outdoor walls need to be weatherproofed or else the holds will not last as long."

      "content": "Visit climbing gyms for design inspiration. Check your local recreation centers or climbing gyms to see how they have their walls laid out. Write down notes about the wall or draw simple sketches to get new ideas about how you may want to build your wall at home. [3] X Research source Consider putting walls at angles or inclines rather than flat against the wall. Look online for photos of how others have built climbing walls at home to see the best way to make use of your space."

      "content": "Make sketches of your climbing wall design on paper. Draw the design in pencil so you can get ideas of how you want to lay out the wall in your space and make changes easily. Make your wall about 4 feet (1.2 m) wide by 8 feet (2.4 m) tall.Try out different inclines and angles in your drawing to see what would and wouldn’t work. Narrow down your ideas into the 3 you like the most to give you or the people you live with a choice. [4] X Research source Keep your wall at or below 8 feet (2.4 m) tall, or else falling off the wall could cause serious harm. You can build a scale model using cardboard or computer software if you want to visualize the wall in 3D. Typical angles for a climbing wall tend to be between 30-40 degrees from the wall."

      "content": "Draw your design ideas on the wall with a pencil. Use a pencil along with tape, string, and tacks to draw your design on the wall where you plan to build. Make sure everything from the drawing fits well in the actual space, or adjust your design so it fits the space. [5] X Research source Double check for any outlets, vents, or light fixtures that you may need to access when you build the wall. Use a stud finder on your walls to find anchoring points if you plan on attaching your climbing surface directly to the wall."

      "title": "Build a support base if you’re making a free-standing wall.",
      "content": "Build a support base if you’re making a free-standing wall. Use 2 in × 4 in (5.1 cm × 10.2 cm) boards to run vertical supports the same height as your wall. Then cut the 2 baseboards of your support so it’s double the length of the wall’s height. Attach the midpoint of the base to the bottom of the vertical support with a plate connector. Measure from the end of the base to the top of the wall to find the length of the angle. Cut 4 boards to that length, and saw each end to a 45-degree angle. Use plate connectors to connect the angled supports to the bases. [6] X Research source Frames can vary in shape and weight depending on the shape and height of the wall you plan on building. For example, if you want an 8 ft (2.4 m) wall, your 2 bases would be 16 ft (4.9 m) and your 4 angled boards would be about 18 ft (5.5 m)."

Cut the longest boards first before working on the shorter boards. Always double-check your measurements before making the final cut in your wood. Set aside each board after you cut them to size. [7] X Research source Purchase your boards from your local lumberyard or building supply store. Aim to have the width of your wall around 4 feet (1.2 m) and the height around 8 feet (2.4 m).."

      "content": "Assemble the boards into an outline of what you want the wall to look like. Lay the boards on the floor in the shape of your wall so the narrow edges of the boards are face up. Use either a nail gun or hammer where the planks meet and place at least 2 nails at each intersection. Once it’s assembled, you’ll have the outer edges of a frame for your climbing wall. [8] X Research source If your wall is in a corner, make a frame for each climbing surface. You can also use screws and a drill to make your frames. If you want a wall that’s 8 ft × 4 ft (2.4 m × 1.2 m), the outline of your frame will be the same size."

Cut the beams to size and place them inside your frame, using a nail gun or hammer to set them in place. [9] X Research source The term “on center” refers to spacing the center of each board at the specific distance. In this case, the center of each support board should equal 16 in (41 cm). For a wall that’s 4 ft (1.2 m) wide on the bottom, you would place 2 more support beams that are 7 2 ⁄ 3 feet (2.3 m) in the middle of your frame."

Add screws every 12 in (30 cm) or wherever you notice the frame bowing away from your wall or support. [10] X Research source Make sure you know where anything may be behind your walls, such as wiring or pipes. Avoid drilling into them. [11] X Research source For a free-standing wall, make sure the support holds the full weight of the frame without tipping over. If there is any wobbling, add more weight to the base with extra boards."

Use a table saw or circular saw to cut your plywood down to the correct size to fit the frame. Try to keep the boards in the largest sheets possible so you can easily put the wall together. [12] X Research source Standard plywood sizes tend to be either 4 ft × 8 ft (1.2 m × 2.4 m) or 3 ft × 8 ft (0.91 m × 2.44 m). Purchase enough to cover all of the framework."

If you want a clean layout, draw a grid on the plywood so each square is 8 in × 8 in (20 cm × 20 cm). Drill your holes where the lines intersect. If you want a more eclectic look, put the holes in random spots. [13] X Research source How you drill the holes is a matter of preference. Either way will work for installing the handholds."

Use the screw provided with the handhold and a drill to secure it to the wall. Add as many handholds as you want depending on how easy or difficult you want the wall. [16] X Research source Handholds can be purchased online or at specialty climbing stores. Some handholds can be attached with screws without a T-nut on the back. Make routes on the wall using different colored handholds. For example, space red handholds farther apart to make a difficult route or place green handholds close together to make an easy route."
