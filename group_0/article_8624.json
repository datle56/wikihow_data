      "content": "Lay the pike on it's belly and cut about half inch down right behind the head. You'll want a nice, at least 6-inch fillet knife to work with. Cut right behind where the head of the pike meets the body, slicing down until your hit resistance. This is the fish's backbone."

      "title": "Angle the blade towards the tail and cut all the way towards the fin.",
      "content": "Angle the blade towards the tail and cut all the way towards the fin. Use the backbone as a guide, running down to the top fin. Your entire blade should be in the fish, removing a 1-1/2 inch fillet of flesh from the fish's \"back.\" [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut upwards, mimicking the angle of the back fin, to remove the top fillet.",
      "content": "Cut upwards, mimicking the angle of the back fin, to remove the top fillet. As you reach the dorsal fin, start curving up so that your knife exits right before you hit the fin. This top fillet should be boneless, as you can stay above all the bones using this method. That said, don't worry if there is bone running down the center. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use pliers, your fingers, or careful knife work to remove any center bones from the fillet.",
      "content": "Use pliers, your fingers, or careful knife work to remove any center bones from the fillet. There shouldn't be many, but take care of them now. If they are deeply embedded, which is more common with larger fish, you may need a set of clean pliers to remove them."

      "title": "Skin the fillet, if desired, while still fresh.",
      "content": "Skin the fillet, if desired, while still fresh. To do so, slide the knife between the skin and flesh, pushing it through the other side. Holding the top of the fish down with one hand, slice all the way down the fillet to remove the fish. Go slowly to prevent accidentally cutting off the meat. [3] X Research source Some people like to keep the knife still, and actually pull on the skin, ripping it off by keeping the knife between the flesh and skin. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a finger feel out the Y-shaped bones poking out of the top of the fish. These will be your guides as you cut into the side of the fish. If necessary, use your knife to cut lightly into them, exposing the tops so that you can see your guides as you get into the side fillets."

      "content": "Flip the fish on its side and plunge the knife in behind the head. This will be right in line with the cut you made on the top of the fish. Again, cut until you hit the bones, which you exposed in the last step. It won't be quite as deep as you went in the top fillet, as the sides are a bit thinner. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Flip the fish over and repeat on the opposite side. The process is the same, though it can be a little harder to keep the fish balanced with its other side missing. Remember to go slow and use a sharp knife, trying to stay parallel to the cutting board the entire time."

Locate it as the starting point for your fish. [7] X Research source Cutting the tail fillets of a pike is just like any other fish. If you already know what you're doing, there are no extra bones or steps to worry about with northern pike."

      "content": "Cut along the fish until you just about reach the end. You don't want to totally cut the fillet off. It should have a small \"hinge\" of skin right where the flesh meets the tail, so you can pull the meat off the fish like an opening door."
