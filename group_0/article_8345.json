Work the ingredients together until they form a thin paste. [2] X Research source If your gas oven is really dirty, add a few drops of dish soap to the baking soda paste for added cleaning power. If the paste is too runny, add some more baking soda. If it’s too thick to spread, then add a little bit more water. Baking soda is one of the best gas oven cleaners because it’s natural, but it’s abrasive enough to scrub out residue without damaging your oven."
