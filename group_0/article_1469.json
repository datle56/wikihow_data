Many goths pick their lip color based on their eye shadow (and vice versa), so consider creating a contrasting look with dark maroon eyeshadow and bright crimson lipstick , or pair a softer smokey gray eye with bold black lips. If you’re struggling to narrow down lipstick options, determine your skin undertone to find the best shade that suits you. In general, cool-toned lipsticks look great on fair skin, while warm tones complement medium to dark complexions. If you choose a liquid lipstick, make sure it's a long wearing formula that doesn’t transfer."
