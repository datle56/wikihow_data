      "content": "Pores are tiny holes surrounding hair follicles on your face. When these small openings fill up with dirt, dead skin cells, oil, makeup, pollutants, bacteria, and more, they can clog over time (sometimes noticeably—those are blackheads). Clogged pores can also cause breakouts and whiteheads.

If one technique doesn't work, try another. Keep experimenting until you find an unclogging and cleaning method that works for you."

      "content": "In exfoliants, look for ingredients proven to chemically unclog pores. Chemical cleaning is especially effective for pores because it's more difficult to get deep into pores via physical cleaning alone. Look out for ingredients like glycolic, lactic, and salicylic acid—because in your fight to unclog pores, these will be one of the best options. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source First, get your face wet with warm water. Then, gently apply your exfoliant. Rub your fingers around your face in a circular motion. Never use AHA or BHA exfoliants more than 2-3 times per week. Test out just a pinch of exfoliant to start. Wait to see how your skin reacts. These are strong chemical agents. If you use too much too quickly, you could easily dry out your skin. BHAs are typically harsher and sometimes need a prescription. If you're interested in trying out a heavier exfoliant, talk to your doctor first."

      "content": "Pore strips easily clear your pores and help them appear smaller. Pick out a shape and size that suits the section of your face you’re looking to clear up—maybe your nose, forehead, chin, or cheeks. Wet the strip and your face with warm water, apply the strip so it’s firmly pressed into your facial creases, and leave the strip on for 10-15 minutes. Then, gently peel the strip away.

They can also immediately leave your pores looking cleaner and smaller. Plus, they’re just really fun to use, too!"

      "content": "Retinol and retinoids decrease oil and dead cells on your skin’s surface. In short, they're great for unclogging and minimizing pores. Head to your local drugstore and find a cream or oil that contains retinol. Or, reach out to your doctor to get a prescription for a stronger retinoid product. These can cause skin to produce more collagen, look fresher, and ultimately, stay clear for longer. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Though there are tons of benefits, retinol and retinoids pose a risk, too. If you have sensitive skin, talk to your doctor or begin at the lowest percentage. Wear sunscreen and never overuse your retinol or retinoid products. This can lead to extra uncomfortable, sensitive, or dry skin. It’s also important to note that these products aren’t safe for someone pregnant or breastfeeding. Speak to your doctor for more information."

[5] X Research source So masks will collect your pores' impurities—and when you toss your mask, dirt and grime get tossed out with it. Follow your mask’s directions so you don’t cross the line from reducing oil to totally drying out your skin. Finally, if you use a peel mask, remove it very carefully. Otherwise, you risk damaging your skin. Make sure you wash your face with your regular cleanser prior to applying your mask. Follow up with a hydrating moisturizer to help fight off dry skin.
