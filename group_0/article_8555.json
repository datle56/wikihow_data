      "content": "Consider running a rinse cycle. If you are concerned with some residual bleach being present in the tub of your washer, consider running the washer a second time on hot, but without adding bleach. This second wash will get rid of any left over bleach. However, you could just choose to run a cycle of whites after you clean the washer, which would clean out any residual bleach and benefit the white fabrics. Some people also suggest that you put a little vinegar in with this second wash to really get rid of the bleach. However, mixing bleach and vinegar can cause dangerous chlorine gas to be created, so this should not be done. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Wipe down the inside of the door with diluted bleach water. The inside of the door on a front-loading washer is especially prone to a buildup of dirt and mildew. Take a cloth that has been dipped in a diluted bleach solution and wipe down all the areas of the door that have dirt buildup and mildew growth. The bleach solution should be made by mixing ½ cup bleach with 1 gallon (3.8 L) water. [5] X Research source Wiping down the inside of the door before you run a wash cycle will assure that any bleach that remains gets washed away."

You may also want to pour a bit of bleach into the laundry detergent dispenser in your washer. Using about a 1/2 cup of bleach in the detergent dispenser will help to clean out the whole washer."

[7] X Research source Even though you run soap and bleach through these areas, they can have dirt and debris build-up. This is especially true of the detergent compartment, because of the sticky nature of liquid detergent."
