      "content": "Email Elton John at his label. Elton John’s record label – Rocket Music – accepts fan mail emails. You can send your fan mail via email to eltonrequest@rocketentertainment.com. Keep in mind that this is the same email address used to request press bookings, so you’ll be competing with a lot of other communication. Note in your subject line that your email is fan mail, not just a press request. You can write something like \"For Elton, from a fan.\" In your email, tell Elton why you're such a big fan. Write something like \"I've been listening to your music since I was 10. I feel like your music is the soundtrack to my life - for every experience, every milestone, there's an Elton John song that describes it perfectly/\""
