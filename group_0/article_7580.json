      "content": "Identify the number of terms. A term consists of a coefficient, variable, or both. For example, you could have 4 {\\displaystyle 4} , x 2 {\\displaystyle x^{2}} , or 4 x 2 {\\displaystyle 4x^{2}} . You can use the number of terms to determine the type of polynomial you’re dealing with. Monomials have 1 term. Binomials have 2 terms. Trinomials have 3 terms. Polynomials with more than 3 terms are usually just identified by their degree. The variables should have non-negative integer exponents."
