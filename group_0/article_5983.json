      "content": "Check your cat’s incision twice a day for 10-14 days. If possible, ask your veterinarian to show you the incision before you take your cat home, and take a photo or make a note of what it looks like, so you can detect any changes later. Then, each morning and evening, check the incision to make sure it’s healing properly. [1] X Trustworthy Source Animal Humane Society Leading animal welfare nonprofit organization providing medical care, training education, and resources for animal owners Go to source Call your vet if you observe: Redness: The incision may initially be pink or light red around the edges. This redness should fade with time. If it intensifies or the incision appears dark red at any time, this could be a sign of a developing infection. Bruising: Some slight bruising that goes from red to purple as it heals is normal. If the bruising spreads, gets worse or is severe, or if new bruising occurs, seek follow-up care right away. Swelling: Some swelling around the incision site is a normal part of healing, but if the swelling persists or worsens, call your veterinarian. Discharge: You may see a very small amount of light red discharge around the incision when you bring your cat home. This can be normal, but if the discharge persists for more than a day, the amount of discharge increases, the discharge is bloody or the discharge is green, yellow, white or foul smelling, your cat needs veterinary attention. Separation of the wound edges: In a male cat, the scrotal incisions will be open, but they should be small, and they should close rapidly. A female cat or a male that had abdominal surgery may or may have visible stitches, which should remain intact. If the cat does not have visible stitches, the wound edges should remain closed. If they start to separate or you notice anything, including suture material, protruding from the wound, take the cat to your veterinarian right away."

Your vet will probably give you feeding instructions, so follow those as best you can. If you did not receive instructions, consider the following: If your cat seems alert and responsive, offer your cat about a quarter of its normal portion of food about 2-4 hours after you get home from surgery. [5] X Trustworthy Source Animal Humane Society Leading animal welfare nonprofit organization providing medical care, training education, and resources for animal owners Go to source Don’t force the cat to eat or drink, though. If your cat is able to eat, give them another small meal in 3-6 hours. Repeat this until the cat has eaten a full portion of food, and then resume the cat’s normal feeding schedule. Don’t give your cat any “special” foods, treats, or junk food after surgery. Your cat’s stomach may feel upset, so keep your cat’s diet as regular as possible. Don’t give your cat milk; cats can’t digest it."

Keep your cat inside and confined in a small room, away from other animals (including other cats) or small children. [6] X Research source Remove cat trees, perches, and other furniture that your cat may enjoy jumping on. Keep your cat in a kennel or crate when you are not able to supervise them, and prevent them from using the stairs, if possible.

They’ll likely feel nauseous, out-of-sorts, and irritable, so place their bed or kennel in a quiet, comfortable room away from other cats, animals, and small children. Keep food and water close by, and be sure to dim the lights in the room—they may be disoriented due to anesthesia. Make sure that you can still see your cat from its resting place. Block off any dangerous hiding spots or spots that you can’t easily access. If your cat doesn’t have a comfortable bed, make them a bed by lining a cardboard box with a soft blanket. If you can, put your cat's bed in an area with tile or wood floors. Cats enjoy cooling off their abdomens by stretching out on cool, solid floors, and this may help soothe the surgical site. If possible try to keep the bed low, and prevent them from having to jump a whole lot."
