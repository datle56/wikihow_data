[2] X Research source You will have much better look getting a refund for airline tickets if you cancel them within 24 hours; with Kayak, it's best to cancel by midnight of the same day you booked the reservation.

      "content": "Read the terms and conditions. Before you purchase anything from any online site, including KAYAK, thoroughly read the terms and conditions. KAYAK has an entire page of them. [6] X Research source For example, KAYAK makes it clear that you must abide by the terms and conditions of the air carriers and other organizations it connects you with through its site. That means those specific rules can make a difference as to whether you will get all of your money back. So figure out if they are acceptable to you before you book. Since KAYAK is a middleman for many different hotels, car rental companies, and airlines, it's impossible to provide one set of rules."

Before booking a hotel through KAYAK, read the conditions that are listed next to it. [8] X Research source"
