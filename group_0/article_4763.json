    {
      "title": "Pick an overcast day.",
      "content": "Pick an overcast day. An overcast day is ideal because it will keep the sand cool. Because cool sand is able to hold moisture (water) better, it is much more stable than dry sand, making it ideal for building large sandcastles. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a beach with fine sand.",
      "content": "Choose a beach with fine sand. Fine sand is much more compact (put together) than coarse sand. Compact sand provides more structure and stability. To test the compactness of a beachâ€™s sand, ride a bike on the beach. If it is relatively easy to ride the bike, then the sand is perfect. [2] X Research source If you don't have a bike, then press a ball of sand in your hand. Roll the ball around. If the sand sticks together after rolling it around, then it is perfect."

      "title": "Add equal parts water to the sand if it is too dry.",
      "content": "Add equal parts water to the sand if it is too dry. If you have a bucket of sand, add a bucket of water to it. By adding water to the sand, you can transform it into workable sand. [3] X Research source If the sand is really dry, then add more water. Press the sand into a ball in your hand and roll it around. If the sand holds it shape, it is ready to use."

      "title": "Pick a spot 1 foot (0.30 m) above the high-tide water line.",
      "content": "Pick a spot 1 foot (0.30 m) above the high-tide water line. A spot just above the high-tide water line is ideal because it is close to the water. This will make retrieving water from the ocean much easier. Additionally, choosing a spot above the high-tide will protect your sandcastle from approaching waves. [4] X Research source The high-tide line is typically marked by seaweed and other ocean debris."

      "title": "Outline an area as big as you want your sandcastle to be.",
      "content": "Outline an area as big as you want your sandcastle to be. If you want your sandcastle to be 5 by 5 feet (1.5 by 1.5 m), then outline a 5 by 5-foot area. Use a stick or shovel to mark the outside perimeters. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Pile 6 inches (15 cm) of sand evenly over the entire area. Use large buckets, shovels, and garden spades to pile the sand over the entire area. For the best results, use sand that is located below the tide line. This sand is typically wet and compact. [6] X Research source Alternatively, mix one part sand with one part water in a bucket. Use this sand to create your base."

      "content": "Pour water into the sand to make it compact. Use a stick to poke a grid of holes into the base of sand. Slowly pour buckets of water over the entire base. Let the water drain all the way through the sand. [7] X Research source Pour one bucket of water for every 1 foot (0.30 m) of sand. If the sand still feels too loose or dry, then add more water."

By removing the bottom of the bucket, it will be easier to lift the bucket off of the sand. [10] X Research source If you do not want to remove the bottom yourself, then ask the hardware store if they can do it for you. Alternatively, use a regular bucket without the bottom removed if you do not have a 1 gallon (3.8 l) bucket. You can purchase 1 gallon (3.8 l) buckets, saws, and sandpaper from your local hardware store."

Once you have reached your desired height, use a sand wedge hoe or a plastic knife to smooth the surface of the sand flat. [13] X Research source Large sandcastles are typically 5 by 5 feet (1.5 by 1.5 m) or bigger. If you plan to build a sandcastle taller than you, then bring a step ladder to the beach so you can reach the top."

Repeat this pattern throughout to create an off-set brick pattern. [19] X Research source You can also use the toothpick to create other cool patterns or designs on your sandcastle, like a diamond pattern or flower pattern.
