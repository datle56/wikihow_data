Turn your head about 10 to 15 degrees away from the camera - your chin and jawline will appear much stronger, and you will have a candid look in the photo. You can tilt your head down slightly too for a similar effect. This helps to bring focus away from your face and highlights your chin."

Try to find clothes that go well with clothes you already own, and don’t be afraid to try something different. Sometimes, variety is the spice of life. Clothes can be the easiest way to improve your appearance in general, but will not always be enough to make you photogenic.
