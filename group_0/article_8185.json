      "content": "Make sure you have the right supplies. Before skimming and brushing your pool, take stock of your supplies. Make sure you have everything you need. Make sure you have a telescopic pole. Most pool cleaning supplies attach to a pole like this, so having one available helps. You might want to wipe off the pole to make sure it's free of any debris that could potentially contaminate your pool. [1] X Research source A leaf skimmer or skimmer net is an important pool cleaning tool. This is a small net that attaches to the telescopic pole. You use this net to remove leaves and other debris from the surface of your pool. As with any pool cleaning supplies, leaf skimmers should be cleaned out on occasion. [2] X Research source Make sure you have a pool brush. This is a device used to clean the sides, ladders, and steps of your pool. Brushes can get clogged with dust and debris, so make sure you rinse out your pool brush periodically to make sure it's clean. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Skim the surface of your pool with a leaf skimmer. The first step to cleaning your pool is to skim its surface with the leaf skimmer. In fact, this should be done on a day-to-day basis to make sure the pool's surface is free of any contamination. This is a fairly easy part of pool maintenance. Attach the skimmer to the telescopic pole to start. Then, use the net to pull out debris. Things like leaves and other foliage frequently fall into outdoor pools. Simply use the net skimmer to remove any foreign bodies you see at the top of the pool's water."

This should be done on a weekly basis. Simply attach the pool brush to the telescopic pole and run it over these areas, using some force to remove grime when necessary. Keep in mind areas with poor water circulation, such as stairs, may need more attention. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Select a pool vacuum.",
      "content": "Select a pool vacuum. A pool vacuum is used to clean the floors of a swimming pool. There are different types of pool vacuums depending on your type of pool and personal needs. Automatic cleaners come in three types. Suction side cleaners are not recommended as they often accidentally suck up things like rocks, which can harm your pool's filtration system. Pressure side cleaners attach to the return jet of your pool filtration system and work by removing debris from filtered water and placing it in a removable bag. However, this requires you to do some filtering. The most efficient automatic cleaner is a robotic pool cleaner. These self-contained units drive around the bottom of your pool collecting debris. The only downside, however, is they tend to be costly. [5] X Research source You can save money by using a manual pool vacuum. You can buy a manual pool vacuum online. You may also find one for sale at a hardware shop. The vacuum should come with instructions for set up and use. [6] X Research source"

For a manual vacuum, there is usually a way to attach the vacuum's head to the telescopic pole. You will then slowly lower the vacuum head into the pool. You should then feed the hose into the pool. Make sure all air is removed from the hose before attaching it to the pump that comes with most manual vacuum cleaners. Attaching the pump to the hose before the air has been expelled can harm the pump. Vacuums should always come with individual manufacturer's instructions. If you're unsure how to use a vacuum pump, there is usually a number on the box you can call with questions."

      "content": "Test the water's pH levels. There are chemicals in pool water that help maintain a pool's cleanliness. Factors like weather and use can affect chemical levels. You should test the pH levels at least three times a week to make sure the pool is safe to use. You can buy a pH tester at a local supermarket. You should read reviews of different brands before making a purchasing decision to make sure you're buying a reliable brand. Once you've selected a tester, use this to check your pool's pH levels. The pH level of your pool should be between 7.2 and 7.8. Depending on how users chlorinate their pool, they may find that attempting to maintain a pool with a low pH will bring frequent acid additions. If you're frequently adding acid you may want to look into lowering your Total Alkalinity(TA) level. If it your pH is outside these ranges, use either pH reducer or pH increaser . Apply as needed to bring your pool to the proper pH range. [9] X Research source"

For starters, there will likely be a layer of scum on the surface of the pool. Do not use a skimmer to remove debris as this will stir scum into the water and make the pool look worse. Instead, use a leaf net to remove debris from the pool surface. If you do not have a leaf net, you can purchase one at a local hardware store. [13] X Research source"

Test and adjust the water's pH levels. When attempting to clear a green pool you may find it best to first lower your pH to 7.2. This is in part because many pH tests are invalid at high chlorine levels. It will probably take a few days, and some trial and error with pH reducer and increaser, to get the pH levels to a safe level. In addition to pH reducer and increaser, you may need to add alkalinity increaser to the pool. [14] X Research source Again, a good pH level is between 7.2 and 7.8 however when cleaning a green pool it's best to lower pH to 7.2. You need to shock the pool. It is likely very dirty and might need quite a few gallons of pool shock, administered over the course of a few days, to get the water back to safe levels for swimming. Start off by adding 3 or 4 gallons. See if the pool water has, by morning, changed cloudy white, light green, or clear. If it has not, add another 3 to 4 gallons and wait until 24 hours. Repeat this process until the water has changed color. [15] X Research source"

[16] X Research source Have your filtration system checked if the pool does not clear up in 4 to 5 days. This could be a sign something is wrong with your filtration system.
