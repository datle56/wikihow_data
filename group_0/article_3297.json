Those two traits, as well as eloquence, charm, and a strong work ethic will help build up your character in people's eyes. Even though you want the majority of people to like you, there will be people who do not. The end goal though is for people to respect you, whether they agree with you or not.

Then, once you know what it is you want to acquire, go after it. [4] X Research source Do not be afraid. If you feel that you have a right to higher wages or respect from others, then don't hesitate. Be prepared to give an answer as to why you want something. You may not always have to negotiate or argue, but you want to be prepared. Speak clearly and firmly when asking. Hesitation is a sign of weakness. Be persistent and don't give up because your perseverance will be respected in the long run. Don't plead or whine because that comes across as weak.

Being alpha female does not mean that you put down other women and degrade them in order to elevate your own status.
