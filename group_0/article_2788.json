      "content": "Get comfortable with yourself and your opinions about life. Everyone has opinions about life, and in many cases, opinions can be humorous to other people. People who are naturally funny are typically willing to find humor in both themselves and their opinions. If you are too uptight or self-conscious, it will be difficult to find humor in such things. [2] X Research source Think about opening up to others by sharing an embarrassing story about yourself. Be cautious, however, as self-deprecating jokes could make you or others feel uncomfortable. Stick with something that is in good taste."

      "content": "Research comedic styles. Different comedic styles appeal to different people. Some people enjoy sarcastic and witty comments, others are good with jokes, some like impressions, and others still enjoy funny actions. All of these are legitimate methods of being funny, but it is best to pick something that fits your personality to be naturally funny. [6] X Research source Anecdotal comedy refers to funny personal stories that may or may not be embellished. Dry humor is delivered with no expression and matter-of-fact, while the material itself is very funny. Hyperbolic comedy is characterized by massive exaggeration. Ironic comedy is when the meaning of the joke is the opposite of the actual meaning."

      "content": "Practice being funny. Make it your goal to say or do something that makes someone laugh once a day. A good sense of humor does not emerge overnight, and professional comedians often spend years developing their unique style. By starting small, you will be on your way to being naturally funny in general conversation. Do not be afraid to share something you think is funny. While others will not always understand your humor, you can use their reactions to help improve your style, content, and timing. Reflect on what makes you laugh. If you find something funny, share it with a friend who you think will find this funny as well. Share a funny episode from a movie, television show, book or comic strip."

      "content": "Feel out your audience. Be aware of what kind of people you are speaking with, and what makes them laugh. Remember that just because you think something's funny, it does not necessarily mean that the people around you will. You need to know your audience before you can make them laugh! Be aware that humor changes with age. [7] X Research source Older individuals are less likely to laugh at sexual or aggressive types of humor, while the right younger audience may appreciate it. Note that inside jokes, particular group stories, or practical jokes are usually best shared with close friends. You do not want to make someone feel left-out because they don't understand the context. Unless you share similar views, avoid joking about religion or politics.

      "title": "Work on your timing when telling a story or joke.",
      "content": "Work on your timing when telling a story or joke. Professional comedians say timing is everything and key to comic delivery. [10] X Research source Stories and jokes are made more funny when the teller pauses right before the punchline to build drama and anticipation. You can also wait to laugh until a couple seconds after the punchline, that way people can never be sure if you are joking or not. Always give your audience time to laugh before moving on to a different topic. If you notice something funny, do not wait too long to point it out. Seize the moment! Asides, which are sarcastic or funny comments inserted into conversation, work well when delivered quickly. Keep stories short and simple, as too much background or too many tangents will distract the audience."

      "title": "Make jokes at your own expense.",
      "content": "Make jokes at your own expense. Audiences appreciate when you make yourself the target of comedy. It will help them open-up and they will find it easier to laugh at both you and themselves. As a result, people will begin laughing and social anxiety will be reduced. It is not recommended that you begin by making jokes about someone else. If you are with someone who is able to laugh at themselves, you can gently poke fun at them after you have done the same to yourself. Make sure you don't go too far, as this will turn a light-hearted situation into an awkward one."

      "title": "Target well known subjects that won't be harmed.",
      "content": "Target well known subjects that won't be harmed. Poking fun at authority figures, such as politicians, celebrities, or (former) bosses is usually safe. Do not make jokes at the expense of people people who are physically or cognitively disabled, or dealing with a difficult experience such as divorce, death, illness, or sexual assault. A good rule of thumb is to punch up, not down. Making fun of a person or entity in a position of power, e.g. a bully, is punching up. Making fun of a person or entity that lacks power, e.g. an oppressed group, is punching down. Punching up challenges the status quo, while punching down reinforces it."

      "content": "Avoid memorizing and re-telling older jokes. Telling well recited jokes, such as knock-knock jokes or inappropriate jokes, will turn people off to your sense of humor. In addition, trying to tell a joke you heard on TV or found online will appear rehearsed and unnatural. Stick with your own observations."

You also want to be able to grab and keep people's attention, but not because they find you offensive. At work, avoid forms of \"low comedy\" that would be too risky.
