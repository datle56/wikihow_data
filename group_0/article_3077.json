      "content": "Make sure you’re equally mature. This can be a tough one when you’re a teenager. Everyone around you is in the process of maturing, and you’re probably all doing so at different rates. Even so, do your best to pick someone who seems to be at a similar place on that journey as you are. It will ultimately make things easier. [1] X Research source A good way to know if you’re equally mature is to notice how comfortable you feel around this person and how easy they are to talk to. Do you find yourself feeling annoyed by them because they’re immature or because they're condescending and elitist? In both cases, you may be at different levels of maturity. Some people like to say that, “age is just a number.” That’s sometimes true, but age can also be a helpful indicator when you’re trying to tell if a relationship will work out."

      "content": "Share interests. Sharing interests is an important way that people in romantic relationships connect. Of course, you don’t need to have everything in common or like all of the same things, but if you enjoy similar activities, you’ll always be able to find fun things to do together. [2] X Research source Meeting someone through an activity you enjoy can make for a great relationship. You could meet a potential partner in a club, student government, or an extracurricular activity. Similar values or backgrounds can also bring you together. For example, a person who loves sports can still be with a person who loves art if they both have similar religious or spiritual practices."

      "title": "Look for someone with self-awareness.",
      "content": "Look for someone with self-awareness. This one can be tough when you’re a teen, since not everyone is going to be mature enough to have self-awareness. Self-awareness means that a person has some conscientiousness about their behavior and their effect on others. They’re able to look at themselves honestly and critically and make changes, if needed. [3] X Research source A person with self-awareness will have some patience and self-control. They won’t try to rush you or the relationship before you’re ready. Self-awareness helps a person be a better partner because they can see how their actions affect you and the relationship."

      "title": "Choose someone who is respectful.",
      "content": "Choose someone who is respectful. It is important that you find a partner who is respectful and avoid those who might be manipulative or abusive . Early relationships are all about learning, and this is a good time to set your boundaries and understand your rights in a partnership. Abusive people can be very charming, so it's important you learn to look past what a person says and really look at their behavior and how they treat you. Common characteristics of abusers include: extremes in behavior and mood, overly protective and controlling, rigid ideas about gender roles, inflexible and judgmental, intense and codependent, and a tendency to bottle up emotions. If you notice these signs from a person, then they're not someone you should get involved with . As much as you may like them, or feel like they're just misunderstood, this is not a healthy dynamic. Set boundaries about what you will and will not accept in a relationship and stick to them. If the person you're interested in knowingly violates these boundaries and chooses not to respect them, then you should end the relationship."

When you meet someone you’re super excited about, you may want to dive right into a relationship with them. That can be thrilling in the moment, but you may get hurt if the relationship crashes and burns. [5] X Research source Let yourself date for a while before deciding to officially be this person’s girlfriend. If they press the issue, you can be honest. Say something like, “I really like you, which is why I want to take things slowly. I want to make sure that if I’m going to be your girlfriend, I can be a great girlfriend.” You can also say something like, “I really like you, but I'm just not sure if I want to be your girlfriend just yet. I'd like to get to know you a little better if you're really interested.” if that’s how you feel."

      "content": "Learn to compromise. Both you and your partner are going to have to do some compromising for the relationship to work. Figure out what’s important to you and communicate about that. Keep in mind, however, that it’s important to know the difference between healthy and unhealthy compromises. [6] X Research source For example, if dance is important to you, you could say: “Dance is important to me, and it would mean a lot if you could come to my recitals.” You should do the same for your partner in return by supporting their hobbies. If they attend your dance recitals, then cheer them on during their sports game. You may have to compromise on dates. For example, you could see his choice of movie, but then go to the restaurant that you want."

      "content": "Stay faithful. This one is crucial for a healthy relationship. If you’ve committed to being someone’s girlfriend, that generally means that you’ve committed to being romantic only with them until you break up. Avoid flirting or otherwise being romantic with other people. [7] X Research source Some people prefer open relationships where it’s okay to be romantic or sexual with more than one person. This takes a lot of maturity and communication from all parties. Never assume a relationship is open without talking about it first. Though flirting with someone else is not technically cheating, it can make some people jealous. Avoid doing this in front of your partner out of respect. If you find yourself tempted to cheat, you may not be ready for a relationship, or this may not be the right person for you right now."

Sometimes, something will happen in your relationship and you’ll just want to vent or gush to the whole world; however, remember that things that end up on social media can be seen by tons of people, sometimes forever. [14] X Research source Even if you want to let the world know how wonderful and sweet your partner is, tone it down. They might get embarrassed or have seen the gesture as something private. Likewise, if you had a big fight or they did something that upset you, don't tell the whole world about that, too. That could make things even worse."

If you want to share something from your relationship with friends, ask your partner about it first, as it could be private. If they’ve said something like, “This is just between us,” then it's definitely not something you should share."
