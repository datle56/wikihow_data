      "title": "Start out small.",
      "content": "Start out small. If you are a beginner in gymnastics, you need to build up your flexibility gradually over time. Begin in a way in which you feel most comfortable and slowly develop yourself one step at a time. Try some gentle stretches, such as the side stretch. Stand with your feet together and lace your fingers together. Raise your arms over your head and focus on lengthening your torso as well as your arms and legs. Gently lean to one side, and hold for 10 seconds. Return to the starting position then repeat on the other side. Stretch your legs by standing an arm's length away from a wall. Keep your arms straight and rest your hands on the wall, then bring one foot back, keeping it straight. Let your front knee bend and hold the stretch for 10 seconds. Return to the starting position then repeat with the opposite leg."
