First impressions aren’t always reliable when it comes to dating, which is why experts recommend getting to know someone before going steady. [1] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Think of the 3-month rule as a 90-day job evaluation. During this period, you date your partner while questioning their character, personality, values, and habits to see if they’d be a good match for you. The rule is a way to lower your expectations and examine any red flags that may pop up before making things exclusive. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mental Health Foundation UK charity working towards good mental health for all. Go to source Most couples prefer to keep things strictly hands-free, saving sex for after the probation period. This way, couples can focus on their emotional chemistry rather than their physical connection. However, the rule isn’t matter-of-fact, as everyone has a different idea of what can happen during the 90 days—it all depends on you and your partner’s personal preferences. For instance, some couples will announce that they're dating during the trial period, while others prefer to keep things on the down low until the 90 days are up."

      "content": "Examine what you want and need in a relationship. Before starting a relationship and following the 3-month rule, it’s important to distinguish what you desire in a partner. Wants and needs are different things, and having an idea of what you’re looking for can help you find the perfect partner. [3] X Research source Wants include a person’s job, traits, and physical attributes. For instance, you may want a partner who has a stable career, comes across as mysterious, and is taller than you. Needs are the qualities and values you seek in a person. For example, maybe you need a partner with a strong work ethic looking to raise a family."

      "content": "Discuss boundaries with your partner. Tell your partner about the 3-month rule and what you expect from them. Basically, what can you both do and not do during the 90 days? Can you see other people? Is sex off the table? Lay down the ground rules before the 3 months start to make sure you’re both on the same page. Along with this, discuss what will happen if one of you breaks a rule during the 90 days. Perhaps the relationship ends, or you restart the 3-month trial period."

Spend the weekends together, meet up after work for dinner and a movie, or just walk around the mall and chat. The more time you spend together, the better you’ll be able to tell if they’re the right match for you. Pay attention to what your partner likes and dislikes, then plan a date around their interests. [4] X Research source For instance, if they mention that their favorite flower is a sunflower, take them to a sunflower farm. Ask them questions like, “What makes you laugh the most?” “What makes you feel fulfilled?” and, “What’s your love language?”"

Are you able to communicate openly during an argument? Pay attention to what you like and dislike about your partner’s behavior and tendencies.

Common red flags include: [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source They struggle to make commitments.

Common green flags in a relationship include: [6] X Research source They show kindness and empathy. They have the will to learn and grow with you. They apologize and admit when they’re wrong.

Own your worth—you deserve a partner who’ll treat you like a king or queen, so don’t hesitate to turn down anyone who will make you feel like anything but. Build confidence and raise low self-esteem by saying positive things about yourself.

Share how you’re feeling in the current moment—don’t be afraid to be vulnerable. After all, having good communication is the key to a lasting relationship. [9] X Research source Speak clearly and use an even tone when communicating, even in an argument. This way, you can stay level-headed while getting your point across effectively. [10] X Research source Use “I” statements to express how you’re feeling. For instance, you may say, “I like when you kiss me awake in the morning,” or “I feel like our relationship isn’t progressing. Could we talk about it?” Believe it or not, nonverbal body language plays a big part in communication. Crossing your arms typically means you’re closed off and not open to a conversation, while maintaining eye contact is a great way to say, “Hey, I’m listening.”"

That means no TV or phones—put all your attention on them. Try to avoid interrupting them while they talk.

The honeymoon phase typically lasts 6 months to 2 years and makes you feel like you’re on Cloud 9 24/7.
