      "title": "Keep the action figures away from direct sunlight.",
      "content": "Keep the action figures away from direct sunlight. UV light can be extremely damaging for plastic toys and the packaging of most figures. Never place your figures in direct sunlight, and keep them away from windows when they’re in storage. The combination of heat and UV light can harm the plastic and cause paint to peel. [1] X Research source When storing your figures, try to find a windowless room. If the room does have a window, make sure your figures are facing away from it."

      "title": "Store your figures at room temperature in a dry area.",
      "content": "Store your figures at room temperature in a dry area. When looking for a storage space, find a room that has a fairly steady temperature around 70 °F (21 °C). If you’re concerned about the humidity of the room, use a hygrometer to check that the humidity is around 35-45%. Extreme changes in temperature and humidity can be especially damaging for figures that are still in their original packaging. Closets and cupboards are normally great places for storing an action figure collection. If you have a finished basement, you can also store them there, as long as it doesn’t get too cool or damp."

      "title": "Purchase sealed storage containers for your most valuable figures.",
      "content": "Purchase sealed storage containers for your most valuable figures. For collectibles worth over $100, buy a sealed glass storage container. Open the container and carefully position your figure inside. Then, close the container and seal it according to the directions. The container will protect it from dust and dampness. Keep in mind that sealed containers will not protect your figures from changes in temperature or exposure to sunlight. Be sure to keep this in mind when storing your collectibles. Normally, you can find these containers online through websites that specialize in storing collectibles. However, if you have a store that specializes in storage solutions near you, try calling them to see if they have any in stock."

      "title": "Use a display case if you have a large collection.",
      "content": "Use a display case if you have a large collection. Many collectors like to keep their action figures on display. Look for a case that has glass doors to protect your figures while still showing them off. Position your figures on the shelves so that they’re visible but not overly crowded, which can damage them and make organization harder. Some collectors use bookcases with detachable glass doors to store their figures. Keep in mind that glass will not protect the action figures from changes in temperature and exposure to sunlight. If your shelving doesn’t have protective doors, be sure to monitor the temperature and humidity in the room, and keep your figures away from sunlight."

      "content": "Get plastic shell cases for a cheaper alternative. If you want to display and protect your figures but don’t want to spend a lot of money, acrylic and plastic shell cases are the perfect solution. Normally, they open on a hinge, and you can insert your figure into the case. Then, close the case and position the container on a shelf. Be sure to keep the containers away from direct sunlight and store them at room temperature."

      "title": "Use resealable containers for more common figures.",
      "content": "Use resealable containers for more common figures. For figures that you use often and don’t have packaging, place them in clean resealable containers, such as plastic takeout containers or large storage bins. These will protect your figures from dust and dampness, but allow you to store many figures at once. If most of your figures are outside of their packaging, be sure to wrap them in cloth or place them in resealable bags to prevent them from hitting against each other in the container."

      "title": "Dust your figures once per month with canned air and a brush.",
      "content": "Dust your figures once per month with canned air and a brush. The first step to keeping your figures clean is removing dust regularly. Start by dusting the shelves with a duster if they’re on display, and then use a soft bristle brush, such as a makeup brush or paint brush, to remove particles from your figures and packaging. For delicate figures, spray them with pressurized air to remove the dust without touching them. [2] X Research source You can find pressurized air at most grocery or department stores. If you want to buy a few cans at a time, search online retailers like Amazon to see if you can get a better deal."

      "title": "Use water and effervescent tablets to clean figures without batteries or decals.",
      "content": "Use water and effervescent tablets to clean figures without batteries or decals. Place dirty or sticky plastic figures in a bowl of warm water. Then, drop an effervescent dental tablet into the water, and wait for it to begin bubbling. Once the tablet is about halfway dissolved, flip your figure over in the water to clean the other side. Never place an action figure that has a battery compartment or sticker decals directly into water. This can irreparably damage your figure and can be dangerous to you! The bubbles from the tablet work to “scrub” away the stains and other residue on the plastic. You can find effervescent tablets at most grocery stores in the dental care section, or you can order them online."

      "title": "Rub soap and water on stains if your figures have decals or batteries.",
      "content": "Rub soap and water on stains if your figures have decals or batteries. Make a mixture of 1 cup (240 mL) of water and 1-2 drops of mild dish soap, stirring until bubbles form. Then, dip a cotton swab or microfiber cloth into the water, and remove excess water by squeezing or pinching. Rub the stained area until the mark disappears, and wipe the area with a dry towel to soak up any leftover water. It may take a few sessions of scrubbing for the soap and water to remove the mark completely. Be patient and use more soapy water as needed. Never use water on an area where there is a sticker decal or near the battery compartment of a figure."

      "title": "Use isopropyl alcohol to remove ink and other stains.",
      "content": "Use isopropyl alcohol to remove ink and other stains. Dip a cotton swab into 70-90% isopropyl alcohol, and then dab the alcohol over the mark. Keep dabbing until the mark disappears, and then wipe the area with a damp towel to rinse it. Dry your figure with a towel and inspect the area to make sure there is no discoloration. Leaving the alcohol on your figure can cause extreme discoloration. Be sure to rinse it completely before putting it into storage."

      "title": "Remove the batteries when you aren’t using your figures.",
      "content": "Remove the batteries when you aren’t using your figures. Battery acid leaks are dangerous and can damage your figures. Each time you use a figure, remove the batteries before storing it for any period of time. If you forget this step, remove the batteries as soon as possible to prevent leaks, which happen over long periods of time. If you open the battery compartment of a figure and see a crystallized, white residue, put it down and put on a pair of rubber gloves. Then, clean the build up and corrosion with the proper chemicals for that type of battery."

      "title": "Wear gloves whenever you have to handle your collection.",
      "content": "Wear gloves whenever you have to handle your collection. To prevent oils from your hands from transferring onto your figures and degrading the plastic, put on a pair of cloth gloves before you touch them. If your figure has a base, try to hold it by the bottom as much as possible to prevent damage to the top portion. If you don’t have a pair of gloves available, use a microfiber cloth or a clean towel to handle your figures. This will act as a thick barrier and protect the plastic."

      "title": "Consider getting insurance for your collection.",
      "content": "Consider getting insurance for your collection. If you have an extensive collection, you might want to contact an insurance company to appraise and insure the collection in case of accidental damage or a natural disaster. To get an insurance policy, make sure you have a detailed list of which figures are in the collection, pictures of each figure, receipts, or some other proof of purchase for each figure. Depending on which insurance company you use, they might also require that the figures are kept in a safe, protected environment. If you own a house, you may be able to extend your homeowner’s insurance to include your collection. Call your agent to ask if this is possible."
