You can usually find the default IP address, username, and password on either the side of the router or somewhere in the user manual. Note that the manual may only have the default IP address. It does not always have the default password. The side of the router, on the other hand, will almost always have all necessary pieces of information. The default for most routers is 192.168.1.1 . This is true of Linksys, Actiontec, and VersaLink routers, as well as many others. The default can vary from this, however. For AT&T routers, the default is usually 192.168.1.254 . For WRP400, the default IP is 192.168.15.1 ."

The electronic manual will only give you the default IP address. It will not work if you have changed your router's IP address at some point. To find the electronic version of your router's manual, you will first need to do an Internet search for the manufacturer's website. From there, use the website's search or browse tools to navigate to the manuals for any routers it creates and look through the results until you find the manual that corresponds to your router's model number."

You will be given a list of models under that manufacturer. Locate yours and take a look at the username and password sections of the chart to determine what your router's defaults are. For NetGear, LinkSys, Actiontec, and VersaLink routers, the default username is usually admin . Note that some routers, like Belkin routers, do not have usernames.

If you changed your log-in information for your router but cannot find it, the only practical thing to do is to reset your router so that its information returns to those defaults. For most routers, you can reset the IP address by pressing the \"Reset\" button on the back of the router box for 30 seconds. Usually, to reach this reset button, you will need to use a toothpick, unwound paper clip, a small screwdriver, or other small pointed object to reach into a protective hole and press the button inside. Resetting the router will erase any special settings you have created. Your password and username will be reset, as well."

If you have a PDF version of your router's user manual, you might be able to do a search for \"password\" and find the information about where to change your password among the search results. The difficult part about searching for the word \"password\" in the PDF manual is that there are many passwords associated with your router, and you may get many results that do not relate to the password you are looking for. For instance, the log-in password is not the same as the PPoE password, PPTP password, or L2TP password, nor is it the same as the password for your wireless network."

A good idea is to write it on an index card and to tape it to the side of your router. Along with your password, consider writing down your username and IP address so that you will not need to go searching for these pieces of information again, either."
