      "title": "Pull the brush head off of your Quip.",
      "content": "Pull the brush head off of your Quip. Hold the Quip in your hands so the brush bristles face away from you. Make sure one of your hands is holding the brush head and the other is holding the handle. Place your thumb on the dots on the back of the toothbrush and firmly pull the toothbrush apart to access the battery. [1] X Research source Don’t bend the brush head or handle straight back since you could damage the toothbrush and make it unusable."

      "title": "Remove the motor and old battery from the toothbrush.",
      "content": "Remove the motor and old battery from the toothbrush. The motor is the part of your Quip sticking out from the handle after you remove the brush head. Place your thumbnail in the small notch on the front of the motor and pull it out from the handle. Then, flip the handle upside down and tap it into your palm so the battery comes out. [2] X Research source If you aren’t able to get your thumbnail in the small notch, you can also grab the plastic wings on the side of the motor and pull it out. Don’t use other tools on your Quip since you could easily damage it."

      "title": "Slide the negative end of a AAA battery into the toothbrush.",
      "content": "Slide the negative end of a AAA battery into the toothbrush. Grab a new AAA battery and hold it upright so the flat negative side is face-down. Put the new battery into the Quip so the negative side is on the bottom and the positive side faces up. Tap the bottom of the Quip on a tabletop so the battery goes completely into the handle. [3] X Research source You can use a standard AAA battery bought from the store or the battery that comes with your replacement brush head when you get one. A battery should last about 3 months in your Quip if you use it regularly."

      "title": "Put the motor back into the brush.",
      "content": "Put the motor back into the brush. Hold the motor so the arrow next to the battery symbol points down so you know you’re inserting it the right way. Set the motor in the Quip handle and push it down until it won’t go any further. It’s okay if the motor slightly springs back up. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Push the brush head back onto the toothbrush until it clicks.",
      "content": "Push the brush head back onto the toothbrush until it clicks. Align the head of the Quip so the “Q” symbol faces the front of the toothbrush. Press the brush head into the handle until you hear it click. Press the “Q” symbol to turn on your Quip and test the new battery to make sure it works. Use a new brush head if your old one is over 3 months old. That way, your brush stays fresh. If your Quip doesn’t work after you change the battery, then you may need to take it apart again and look for any problems."

    {
      "title": "Try a different battery if the Quip doesn’t turn on.",
      "content": "Try a different battery if the Quip doesn’t turn on. Take your Quip apart again and remove the battery you just put in. If the first battery doesn’t work, set a different battery inside the handle to test it. Make sure the flat negative side of the battery points down when you insert it into the handle. Put the Quip back together and turn it on again to see if it works. You can also try testing the battery that didn’t work in a different electronic device, such as a TV remote, to see if it works there."

      "title": "Push the base of the motor onto the body so there are no gaps.",
      "content": "Push the base of the motor onto the body so there are no gaps. Remove the motor from your Quip and check if there is any gap between the base on the bottom and the main body. If there is, then set the bottom of the motor on a hard surface and push down on the body to close the seam. Put the motor back into the toothbrush and test it to see if it’s working. If the base and body of the motor already have a tight seal, then something else may be wrong with your toothbrush."

      "title": "Send pictures to the Quip help site if you still don’t know why it’s not working.",
      "content": "Send pictures to the Quip help site if you still don’t know why it’s not working. Put your Quip on a flat, well-lit surface and take a picture of it. Then, fully disassemble the toothbrush and take another picture of the components together. If there’s any damage to the pieces, make sure you can clearly see it in the photo. Send the pictures along with your problem and order number to the Quip support site so they can see the problem and possibly send you a free replacement. The support email for Quip is: help@getquip.com. You must have an account with Quip if you want to be covered by a warranty and get replacement parts."
