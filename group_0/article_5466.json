Move the decimal point two places to the left to get the converted decimal. [2] X Research source You can also use the % {\\displaystyle \\%} sign on a calculator. For example, you might want to calculate the sale price of a pair of shoes that is regularly $69.95. If the shoes are 25% off, you need to convert 25% to a decimal by thinking 25 % = 25.00 % = .25 {\\displaystyle 25\\%=25.00\\%=.25} ."

This will tell you the discount, or what value is being taken off the original price. [3] X Research source For example, to find the 25% discount on a pair of $69.95 shoes, you would calculate 69.95 × .25 = 17.49 {\\displaystyle 69.95\\times .25=17.49} ."

      "title": "Subtract",
      "content": "Subtract the discount from the original price. To subtract decimals, line up the decimal points and subtract as you would whole numbers. Be careful to drop the decimal point down into your answer. You can also use a calculator. The difference will be the sale price of the item. [4] X Research source For example, if a pair of shoes that are originally $69.95 have a discount of $17.49, calculate the sale price by subtracting: 69.95 − 17.49 = 52.46 {\\displaystyle 69.95-17.49=52.46} . So, the shoes are on sale for $52.46."

      "content": "Round the original price to the nearest ten. Use normal rounding rules to round up or down. Doing this will make it easier to calculate the percent discount of the number. For example, if the original price of a shirt is $47.89, round the price up to $50.00"

      "content": "Calculate 10 percent of the rounded price. To mentally calculate 10% of a price, think of the price written as dollars and cents with a decimal point. Then, move the decimal point one place to the left. This will show you the number that is equal to 10%. [5] X Research source For example, to calculate 10% of $50, think $ 50 = $ 50.00 = $ 5.00 {\\displaystyle \\$50=\\$50.00=\\$5.00} . So, 5 is 10% of 50."

Don’t worry about fives in the percentage for now. For example, if a shirt is 35% off, you would need to know how many tens are in 35. Since 35 ÷ 10 = 3.5 {\\displaystyle 35\\div 10=3.5} , there are 3 tens in 35."

Since you determined what 10% of the price is, find a larger percent by multiplying by the number of tens. [6] X Research source For example, if you found that 10% of $50 is 5, to find out how much 30% of 50 is, you would multiply $5 by 3, since there are 3 tens in 30: 5 × 3 = 15 {\\displaystyle 5\\times 3=15} . So, 30% of $50 is $15."

It is easy to calculate 5% by simply dividing 10% of the original price by 2, since 5% is half of 10%. For example, if 10% of $50 is $5, then 5% of $50 is $2.50, since $2.50 is half of $5."

For example, if a shirt is 35% off, you first found 30% of the original price was $15. Then you found that 5% of the original price was $2.50. So adding the values of 30% and 5%, you get $ 15 + $ 2.50 = $ 17.50 {\\displaystyle \\$15+\\$2.50=\\$17.50} . So, the estimated discount of the shirt is $17.50."

Multiply the original price by the decimal: 154.88 × .40 = 61.95 {\\displaystyle 154.88\\times .40=61.95} . Subtract the discount from the original price: 154.88 − 61.95 = 92.93 {\\displaystyle 154.88-61.95=92.93} . So, the sale price of the television is $92.93."

      "content": "Estimate the sale price. A tablet is regularly $199.99. On sale, it is 45% off. Round the original price to the nearest ten. Since $199.99 is only 1 cent away from $200, you would round up. Calculate 10% of the rounded price. Moving the decimal one place to the left, you should see that 10% of $200.00 is $20.00. Determine the number of tens in the percent off. Since 10 × 4 = 40 {\\displaystyle 10\\times 4=40} , you know that there are 4 tens in 45%. Multiply 10% of the rounded price by the appropriate factor. Since the percentage off is 45%, you would multiply 10% of the rounded price by 4: $ 20 × 4 = $ 80 {\\displaystyle \\$20\\times 4=\\$80} Calculate 5% of the rounded price. This is half of 10%, which is $20. So half of $20 is $10. Add the remaining 5% to the discount. 40% is $80, and 5% is $10, so 45% is $90. Subtract the discount from the rounded price: $ 200 − $ 90 = $ 110 {\\displaystyle \\$200-\\$90=\\$110} . So the estimated sale price is $110."
