      "content": "Use your US size when buying Canadian shoes. US and Canadian shoe sizes are interchangeable in both men’s and women’s, so you won’t have to do a conversion to switch back and forth. This also means that you can use your Canadian size when doing conversions, since it’s the same as your US size. If you wear a US women’s size 8, for example, you’d wear a size 8 in Canadian women’s as well."

      "content": "Convert from US women’s to men’s sizes by subtracting 1.5. Although exact sizes differ between shoe brands, US women’s shoes tend to be smaller than men’s by about 1.5 sizes. This means that if a women’s shoe has the same length and width as a men’s shoe, the women’s size will be 1.5 more than the men’s. You can subtract 1.5 from a women’s size to get the men’s equivalent, or add 1.5 sizes to a men’s size to convert to women’s. [1] X Research source For example, if you wear a women’s 9, you’ll wear a 7.5 in men’s. If you wear a men’s 10, you’ll wear a women’s 11.5."

If your US size is a half size, you’ll add 30.5. [2] X Research source For example, if your US women’s size is a 7.5, you’d add 30.5 to get your EU size of 38. If your US size is a 7, add 30 to get your EU size 37. To go from an EU women’s size to a US women’s size, subtract 30 and try on a shoe in that size. Then try on the same shoe in a half size smaller and choose whichever one feels best to you."

These sizes vary a bit more and the conversion might not be exact, but you can approximate your size by adding 16.5 to your US women’s shoe size. For example, if you wear a 10 in US women’s shoes, your Asian women’s shoe size would be around 26.5. This sizing method is used in China and Hong Kong, among other countries."

If you wear a whole size in US shoes, add 33. For example, if you’re an 11.5 in US men’s shoes, you’ll be a 34 in EU shoes.
