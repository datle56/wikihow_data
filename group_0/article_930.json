      "content": "Check your brake pads before you make any adjustments. The brake pads are the pads that clamp down on the front tire of your bike when you pull the brake lever. If the brake pads are worn down past the line labeled “wear line,” you’ll need to replace them before you make adjustments to your brakes. [1] X Research source If the wear lines on your brake pads aren't labeled, they should be marked by grooves on the side of the pads instead. You can order new brake pads online or pick some up at your local bike shop. Jackel provides a key bit of advice: Make sure your wheel lines up correctly in the dropouts as well, or else it won't make good contact with your brakes.

      "content": "Squeeze the brake lever to see where the pads hit the rim. Both brake pads should be coming into contact with the rim of the front tire at the same time. They should be hitting the center of the rim, with an equal amount of space above and below the pad. If the pads are hitting the rim too high or low, they could come into contact with the rubber part of the tire or the spokes on the bike. [3] X Research source Crouch down to get a good look at the brake pads as you're squeezing the brake lever. Jackel says that, if your bike has a quick-release mechanism, check to make sure that it isn't loose or hasn't come undone. Otherwise, your brakes won't squeeze tightly on the wheel. [4] X Expert Source Jonas Jackel Owner, Huckleberry Bicycles Expert Interview. 15 February 2020. “People frequently have the quick release open and they don’t realize it,” continues Jackel. “They think that their brakes need to be adjusted, but they actually just need to close the quick release.” [5] X Expert Source Jonas Jackel Owner, Huckleberry Bicycles Expert Interview. 15 February 2020."

The barrel adjusters are located where the brake cables meet the brake levers. [10] X Research source Loosen the barrel adjuster attached to the loose brake cable by turning it counterclockwise. Loosening the barrel adjuster will actually slightly tighten the brake cable. After you loosen the barrel adjuster, pull the brake lever to see if it fixed the problem. If the brake cable is still too loose, you’ll need to adjust it on the caliper. Leave the barrel adjuster as it is. Don’t tighten it yet."

The brake cable is the thin cable extending off the caliper. Locate the bolt that’s holding the brake cable. Use an Allen wrench to turn it counterclockwise a few times until the bolt is slightly loose. [11] X Research source Don’t unscrew the bolt all the way. Just rotate the Allen wrench counterclockwise 2-3 times until the bolt is loose."

      "content": "Pull the brake cable outward to tighten it. Now that the bolt is loosened, you shouldn’t have any problem pulling the cable. Hold it in place with your fingers once you’ve pulled it taut. As you pull the cable, the brake pads should tighten on the rim of the front tire. You want them to be tight enough that there’s some resistance when you turn the tire, but not so tight that the tire isn’t able to turn at all. [12] X Research source If you can't turn the tire at all, pull less hard on the brake cable so it's not as tight."

Tightening the barrel adjusters will loosen the brake pads that are clamped onto the front tire. Once the barrel adjusters are tightened, your brake cables should be all set! Test the brake cables again by pulling the brake levers. When you pull the levers now, there should be 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) between the lever and the grip on the handlebars."

      "content": "Diagnose the issue by spinning the wheel and looking at the calipers. The process for adjusting hydraulic brakes is identical in the front and the back. Before you tinker with anything, lift the tire up and spin the wheel. Look at the gap between the calipers and the discs. [13] X Research source If the disc rubs against the brake pads: Your brake pads need to be adjusted and you should continue with the remaining steps. If the disc wobbles and doesn’t hit the brake pads: You do not need to adjust your brakes. Your disc needs to be realigned , unbent, or replaced , though. If the disc spins straight and doesn’t hit the brake pads: Your brakes are set up correctly. You can tighten them slightly to make them more sensitive if you’d like, but if they’re working as intended, it’s best to leave them alone."

      "content": "Loosen the mounting bolts on top of the calipers. Unlike traditional brakes, the mounting bolts for hydraulic brakes are typically on top of the calipers. Grab an Allen wrench that matches the size of the bolts and turn each bolt counterclockwise until you can freely jiggle the calipers by hand. [14] X Research source On some fringe models, the mounting bolt is actually underneath the calipers."

The brakes will engage perfectly center with the rotor. [15] X Research source Yes, it’s actually this easy to center hydraulic brakes. Because the hydraulic brakes are a closed system, engaging them while the calipers are loose will force the system to equalize, leaving you with perfectly centered brake pads. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Tighten the mounting bolts while you continue holding the lever down. With the brakes centered, retighten the mounting bolts with the same Allen wrench you used to loosen the calipers. Once your mounting bolt is tight, check your work by spinning the wheel. [17] X Research source If the problem is fixed: Tighten the bolts all the way and use a torque wrench to secure the bolts to the recommended torque (usually 6-8 Nm). If the problem persists: Either the issue isn’t with your brakes (you may have a bent wheel, for example), or your brakes have actually failed. See a professional bike repair shop for help."
