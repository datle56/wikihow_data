      "title": "Gather clay.",
      "content": "Gather clay. You can find clay in veins along the bottom of shallow rivers, swamps or inside of mason houses (plains, savanna, and desert villages). You can break clay blocks with your hand, but using a shovel works best. Breaking clay blocks always drops 4 clay balls, regardless of Fortune."

    {
      "title": "Turn the clay into bricks.",
      "content": "Turn the clay into bricks. Add a clay ball and a fuel source, like coal or planks, to your furnace, to smelt the clay balls into bricks. Make sure you smelt the clay balls, and not the clay block. Smelting the clay block will give Hardened Clay/Terracotta which can't be turned back to normal clay."
    },
    {
      "title": "Craft the bricks.",
      "content": "Craft the bricks. Brick items, need to be crafted into blocks first before they can be used to build with. To do this, place 4 bricks in a 2x2 square in your crafting menu. Bricks (the item not the block) can also be used to craft flower pots."
    },
    {
      "title": "Trading with Villagers.",
      "content": "Trading with Villagers. Alternatively, you can trade emeralds for bricks with a Stone Mason villager instead of gathering the clay yourself. Stone Masons houses can naturally spawn as part of a village, but you can also convert an unemployed villager into a stone mason by placing a Stonecutter close to them. This method is recommended for large projects as less time is spent just looking for clay. For a smaller project like this you shouldn't need to trade with too many villagers, but for a larger build, its a good idea to invest in a trading hall."

If you want a fireplace escape route make the fireplace either 2x1x3 or 2x2x3 (these dimensions are: height x width x length/back) with a hallway that leads somewhere safe (like a hidden bunker) and a minecart behind where the flame will be.(it will work even if the fire is... flaming, but just in case dig a 1x1 hole in the hall and place a bucket of water)"
