      "content": "Use a sharp knife. It may seen counterintuitive at first, but a sharp knife is safer than a dull blade. Dull knives not only mash instead of slice into foods, they slip more easily, especially on round, slick foods like onions. But dull knives are still plenty sharp enough to cut you."

      "content": "Do it the easiest and safest way if you're not an expert. Many chefs and experienced cooks chop onions in part by making horizontal slices parallel to the cutting board -- and under their hands and towards their wrists. It works quite well when done properly, but can also cause serious injury if you make a mistake. For the home cook, then, especially if you're a little wary about having a sharp knife in your hand, stick to the methods listed below. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Let the onion do some of the work for you. Onions are built a bit like the earth -- ever-larger spherical layers surrounding a core -- except with the North and South poles (the stem and root ends) holding everything together. The onion wants to come apart once you start cutting into it, so if you attack it in the right way this falling apart will do much of the chopping for you."

Hold the onion with your free hand, pierce it with the tip of the knife near the root end, then push the rest of the knife down through the onion. Leave enough of the root end intact to hold the onion together. Make parallel cuts across the onion at the width you desire -- roughly 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.6 cm) is usually considered \"chopped.\""

If you find it difficult to make cuts this thin, you can run through a pile of chopped or diced onions with your knife. Pile up your diced onions in a mound on the board. Pin the tip of your knife to the cutting board with your free hand and rock the knife up and down through the mound. (If you ever used, or saw your teacher use, one of those big paper cutters in school, you'll have an idea of the cutting motion.) Re-pile the onion pieces as needed."

Ventilate the area with a fan. Chew gum, or hold water, a bread stump, or a teaspoon in your mouth."
