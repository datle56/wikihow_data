This hole will be used for your spigot , so make sure to use a drill bit that’s a little bit smaller than or the same size as the spigot. [1] X Research source Make sure that your garbage can is clean, and that it wasn’t used to store any hazardous materials that could potentially contaminate your rainwater. Food-grade plastic containers are also great to consider for a rain barrel. [2] X Research source Alternative: Feel free to buy a premade rain barrel if you don’t have the time or equipment to make your own. Before you set it up, make sure that it comes with a screen, overflow tube, and hose. [3] X Research source"

Apply a thick layer of waterproof sealant over the rubber washer, insert the spigot into the hole, and let it dry for as long as instructed on the package. [4] X Research source Once the sealant is dried, secure it on the inside of the barrel by sliding on another rubber washer and metal washer. If you don’t have any waterproof sealant, use watertight Teflon tape ."

Use a box cutter to cut the collection hole, and make it big enough to accommodate the water flow from your downspout. Place it near the side of the lid, following the curve, so it can fit comfortably against the wall of your house. [5] X Research source Place the barrel under your downspout and make a mark on the lid for the hole location. Don’t place the hole too close to the center of the lid; if your downspout is against the side of your house, there won’t be enough room for you to place the hole directly under it."

      "content": "Make a second hole to release overflow. Suppose the barrel collects a lot of rain. In that case, it’ll need an overflow opening to release the extra water. Using your drill or box cutter, cut 1-2 smaller holes in the lid to accommodate this extra flow. [6] X Research source If you want to collect the overflow water, build a second rain barrel. Run a short length of hose or PVC pipe from the second barrel to the overflow hole in the first barrel to allow the extra water to run through."

Before you secure the garbage can lid, cut a large piece of landscaping fabric or metal screening and place it over the entire opening. Cut it large enough that about 1 ft (30 cm) of fabric sticks out over the can. Then, attach the lid to secure it in place. [7] X Research source Landscaping fabric is made of a fine mesh, which will allow water to pass through while keeping out mosquitoes and other pests."

[8] X Expert Source Mike Garcia Licensed Landscape Contractor Expert Interview. 20 November 2020. To make it more convenient to use, create a small platform of bricks or another solid, durable material and set the barrel on top. [9] X Research source This will give you more room to fill up water cans or buckets of water. [10] X Research source Thoroughly clean your gutters before collecting rainwater from your downspout. If you want to connect a hose to the spigot, raising the barrel a bit will also give you more water pressure. Place a rain barrel underneath each downspout to collect more rainwater. If you use your water for gardening, you can pour it out of the spigot as-is. If you plan to use it for cooking, drinking, or cleaning, filter it first."

Drape a large piece of tarp over this dirt section and weigh down the edges with rocks to protect it from the wind. Run a drainpipe from the lowest corner of the tarp to the collection tank—an IBC tote tank or rain barrel works well for this. Seal the pipe's entry point through the tarp with a waterproof sealant to make the connection secure. [11] X Research source Use corner pipe attachments if you need to lift the water into the tank; the pressure should be high enough to pump it upwards on its own. Set up a screen over the entry point of the tank to prevent bugs and debris from getting into your water supply. [12] X Research source"

If you plan to use it indoors to provide drinking water for pets, livestock, or humans or use it for showering or bathing, to run a dishwasher or washing machine, or for a utility sink, make sure you filter it first!
