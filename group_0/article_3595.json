Consider working with a trainer who works specifically with models. Tell him about your modeling goals and how you want to look, and ask for a tailored exercise regimen that will support those goals. Eat the right foods and the right amounts. Contrary to what some people tell you, you should eat healthy foods, as well as healthy amounts of food. Veggies, fruits, whole grains, healthy fats, and proteins should make up the basics of your diet. Sugars, starches, empty carbohydrates, and unhealthy fats should be avoided as much as possible. Be sure to drink a lot of water. Avoid sodas (even diet sodas) and minimize your alcohol intake. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Match your modeling goals to your body type. Technically, anybody can be a model. However, if you don't meet certain requirements, the work available to you will be incredibly limited or you may have to compensate in other areas (reliability, technique, etc). A Plus-Sized Model : If your body is full and curvaceous, you may be able to be a plus size model. A Runway Model : Most women on the catwalk are at least 5'8 and commonly small-breasted. Men are mostly between 5'11 and 6'2. A Print Model : Most editorial female models are at least 5'7, but a beautiful face with great personality are the most important features for print models. An Underwear Model : For women, this requires large breasts but small hips. For men, this requires broad shoulders but slim waists. An Alternative Model : Some agencies hire alternative models: models who do not conform to the industry “standards” of beauty, height, and weight. Additionally, having a specific passion or cause that you're working towards can help open doors that may be closed due based on a body feature that does not “fit industry standards”. [3] X Research source Other Types of Modeling : If you don't fit any of the face or body descriptions, perhaps you can be a foot, hair, or hand model."

      "content": "Consider situational modeling. If you do not think the runway or magazines are the place for you, look into other types of modeling. Companies use models for special events or to promote specific products. There are fewer restrictions on body type and more emphasis on personality for these modeling jobs. A Promotional Model : Some companies want their customer base to interact directly with models who are generally attractive with likable personalities to promote their brand. You may see these models in grocery stores, events, or clubs promoting things like food, liquor, or new products. A Spokesmodel : Spokesmodels are hired to be consistently associated with a specific brand. Contrary to popular thought, spokesmodels don't always have to verbally promote the brand. A Trade Show Model : This type of model is hired by companies or brands to advertise to attendees at a trade show tent or booth. These models are typically not employed by the company but hired as \"freelance\" models for the event."
