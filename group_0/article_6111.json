      "content": "Provide a well-balanced pellet food once the rat is 2 weeks old. All rats over 2 weeks of age need a diet that is relatively low in fiber, high in protein and contains a low percentage of fat. For the first 2 weeks of life, baby rats get all their nutrition from their mother’s milk. [2] X Research source To achieve the right balance of nutrients, offer store-bought pellet food specially formulated for rats. This will ensure that your rat gets all the nutrients and calories needed to survive. [3] X Research source Rat food is often called “rodent block,” as it comes in hard, block-shaped pieces. Buy rat food in some grocery stores, in pet stores, or online."

      "content": "Offer a variety of healthy vegetarian supplements. Young pet rats will benefit from having a range of options to nibble. Small amounts of things like fresh vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, whole grain cereals, and even crackers will supplement your rat’s diet. [4] X Research source Just like humans, rats have individual tastes and some can be picky eaters. Introduce a wide variety of choices until you can determine which ones your rat prefers. Rats can eat meat, but it is not necessary for their overall health and it should not be a staple in your rat’s diet. There are many foods that rats cannot eat, including apple seeds, oranges, and peanuts. Before introducing your rat to a new food, check online to make sure it is not dangerous to rats. Some safe foods to offer your rat include apples, blueberries, grapes, and dried cereal. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Let your rat eat its droppings. This may be an unappetizing habit to watch, but rats are actually supposed to eat their feces. It’s a process called coprophagy and it allows your rat to optimize its absorption of nutrients from its food. [8] X Research source Without this process of ingesting its food twice, rats would be unable to benefit from all the nutrients in their diet."

      "content": "Get your rat a companion of the same sex. Rats are very social creatures and should not be raised alone. To avoid breeding, make sure you get a companion rat of the same sex. They need to grow up around other rats, preferably of the same age, in order to be happy and well-socialized. [9] X Research source Rats become capable of reproducing by 5 weeks of age, so it’s important to learn their sex and keep males from females before they reach this age. To determine your rat’s sex , hold it gently so its underside is visible. Male rats as young as 3 weeks of age have a large and noticeable scrotum, which should help you distinguish them from the females. [10] X Research source"

You should look for a cage that is made of wire that has 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) openings between the bars. [14] X Research source Be wary of cages marketed exclusively for rats, as these can often be too small or of poor quality. Shop for a cage based on its size and wire gauging.

Check for wounds, lumps, and fleas or ticks as you bathe it. Follow-up on any concerning issues with a visit to your vet. When you bathe your rat for the first time, try to do it when the weather is warm so it doesn't get too cold. Use warm water, but not hotter than 100 °F (38 °C). Like any new situation, ease your rat into it using a calm and gentle voice and treats as a lure and reward."
