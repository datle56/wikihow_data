      "title": "If you're not sure what to say to someone grieving their dad, share a quote.",
      "content": "If you're not sure what to say to someone grieving their dad, share a quote. This typically works best in sympathy cards, emails, or text messages, rather than in-person encounters. However, meaningful quotes can also be a great addition to a eulogy if you're speaking at the funeral. Pick a quote that resonates with you, and add it to your handwritten note, digital message, or eulogy to offer some comfort, inspiration, and uplifting energy at this difficult time. “Only people who are capable of loving strongly can also suffer great sorrow, but this same necessity of loving serves to counteract their grief and heals them.” ― Leo Tolstoy [5] X Research source “What is grief, if not love persevering?” — Vision in the TV show WandaVision [6] X Research source “How lucky am I to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.”— A.A. Milne [7] X Research source “Never. We never lose our loved ones. They accompany us; they don’t disappear from our lives. We are merely in different rooms.” — Paulo Coelho [8] X Research source “The pain passes, but the beauty remains.” — Pierre Auguste Renoir [9] X Research source \"And when great souls die, after a period peace blooms, slowly and always irregularly. Spaces fill with a kind of soothing electric vibration. Our senses, restored, never to be the same, whisper to us. They existed. They existed. We can be. Be and be better. For they existed.”— Maya Angelou [10] X Research source “Tis’ better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.” — Alfred Lord Tennyson [11] X Research source “Unable are the loved to die, for love is immortality.” — Emily Dickinson [12] X Research source \"An honest man here lies at rest, the friend of man, the friend of truth, the friend of age, and guide of youth: few hearts like his, with virtue warm'd, few heads with knowledge so inform'd; if there's another world, he lives in bliss; if there is none, he made the best of this.” — Robert Burns [13] X Research source \"Nature’s first green is gold, her hardest hue to hold. Her early leaf’s a flower; but only so an hour. Then leaf subsides to leaf. So Eden sank to grief, so dawn goes down to day. Nothing gold can stay.”— Robert Frost [14] X Research source"
