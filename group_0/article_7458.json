      "content": "Make sure your friends offer emotional support and guidance. Good friends will be willing to support you on a consistent basis, through your high points and your low points. Your friends should offer to support you during any difficult emotional times and be there for you in a real, genuine way. They may also offer guidance and advice when you need it.

      "content": "Determine if you have a good balance of give and take. Good friendships also have a good balance of giving and taking, where you feel mutually supported. You should try to cultivate friendships where there is a balance of give and take, and where you do not feel you are giving or taking more than the other person. [4] X Research source Some people are givers; they'll do anything to help and support someone. Others are takers; they'll take someone else’s time and energy to fulfill their own needs. While natural givers may sound like the way to go, you should actually look for friends who can maintain a balance between both of these two extremes."

      "content": "Decide if your friends bring out the best in you. Your friends should also encourage you to develop into the best version of yourself you can be. They should help you focus on how you can be yourself and achieve your goals. Your friends should act as your own personal cheer squad, where they proudly encourage you to go after what you want.

Follow people you find interesting and comment on their posts or chat with them. Eventually, you may feel comfortable doing this in person."

Friends who use you are only interested in their own personal gains and wins. They may show no interest in your own needs and fail to show up when you need them. [18] X Research source For example, if you get a role in a film, a bad friend may suddenly start paying more attention to you and ask for autographs, which they later sell for gain."

You should also try to rid yourself of friends who are always harping on about the negative aspects of a situation, as this can end up draining you of your energy. You may have friends who only view things from a negative point of view and refuse to focus on the positive aspects. This may then lead you to also adopt a negative point of view and put in you in a permanent state of negativity.

Go to source If your friend is being negative, give them support and try to cheer them up; they may just be having a hard time.
