      "content": "The 80/20 rule says to accept being 80% satisfied with your relationship. The other 20% of your overall satisfaction comes from yourself: your lifestyle, your hobbies, and your career can all play a part. Researchers believe that by keeping your expectations realistic, you open yourself up to more relationships and stop searching for a “perfect” partner. [1] X Research source Plus, the 80/20 rule gives you permission to focus on your own needs, too. Since work, kids, and responsibilities can all distract you from your relationship, it’s a useful tool to help you balance your time well. For instance, your partner might make you feel loved, safe, and happy, but you turn to your family and friends to feel like you’re part of a community. 80% of your needs are being met by your partner, and you’re figuring out the other 20% on your own. When the 80/20 rule is applied to infidelity, the theory is that when someone cheats, they’re attracted to the 20% in someone else that they were missing from their partner. However, they often end up realizing that they were better off with the 80% their partner was already giving them."

      "content": "Satisfy 20% of your own needs and wants. Your romantic partner is great, but they aren’t perfect. There are going to be some emotional needs that they can’t meet, and that’s okay. Focus on meeting those yourself so you can enjoy the 80% that your partner does provide. [2] X Research source For instance, maybe you love spending time with your partner, but you two don’t like the same movies. Once a month, take yourself out on a movie date. Or, maybe you’re a foodie but your partner is pretty picky. Try a new restaurant with friends every other week to satisfy that need within yourself."

      "title": "Spend 20% of your time away from your partner.",
      "content": "Spend 20% of your time away from your partner. In reality, this means taking about 1 night a week for yourself. You might grab drinks with friends, go out in nature on your own, or try a new hobby . Absence makes the heart grow fonder, and taking this time will help you come back to your relationship feeling refreshed and revitalized. [3] X Research source The 80/20 rule helps you maintain your individuality , even while in a relationship. If you spend 80% of your time with your partner and 20% of your time apart, then you’re still doing your own hobbies and maintaining your own friendships. If this is a change in your relationship, be sure to talk to your partner about it first. Say something like, “Hey, I was thinking that on Thursdays, we could each do our own thing after work. That way, we’ll have time for our own hobbies, but we can still make time for each other, too.”"

      "content": "Embrace your partner’s flaws. Loving your partner is easy when it comes to their good qualities, but what about the ones you’re not so happy with? Use the 80/20 rule to remind yourself that if 80% of things are good, then you can let go of the other 20%. [4] X Research source Maybe your partner is super sweet and romantic, but they can often be a little sarcastic. Remember that their flaws make them human, and that 80% of why you love them means you can put up with that sarcastic 20%."

      "content": "Stop searching for the “perfect” relationship. If you’re single and in the dating pool, it’s easy to get stuck in the trap of looking for the perfect person. However, keep the 80/20 rule in mind: as long as you find someone who meets around 80% of your needs, then you can do the other 20% by yourself. This will broaden your horizons and can help you find a good match for you. [5] X Research source Of course, this doesn’t mean that you should lower your standards—if you meet someone who’s truly wrong for you, it’s unlikely that the relationship is going to work out. But if you find yourself thinking about a date you had and wishing it had just been a little bit better, it may be worth the effort."

      "content": "It takes the pressure off of the relationship. You might be wondering: why 80/20, and not 90/10? The truth is that expecting your partner to meet even 90% of your needs adds a lot of pressure to your partnership. When you expect to meet 20% of your own needs, you allow the relationship to be fun and flowing rather than rigid. [8] X Research source"

Sure, your partner might not be giving you that 20%, but they are providing you with an awesome 80%, which is more than enough. [9] X Research source For instance, maybe your partner gives you a lot of love and attention, which makes you feel appreciated and valued. However, they don’t often praise you for your abilities or your achievements. You might trade a sense of achievement for that love and appreciation you do get."

      "content": "In the late 1800s, Vilfredo Pareto came up with the 80/20 rule. Born in Italy and making his career as a philosopher, he noticed that 20% of the pea plants in his garden produced 80% of the peas. When he applied this principle elsewhere, he found that it stood up: in Italy, around 80% of the land was owned by 20% of the population. He then coined the 80/20 rule, also called the Pareto Principle, which states that 80% of the results will come from 20% of the action. [10] X Research source Different cultures use the 80/20 rule in different ways. For instance, in Japan, many people eat until they’re only 80% full to lose weight and stay fit. In business, many people use the 80/20 rule to organize their tasks in order of importance. Dedicating 20% of your time to your most important goals produces 80% of the impact."
