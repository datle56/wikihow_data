      "title": "Mix in different shades of red.",
      "content": "Mix in different shades of red. Bright red shades can look overwhelming if used in every accessory. Instead, use different shades of red to create contrast while staying within an all-red color scheme. You have a lot of options with red, starting on the lighter end spectrum with pinks and light reds, and ranging all the way into super dark shades like wine and burgundy. For instance, you could wear a scarf, shrug or wrap in a shade of red that’s slightly lighter or darker than your dress."

    {
      "title": "Wear burgundy flats, heels or boots.",
      "content": "Wear burgundy flats, heels or boots. This shade is deep enough to mimic the classic look of black, but offers a subtle hint of color. Try wine-red ballet flats with a simple red dress. With a bold dress, amp up the intensity by wearing deep red patent leather pumps. Try pairing a trendy red dress with burgundy booties in leather or suede."

    {
      "title": "Wear jewelry with red gemstones.",
      "content": "Wear jewelry with red gemstones. Choose pieces set with rubies, garnets or deep red Swarovski crystals. Gunmetal settings create a tough look, while silver and gold settings have classic appeal. If you want to take the monochrome theme even further, choose pieces made of rose gold. For instance, pair an iconic little red dress with a ruby or garnet pendant on a delicate silver chain. Add drama with a matching cocktail ring. Restrict your jewelry to one or two small pieces, and avoid any accessory that looks unnecessarily large. Let your red dress be the focal point."

      "title": "Add a belt and carry a purse in the same red shade.",
      "content": "Add a belt and carry a purse in the same red shade. A matching belt and purse in crimson or burgundy leather can add great contrast to your red dress while still creating a classic vibe. Choose a thin belt and smaller purse, like a clutch, so the focus stays on your dress. You can certainly have an ensemble with multiple red pieces, but try to keep the accessories relatively toned down."

      "title": "Be the life of the party by wearing primary colors.",
      "content": "Be the life of the party by wearing primary colors. Carry a handbag with red, yellow, and blue running through it, and match it with blue shoes or simple yellow earrings. Keep your accessories small and low-key to achieve a funky style without looking too busy. This works well for casual and party dresses, but may be too much for a formal or semi-formal occasion. Try wearing a short red skirt with a pair of blue heels or flats. Carry a matching blue clutch. Make a statement with vibrant yellow pointy-toed heels and matching scarf. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for patterns that include red in them.",
      "content": "Look for patterns that include red in them. This works especially well if the shade of red matches the shade of your dress closely. You could wear a scarf with red and violet stripes, or a sash with an abstract print in red and orange. For a retro vibe, look for polka dotted or paisley patterns with red in them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Opt for deep or muted colors over bright hues.",
      "content": "Opt for deep or muted colors over bright hues. Deep shades, like charcoal gray and midnight blue, add color without looking too flashy. Bright colors may compete with a red dress, and could even create a tacky vibe. Deeper shades may be muted in contrast to the red dress, but they can still add a fun pop of color! For instance, throw on a chunky knit scarf and matching lace up ballet flats in deep royal purple."

    {
      "title": "Mix in shades of brown for casual and dressy looks.",
      "content": "Mix in shades of brown for casual and dressy looks. Try a simple, chocolate brown colored pump matched with a solid brown belt if you’re wearing a formal red dress. For something casual, try earthy brown sandals and oversized brown purse for a bohemian vibe. [2] X Research source For jewelry, look for pendants and earrings that contain brown gemstones like tiger's eye, amber, jasper, or topaz. The gemstones can be large, but only opt for one or two statement pieces. The red of your dress should still be the main attraction."

      "content": "Wear it with green accessories during the holiday season. Holiday parties and other related events are the perfect opportunity to mix in some of your favorite green accessories. For instance, you could pair a red sweater dress with deep green pumps and a matching green knit scarf to create a fun, seasonal look at an office party."

      "title": "Break things up with a black belt and shoes.",
      "content": "Break things up with a black belt and shoes. Black is a strong neutral that can hold its ground against a red dress without stealing the show. Wear a thin black belt around your waist to break up the monotony of a solid red smock dress. Finish the look with black tights and black knee-high boots."

    {
      "title": "Use black to add a little sexiness to your outfit.",
      "content": "Use black to add a little sexiness to your outfit. Black can look strong and classy, but the right black accessories can really turn up the heat. Wrap a black lace shawl around your shoulders for an evening look. Carry a matching black clutch with lacy accents. Complete the look with your highest pair of black stilettos or heeled boots."

      "title": "Lighten things up with white accessories.",
      "content": "Lighten things up with white accessories. Pairing red with white works really well for casual and retro looks. Give your red summer sundress a retro vibe by wearing white bangle bracelets and white sandals. White sneakers can look great with the right casual red dress, too. [3] X Research source For a 50s pinup vibe, try wearing your red dress with strappy or open-toed white heels. Tone down a red dress at the office by wearing it with a soft white cardigan."

      "title": "Try a black and white pattern.",
      "content": "Try a black and white pattern. Patterns create added visual interest, but a simple black and white pattern keeps it subtle. Try a black and white polka dot handbag for timeless appeal, or get a little edgy with a large zebra print shoulder bag. Flats with black and white stripes can look great, too."

      "content": "Pull out your vintage pearls to add simple sophistication. A simple pearl necklace, matched with small pearl earrings, can create a classy, elegant look, especially when paired with a white or cream shoe. Add a pearl cocktail ring for even more glam. To create a 20s look, drape a long string of pearls over the front of the dress, or double the string up for a flapper vibe."

    {
      "title": "Choose jewelry with black gemstones like onyx, or even black pearls.",
      "content": "Choose jewelry with black gemstones like onyx, or even black pearls. A simple necklace or tennis bracelet adorned with black stones is a good way to add a small trace of black to your outfit. Black diamonds are also popular now, although they are on the pricier side. For a unique yet sophisticated look, wear black pearls."

      "title": "Wear a simple gold or silver necklace.",
      "content": "Wear a simple gold or silver necklace. Gold and silver look equally great with red, but too much of one or the other could detract from the dress. For dresses with low necklines, go with a simple and classy gold or silver chain. [4] X Research source It creates just enough sparkle to complement your overall look. Add a little more glamour with a pair of matching drop earrings or ring. For a sleek, Art Deco look, choose silver jewelry. Try a long silver chain and vintage silver cocktail ring."

      "content": "Make a statement with metallic shoes and a matching handbag. Wear a formal red dress with glitzy gold heels and matching golden clutch. Pair a casual red sundress with silver sandals and oversized silver bag for an informal bohemian vibe. Whether you go with gold or silver, tie the look together by adding a single piece of matching jewelry. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Go for a two-toned look.",
      "content": "Go for a two-toned look. While silver and gold can be used separately for a red dress, mixing the two together can create a look that is both visually interesting and classy. Look for two-toned jewelry, or create the look yourself by layering thick gold and silver necklaces around your neck. Follow through by matching a silver chain belt with a gold shoe, or vice versa."

      "content": "Maximize your glitz and glamour with diamonds. Wear just enough diamonds to add sparkle to your ensemble without competing with your bold red dress. Pair simple diamond stud earrings with a delicate diamond pendant, or wear showcase diamond chandelier earrings and skip the rest of your jewelry altogether."
