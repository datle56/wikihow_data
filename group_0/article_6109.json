[1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Bacteria builds up on your hands throughout the day, so clean them off whenever you need to touch the incision. Wet your hands and rub them together to lather your soap. Scrub between your fingers, under your nails, and the backs of your hands for at least 20 seconds to kill all of the germs.

      "content": "Leave medical tape on until it peels off on its own. Usually, your doctor will put medical tape over your wound to hold it closed and speed up healing. Even though it may be tempting to pick at it, leave the tape alone while you’re still recovering. [3] X Research source After about 3–7 days, the tape will loosen and fall off so you can throw it away.

      "content": "Wash the wound twice a day with soap and water. Even though your wound is closed, it could still get infected if there’s bacteria. Wet the area with warm running water to get rid of germs on the surface. Gently lather soap around your wound to kill the bacteria and clean dirt that built up. Rinse the soap off of your wound so you’re completely clean.

      "content": "Pat the wound dry. Use a soft, clean towel so you don’t hurt yourself. Gently pat your wound rather than rubbing it back and forth. Make sure you completely dry your wound so it doesn’t get infected.

      "title": "Cover your wound with a bandage for the first 5–7 days.",
      "content": "Cover your wound with a bandage for the first 5–7 days. Find a bandage that’s large enough to cover your entire wound. Wear the bandage at all times throughout the first week after you get your stitches out. That way, it’s less likely to get contaminated or infected. [8] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source This is especially important if you had stitches on your knees, elbows, hands, or chin. Bandages also stop your clothes from rubbing against your wound and prevent irritation. Apply an ointment or petroleum jelly to the scar before you apply a bandage to help speed up healing."

      "title": "Apply petroleum jelly to your wound to keep it moist.",
      "content": "Apply petroleum jelly to your wound to keep it moist. After you clean your wound for the day, take a fingertip-sized amount of petroleum jelly and gently rub it into the area. Work the petroleum jelly in until it’s clear and forms a thin layer over your wound so it doesn’t dry out. Protect your wound with a bandage so it doesn’t reopen or get irritated.

      "content": "Cover the area or use sunblock when you go outside. If you can, hide your scar under your clothes. Put on long sleeves or wear pants depending on your scar’s location. You could also use a bandage if you want it completely covered. If you aren’t able to easily cover your scar with clothes or a bandage, then put on sunblock that contains zinc and has at least 30 SPF or higher. [10] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If you don’t use protection from the sun, then your scar might have red or brown discoloration. If your wound is on your head or face, you might be able to cover it with a large sun hat. Covering your scar from the sun minimizes permanent skin discoloration around your scar."

      "content": "Massage your wound twice a day to reduce scar tissue. Only massage your scar if it’s closed and doesn’t have any signs of infection, or else you could reinjure yourself. Gently apply pressure on your scar and massage along the length of your injury. Massage your scar for 5–10 minutes twice every day. [11] X Research source Only press down until you feel slight pressure. If you feel any pain, ease up so you don’t hurt yourself.

      "content": "Stick with gentle activities for the first month to avoid irritation or reinjury. Strenuous activities that stress your wound can cause pain or make it split open, so avoid activities like sports, weight lifting, or swimming. Instead, just rest and stick to some low-intensity exercise, such as walking. Talk to your doctor to see what activities you can do safely while you’re recovering. [18] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Your wound will feel tender as well, so be careful not to bump or hit it against anything. Even though yoga and stretching might be low-intensity, it can also pull at your wound and cause it to split open."

If you notice redness extends 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) out from the wound, call your doctor since it could be a sign that you developed an infection. Check the incision for any pus and tenderness when you touch it since these could be other indicators.
