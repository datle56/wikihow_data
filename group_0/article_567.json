      "content": "Find the least common multiple of both denominators. “Whenever you're adding or subtracting fractions, you have to have a common denominator, meaning that bottom number has to be the same,” Jia says. So before we can add the fractions together, we need them to have the same denominator, or bottom number. To do this, we find the least common multiple (LCM). Find the least common multiple by listing multiples of each number until you find a multiple that they share. For example, say we’re trying to add ½ and 2/6. We start by listing multiples of 2: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. Then, list multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30. We can see from our lists that the lowest multiple that both denominators share is 12, so 12 is our least common multiple. Multiples are the numbers you get when you keep adding a number to itself, or multiplying a number by each other number. A “proper fraction” is a fraction where the numerator (top number) is less than the denominator (bottom number)."

      "title": "Rewrite each fraction using the LCM.",
      "content": "Rewrite each fraction using the LCM. Now that we have an LCM, Jia tells us, we convert each fraction so that they all have the LCM as their denominator. To do this, we ask, “What number do we multiply the denominator by to get the LCM?” Once we know that, we multiply both the numerator (top number) and denominator by that number to convert the fraction. In our example, we have ½ + 2/6. Let’s start with ½. What number multiplied by 2 equals 12? The answer is 6, so we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 6. 1 x 6 = 6, and 2 x 6 =12, so our new fraction is 6/12. Then, we do the same for 2/6. 6 x 2 = 12, so multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2. 2 x 2 = 4, and 6 x 2 = 12, so our new fraction is 4/12. Now, rewrite the equation with our converted fractions: 6/12 + 4/12 ."

      "content": "Simplify the answer, if possible. Our answer is 10/12, but we always want to simplify or reduce the fraction down to its smallest form, Jia reminds us. To do this, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by the greatest common factor. To find the greatest common factor, we list the factors of both the numerator and the denominator and find the highest number they share. For example, the factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10. The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. So we can say the greatest common factor of the two numbers is 2. Now, divide both the numerator and denominator by 2 (10 / 2 and 12 / 2) to get ⅚, so our final answer is ⅚ ."

Because you have to make the denominators the same before you add the fractions, find a common multiple that they share, Jia says. Then choose the lowest one. For example, for 9/5 + 14/7, the multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 while the multiples of 7 are 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35. 35 is the least common multiple .

For example, multiply 9/5 by 7 to get a denominator of 35. You also multiply the numerator by 7, so the fraction becomes 63/35. Then, 7 x 5 = 35, so we multiply 14 x 5 to get 70, and our new fraction is 70/35."
