      "content": "Set rewards for yourself. Whether it's a video game, 30 minutes on social media, or a candy bar, find something that you really want to do. Make an agreement with your family that you will only receive the reward if you complete a certain number of tasks after school every day. This way, you'll have a reason to get things done as soon as you get home. [1] X Research source You don't necessarily need to arrange rewards with your family in order to motivate yourself to be productive. If you can be disciplined, you can be in charge of rewarding yourself after you've gotten a few things done. Ask your parents if there are any incentives that they can think of to give you for being consistently productive after school."

      "content": "Perform some simple stretches to activate your body. Stretching will get the blood flowing and make it easier to get started on your first task. Stand up and stretch your back by tilting backwards with your hands on your hips. Use your toes to lift your ankles 3–5 inches (7.6–12.7 cm) off of the floor to stretch your hamstrings. Then, keep your legs straight as you bend over to touch your toes. Stretch your upper body by pulling back on your palms as they point away from you. Bend your elbow behind your upper back and push on your triceps to stretch your arms. Jumping jacks , yoga , and jump rope are all good physical activities that can be used instead of stretching. Stretch for at least 5 minutes before moving on to your next task. This will help get your body in the habit of moving before"
