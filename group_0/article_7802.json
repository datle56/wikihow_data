      "title": "Dab with the grease as fast as possible with the cloth.",
      "content": "Dab with the grease as fast as possible with the cloth. Gently blot at the grease stain, trying to absorb as much of it as possible as quickly as possible. The trouble with cleaning leather is that it tends to absorb liquid, especially grease, making it difficult to clean topically once it's been absorbed. Avoid scrubbing the leather. This can damage the fine grains of the leather, making the stain worse. Blot gently and use some kind of lint-free microfiber cloth."

      "title": "Find the grain of the leather.",
      "content": "Find the grain of the leather. Just like wood, leather has a direction of texture. You'll have more success in applying any cleaner if you apply it along the lie, as opposed to across it. In other words, any time you wipe or blot at the leather, you want to do it with the grain. If you're having trouble finding the grain, try to work from the \"outside\" of the stain in to the center. At the very least, you'll be able to shrink the stain this way. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Spread talcum powder on the item.",
      "content": "Spread talcum powder on the item. [2] X Research source Use regular household baby powder to soak up the grease. Be liberal with your application of the powder. It works particularly well at drawing the grease out without damaging the leather because it's more absorbent than the leather is, as long as you get there in time. Let the powder sit overnight, or at least several hours to do its work."

One particularly effective method of cleaning grease from smaller items is to use a bit of dish soap and distilled water to create a lather and clean the item. You'll need a couple of clean micro-fiber cloths, the soap, and water. [4] X Research source Consider using a spray bottle to make the job easier. You can use mild dishwashing soap and warm water to wash leather. It is better not to use vinegar because it can deepen stains affected by acidity."

      "content": "Do a patch test. Find a less visible spot on your item to \"patch test\" the cleaning solution of choice. If your leather is dyed in any way, any kind of cleaner can affect the color, so pick an out-of-the-way patch to test it on."

You want to use the same basic principle as the quick-fix method, gently dabbing and letting the cleaner do the work. Don't make it worse by scrubbing."
