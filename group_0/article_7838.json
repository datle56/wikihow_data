Start at the top corner of your windshield, and use up-and-down movements to clean off the glass. When the side you’re wiping with looks dirty, flip the towel over to the clean side. Work your way across the entire windshield with your towel to remove the loose dust that causes streaks. [2] X Research source If you have trouble getting into the corners of your windshield, use a windshield microfiber cleaner that reaches into tight spots. Avoid using paper towels to clean the inside of your windshield since they could leave streaks or tear and get stuck on the glass. [3] X Research source"

Heat from the sun can cause the plastic and vinyl in your dashboard to break down, creating “outgassing” that leaves a hazy film on your vehicle’s windshield. Try to find a shaded area to park your vehicle, such as in a garage or under a tree, to keep the interior cool. [12] X Research source Alternatively, put a windshield cover over the inside of your windshield when you park your vehicle outside. That way, the sun doesn’t warm up your vehicle as much."
