Put a tight-fitting lid on the pot and turn the heat to medium high. Shake the pot every few moments as the kernels heat up and begin to pop. When the popping begins to slow down, remove the pot from heat. If you want to use the microwave instead. pour the syrup mixture and popcorn kernels into a glass microwave-safe bowl with a lid. Pop the popcorn on high for three to four minutes, or until the popping slows to a stop. Do not use a plastic bowl, even if it's microwave safe, since the syrup will get very hot and could scorch the bowl. Be sure to use a glass one."

This buttery popcorn will turn out delicious and vibrantly coloured, but unlike the sweet caramel version, savoury colourful popcorn will dye your fingers and mouth with food colouring. If you don't mind having green, red or blue fingers and lips, try this recipe. If you do, make the sweet caramel or fruity kind. Here's what you'll need for simple buttered popcorn with a pop of colour: 1 tablespoon of butter 1/3 cup of popcorn kernels Liquid or gel food colouring Salt"
