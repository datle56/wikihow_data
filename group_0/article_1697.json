Maybe the girl in front of you is wearing the jersey of your favorite sports team, or maybe a guy is walking a dog who looks just like your parent’s pooch. Take these opportunities to approach and strike up a conversation. You never know where things could go if you don’t take the first step! [14] X Research source Proximity can also be a helpful wingman. For instance, maybe you run into the same person when you take the bus into the city, or you pass the same girl twice at your local pizza place. Always try to read the room when you start chatting with a stranger. If they seem disinterested in the conversation, take a step back and leave them alone. At the end of the day, what matters most is that you put yourself out there!"

There’s a lot that can be said against dating apps, but just being along for the ride, even if the date didn’t go anywhere, made the experience more enjoyable and enriching. I ended up meeting my current partner at work, but I still have tons of friends who have either met their long-term partner on the apps or who use the apps to meet new people.\" - staff writer Dev M.
