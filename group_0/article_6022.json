      "content": "Select a cage. Conures are active birds that like to keep busy. [3] X Research source Your conure will need a cage that gives him lots of space to move around and play with his toys. [4] X Research source If you have a small conure, his cage should be at least 18 x 18 x 18 inches (46 x 46 x 46 centimeters). A larger conure would need a cage that is at least 36 x 36 x 36 inches (91 x 91 x 91 centimeters). The cage can be either horizontal or vertical. [5] X Research source The cage bars should be horizontal so your conure can climb on them. [6] X Research source The bars should be spaced no further than 3/4 inches to one inch (two to 2.5 cm) apart. Consider purchasing a cage cover to give your conure a sense of security when he sleeps. [7] X Research source Alternatively, you could use a blanket or large towel to cover his cage at night."

      "content": "Situate the cage in an ideal location in your home. Your conure's cage should be in a room that is not in the direct path of harmful kitchen fumes. Within the room, make sure not to place the cage in direct sunlight. [8] X Research source Conures are most comfortable in rooms that are 70 to 80 °F (21 to 27 °C), which is the typical room temperature for most homes. The room should also be free of drafts. [9] X Research source Many types of fumes are toxic to conures, including perfumes, aerosols, and fumes from cleaning products and non-stick cookware."

      "content": "Place some basic items in your conure's cage. Perches are an essential item in any bird's cage. For your conure, choose at least two perches that are 1/2 to 5/8 inches (about 1.5 centimeters) in diameter. Position the perches such that your conure's tail feathers will not rub against the cage bars when she sits on the perches. [10] X Research source Place one perch close to your conure's food and water dishes. Consider using perches that have various sizes, shapes, and textures. This will help keep your conure's feet healthy and strong. [11] X Research source Many types of perches are available at your local pet store. Place two to three food and water dishes in her cage. One dish would be for water and one or two would be for food. Conures love to take baths. Place another water dish in your conure's cage, [12] X Research source preferably one that is large enough for her to step in. Look for these dishes at your local pet store or housewares store. Line the bottom of your conure's cage with newspaper or paper liners."

      "content": "Clean your conure's cage regularly. Conures can be messy, so you will need to maintain a regular cleaning schedule for your conure's cage. On a daily basis, you should clean his water and food dishes. [13] X Research source Conures like to dip their food in their water bowls, so you may need to clean your conure's water dish several times a day. [14] X Research source Replace the cage lining each day. Clean your conure's toys and perches on a daily basis. Dishwater detergent is sufficient for cleaning these accessories. Make sure to completely rinse off the soap before placing the cleaned items back in your conure's cage. [15] X Research source Depending on how messy your conure is, you will need to disinfect his cage either weekly or monthly. Since bleach fumes can be toxic to your conure, you will need to keep him in a separate room when you disinfect his cage and allow it to dry. [16] X Research source Speak with an avian veterinarian or avian expert about safe cleaning products to use in your conure's cage."

      "content": "Place toys in your conure's cage. Conures like to be kept busy. Without things to do, your conure could become bored and resort to feather picking. [17] X Research source Giving your conure a variety of toys will keep her happily entertained. Popular toy types for conures include foraging toys, wooden chew toys, and shredding toys. Foraging toys mimic your conure's natural food foraging behavior in the wild. Shredded toys can help your conure relieve stress and boredom. If you don't want to purchase a shredded toy, you can place some newspaper in the cage for him or her to shred. Avoid toys that have small parts. These parts could catch on your conure's beak or claws, possibly leading to damage or injury. [18] X Research source Keep different types of toys at your conure's cage at all times to prevent boredom with any one toy. Consider installing a play stand in your conure's cage that can hold toys. [19] X Research source All types of toys can be found at your local pet store."

      "content": "Consider putting a mirror in your conure's cage. Mirrors can be a good choice of enrichment to keep your conure busy. However, introduce him to a mirror only after he has bonded with you—otherwise he may bond with the mirror instead of you! [20] X Research source Mirrors can also encourage mating behavior (e.g., regurgitating food, tail lifting). [21] X Research source Mating behavior can be especially problematic in female birds, since they can lay eggs without a mate. If you have a female conure, mating behavior can lead to spontaneous egg laying that could result in physical stress and illness. [22] X Research source Your conure could see the mirror as a \"love toy.\" [23] X Research source Speak with your veterinarian if you are unsure about placing shiny objects in your conure's cage."

Pellets should make up approximately 60 to 70% of your conure's diet and seeds no more than 10% and fruits and veggies for the rest. They can come in different colors, which adds a little variety to an otherwise uninteresting food. [24] X Research source Pelleted bird food, along with seed mixes, provide a good, nutritious diet. Some commercial seed mixes have fillers or harmful additives. Ask an avian veterinarian or the staff at your local pet store if you are unsure about which pelleted food and seed mix would be best for your conure, or select a seed mix that is labeled as \"organic\" or \"all natural.\""

Fruits and vegetables are a great way to add this variety. Examples of fresh vegetables to feed your conure are collard greens, spinach, pumpkins, and zucchini. There are many types of fruit you can feed your conure, such as mangoes, blueberries, kiwi, and apples. Fruits and vegetables also add important vitamins and minerals to your conure's diet. Wash the fruits and vegetables thoroughly with water to remove pesticides. Consider purchasing organic produce but not avocado because it is poisonous to your bird. Cut the produce into smaller pieces."

      "content": "Incorporate nuts into your conure's diet. Nuts add healthy protein and fat to your conure's diet, and should be a mainstay in her daily eating regimen. Examples of nuts to feed your conure are hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, peanuts, and brazil nuts. The nuts should be low in salt. Although important, nuts should be fed only in small amounts because of their high fat content. Your conure could become obese if she eats a lot of nuts. If you feed your conure peanuts, they must be unshelled. Peanut shells contain a fungal toxin called aflatoxin that could make your conure very sick."

There are many types of healthy grains you can feed your conure, such as cooked brown rice or barley, as well as cereal, pasta, and crackers. Conures cannot break down sugar very well, so avoid sugary cereals. Examples of legumes are lentils and different types of beans (e.g., green beans, black beans). Legumes and grains have vitamins, minerals, and fiber that are essential components of your conure's diet."

Incorporate foods into his diet (dark leafy greens, soy oil, and fish meal) that are high in these nutrients. Adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin K are important to prevent a condition called Conure Bleeding Syndrome. Calcium perches are available that your conure can chew on to get extra calcium in his diet. Cuttlebone is another calcium source, but is not recommended for conures. Water-soluble vitamins can be added to your conure's water. Speak with your veterinarian before supplementing your conure's diet."

For example, your conure should not eat avocados, cocoa, or onions. These foods contain toxins that could sicken your conure. Human foods that are high in sugar, salt, or fat should also be avoided, since a conure's digestive system cannot break them down very well.

At each feeding time, place a variety of fresh foods, cooked foods, and seeds in his food dishes. After about one hour, remove any remaining food. In the morning, give him some pellets after you have removed the other food. He can snack on the pellets throughout the day. Conures are prone to obesity. To prevent him from overeating at mealtime, feed him only as much as he can eat in one sitting. It will probably take some trial and error to determine how much to feed him at mealtime. Since conures are messy eaters and like to dip their food in their water, you may have to replace your conure's water dish at each meal time."

To have quality interactions with her, you will first need to gain her trust. One way to gain her trust is to talk to her in a smooth and calming voice. Talk to her throughout the day, especially when you are feeding her and cleaning her cage. The more she hears your voice when you are near her, the more comfortable she will be with you. Another way to gain her trust is to approach her cage slowly and calmly. When she sees that you are not a threat, she will be much more at ease when you are nearby."

Begin by gently placing your hand either on or near the outside of his cage. Talk to him while you hold your hand nearby to calm his anxiety. When your conure is comfortable with your hand outside his cage, slowly place your hand inside his cage. [27] X Research source Hold some treats (e.g., millet spray, dark leafy greens) in your hand and keep your hand still while he approaches and explores your hand.

Using your index finger as a perch, gently press your finger against her lower chest (just above her feet) to encourage her to step up onto your finger. [28] X Research source Give her a treat and verbal praise when she steps onto your finger. When she gets good at stepping onto your finger, you can take her out of his cage and practice stepping up in a different room, such as the bathroom."

[29] X Research source Try as he might, your conure will probably be able to learn only about five or ten words. Your conure will need to focus all of his attention on you to learn how to talk. Turn off any other noises (television, radio, phone) that may distract him. [30] X Research source Choose simple words and phrases, and associate them with a specific object or action. [31] X Research source For example, you can say \"Are you hungry?\" when you feed him and \"Goodbye!\" when you leave the room. Speak with enthusiasm to your conure. The more excited you sound, the more excited and motivated he will be to mimic your words. [32] X Research source Your conure's voice will be high pitched. [33] X Research source"

If she will let you, gently wrap your conure in a towel after her bath and hold her close to you until she is dry. [34] X Research source Conures are very cuddly, so your conure will probably enjoy being so close to you after a good bath. When she is dry, your conure will preen herself. To preen, she will use her beak to reach back to her oil gland (located at the base of her tail) and spread the oil over her plumage."

Toss a soft stuffed toy towards your conure. [37] X Research source Be aware that she might not be very good at catching what you toss, but she will have fun anyway. She may even toss the toy back to you. [38] X Research source Mimic your conure's actions and vice versa. For example, when your conure stretches her wings, stretch your arms out in response. [39] X Research source Move side to side, and see if your conure will do the same. Make a mess with your conure. Conures love to shred things. When you have your conure out of her cage, sit on the floor with her and make a mess by shredding some newspaper. Give her her own newspaper to shred. [40] X Research source"

Gently place your free hand on his back and begin to bend your body forward very slowly. Keep your hand on your conure's back as you bend forward. Lying back may feel a bit strange to your conure at first, so he will need your hand on his back to feel more secure with this movement. When he is comfortable lying back on your hand, you can play with him by tickling his tummy. [41] X Research source You could also give him small toys that he can play with when lying on his back.
