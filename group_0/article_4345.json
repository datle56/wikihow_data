      "content": "Gather at least 4 players around a large table. Boom Cup requires at least 4 players, which shouldn’t be a problem when the drinks are flowing and the party is in full swing. Play with as many people as you can fit around your table—there’s not really any limit. Gather and evenly space the players around the table. [1] X Research source If you’re playing with alcohol, make sure everyone’s of legal drinking age, and that everyone has a way to get home safely."

      "title": "Fill and arrange about 20 plastic cups in the center of the table.",
      "content": "Fill and arrange about 20 plastic cups in the center of the table. Fill the plastic cups about ⅓ full of beer (or juice or soda, if you’re running a dry event). Then, gather all the cups in the very center of the table with their rims touching. Place them so that they're within reach of every player, for easy access. [2] X Research source Twenty cups is a typical number, but generally, fill about 3-4 cups for each player participating. Some games also include a full cup in the very center, which the last player has to chug."

      "content": "Give an empty cup and a ping pong ball to 2 random players. Two players each receive an empty cup and a ping pong ball . These players set their cups anywhere on the table in front of them. [3] X Research source Feel free to choose these players however you wish—the youngest of the group, the oldest, whoever didn’t bring their own beer, etc. These are the starting players. All players remain standing around the table in a circle throughout the game."

      "content": "Bounce the ping pong ball into your empty cup on “Go!” Count down “3, 2, 1, Go!” On “go,” you and the other starting player attempt to bounce your ping pong balls off the table and into the empty cup in front of you. Keep trying until you make it! [4] X Research source If you accidentally bounce the ball into one of the cups in the center of the table, you must drink it, then stack the empty cup inside your own."

      "content": "Pass the cup and the ball to the left when you land the shot. Once you’ve successfully bounced your ping pong ball into your cup, hand the ball and the cup to the player to the left of you, who then tries to do the same. Once they’ve landed the ball into the cup, they pass it to the left, and it keeps going around the table. [5] X Research source If you land the ball in the cup on your first try, pass the ball and the cup to whomever you want (except for the person currently trying to bounce their own ping pong ball). While playing, both cups move clockwise around the table."

      "content": "Slap the cup away from the player to your left if you make your shot first. At some points during the game, one cup will “catch up” to the other on their way around the table, so that 2 players right next to each other are trying to bounce the ping pong balls into them. If the player on the right makes their shot first, they slap the cup away from the player on their left. [6] X Research source The player who slapped the cup then passes their own cup to any player at the table. In one variation, the player on the right stacks their cup into the cup of the player on the left, making for a taller and more challenging target as the game progresses."

If the player immediately to the right of you lands their ball in their cup before you and slaps your empty cup away, grab one of the filled cups from the middle of the table and drink!

      "content": "Keep playing until there are no more cups in the center. Keep bouncing the ping pong balls, passing the cups, slapping your opponents’ cups, and drinking from the cups in the center of the table until the center cups are all gone. In some games, the last person to have their cup slapped has to chug! [9] X Research source Nobody really loses in Boom Cup—that is, everyone wins. But if you like, determine a winner by having a scorekeeper keep track of how many times each player lands the ball in the cup. Whoever has the most points at the end wins."
