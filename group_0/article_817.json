You may need to experiment a little to identify the library that you like; however, there are some general guidelines that can help you choose more quickly. Any library that says \"Vector Pack\" will likely have some graphics that include buttons and ribbons that follow the same theme. For example, the \"Grime Vector Pack\" has buttons that are styled like street art. Any library that has a culture-specific theme like \"Fashion\" and \"Sushi\" will have a number of images that relate to that specific theme."

You can also click on the Symbol Palette Menu, which is a small arrow to the right of the symbols. It will bring up a pop-out menu. Select \"Place Symbol Instance.\""
