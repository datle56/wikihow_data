      "content": "Check the rules if you’re entering your boat in a contest. As a general rule of thumb, stick with corrugated cardboard, cardboard blocks, cardboard tubes, duct or masking tape, glue, latex paint, and varnish for your boat. Most regattas have a pretty strict list of materials that you can and can’t use, so you don’t want to get disqualified before the race even starts! Many regattas ban materials like wood, styrofoam, plastic sheathing, metal, and fiberglass. Coated cardboard is often off-limits as well, along with caulk, staples, clamps, and screws. Basically, your boat can only be made with cardboard, paint, and some type of basic adhesive. Contest rules also limit the types of boats you can make. Raft- and canoe-style boats make the cut, while surfboard-style boats typically aren’t allowed. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Build a flat-bottom boat to prevent it from tipping in the water. A flat-bottomed boat offers lots of stability, which is great if you’re racing across a pool or lake. Boats with V-shaped bottoms have a greater chance of capsizing once you’re in the water."

      "content": "Design the boat to be 18-48 in (46-122 cm) wide and 18 in (36 cm) tall. If you’re sailing solo, 18-30 in (46-76 cm) gives you enough wiggle room along the width of your boat. If you’re planning on sitting side-by-side with someone in your boat, give yourself 48 in (122 cm) of breathing room. Then, plan for your boat to be about 18 in (36 cm) high—this gives you enough space to paddle in the boat while kneeling or sitting down."

      "content": "Make the boat between 8 and 12 ft (2.4 and 3.7 m) long. Factor in your crew size when you’re finalizing the dimensions of your boat. An 8 ft (2.4 m) long boat might be best if you’re sailing by yourself, while a 12 ft (3.7 m) long boat would work better for a larger crew. Your boat’s length plays a big role in how easy (or hard!) it is to control. Boats that are less than 10 ft (3.0 m) long are difficult to keep pointed in one direction, while boats that are more than 12 ft (3.7 m) long can be difficult to turn."

      "title": "Give your boat a pointed bow if you’d like it to go faster.",
      "content": "Give your boat a pointed bow if you’d like it to go faster. When your boat has a squared-off bow, the water hits the very front of the boat and creates some water resistance. When your boat has a triangular front, you run into far less of that water resistance—this makes you cut faster through the water! [2] X Research source This isn’t to say that there’s anything wrong with a simple, squared-off bow! Plenty of people have entered regattas with square boats. [3] X Research source Plus, a square-shaped boat works well with certain themes and decorations, like a school bus or fire truck."

      "content": "Build a horizontal block across the boat to give it extra support. Plan on making a “support block” that spans horizontally along your boat. You can either position this piece so it separates the hull from the crew compartment, or put it in the center of the boat to create 2 separate crew compartments—just be sure to balance the weight in each."

      "title": "Multiply the boat’s volume by 62.4 (28.3 metric) to ensure it can hold your crew.",
      "content": "Multiply the boat’s volume by 62.4 (28.3 metric) to ensure it can hold your crew. Find the volume of your boat by multiplying the width by the height and length. Then, multiply this number by 62.4 (26.3), since water weights 62.4 lb per cubic foot (28.3 kg per cubic meter). This number is the total amount of weight your boat can support without sinking. For instance, if the boat is 10 ft (3.0 m) long, 3 ft (0.91 m) wide, and 1 ft (0.30 m) tall, the volume is 30 ft 3 (0.819 m 3 ). Multiply 30 cu ft (0.819 m 3 by 62.4 lb/cu ft (1,000 kg/m 3 ), which gives you 1,872 lbs (819 kg). In other words, your boat can support 1,872 lbs (819 kg) of combined weight without sinking. Believe it or not, a 1 by 1 by 3 ft (0.30 by 0.30 by 0.91 m) box can support someone who weighs up to 187 lb (85 kg) without sinking. If your boat is large enough to physically hold you, it’s likely sturdy enough to float."

      "content": "Build and test a small, to-scale model of your boat design to make sure it works. Grab a manila folder or piece of thin cardboard—this will be sturdy enough to make your mini boat. Fold and cut the material into your design so you can see if the structure seems viable or not. An easy way to scale down the dimensions of your boat is to use the same number of smaller units. For example, if your finished boat will be 10 by 3 by 1 ft (3.05 by 0.91 by 0.30 m), switch the units to inches to make the boat smaller but keep the model proportionate. In this case, you’d make your model 10 by 3 by 1 in (25.4 by 7.6 by 2.5 cm). Stick a couple of coins or rocks into your boat to represent you and your fellow crew members. Don’t be discouraged if your first model doesn’t work out. It’s better to work out the kinks in the planning phase than to have a huge chunk of cardboard that doesn’t float properly!"

Stop by your local pharmacy, recycling center, or big-box store and see if they have any spare cardboard boxes they’re tossing away. Grab as many sheets of corrugated cardboard from these places as you can—this type of cardboard is much sturdier and will give your boat much more structure. Grocery stores, fast food restaurants, bookstores, coffee shops, and schools might also have leftover boxes they’re no longer using. You also check out sites like CraigsList and Freecycle to see if people in your community have some extra cardboard lying around."

Thoroughly coat 1 of the joints or pieces of cardboard with an even layer of glue and stick it to the adjoining piece. Then, secure the pieces with clamps to make sure that the cardboard doesn’t move or come apart. Wait for the glue to dry completely before removing the clamps. [9] X Research source Check your glue’s packaging to see how much time it needs to dry and cure.

[16] X Research source Duct tape shrinks down when you paint over it, and clear tape tends to melt beneath a coat of paint. Don’t use either of these tapes if you plan on painting your boat some more."

Now, it’s time to have fun decorating and jazzing your boat up! Just make sure that your additions won’t mess with the structural integrity of the boat or break the rules. [17] X Research source For instance, if you want your boat to look like a pirate ship, add a mast and sail, Jolly Roger flag, cannons, anchors, and a crow’s nest."
