If you're looking for a more professional-sounding email address that you can use for years, sticking with your name is the best way to go. [1] X Research source It will be easy for you and your friends/family/coworkers/etc. to remember, and it won't be embarrassing ten years from now. However, if your name is very common (e.g. John Smith), it's very likely that email address has already been taken. If this is the case, you will have to think of something else or add something distinct onto your name, such as numbers, underscores, your middle name or initial, etc. Examples of these potential variations include: [2] X Research source johnsmith65@email.com john_smith@email.com smith.j@email.com johnpsmith@email.com jp_smith65@email.com"

If you're concerned about your privacy and would rather not use your real name for your email address, you'll need to get creative to think of an address you can use. Brainstorm a list of things that you like, such as a favorite sport, hobby, pet, TV show, country, celebrity, color, season, etc. Once you've done that, try and find a way to work this into your email address. You may have to mix and match different elements from your list to create your address. Examples of addresses you could come up with using this method include: purplesoccerball@email.com math_whiz@email.com michealjacksonrocks@email.com american_girl@email.com autumnleaves@email.com"

      "content": "Consider creating a family email address. If your email address will be used by the whole family and will be receiving emails pertaining to yourself, your partner, your children, etc. you may want to consider making an email address that reflects this. If you're going to do this, some elements you could include in your address could be things like your last name, the number of people in your family, the word \"family\", etc. For example, if your last name was Johnson and you had four people in your family, potential addresses could include: [3] X Research source the_johnsons@email.com johnsonfamily@email.com 4johnsons@email.com johnson.fam@email.com"

      "content": "Be prepared to switch up the spelling or add punctuation or numbers. Because so many people have email addresses, it's very likely that the address you want will have already been taken. Because of this, you'll have to be willing to make some changes in order to create a unique email address that isn't already being used. One way to do this is by changing the spelling, whether it means changing a letter, adding an extra letter, etc. Another way to do this is by adding punctuation, whether it's an underscore or a period. Depending on what email server you're using, some forms of punctuation may not be allowed, so keep this in mind. Another way to make a unique address is to add numbers. If you're going to add numbers, make sure that they're numbers that will be easy for you to remember, such as your favorite number. Examples of these changes include: Change i_ love _music@email.com to i_ luv _music@email.com Change cat s .rule@email.com to cat z .rule@email.com Change dolphinlover@email.com to dolphinlover r @email.com Change janesmith@email.com to jane_smith@email.com Change janesmith@email.com to janesmith 45 @email.com"
