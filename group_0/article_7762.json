      "title": "Select or create a non-abrasive cleaning solution.",
      "content": "Select or create a non-abrasive cleaning solution. For a general cleaning, fill a bucket with warm water and add a squirt of liquid detergent. Add more soap to your bucket if you think you’ll have a tough time cutting through stubborn dirt and grime. Opt for non-abrasive cleaners such as dish and laundry detergents, household all-purpose cleaners, bathroom cleaners, or baking soda. Avoid abrasive cleaning products, such as scouring powders, since these can cause damage to your fiberglass bathtub or shower."

      "title": "Apply the cleaning mixture with a non-abrasive applicator.",
      "content": "Apply the cleaning mixture with a non-abrasive applicator. Dunk a soft sponge in your bucket of warm soapy water and gently scrub the surface of your fiberglass shower or tub. If you don’t use a soft sponge, make sure that your applicator is made of nylon, polyester, or polyurethane. Do not use scouring pads, steel wool, or scrapers because they will be too harsh on the fiberglass."

    {
      "title": "Rinse away the cleaning solution and dry the surface with a towel.",
      "content": "Rinse away the cleaning solution and dry the surface with a towel. Let the cleaning solution sit on your fiberglass surfaces for about an hour. Afterward, rinse the tub or shower thoroughly with warm, clean water and dry it with a hand towel."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove soap scum with baking soda and water.",
      "content": "Remove soap scum with baking soda and water. Once soap scum accumulates, it can be difficult to get off with regular bathroom cleaners. Mix water and baking soda until it has a paste-like consistency and apply the paste to the soap scum areas. Leave the applied mixture alone for a couple of hours and then rinse it off with warm water. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use an acid to dissolve stubborn soap scum.",
      "content": "Use an acid to dissolve stubborn soap scum. More challenging soap scum might need an acid, such as vinegar, to help dissolve it. For best results, soak a cloth with vinegar and cover the stained area with it for about an hour. After removing the cloth, clean the area with warm soapy water and a soft sponge. [2] X Research source Stronger acids, such as diluted muriatic acid, should only be applied while wearing rubber gloves and as a last resort. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Bleach dark stains with hydrogen peroxide.",
      "content": "Bleach dark stains with hydrogen peroxide. Deeper, darker stains may be challenging to get rid of with regular cleaning products. Place several layers of clean white cloths over the stained area and pour hydrogen peroxide on top. Let the hydrogen peroxide soak in overnight and in the morning, rinse and dry the area.

    {
      "title": "Use acetone or paint thinners on extreme stains.",
      "content": "Use acetone or paint thinners on extreme stains. Difficult stains can be removed with acetone, which is the main ingredient in nail polish remover, or paint thinners such as turpentine. Soak a clean white cloth with the solution that you’re using and gently rub the stained area until it returns to its natural color. These solutions are fine to use occasionally on stained fiberglass, but should be used sparingly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spray the surface with vinegar 2-3 times per week.",
      "content": "Spray the surface with vinegar 2-3 times per week. Fill a spray bottle with white vinegar and use it to spritz the fiberglass surfaces a few times a week. This can minimize odors in addition to cutting down the amount of time you’ll spend scrubbing the fiberglass clean later."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid leaving items suctioned to the surface.",
      "content": "Avoid leaving items suctioned to the surface. If you have items in your tub or shower that adhere to the fiberglass with suction cups, remove them. They leave residue stains that are difficult to remove and clean properly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Polish and wax fiberglass surface twice per year.",
      "content": "Polish and wax fiberglass surface twice per year. Use a clean cotton cloth to first apply an automotive white polishing compound to any dull or scratched areas, and then buff with a white automotive cream wax. Repeat this routine twice a year to keep your fiberglass tub or shower looking shiny and new."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your fiberglass surfaces dry.",
      "content": "Keep your fiberglass surfaces dry. After each use, squeegee your shower or wipe it dry with a bath towel. Doing this regularly will get rid of the particles that allow soap scum to form, which will give you fewer stains to scrub off in the long run. [5] X Research source Open the window or turn on a fan when your bathroom surfaces are drying to avoid mildew growth."

    {
      "title": "Soften your water.",
      "content": "Soften your water. Install a water softener to filter minerals out of your water, which contribute heavily to soap scum buildup and rust. Additionally, put epsom salts in your bath water each time you take a bath to help soften it. [6] X Research source"
