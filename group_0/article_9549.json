      "content": "Be present while practicing. Being present in the moment (rather than constantly thinking about the past or worrying about the future) plays a huge role in Eastern Philosophy. This means that when you are practicing Tai Chi (and in your daily life in general) you should also practice being mindful, or fully present, in the moment. In the case of Tai Chi, you should practice noticing physical and emotional sensations you feel while you are actively practicing. Naturally, your mind may wander. In these instance, you should simply try to notice extraneous thoughts that come into your mind, and then go back to noticing the feelings and sensations you are currently experience. Don’t judge the thought, and try not to follow it."

Although your mind will very likely wander to other thoughts, worries, and/or other things you have to get done, just do your best to come back to the present when you notice that it has wandered. Don’t get mad at yourself when this happens."
