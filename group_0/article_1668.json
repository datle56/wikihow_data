      "content": "Gather the players in a circle and chant, “Game start!” If you’ve listened to Rosé’s hit song “APT,” you know exactly how this viral drinking game starts. Once everyone is gathered—either in chairs or sitting on the floor—have them chant, “Game start!” Then, you’re ready to play. [2] X Research source You could also say the opening phrase that Rosé uses in her song; in English, it translates to “A random game that Chae-young likes. Game start!” Chae-young is Rosé’s Korean name—but you could swap Chae-young out with someone else’s name if you prefer. There’s no limit to the number of people who can play this game at once. The more, the merrier."

      "content": "Chant “apateu, apateu” in unison while moving your hands. Repeat the chant until you say “apateu” (which is how you pronounce the Korean word for “apartment”) anywhere from four to six times—this can vary. As you chant, move your hands to the beat in a rhythmic motion, putting one over the other (so you’re alternating which one is on top and which is below). [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose a player to call out a random number.",
      "content": "Choose a player to call out a random number. If you plan on doing multiple rounds of APT (which is usually how it’s done), you can make each round a player’s turn and alternate turns around the group. The player whose turn it is must say a number of their choice. Then, all players must immediately stack their hands on top of each other. [4] X Research source You don’t need to stack your hands in any particular order; it should be totally random. The random number should ideally be less than or equal to the number of hands in the stack—but that’s not a hard rule. It can be any number (just keep in mind that something really high, like 42, might be annoying for players)."

    {
      "title": "Have everyone count up to the number called out.",
      "content": "Have everyone count up to the number called out. While counting, players must move their hands from the bottom of the stack to the top, moving one hand for every number that’s called. Keep doing this until you get to the number that was called out; whoever has their hand on top of the pile then has to take a drink, and everyone else throws their hands in the air! [5] X Research source For example, say the number is “five.” The person whose hand is at the bottom of the pile would move theirs to the top on “one,” then the next person on “two,” and so on. The person who moves their hand to the top of the pile on “five” would be the one to drink."

      "content": "Speed round In this version of the game, players only have a second (or two) to move their hands to the top of the stack. Anyone who’s too slow has to take a drink! Since these are house rules, you can decide how to time players and how little time they get; we recommend no more than a couple of seconds. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Taboo number",
      "content": "Taboo number Every number that gets called out in a round of APT can no longer be used in future rounds. So, if a player calls out a number used before, they have to take a drink! You can also make players drink if they say the wrong number when moving a hand to the top of the pile."

    {
      "title": "Clap and stack",
      "content": "Clap and stack This rule is simple: just clap your hands together before placing one on top of the stack. And, if you miss a clap, you have to take a drink. Alternatively (or in addition to this), you can have players clap their hands right after a number gets called out before putting both hands in a random stack. [7] X Research source Instead of a clap, come up with different extra moves for players to make! For example, maybe they have to wave or give a thumbs up before putting their hand on the stack."

      "content": "Sing a song Whoever loses a round has to sing a line of song lyrics (any song lyrics they like) before drinking. Since so many people are playing APT because of a song, you could always sing lines from “APT” (or challenge players to think up the funniest song possible to sing). [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Play in reverse",
      "content": "Play in reverse In this version, hands are stacked from the top down—not the other way around. That means when a player says a number, they have to move their hand from the top of the stack to the bottom, and if they mess up, they have to take a drink. You still count numbers sequentially (1, 2, 3…). The only part that’s reversed is the hands!"

      "content": "Have a thumb war The two players whose hands end up at the top of the stack must have a thumb-wrestling competition! Whichever player manages to pin the other’s thumb with theirs wins—and the loser has to take a drink (or face some other penalty that the group cooks up). [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Exclaim “geonbae!” before taking a shot. That’s what Bruno Mars sings during his part of “APT.,” and there’s a reason for it! “Geonbae” (건배) is the Korean word for “cheers.” It literally means “empty glass,” so saying “geonbae” before taking a drink is just like saying, “Bottoms up!” or “Cheers!” in English.

      "content": "Have some food ready while you play. In Korea, drinking with food on hand is a must—there’s always something to eat on hand, even if it’s just a quick snack. So, if you want to have an authentic game of APT, you’ll need something for players to snack on, too. [11] X Research source Drinking alcohol on an empty stomach can make its effects stronger. Having food in your stomach helps slow the rate at which the alcohol enters your bloodstream. So, drinking with food is a pretty smart idea!"

      "content": "There’s a definitive etiquette to drinking in Korean culture. In Korean drinking etiquette, the oldest guest (or the most honored guest) is responsible for pouring everyone else’s drink. After they do that, someone else must pour their drink. Furthermore, everyone else is supposed to wait for the oldest person to take the first sip before drinking their own beverages. [12] X Research source You’re also supposed to pour and accept drinks with both hands in South Korea. This is another sign of respect for your elders."

      "content": "Try a beverage that’s beloved in Korea for a truly authentic experience. Soju is a great choice: it’s a Korean drink that’s usually served as a shot, and it’s often referred to as Korean vodka because it’s smooth and has a neutral taste—though it also comes in a wide range of flavored varieties! There’s also makgeolli (a rice wine) and popular beers in Korea, like Cass, Hite, and Terra. [13] X Research source You could also make somaek, which is a Korean cocktail that combines soju with beer. Of course, always drink responsibly. It’s easy to start feeling the effects of alcohol quickly when playing a drinking game, so be smart, pace yourself, and switch to water if you start feeling sick."
