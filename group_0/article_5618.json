      "content": "Call your cell phone provider to enable international roaming. If you are visiting Mexico and want to be able to reach loved ones at home, call your provider before your trip and give them the dates that you will be in Mexico. Then, they can enable international roaming, which will give you voice, text, and data access using the local cellular networks in that country, but usually at higher rates. [1] X Research source Because charges for international roaming can be quite high, enabling this feature is only recommended if you will be visiting Mexico for a short period of time (under 1 month). Depending on the type of phone that you have, you may also need to authorize data roaming in your phone’s settings. You have to do this is if you have an iPhone. [2] X Research source If you have multiple phones that you will be bringing to Mexico, double-check that international roaming is enabled on all of them. [3] X Research source"

Each service territory in the U.S. is assigned a 3-digit area code that precedes all of the phone numbers that originate in that location. Dial that, and then follow it with the 7-digit phone number you’re trying to reach. For example, the final number you will dial will look something like this: 00 1 (123) 456-7890. The parentheses in this number indicate the area code."

      "content": "Purchase a calling card with a low billing increment. Calling cards provide toll-free or local-rate numbers to access international calling services. They are usually available at convenience or grocery stores. Look for a card with a low billing increment, meaning that you will be charged for as close to the duration of the call as possible. For example, if you call using a card with a 5-minute billing increment, a 1 minute call will be charged as 5 minutes, and a 6 minute call will be charged as 10 minutes. [4] X Research source The cost of the card will depend on the number of minutes and where you need to call. Beware of extra charges, such as additional connection or maintenance fees, that may be applied when using a calling card. Some “maintenance fees” are charged to your card’s balance daily or weekly. Read the fine print on the card before purchasing! [5] X Research source"

Choose the one that applies to you, dial 1, and then type in the listed number. An automated voice will answer, and from there you should follow the instructions it gives. For example, if your calling card is meant to be used in New York, there will be different numbers to call based on which neighborhood you’re in. If you’re in Manhattan, you will call a different number than if you were in Hempstead. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Purchase an unlocked cell phone. Unlocked cell phones are phones that are not tied to any one specific carrier. They are typically more expensive than normal phones because they are compatible with any cell service provider. The advantage, however, is that you can connect them to providers in countries outside of your home country. Unlocked iPhones are typically referred to as “jailbroken.” Cell phone carriers generally won’t unlock your phone if you ask them to, especially if you’re still under contract with them. It’s possible to have your phone unlocked by a third party, but doing so typically voids your phone’s warranty."

A SIM (subscriber identity module) card is a tiny card that slides into your phone (often close to the battery) that gives the phone its phone number and access to service. Go to a mobile phone store in Mexico and buy a SIM card for one of the major Mexican cell phone carriers — Telcel, Virgin Mobile, Movistar, or AT&T. This is a great option if the international roaming rates for your normal cell phone provider are not affordable. You will get a new phone number when you insert a new SIM card, so be sure to tell your family and friends in the United States what your Mexican phone number is."

Make sure your internet connection is strong in order to have the best quality call! While on a voice call, you can switch to a video call by tapping “Video Call” and then selecting “SWITCH.” If the person you’re calling accepts the switch, the call will shift from an audio to a video call. Add up to 4 participants to create a group voice call. If you have 3 other friends that you want to include in the conversation, no worries! While you’re on a voice call with 1 person, tap the “Add participants” options and search for another contact to add to the call. Once you find them, hit “ADD.” [13] X Research source"
