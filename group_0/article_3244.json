Successful students know how to succeed because they’ve made their studies their top priority. Though it’s important to make time for friends, family, extracurricular activities, and even some solo down time, you should never neglect the time you need to spend studying. If you have an important exam coming up and don’t feel prepared, then you should probably skip the big party two days before it. If you’re really behind on your French, then you may need to skip that new episode of Criminal Minds for the time being. This doesn’t mean that you can never do the things you want to do, but that you should recognize when studying should be at the top of your list. [2] X Research source That said, you can’t ignore everything in the world just so you can study. If a friend or family member is having a crisis, you can’t ditch him or her just to study, either."

Cheating won’t get you anywhere, and what may seem like a shortcut one day can actually get you into a lot of trouble the next. It’s never worth it to cheat on a test, and you’re far better off not doing well on an exam you’re not prepared for than getting caught cheating. Even if you’re not caught, cheating makes you think it’s okay to take shortcuts when it comes to life and studying, and it can lead to some bad habits down the line. Don’t fall into peer pressure, either. In some schools, cheating is considered the norm, and it seems like so many kids are doing it that you might as well join in. This kind of group thinking is very dangerous and can keep you from reaching your full potential."

[4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Successful students stay focused on the task at hand. If you have to study one chapter of your history book for an hour, you need to commit to doing so instead of letting your mind wander. If you need a break, take a short 10 minute one, but don’t let it run over into an hour long break with only 10 minutes of studying. You can actually train your mind to concentrate for longer and longer periods of time, so even if you feel like you can’t focus for more than 15 minutes straight, just work on building up to 20 minutes, and then building up to 30 minutes and so on.

They don’t care what their brother, neighbor, or lab partner does in school because they know that in the end, all that matters is their own success. If you get too bogged down in what other people are doing, then you’re bound to be disappointed in yourself or to become so competitive that your mind gets poisoned. Learn to brush the others aside and to focus on doing the best that you can do. Don't compare yourself with anyone. With this, you are insulting yourself."

They actually care and are interested in the material that they study, and their passion for knowledge helps them improve. Of course, you can’t get excited about every little thing you’re learning, from photosynthesis to linear equations, but you can try to find something that you care about in every class. [9] X Expert Source Sean Alexander, MS Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 14 May 2020. This will keep you focused and will make it more fun for you to learn. If you really find something you’re passionate about in class, then you should do some outside reading to get even more excited about the topic. For example, if you loved reading The Sun Also Rises in class, try reading A Movable Feast or some of Hemingway’s other works on your own, too."

While you don’t have to love every single subject that comes your way, you should be motivated enough to listen to your teachers, to avoid texting your friends, and to be focused enough to really hear what your teacher is telling you, and to be able to pick up on the most important aspects of each lesson. In order to pay attention, it’s important to keep your eye on the teacher. If you’re confused about something, you can quickly ask for clarification.

If you really want to succeed in the classroom, then it’s important that you ask your teachers questions, when it’s appropriate, in order to get a stronger understanding of the material. You shouldn’t interrupt the lessons, but you should ask questions if you really have them in order to avoid being confused and to prepare for your exams. Asking questions will also keep you active in the discussion and will help you learn the material, too. At the end of each class, you can also review your notes and prepare questions to ask the next time if anything is unclear. Some teachers want you to wait until the end of the lecture to ask questions. If this is the case with your teacher, be respectful of that."

Participating will also help you develop a good relationship with your teachers, which will also help you in the classroom. You don’t have to raise your hand after every question, but you should make an effort to talk when you have something to say. Remember the principle of 3-3-3. In every class, answer at least 3 questions. This may boost up your participation scores. Participation is important in group work, too. Successful students work well by themselves and with others."

You can reward yourself by talking to your friends, reading your magazines, or doing whatever else you do for fun later, but you can’t let it get in the way of your study habits. If other students are an easy distraction or you feel like you might just talk to them because you're bored of the current topic, ask the teacher if you could move seats. If not, try your best to ignore the distraction and if they continue, ask them politely to stop. Try not to think about one class when you’re sitting in another.

This will help you focus since it’ll be harder to get distracted or to do something other than pay attention when the teacher is right there. It’ll also help you build a stronger bond with your teacher, especially if you’re in a large lecture hall, because teachers tend to engage more with the people who are sitting in front.

It’s important to be aware of your learning style so that you can best tailor your studying to suit your needs. Many people are actually a combination of different learners, so multiple styles may appeal to you. Here are some of the most common learning styles and some tips for studying: Visual learners. If you’re a visual learner, then you learn by using images, pictures, and spatial understanding. Charts, diagrams, and color-coded notes may work best for you. When you take notes, flow charts or even some relevant drawings may be more effective than large blocks of words. Auditory learners. These types of learners learn best by listening. Try recording your lectures and repeating them, or really honing in on your teacher's words and taking some notes later. You can also repeat your notes or the course materials to yourself or talk to experts or participate in group discussion to study more effectively. Physical or kinesthetic learners. These learners learn best when they use their bodies, their hands, and their senses of touch. You can learn by tracing words to reinforce the subject matter, memorizing notes by walking, or by using any activities that make you move around or touch things while learning."

No one can study for eight hours straight, not even that one person who is super driven or has an IV of coffee steadily pumping in his veins.

Plan to take a break every 60 or 90 minutes, and do something that will allow you to rest your eyes, have some nourishment, or get some fresh air. Taking breaks help to break down the data you have remembered into chunks. You may do the following during your break: [17] X Research source Listening to music. Reading a book. Having a nap. Take a shower. Play video games. Surf on social media. Successful students know when they need to rest. They can sense when they’re getting tired or when studying is no longer productive.

Though it can be impossible to avoid distractions entirely, you can make an effort to minimize them before you even sit down to study, which will help you focus and not get off-track. You can even disable your Internet if you don’t need it to study to keep yourself from being distracted. If you really don’t need your phone, you can turn it off, too. If something is worrying you, then devote time to figuring it out and then get back to your studies if you can. If you feel bothered all day, then you won’t be able to get your work done."
