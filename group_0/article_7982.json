      "content": "Locate the printer rollers. On inkjet printers, the printer rollers are typically located on the bottom, just above the paper tray. You can usually find them if you remove the paper tray and look right above where the paper tray used to be. [1] X Research source The rollers should rotate manually when you apply pressure to them. If not, you will need to use the “feed paper” option on your printer to rotate them. Either way, you shouldn’t need to remove them entirely for the cleaning process."

      "content": "Clean rollers with a lint-free cloth and water. Pour some distilled water into a cup and dip your lint-free cloth into it. You want the cloth to be damp but not soaking wet.
