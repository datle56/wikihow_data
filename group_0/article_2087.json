When you're sitting next to her, look into her eyes. If they're lustful and scream that she's dying to get closer to you, go in for the kill. If they're saying, \"What the hell are you doing?\" it's time to back off. A lot of understanding Virgo will be reading her. Sometimes you'll be wrong, but if you've built up a friendship, you should be pretty good at this by now. But if worse comes to worse, you could openly ask her! She'll appreciate your directness as long as you're tactful and diplomatic."

She needs someone who can help calm her down, to be her rock. If you can do this, there will be no way she can let you go. When you see her thinking, ask her what's going on. If she doesn't open up, don't leave. She may just be feeling the waters or uncomfortable asking for assistance. Let her know you're there if and when she needs you. When you get to know her well, odds are you'll have a grip on at least a few of the reasons she's worried. Try to make her plate less full by picking up the slack. Does she need to run errands?
