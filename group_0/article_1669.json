If you find yourself exploring bodies of water frequently, this enchantment can help you ignore the speed penalty of being underwater whether you're looking for caves or materials. Mining faster also means you won't need to come up for air as frequently. While you should still keep an eye on your oxygen level, you can make far more progress than without the enchantment. If you want to stay underwater for longer, you can also add the Respiration enchantment to the helmet. You may want to make an underwater home if you want a base that is safe from explosions and most mobs."
