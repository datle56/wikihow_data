      "content": "Prepare the potatoes for roasting. Wash the potatoes with cold water, taking care to scrub off dirt and other debris. Cut each potato into bite sized pieces; for small potatoes, cutting each one in half should be sufficient. Because the skin of new potatoes is so thin, there's no need to peel it. Use a paring knife to cut off any bruised or pitted parts from the potatoes."
