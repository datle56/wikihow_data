      "content": "See your doctor before trying to clean your ears at home. Humans are supposed to have earwax — it has the important job of protecting our ears from bacteria and fungus. It’s rare to have so much earwax that it has to be removed; however, if you have ear pain, a feeling of fullness or pressure in your ear, or hearing loss, see your doctor to make sure that the problem is excessive earwax and not something else. Earwax removal is most safely done by a healthcare professional.

If your doctor okays it, you can proceed to using peroxide at home. Ask for advice on selecting and using at-home ear cleaning products."

[5] X Research source Fill two bowls with hot water. Place the bottle of peroxide in one, and the bottle of oil in the other. Let them sit for a few minutes to warm. You could also put the oil and peroxide into two smaller bowls and place those in the hot water. Test the temperature of the oil and peroxide on the skin of your hand before putting it into your ear. It should be warm, not hot."

Allow the oil to sit in your ear, with your head tilted, for about 3 minutes. [6] X Research source Do not push the dropper deep into your ear canal. Insert the tip gently into your ear and let the oil drop or roll down to your eardrum."

      "content": "Flush the wax out with warm water. When the bubbling has stopped and time is up, draw up some warm water with your bulb syringe. Tilt the ear you are cleaning over your sink. Hold the bulb syringe at a 45° angle to your ear, and gently squirt the warm water into your ear canal. Pull your outer ear up and back with your other hand — this straightens your ear canal and will let the water in better.

You can try repeating the process over several days. See your doctor if your symptoms don’t improve after several attempts. Once your ears are clean, you can do this cleaning process once a month. If you often struggle with excess earwax (and not another ear problem), you can use oil weekly to soften the wax. Use two to three drops in each ear, and flush it out with warm water. Peroxide is probably too drying to use weekly."

If you get swimmer’s ear often and it’s been diagnosed by your doctor in the past, cleaning your ears with peroxide occasionally may help prevent infection. You can also try putting two to three drops of oil in each ear before swimming as a protective measure."

Peroxide can be very drying, which can be irritating if you’re prone to breakouts or skin reactions. If peroxide is drying your ear canals, try adding a few drops of mineral or baby oil to the peroxide. [10] X Research source If that doesn’t help, use an alternate method to clean your ears. You can try warm water alone or a saline solution, instead. Make a saline solution by dissolving ½ teaspoon of salt in a cup of boiled water. [11] X Research source"

You may also have a feeling of fullness or pressure in your ear, or a fever.

Suspect that your eardrum has ruptured if you have increasing pain or pressure in your ear, followed by quick relief from pain, drainage from your ear, and loss of hearing. See your doctor right away — ruptured eardrums usually heal by themselves, but they might need to be repaired surgically. In the meantime, keep your ear clean and dry. [13] X Research source You should not use peroxide if you have ear tubes, or tympanostomy tubes. Some people get small hollow tubes surgically implanted in their eardrum as a child if they have frequent ear infections. Don't use peroxide if you've ever had ear surgery."
