      "content": "Use your imagination to help your bio stand out. Who says your Bumble bio has to be one thing or another? It’s your profile, after all!

Just make sure you’re not putting other people down or making rude, disrespectful remarks."

    {
      "title": "Highlight your best attributes.",
      "content": "Highlight your best attributes. If you’re stuck on which bio to use, stick to the one that shows the best version of yourself. Which shows your personality best? If you’re unsure how to describe yourself, ask a friend for help! Think of your Bumble bio as a sales pitch for yourself. If you saw an ad advertising you, what would it say? Use keywords that describe your passions and interests and get more matches. For instance, if you’re a gym rat, include the word “fitness” somewhere in your bio. If you’re in college, use terms like “student” or “major.”"

    {
      "title": "Keep it brief.",
      "content": "Keep it brief. When writing a Bumble bio , ditch the details and aim for clarity. Try to avoid long, windy paragraphs. The clearer and more concise you are, the better. Think of it this way: the shorter your bio is, the easier it’ll be for people to read it."

    {
      "title": "Let your profile picture speak for itself.",
      "content": "Let your profile picture speak for itself. Your picture is undeniably the most important part of your Bumble bio. To make the best first impression, pick a picture that only showcases you and represents your personality. Avoid using a picture of you and your buddies as your main profile pic, as potential dates may not know which guy you are in the group. Use a photo with flattering lighting. For instance, don’t pick the selfie you took in the dark while camping last summer. Choose a pic that showcases your talents or hobby. For example, if you play guitar, aim for a photo of you on stage performing."

    {
      "title": "Be upfront about your intentions.",
      "content": "Be upfront about your intentions. When putting your Bumble profile together , make sure you know what you’re seeking. Are you looking for a life-long partner? Do you have more interest in casual dating? Try to put what you’re seeking in your profile so people know what to expect right away.
