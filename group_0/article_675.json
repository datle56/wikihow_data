      "title": "Pour 2 bottles of clear or glitter school glue into a bowl.",
      "content": "Pour 2 bottles of clear or glitter school glue into a bowl. Do not use regular white school glue. It has different ingredients and won’t react with liquid starch the same way clear or glitter school glue does. [1] X Research source Most bottles of school glue are about 5 ounces (150 mL). Keep this in mind, as this will affect how much liquid starch you use. You can make a smaller batch of slime using just 1 bottle of glue. You’ll use less liquid starch as a result. If you are using clear school glue, remember: you can always add glitter to it later!"

    {
      "title": "Stir in extra glitter with a spoon, if desired.",
      "content": "Stir in extra glitter with a spoon, if desired. How much glitter you use is up to you. Start with about 1 tablespoon, then add more until you get the look you want. Extra-fine glitter will work and look much better than the regular chunky kind. [2] X Research source If you are using glittery school glue, you probably already have enough glitter. If you want your slime to be more colorful, add 8 to 12 drops of food coloring. This is enough for 2 bottles of glue. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Stir in your fragrance oil, essential oil, or extract.",
      "content": "Stir in your fragrance oil, essential oil, or extract. These are not interchangeable, and you will need to use different amounts for each. Choose your desired fragrance, then stir it into the glue. The amounts listed below are for 2 bottles of glue; if you used a different amount, adjust it accordingly. Baking extract: 2 to 4 teaspoons. This is your basic almond, lemon, mint, or vanilla extract. You can get it in the baking section of a grocery store. [4] X Research source Candy-making flavoring oil: 2 vials. You can buy this in the candy-making section of a craft store. It comes packs of 2 tiny bottles. You will need to use both tiny bottles. Essential oil: 8 drops. Buy it in a health food store or in the soap-making section of a craft store. Vanilla, lemon, mint, and lavender are great choices. [5] X Research source Fragrance oil: 1/2 teaspoon. This is similar to essential oil, but less potent. Make sure that it is skin-safe. Soap-making fragrance oils will be the best."

      "content": "Stir in 5 to 10 ounces (150 to 300 mL) of liquid starch. Start with 5 ounces (150 mL) of liquid starch. Pour it into the glue, then stir it in. If the consistency is not quite right, add more liquid starch. [6] X Research source Don’t use more than 10 ounces (300 mL) of liquid starch altogether. If you used a different amount of glue, use half of what you used for the glue. For example, if you used 5 ounces (150 mL) of glue, use 2.5 ounces (75 mL) of liquid starch."

      "content": "Take the slime out and knead it for about 2 to 3 minutes. There may be some starch left in the bowl, which is fine. The starch is simply there to activate the slime ingredients. The glue will pick up what it needs to turn into slime, and leave the rest behind. [7] X Research source As you knead the slime, it will take on a more putty-like consistency. Make sure that your hands are clean and dry for this."

      "title": "Adjust the consistency, if needed.",
      "content": "Adjust the consistency, if needed. Again, this is mostly up to your preferences. If the slime is too sticky for you, add more liquid starch. If the slime is too stiff or rubbery, add more glue. Be sure to knead the slime well after each addition that you make! [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Store the slime in an airtight container. Because this slime is homemade, it won’t last as long as store-bought slime. It will last about 2 to 3 days, though it may last up to 4 days. Slime will start to dry out as it gets old. If it becomes too hard to play with and loses its stretch and ooze, it's time to toss it."

Keep in mind that you can always add glitter and/or food coloring later to white or clear school glue.

Plan on using about 4 to 6 drops of food coloring. [12] X Research source You don’t need to add food coloring into glitter school glue because it already has color in it."

      "content": "Stir the Borax solution into the glue, then wait 1 minute. The glue won’t absorb all of the Borax solution, which is fine. Simply pour the Borax solution into the glue, then give it a quick stir. Set the bowl aside for 1 minute. [13] X Research source During this time, the ingredients will come together and start to polymerize."

Simply reach into the bowl and squish and knead the slime. Try to pick up as much of the Borax water as you can. [14] X Research source There may still be some Borax water left in the bowl, which is fine. The glue will have picked up everything it needed in order to turn into slime."

      "content": "Keep the slime in an airtight container. Homemade slime isn't exactly the same as store-bought slime, so it won't last quite as long. Expect your slime to last about 4 to 5 days. Slime hardens the older it gets, so when your slime starts to lose its stretch, toss it."
