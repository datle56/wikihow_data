      "content": "Tie each jean leg in a bunch with rubber bands. This will help give your jeans the patchy, tie-dye like appearance of acid washed jeans. Work with one jean leg at a time, tying parts of the legs with rubber bands. [1] X Research source There is no exact method for tying the jean legs. It depends on the kind of pattern you want. If you want a very tie-dyed appearance, twist your jeans in multiple places up and down each leg and secure these twists with rubber bands. If you want a less chaotic look, only twist and secure a few parts of the jeans. You can try concentrating on a particular area, like the lower legs or knees. Once you've added as many twists as you want, roll up each pant leg. Use a large rubber band to secure each pant leg in a tight roll. Your jeans should now be tied together in a small, lumpy bunch."
