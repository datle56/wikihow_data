      "content": "Select fruits and vegetables that are in season. When fruits and vegetables are in season, they tend to cost less. Additionally, grocery stores often run sales on seasonal produce because they know customers expect certain fruits and veggies at certain times of the year. As an added bonus, when things are in season, they usually taste better. Another tip: don’t be afraid of bruised fruits and vegetables. Surface imperfections do not impact the taste or health of the item. [3] X Research source In the fall , look for apples, pumpkins, spinach, grapes, and green beans. In the winter , look for winter squash, cabbage, root vegetables (beets, carrots), and grapefruit. In the spring , look for Swiss chard, spring onions, asparagus, strawberries, and pineapple. In the summer , look for melons, corn, berries, zucchini, tomatoes, and summer squash. You'll likely notice the cheapest produce prices in summer. So, this is a good time to buy extra and freeze what you don’t use (or can it yourself )."

[8] X Research source Registered dietitian-nutritionist Kelly Gomez agrees that plant-based foods are a great way to add protein to your diet. She says one package of tofu has “close to 30 grams of protein.” Gomez also says “peanut butter, almond butter,” “quinoa, rice, [and] beans…have a lot of protein in them as well.”"

For instance, buying a large can of oatmeal is typically much cheaper than buying a box of instant packets. Just buy items you know you’ll use to ensure you get their savings. [9] X Research source Stick to buying frozen foods and non-perishable items in bulk so they don’t spoil before you can use them up. For instance, buy pasta, beans, rice, oatmeal, canned goods, meat, and frozen produce. Some health food stores allow you to buy select items in bulk bins. These stores often have items like grains, beans, pasta, nuts, granola, flour, and sugar. You can get just what you need and take advantage of the cheaper prices. Avoid buying bulk items just because they’re a deal—if you won’t use them, it’s not worth the price tag. For instance, don’t buy a huge tub of mayonnaise that you will never use up before it expires, or a bargain box of cereal that no one in your family eats."

However, you can save more money by checking each item’s unit price , which is the cost of the item per ounce (or other unit of measurement). A larger item might cost more than a smaller item but its unit price might be less, which means that buying the larger item gives you a bigger bang for your buck. [10] X Research source For example, say you’re looking at a 32 oz item that costs $2 and a 10 oz item that costs $0.80. The unit price for the 32 oz item is $0.06 and the unit price for the 10 oz item is $0.08. So, the 32 oz is the better buy! Be vigilant when checking prices, as they change all the time. Occasionally there is a sale on a certain package size or product that changes what the most affordable option is.

If you don't already have healthy recipes you love, find some you like online, in recipe books, or ask your friends for recommendations. [24] X Trustworthy Source US Department of Agriculture U.S. agency responsible for promoting good agricultural practices and protecting consumers Go to source For instance, check out the USDA's MyPlate website . It has healthy recipes that you can use to plan meals. Or, look for recipes here on wikiHow ! Don't forget to plan around your schedule. Opt for quick meals or leftovers on nights when you're going to be busy. To help plan quick, healthy dinners, registered dietitian-nutritionist Dina García recommends using her acronym PF3, which stands for “Protein, Fiber, Fat, and Fun.” She says “my favorite thing to do is skillet meals” to incorporate PF3 easily. For instance, she likes to cook ground turkey, potatoes, and broccoli and top it with cheese. Or, cook “shrimp, whole wheat penne pasta, some vegetables,” and top it with “pesto sauce.” Certified holistic health coach Theresa Fitzpatrick says, “Frozen meals are a handy option, especially if you are too busy to prep and cook.” To ensure they’re healthy, she just says to “watch out for…the sodium content, fat content, sugar content, and added chemicals.”"

You'll be more likely to keep eating healthy, and you'll save money at the same time. If you’re having trouble sticking to a healthier diet, Coleman recommends “start[ing] with one thing at a time.” For instance, she says to “start with breakfast, or start with one small change, and then build on that rather than trying to overhaul everything at once.”"

While you don't need to completely cut animal protein out of your diet, opting for more plant-based options can help cut costs. For instance, cook a smaller portion of ground beef and supplement it with black beans and brown rice for a taco night. [27] X Research source Some other ideas for extending meat with vegetables, plant-based proteins, grains, and complex carbohydrates include stir frys, burritos, soups, and pasta dishes. If you want to go vegetarian or vegan, Coleman says to “make sure that every single time you eat, you're still getting protein in there.” For instance, “instead of just an apple, have an apple and some nuts. Instead of oatmeal, add some hemp seeds or peanut butter to it,” and “instead of just pasta, you can do a lentil-based pasta that has a little bit more protein to it.” Some vegetarian equivalents to 1 ounce of meat include an egg; ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of beans, peas, or lentils; ½ ounce (14 grams) of nuts or seeds; 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of peanut butter; or 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of hummus.
