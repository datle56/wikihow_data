If you're cooking a full pound of bacon, it may take up to 15 minutes. [8] X Research source To avoid splattering the microwave with grease, you can lightly cover the bacon with a few paper towels. Rotate the microwave plate at 10 minutes. This will ensure even cooking of the bacon. Or, if you don't like your bacon crisp, take it out at this point. Be careful! The plate is hot and the hot grease has dripped onto it. Keep checking the crispness to see if it's to your liking."

Carefully take it from the microwave and put it down on a heat-safe surface. Use tongs to take the bacon slices off the bowl and lay them out flat on a paper towel. If you let the bacon slices cool on the bowl, they will form a \"U\" shape for serving. Be very careful not to spill the bacon grease as you remove the plate from the microwave."
