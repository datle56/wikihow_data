  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Put a single line of verse in quotation marks.",
      "content": "Put a single line of verse in quotation marks. If you are only citing 1 line of verse from a work by Shakespeare, use quotation marks around the line of verse. Make sure you include all punctuation in the quotation marks. [1] X Research source For example, you may write, “Prospero feels doomed by his decision, stating: ‘Hell is empty.’”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use slashes when quoting 2-3 lines of verse.",
      "content": "Use slashes when quoting 2-3 lines of verse. If you are using a quote that contains more than 1 line of verse, separate each line with a slash (/). This will help the reader understand the verses appear on separate lines. You need to put a space on either side of the slash. [2] X Research source For example, you may write, “In the play, Prospero refers to the temporality of life, noting: ‘We are such stuff as dreams are made on/and our little life is rounded with a sleep.’”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Set more than 3 lines of verse in block quotes.",
      "content": "Set more than 3 lines of verse in block quotes. If you are including a longer quotation from the play that spans 3 or more lines, start the quotation on a new line, 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the left margin. Do not use quotations around the quote. [3] X Research source For example, you may write, \"The character Ariel tries to soothe with a song that describes fear as fleeting: Full fathom five thy father lies; Of his bones are coral made; Those are pearls that were his eyes: Nothing of him that doth fade, But doth suffer a sea-change Into something rich and strange. Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell: Ding-dong Hark! now I hear them,—Ding-dong, bell.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Use block quotes to quote dialogue between characters.",
      "content": "Use block quotes to quote dialogue between characters. Apply the same block quote formatting, 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the left margin. Begin each section of dialogue with the character’s name in capital letters. Put a period after the character’s name, followed by the quotation. Indent any subsequent lines spoken by the character 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) from the left margin. Start a new line when the dialogue shifts to a new character and do not use quotation marks. [4] X Research source For example, you may write: \"The play’s first moment of betrayal involves two characters abandoning their authority figure: ANTONIO. Let's all sink wi' th' king. SEBASTIAN. Let's take leave of him.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Place parentheses at the end of the quotation.",
      "content": "Place parentheses at the end of the quotation. In-text citations should always appear at the end of the quotation in parentheses, even if you are citing 3 or more lines of text in a block quote. The quotation should appear after the last line in the block quote. [5] X Research source For example, you may write, “Prospero feels doomed by his decision, stating: ‘Hell is empty/and all the devils are here.’ (1.2.15-16.)” An example with block quotes would be, \"The play’s first moment of betrayal involves two characters abandoning their authority figure: ANTONIO. Let's all sink wi' th' king. SEBASTIAN. Let's take leave of him. (1.1.4-5)\""

      "title": "Abbreviate and italicize the title of the play.",
      "content": "Abbreviate and italicize the title of the play. Start the in-text citation with the title of the play. Abbreviate the title of the play according to the MLA guidelines and italicize the abbreviation. [6] X Research source You can find a complete list of abbreviations for the titles of Shakespeare’s plays on Internet Shakespeare Editions: http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Foyer/guidelines/abbreviations/ . If you are only discussing one play by Shakespeare in your paper and you refer to the play once already in your paper, you do not need to include an abbreviation of the title in subsequent citations. For example, you may write a citation from Macbeth as, “A good example of foreshadowing is spoken by the second witch, ‘By the pricking of my thumbs,/Something wicked this way comes.’ ( Mac . 4.1.57-58)” Or, if you have already referred to the play once, you leave the “Mac” out of the citation, using just the numbers, “(4.1.57-58).”"

You do not need to include the words “act,” “scene,” or “line,” in the citation, just the numbers. Use a dash between the line numbers if the quotation spans more than one line. [7] X Research source For example, you may write, “A good example of foreshadowing is spoken by the second witch, ‘By the pricking of my thumbs,/Something wicked this way comes.’ (4.1.57-58.)” This means the quotation comes from Act 4, scene 1, lines 57-58."

Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1974. 1306-42. Print.” For an anthology with more than one volume, you would note the volume number you accessed: “Shakespeare, William. As You Like It .
