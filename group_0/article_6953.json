      "content": "Character flaws are negative aspects of a character’s personality. They affect characters in undesirable ways, though some flaws aren’t as negative as others. They range from slightly detrimental to extremely harmful! For example, a boring character isn’t fun to be around, but there’s nothing truly bad about them. By contrast, a murderous character is (for obvious reasons) much more dangerous and villainous. [1] X Research source All character flaws typically have consequences of some kind, depending on how severe the flaw is (and the character in question). Character flaws can also manifest differently based on the personality of each character and their role in the story. Overall, there are three categories of character flaws: minor, major, and fatal. Your characters can have flaws from multiple categories if you want."

      "content": "Major character flaws Major character flaws are pretty serious and will definitely impact a character's story (and life) in a big way. Major flaws can be emotional, mental, or physical, and a character may end up trying to atone for their flaws or simply overcome them over the course of the story; they’re significant but not necessarily unforgivable.

      "title": "Fatal character flaws",
      "content": "Fatal character flaws Fatal flaws are usually reserved for the villains in a story. “Fatal” can be literal (resulting in the character’s death) or figurative (meaning the flaw can lead to a character’s downfall), and some people may consider fatal flaws unforgivable, whether or not the character attempts to atone for their flaws in the story.

      "content": "Figure out what kind of arc you want the character to have. There are three main types of character arcs: positive, flat, and negative. You can choose to address your character’s flaws in many ways depending on the type of arc you choose. Positive arcs involve characters ultimately overcoming their flaws, negative arcs involve characters succumbing to their flaws, and flat arcs involve little to no significant change. [5] X Research source Positive arc : In a positive arc, an arrogant character might learn to appreciate and work with others while gaining a more humble view of themselves. Flat arc : In a flat arc, an arrogant character might be no more or less self-important than they were at the story's beginning; instead, the story reflects how their arrogance affects other characters. Negative arc : In a negative arc, an arrogant character might sink deeper into their arrogance, becoming convinced that they’re the only person who can do something and refusing to listen to or cooperate with others."

      "content": "Give the character strengths to balance their weaknesses. A character should also have corresponding strengths for each flaw—especially since the two are often related. So, when choosing your character’s flaws, consider what strengths they’d have based on each flaw and how each strength or flaw would manifest. [6] X Research source For example, a hedonistic character could also be fun-loving, enthusiastic, or worldly. A skeptical character could also be smart, knowledgable, and difficult to trick or deceive. An arrogant character could also be very skilled and accomplished (to reflect their self-importance)."

      "content": "Incorporate the character flaw into the plot of your story. Don’t make all your characters’ flaws random or unrelated to the story. Figure out how their flaws affect the narrative and how they can have an arc based on those flaws throughout the story. Remember: a character can have quirks or benign flaws, but they should also have a couple of larger flaws that affect their journey. [7] X Research source For example, a character’s cynicism or skepticism might prevent them from getting closer to their love interest. Similarly, a character’s pride might make it harder to work with others until they encounter a setback they can’t overcome alone."

      "title": "Embrace your character’s flaws rather than trying to avoid them.",
      "content": "Embrace your character’s flaws rather than trying to avoid them. No character, even a story's protagonist, should feel utterly perfect or without flaws. Try not to worry about making your character unlikable—because a “likable” character isn’t one with no faults. Don’t be afraid to pick major (and sometimes fatal) flaws for your characters to make them more engaging! [8] X Research source For example, a character whose only flaws are being clumsy and talkative won’t have many interesting conflicts because those flaws are so minor. Conversely, if you give a character compelling flaws (like being short-tempered, vengeful, selfish, or hedonistic) on top of their minor flaws, readers are more likely to get invested in their journey."
