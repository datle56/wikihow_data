      "content": "Get the most out of your workout with compound exercises. Exercises that work the main muscle groups (compound exercises) will give you the most significant gains in muscle mass and boost your metabolic rate. For instance, the bench press works your pectorals, your triceps, and your deltoids in a single exercise. An isolated exercise like a tricep kickback will work only your tricep. Compound exercises hit more muscle fibers with each lift, so you get a lot of bang for your buck. [2] X Expert Source Laila Ajani Fitness Trainer Expert Interview. 31 October 2019. Try creating a compound exercise routine with a 4 day upper/lower split or a 3 day full body split to avoid overworking your muscles, which often happens with isolated exercises. Use isolated exercises to tweak your muscle growth an appearance once you have already met your goals. Back squats and Bulgarian split squats are other great compound exercises that you can try.

      "content": "Build the muscle in your legs and buttocks. To add muscle mass to your lower body, you need to do exercises that target the large muscles in your thighs, calves, and hips. When it comes to building muscles, heavy weights (or high resistance) and low repetitions are the key (while the opposite is true if you are trying to improve your endurance). To build the muscles in your thighs, you need to do exercises that focus on the hamstrings, quadriceps, and hip adductors, such as different variations of lunges, squats, and step ups. [4] X Research source Back squats, front squats, and Bulgarian split squats are some excellent thigh-strengthening exercises you can try during your next workout. [5] X Expert Source Laila Ajani Fitness Trainer Expert Interview. 31 October 2019. Deadlifts and glute bridges are great ways to strengthen your glutes. [6] X Expert Source Laila Ajani Fitness Trainer Expert Interview. 31 October 2019. To build the muscles in your calves (gastrocnemius, soleus, and tibialis anterior), do standing or seated calf raises. [7] X Research source The muscles in your hips and buttocks (gluteus maximus, abductors, flexors, and deep external rotators) are engaged with some of the same exercises as your legs (such as squats and lunges), but to add more specific exercises to target these muscles, try hip extensions and leg presses. [8] X Research source You should do these exercises using resistance that is heavy enough that you can only do 4 to 8 repetitions max. If you can easily do 8 or more reps, you are probably using too low resistance and are building endurance instead of bulking up your muscles. Note for teens: always consult a trainer and a pediatrician before engaging these exercises. Your body is still growing and developing so avoid high intensity and weights."

[9] X Research source There are a vast variety of exercises you can choose from to build these muscles. Try the different rows (such as bent-over rows, lying rows, and seated rows) or do pull-ups, chin-ups, pulldowns, and shrugs. These exercises can be done using free weights and exercise machines or even just rubber bands or body weight. Strengthening your back muscles can help improve your posture as well. Pull-ups and chin-ups are some of the best exercises for strengthening your back, but if they're too difficult for you right now, start with a dead hang; grip the pull-up bar, lift your feet off the ground, and hang with your arms straight for 10 seconds.

Use whey protein immediately after workout to replenish your muscles and promote muscle growth. Be sure to get high-quality protein from foods as well and not just from whey protein. Adults can use 20–30 grams (0.71–1.1 oz) of whey protein per day, without exceeding 1.2 grams (0.04 oz) per body weight (kg). Higher doses have been used but should be done with caution and only limited amount of time. Children should get 0.8–1 gram (0.03–0.04 oz) of protein per body weight (kg) per day.

However, you should not forget cardio exercises entirely as these strengthen your cardiorespiratory system and have numerous other health benefits, including improving bone strength, reducing blood pressure, reducing risk of chronic illnesses (diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular conditions), and improved mood. Also keep in mind that reducing overall body fat with cardio can cause muscles to \"pop,\" and your body can look leaner and stronger. The key when planning cardio routine during muscle-building season is to do shorter sprints instead of long, aerobic workouts. Focus on 20 minute high-intensity exercises with 30 to 60 second high-intensity sprints followed by 1 minute rests. Do your cardio separately from your weight training workout. Never do your cardio after the weight training workout but reserve it to a separate day. Limit the amount of cardio workouts to 20 minute workouts 3 to 5 times a week."
