Use the value in the equation v a v = x f − x i t f − t i {\\displaystyle v_{av}={\\frac {x_{f}-x_{i}}{t_{f}-t_{i}}}} , or \"final position - initial position divided by final time - initial time.” Distance isn’t always the same as displacement, so check that you’re using the correct value. [1] X Research source This equation is often written as V = D t {\\displaystyle V={\\frac {D}{t}}} , or “velocity equals displacement over time.” If you’re not given the time period and displacement, you’ll have to find those values from your problem. Example 1: A car traveling due east starts at position x = 5 meters. After 8 seconds, the car is at position x = 41 meters. What was the car's displacement? The car was displaced by (41m - 5m) = 36 meters east. Example 2: A ball is thrown 3 meters straight into the air, then falls downward for 5 meters before hitting the ground. What is the diver's displacement? The ball ended up 2 meters below the starting point, so the displacement is 2 meters downward, or -2 meters. (0 + 5 - 3 = -2). Even though the ball traveled 8 meters (3 up, then 5 down), what matters is that the endpoint is two meters below the start point."

If the object turns at some point, you may need to draw a diagram and solve a geometry problem to find the distance . Example 3: A man jogs for 3 meters east, then makes a 90º turn and travels 4 meters north. What is his displacement? Draw a diagram and connect the start and end points with a straight line. This is the hypotenuse of a triangle, so solve for the length of this line using properties of right triangles . In this case, the displacement is 5 meters northeast. At some point, your math teacher may require you to find the exact direction traveled (the angle above the horizontal). You can do this by using geometry or by adding vectors."

Circular velocity refers to the velocity that one object must travel to maintain its circular orbit around another object, usually a planet or other gravitating mass.

[26] X Research source Alexander notes that many people struggle to visualize what a “meter per second per second” really is. If you think about the units for velocity as a fraction (meters over seconds), and then think of “per second” as a fraction, 1 /second, you can divide m/s by 1 /s, and get m/s 2 .
