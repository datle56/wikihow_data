      "content": "Check for compatibility between signs. As a general rule, zodiac signs that fall under the domain of Fire are believed to have the greatest compatibility with those of Air, while Water and Earth signs make the best pairings with their respective qualities.

Examples of strong compatibility through the zodiac include Pisces and Capricorn, Sagittarius and Aquarius, and even Virgo and Virgo—people of a certain sign are often quite compatible with another of their kind.

Much of astrological compatibility has to be put to the test in reality, with the symbolism of the signs acting as guidelines."
