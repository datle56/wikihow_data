Gloss: Similar to the style of paper you use for printing photographs, Gloss determines how much light is reflected on the surface. Choose between Matte and Shiny. Material: Material decides if the object color or the light color is more prevalent. You decide on a scale between Plastic and Metallic. Plastic shows the light's color, while Metallic reflects the object's color more. Exposure: Similar to a photograph, exposure decides if the light is negative or positive. Increasing the exposure will lighten the photograph. Ambience: Ambience diffuses the light between different light sources. Similar to how a large light bulb diffuses in a room."
