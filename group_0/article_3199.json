Even if you don’t play for one of the Big 5 conferences in college, you can still get good experience at a division 2 or 3 school. You’ll get the most exposure if you play for division 1 in the NCAA since they are normally the games shown on TV and from the most prominent schools. Look into schools in the Big 10, Big 12, or Pac 12 since they have prominent basketball programs."
