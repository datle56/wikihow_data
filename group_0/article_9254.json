If you're using a HERO3+ or older, turn Wi-Fi OFF on the camera before connecting it to your computer. There's a dedicated button to enable and disable Wi-Fi on the side of the camera.

      "content": "Connect the GoPro to your computer. Use the cable that came with your GoPro. Attach the end with the USB mini-jack to your camera, and plug the USB jack into a vacant port on your computer. When the GoPro recognizes the USB connection to your computer, it should go into USB mode, causing a USB symbol to appear on the camera's screen if your camera is equipped with one. [2] X Research source Connect the camera to one of the main USB ports on your computer rather than a USB hub or a port on your keyboard or monitor. On a Mac, a camera icon will appear on the desktop. Double-click on it to access the photos and videos stored on the camera's microSD card. In Windows, go to My Computer , then locate your GoPro in the list of available drives and double-click on it. For HERO7 and earlier GoPros, Quik for desktop (Mac and Windows) will open."

      "content": "Insert the microSD card into an adapter or a card reader that's attached to your computer. To do this step, you need either an adapter that allows your standard-sized SD card reader slot to accommodate the micro-sized chip from the GoPro or an external card reader that connects to your computer via USB, both of which you can find for purchase at almost any electronic retailer (like Best Buy). [4] X Research source If you have an adapter that you've put your microSD card into, you'll then need to insert it into the SD reader slot on your computer."

      "content": "Restart your computer and camera. If none of the previous steps help, you can try restarting everything. Unplug the camera, then restart your computer, and finally reconnect the GoPro. Quik does not support HERO7, HERO8, or HERO 9. Instead, your computer's default photo app will open if your computer reads an \"MTP\" connection between your GoPro and your computer, then it's working as intended. With your camera unplugged from your computer, you can check this setting in your camera by going to Connections > USB Connection > MTP , which allows file transfers."
