Gently brush with a short, circular motion to break up any plaque or residue that’s built up on the surface. Brush each tooth individually before moving on to the next one.

      "content": "Brush your molars with short back-and-forth strokes. Position the toothbrush so that it's perpendicular to your lips, or so that the bristles are resting on top of your bottom molars. Start on the molars furthest back in your mouth and work towards the front. Move the toothbrush with short in-and-out motions to clean them. Then, use small circular movements to loosen and eliminate bacteria on the surface. When you reach your front teeth, switch your brush to the other side of your mouth. Once you finish cleaning your bottom teeth, flip the toothbrush over and focus on your top molars. [4] X Expert Source Tu Anh Vu, DMD Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 10 April 2020. If brushing your teeth feels painful, try brushing more gently using only circular motions or switch to a toothpaste formulated for sensitive teeth . To access the outsides of your top molars, move your lower jaw to the side you are working on. This will help make more space inside of your mouth so you’re able to move your brush up and down instead of side-to-side."

      "content": "Choose a soft-bristled toothbrush . Toothbrushes with soft nylon bristles work the best for removing plaque and cleaning debris off of your teeth. Make sure the toothbrush fits comfortably in your hand, and has a head small enough to easily reach all of your teeth, especially the ones at the back. If you have difficulty fitting the toothbrush into your mouth, then it’s probably too big for you. [13] X Expert Source Tu Anh Vu, DMD Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 10 April 2020. Hard-bristled brushes can irritate your gums or scrub away tooth enamel if you apply too much pressure. Electric toothbrushes are a great choice since they vibrate to break up more plaque and usually have built-in timers so you brush for the proper amount of time. However, a manual toothbrush works just as well. [14] X Expert Source Tu Anh Vu, DMD Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 10 April 2020.

For adults and children 6 and older, choose toothpaste that has 1,350–1,500 parts per million (ppm) of fluoride. For children between 3–6, use a lower-strength toothpaste with 1,000 ppm instead. For kids under the age of 3, stick to a fluoride-free toothpaste instead. [16] X Expert Source Tu Anh Vu, DMD Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 10 April 2020. If kids are using fluoride toothpaste, supervise them while they brush their teeth. Fluoride in high doses can be toxic, so don’t allow them to swallow any. There are multiple kinds of toothpaste that target a wide variety of dental and gum problems, including preventing cavities, controlling tartar, protecting sensitive teeth and gums, and removing surface stains. Opt for the one that suits your best or ask your dentist to see what they recommend."

      "content": "Use dental floss every day before you brush. Flossing your teeth is just as important as brushing because it removes built-up plaque, bacteria, and food particles that get trapped between the teeth. Try flossing before brushing your teeth so that you’re able to brush away any food or bacteria that comes loose. [17] X Expert Source Tu Anh Vu, DMD Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 10 April 2020. Just break off a piece of floss about 1 foot (30 cm) long and gently work it between your teeth. Make the floss into a C-shape so it hugs the side of your tooth to remove plaque. [18] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Avoid snapping the floss between the teeth as this can irritate sensitive gums. If you find dental floss awkward to use or if you have braces, look for dental picks instead. These small wooden or plastic sticks fit between teeth and are easier to hold than floss. Alternatively, use flossers , which are small pieces of floss strung between 2 supports, generally with a pick at the opposite end."
