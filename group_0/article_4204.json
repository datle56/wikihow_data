      "title": "Apply conditioner in the shower.",
      "content": "Apply conditioner in the shower. This will keep your hair moisturized and help your curls stay together instead of frizzing. After you rinse out your shampoo, apply it about an inch (2.5 cm) from your roots (since your scalp's natural oils will keep your roots area conditioned) and use your fingers to comb it through to the tips. [1] X Research source Some people with curly hair opt to wash with conditioner only, since shampoo tends to dry out curly hair. Find the routine that feels right for your hair's texture. If your hair has been dry and brittle, conditioner washing might be worth a try."

    {
      "title": "Rinse out the conditioner with cool water.",
      "content": "Rinse out the conditioner with cool water. Rinsing with cool water (as cool as you can handle) is better for curly hair. It causes the hair shaft to lie flat, rather than frizzing up, resulting in sleeker curls. Taking this step will help hold your curls together when you diffuse them after showering."
    },
    {
      "title": "Gently squeeze excess water from your hair.",
      "content": "Gently squeeze excess water from your hair. Flip your hair upside down and use your hands to squeeze out the water rather than twisting or wringing it out. Again, this will help your curls stay pretty and bouncy. When you towel-dry your hair, the curls separate and frizz up. You can also gently pat or squeeze your hair with a clean t-shirt or a microfiber towel to soak up excess moisture. These will not cause frizz like a regular terrycloth towel."
    },
    {
      "title": "Smooth leave-in conditioner into your hair.",
      "content": "Smooth leave-in conditioner into your hair. This is optional, but it's a great help if your hair tends to get very dry and frizzy. Rub some leave-in conditioner between your palms and gently work it through your hair, section by section, until all of your curls are covered. If leave-in conditioner tends to weigh your hair down, try applying it to just the ends. Itâ€™s most critical to condition your ends, since they are the part of your hair most prone to frizz. Put a little conditioner in your hand and rub your palms together, then gently scrunch the ends of your hair with your hands. You can also add in a curling cream or custard at this point, as it is harder to add when your hair is dry. This is a good time to add other styling products, such as mousse, gel, or styling cream, as well."

    {
      "title": "Get your diffuser ready.",
      "content": "Get your diffuser ready. Most hair dryers come with a diffuser attachment. It looks like a wide, circular nozzle with several prongs sticking out. Attach it to your hair dryer and set the dryer to a cool or warm setting. [2] X Research source Using a cool or warm setting, rather than a hot setting, is much better for curly hair. A hot setting will cause your hair to dry out and get brittle. If your dryer has a separate airflow setting, select medium or low instead of high."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flip your hair upside down.",
      "content": "Flip your hair upside down. Most curly-haired people know that volume at the roots is important, since curls are heavy and tend to flatten at the top of the head. To avoid this, start by flipping your head upside down. Your hair will dry in an upside-down position, and once you're finished, your roots will have much better volume. If keeping your head upside down gets uncomfortable, you can lean your head to one side or another instead. The important thing is not to sit upright, since gravity will cause your roots to flatten as your hair dries. Another option is lifting the roots with hair clips. Use claw clips to lift the roots from your head, and dry your hair with the clips in place. That way, you won't have to hold your head upside down to get volume."

      "title": "Turn on the diffuser and hold it pointed up.",
      "content": "Turn on the diffuser and hold it pointed up. Remember to use a low or medium heat setting. Hold the dryer so that the bowl-shaped diffuser is pointing to the ceiling."

    {
      "title": "Lay a handful of curls in the bowl of the diffuser.",
      "content": "Lay a handful of curls in the bowl of the diffuser. Take a small handful of hair, keeping the curls intact, and coil it in the bowl of the diffuser. Just drop the hair into the diffuser; don't push it down or bunch it up. Handle your hair gently at all times."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lift the diffuser until it touches your head to dry your roots.",
      "content": "Lift the diffuser until it touches your head to dry your roots. You should feel the prongs separating the hair at your scalp in order to access your roots. Hold the diffuser there for several seconds to allow your roots to get dry. Move it in a circular motion to lift the roots and make sure all the hair in the section gets dry. When the roots feel mostly dry, lower the diffuser and let your hair drop out of the bowl. [3] X Research source Don't hold the diffuser in place for too long. You just want your hair to get about 80% dry. If you dry it too much, it will frizz up."
    },
    {
      "title": "Move on to the next section of hair.",
      "content": "Move on to the next section of hair. Take another handful from next to the first section and repeat the process. Coil your hair in the diffuser, then bring it up to your head to dry your roots. When your hair is 80% dry, lower the diffuser and let your hair loose."
    },
    {
      "title": "Continue until your hair is mostly dry.",
      "content": "Continue until your hair is mostly dry. Section by section, dry your roots and curls with the diffuser. Since you'll need to have your head upside down, you might want to take a few breaks. Stop when your whole head is 80-90% dry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply hair serum or gel.",
      "content": "Apply hair serum or gel. This will define your curls and keep them from getting frizzy. Put a little product in your hand and rub your palms together, then gently scrunch your hair with your hands to apply. There's no need to use a brush or comb; just use your fingers."

    {
      "title": "Try not to handle your hair too much during the day.",
      "content": "Try not to handle your hair too much during the day. Curls tend to puff up when they're over-handled. Now that your hair is dry, just let it be for the rest of the day. Tuck your hair up under a hat or pin it into a loose bun to protect your curls."

    {
      "title": "Use light-hold hairspray if needed.",
      "content": "Use light-hold hairspray if needed. Avoid using firm or maximum hold spray, since it tends to make curls look rigid and helmet-like. Use a light hold spray that allows your curls to move and bounce easily."
