      "content": "There are some officially licensed gold Pokémon cards. The Pokémon Company has released gold metal cards and gold foil holographic cards as part of the Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG). These cards are rare and only a part of certain expansion sets, collection boxes, and promotional materials. [1] X Research source Besides their shiny color, gold cards are considered extra rare because they often feature unique illustrations. Because gold Pokémon cards are rare and can be valuable, fakes are common. While fake cards can look like the real deal, they are not official nor playable in card tournaments."

      "title": "Check the card for spelling mistakes.",
      "content": "Check the card for spelling mistakes. To tell if a Pokémon card is real or not , make sure the Pokémon’s name is spelled correctly. Then, look at the text on the card to ensure it’s free from errors. [2] X Research source Fake cards often forget to put the accent on the “e” in Pokémon or write “Nintedon” instead of “Nintendo.” Ensure the text matches the card, too. For instance, if you’re looking at a Pikachu card but the text is about Mewtwo, the card is probably a fake."

      "title": "Examine the font, color, and illustration quality.",
      "content": "Examine the font, color, and illustration quality. Real Pokémon cards are printed well and use a clear, uniform font that’s spaced evenly and easy to read. The image on the card is crisp and the gold sheen and other colors are vibrant. [3] X Research source Fake cards are often hard to read because the text is blurry or the font is poorly spaced. The font might be too small or large compared to real cards, too. The illustration is typically not as well done on fake cards. The colors on the card might be too dull or bright compared to the real card."

      "title": "Inspect the card’s holographic shine and texture.",
      "content": "Inspect the card’s holographic shine and texture. The foiled accents on gold cards have a visible, geometric pattern that gives the card a slightly raised texture. The holographic design also shimmers and shines when you move the card around in the light. [4] X Research source If the card appears dull and looks and feels completely smooth, it’s likely a fake."

      "title": "See if the back of the card is centered and the right shade of blue.",
      "content": "See if the back of the card is centered and the right shade of blue. Real gold cards have “Pokémon” written on the top and bottom of the card with a pokéball in the center. The background is dark blue with a dark blue, evenly spaced border. [5] X Research source Fake cards might not center the text on the back of the card or cut off the border. The blue might be too dark, dull, or purple compared to the real card."

      "title": "Check the card’s weight and bendability.",
      "content": "Check the card’s weight and bendability. Real Pokémon cards are printed on thick cardstock that has a substantial weight to it. The cards are stiff and do not bend or rip easily. [6] X Research source If the card feels flimsy or very light, it’s probably a fake. If you’re looking at the card in person, bring a real card with you to compare its weight and feel."

      "content": "Read the product description and check reviews if buying online. Some people make their own gold Pokémon cards and sell them as unofficial cards, so check the description to ensure you’re not looking at a custom card. Always read the seller’s reviews to see if customers are happy with their purchase or mention receiving fake cards, too. [7] X Research source Many Pokémon card players and collectors purchase custom cards because they look cool. Just know that custom cards are not official and might not have value if you ever want to sell them."

Look at the illustration, font, border, symbols, and text to ensure the cards look the same. Look up the card using the official Pokémon card database or Serebii.net’s card database ."

      "content": "Gold cards are rare, though some cards are more rare than others. Compared to regular Pokémon cards, gold holographic cards are very rare. The odds of getting a gold card in an expansion pack is about 1 in 100. [8] X Research source Every Pokémon card has a symbol on the bottom that indicates its rarity, so some gold cars are more rare than others. [9] X Research source Prior to the release of Scarlet & Violet : A black star means the card is Regular Rare. 2 black stars mean the card is Double Rare. A black diamond means the card is Uncommon. A black circle means the card is Common. After the release of Scarlet & Violet : A gold star means the card is Illustration Rare. 2 gold stars mean the card is Special Illustration Rare. 3 gold stars mean the card is Hyper Rare. Booster card packs usually include 1 Rare card and 3 Uncommon cards. The rest of the cards are Common."

      "content": "Gold cards can sell for a few bucks to hundreds of dollars. A gold Pokémon card’s value depends on its rarity, popularity, and condition. For example, a limited-release card that features a legendary Pokémon like Mew or a popular Pokémon like Charizard might be worth $100 to $1,000. A more widespread card that features an item or less popular Pokémon might go for $1 to $10. [10] X Research source Just because a card is rare doesn’t mean it’s very valuable. Pokémon cards are constantly changing in value depending on their demand and popularity. For example, the gold Ultra Ball from the Plasma Freeze Expansion usually sells for $200. [11] X Research source The gold Inteleon from Evolving Skies sells for around $20. [12] X Research source"

Many game stores and comic stores sell used Pokémon cards and they might have gold cards available. [13] X Research source Check out Pokémon conventions and card tournaments for gold cards, too. Many players set up booths to sell or trade their cards. Read the seller’s reviews before buying a card online. Compare the seller’s card to a picture of the official card to make sure it’s real, too. Search for your card online before you buy it to see what its current value is so you don’t end up paying more than it’s actually worth. Alternatively, buy Pokémon expansion packs that can contain gold cards on the official Pokémon website or at stores like Target and Walmart."
