      "content": "The angel number 666 asks you to redirect your energy so you'll thrive. Sure, 666 is calling out that you're facing lots of temptations, but the angels sending it aren't trying to lecture you. They just really care about you and want to make sure that you steer clear of any toxic people, media, or patterns that keep you from manifesting your goals. [1] X Research source 666 is sometimes associated with Satan. In Christianity, 666 is known as the “mark of the beast,” but it can be interpreted in many different ways. The repeated presence of the number 6 just signifies that humans are not perfect like God is, and so they’re easily influenced by temptation. [2] X Research source If it helps, you can think of the \"Devil\" major arcana card from a Tarot deck. When you read tarot cards, the Devil just symbolizes forces you need to resist. The number 666 is also a gentle reminder that you are always connected to the divine. No matter what might be going on in your life at the moment, remember that you have a higher purpose. You are always connected to something bigger and better. In ancient traditions, the number 666 sounds like \"sex, sex, sex\", which represents our lower vibration that needs to be tamed. This is where our \"beast\" comes from, and when seeing this number, we must rise above our animal desire to integrate the divine essence within our own being. In the Occult, the number 666 is not simply written 666 (six hundred sixty-six; triple six), but in different ways like 36, 333, 555 (repeated thrice), 999 etc."
