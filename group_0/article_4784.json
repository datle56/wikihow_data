      "content": "Get a small metal can. [1] X Research source This can will be used to contain water that will be heated as part of the calorimetric measurements. Any small metal can will work, such as those used to package vegetables, or a soda can. [2] X Research source Make sure that it is empty, clean, and open on one end. If you are using a soda can, the opening used for drinking out of the can will suffice."

      "title": "Get a larger metal can.",
      "content": "Get a larger metal can. [3] X Research source You will need a second metal can, large enough that the small metal can will fit inside it with room to spare. Any larger metal can will work, such as a coffee can. Make sure that it is empty, clean, and open on both ends."

      "content": "Puncture four small holes in the small can. [4] X Research source Using a hole punch, ice pick, or other implement, carefully puncture four small holes (each one directly across from another) in the small metal can. Position the holes just below the rim of the open end of the can."

      "title": "Slide two thin rods between the four holes in the can.",
      "content": "Slide two thin rods between the four holes in the can. Slide one rod through the can to the other side, then repeat with the other rod and the two remaining holes; the two rods should cross each other. These rods will be used to support the small can in the calorimeter. Temperature-resistant glass rods are ideal. If you do not have any, try any kind of sturdy, nonflammable rod."

      "content": "Fill the small can with water. Using a graduated cylinder, flask, or other container, pour 100 mL of distilled water in the small metal can."

      "title": "Measure the temperature of the water.",
      "content": "Measure the temperature of the water. Using a mercury thermometer (not a digital one), take the initial temperature of your water. You may need to leave the thermometer in the water for some time so that it can get an accurate reading of the water (which may change temperature as it adjusts to room temperature). Leave the thermometer in the water; you will need it to take another reading later."

      "title": "Place the small can inside of the larger one.",
      "content": "Place the small can inside of the larger one. The small metal can should rest securely inside the larger one, supported by the rods made of glass or another nonflammable material."

Completely unfold the paperclip so that it forms a single long strand. Insert one end of the strand into the cork. Make sure it can stand upright with the unfolded paperclip sticking up."

As the food burns, it will heat the water in the small can that is suspending in the large can. Carefully watch the food as it burns. If it goes out quickly, before the food burns completely, relight it."

[9] X Research source The formula used to determine the caloric value of a sample of food using a homemade calorimeter is relatively simple: calories = volume of water (in mL) x the temperature change (in Celsius) of the water."

[10] X Research source If you recorded the initial temperature of the water, and its temperature after the food was burned, you can determine the temperature change by subtracting the smaller value from the larger. For instance, if the water in the can was initially 35 degrees Celsius, then 39 degrees Celsius after the food was burned, then you have a temperature change of 4 degrees (39-35 = 4)."

[11] X Research source For instance, if you had a temperature change of 4 degrees, then the food contained 400 calories (400 = 100 mL x 4, using the formula calories = volume of water x the temperature change of the water) To determine Kcal of the food, multiply the temperature change of the water by the volume of water in liters. [12] X Research source Using the example above, the sample would contain 0.4 Kcal (0.4 Kcal = 0.100 L water x 4)"
