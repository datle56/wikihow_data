      "title": "Check your TV's inputs.",
      "content": "Check your TV's inputs. On the back or side of your TV, there will be several ports to which you can attach cables. Depending on your TV's age and model, you should see some (or all) of the following: RCA - Red, yellow, and white circular ports. These are most frequently seen on VCRs, DVD players, and older consoles. HDMI - A flat, wide input used for high-definition appliances. Your TV may have more than one of these. S-video - A circular piece of plastic with several small holes in it. This input is ideal for getting optimal quality for older technology, such as VCRs or old DVD players. S-video doesn't carry sound, so you'll need the red and white cables from the RCA cable set if you're hooking up a DVD player or VCR."

      "content": "Check the outputs on your DVD player, VCR, and cable box. The options that you have for connecting your items to your TV will determine the type of connection that you use: DVD player - Usually RCA, s-video, and/or HDMI. VCR - RCA and/or s-video. Cable box - HDMI, though some old cable boxes have RCA outputs."

      "title": "Decide which items you want to prioritize.",
      "content": "Decide which items you want to prioritize. When it comes to image quality, your DVD player and your cable box should have priority over the VCR. This means that you'll most likely want to use an HDMI cable for both if possible, leaving either RCA or s-video connection for your VCR. If your TV only has one HDMI input, you'll probably want to connect the cable box to it and use a different cable type for the DVD player. If you have a receiver that hooks up to your TV's HDMI input, you may be able to connect both the DVD player and the cable box to the receiver via HDMI."

      "title": "Get the right cables for each item.",
      "content": "Get the right cables for each item. This will largely depend on the types (and number) of connections that your TV has: DVD player - Ideally, you'll use HDMI if it's available. If not, use RCA cables or s-video cables. Since your DVDs will be higher-quality than your VHS tapes, use s-video here instead of for the VCR if necessary. VCR - You'll want to use either RCA cables or s-video cables for your VCR. This will usually depend on what you're using for your DVD player. Cable box - You'll need an HDMI cable to attach the cable box to the TV, as well as a coaxial cable to connect the box to the cable service."

      "title": "Buy any cables that you don't have.",
      "content": "Buy any cables that you don't have. Most DVD players, VCRs, and cable boxes will come with the cables that you need to use; however, if you're using s-video or HDMI on a box that came with RCA, you'll need to buy the correct cables online or in a tech department store. If you're buying an s-video cable, make sure that you buy the right one . When buying cables, don't worry about getting the most expensive one that you can find. Good HDMI or s-video cables shouldn't run you more than $15 to $20 depending on where you shop (online is typically the cheapest)."
