      "content": "Enroll in a makeup artist school that suits your schedule and budget. Since makeup artistry is not a licensed profession, states don’t mandate course offerings from makeup artist programs—meaning that the curriculum varies widely between schools. Some schools offer full-time classes that cover all the bases, while others allow you to pick and choose courses that focus on particular industries or skills. These programs also vary widely in cost, with full-time schools being the most expensive. [5] X Research source Typically, makeup training programs run 300-600 hours and can be completed in less than 6 months. [6] X Research source Going to school is not a requirement for becoming a successful makeup artist. It may give you a boost in a very competitive field, however. [7] X Research source"

In this field, looks are led by the editor, designer, or fashion photographers rather than the makeup artist. You’ll often work as part of a stylist and hair team to help prepare models."
