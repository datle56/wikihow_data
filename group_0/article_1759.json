      "title": "Passionate.",
      "content": "Passionate. Aries’ signature color is bright red, and it matches their fiery spirit. This is a sign that feels things deeply and openly. The people in Aries’ inner circle know exactly how much this fire sign loves them. That’s the beauty of Aries’ passionate heart: they don’t pretend to feel things they don’t, and they don’t keep cards close to their chest. All of the causes, people, hobbies, and ideas that Aries loves, they love completely and fearlessly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bold.",
      "content": "Bold. Aries isn’t afraid to go off the beaten path. Using sheer will and determination, they’ll forge their own trail in the brush. This sign goes after what they want, and they aren’t afraid of staying quiet while they do. Say Aries sees you across the room at a party—there’s something about you that they like. Aries won’t play it cool. They’ll walk right up to you, make solid eye contact, stick out a hand, and say: “Hi, I think we should get to know each other.” Which, now that we think about it, might actually be the coolest approach of all!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Brave.",
      "content": "Brave. Aries is a modern-day superhero. This sign takes pride in their willingness to tackle fears and take the fall for others. They stand in front of the group at the haunted house, and they’re first to try the scariest roller coaster at the park (and then, they’ll encourage their nervous friends to give it a whirl—go big or go home!). In Aries’ mind, when you address your fears directly, you conquer them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Confident.",
      "content": "Confident. What’s there to be insecure about? One of Aries’ greatest strengths is their self-assuredness. Unlike other signs in the zodiac, Aries isn’t self-obsessed. They just believe that insecurity gets in the way of fun things and worthwhile accomplishments—so why bother? Life is better when people feel free to be themselves, and this belief guides Aries throughout their journey. Though, Aries sometimes gets a rep for projecting confidence without forethought (because they tend to speak first, think second)."

    {
      "title": "Energetic.",
      "content": "Energetic. Aries is industrious, hard-working, and action-oriented. This sign never stops. Whether it’s sports, home-improvement, work, or even relationships, Aries is always pushing things forward. They believe in progress and improvement, and they work tirelessly to make that a major theme in their life. An Aries may not even realize that this is their way, because their energy flows so naturally and easily."
    },
    {
      "title": "Inspiring.",
      "content": "Inspiring. Aries’ modality is Cardinal, which means that they’re a leader at heart. This sign is all about big ideas, and in life, they’re likely to lead the charge. Aries inspires the group to go out for a fun weekend adventure; they convince friends to open themselves up to new possibilities. These days, Aries might not be leading revolutions, but that doesn’t mean that they don’t find ways to embolden friends and family every day."

    {
      "title": "Impatient, stubborn, easily angered.",
      "content": "Impatient, stubborn, easily angered. Aries has faults, too. Aries is lively and spontaneous, and that’s a strength. But this can also give way to impatience when others aren’t willing to go at the same speed. And what makes Aries a great leader—their confidence—can also look like stubbornness on bad days. Plus, Aries’ now mentality can leave them feeling easily frustrated, which can sometimes cause them to lash out."

      "title": "Attracting an Aries.",
      "content": "Attracting an Aries. Have a crush on the red-hot ram? We don’t blame you. Aries prefers a challenge, and they’re always chasing after beautiful, shiny things. To grab this fire sign’s attention: Be a major flirt. Aries likes obvious flirtation. Bat your eyes, compliment Aries, and tease them mercilessly to get their blood flowing. Play hard to get. Aries likes to play games. Once you’ve made your interest clear, reel back your attention. They’ll love the challenge! Dress up. No need for subtlety with this sign. Wear your favorite outfit, bright makeup, and the color red (which Aries is especially attracted to). Project confidence. Like many people, Aries is attracted to bold, self-assured people. Show your crush that that’s you. Show off your wild side. As a fire sign, Aries loves spontaneity and energy. Don’t hold back—show your crush that you’re all about having fun."

      "title": "Signs that an Aries likes you.",
      "content": "Signs that an Aries likes you. Aries usually makes this pretty obvious. But if you’re having trouble reading the signs, look for these surefire signals: They tell you you’re hot. Yep, that’s right. When Aries is into someone, they’ll usually come right out and say that they like what they see! They ask you out. When Aries is into you, they probably won’t wait to get something started. Persistence and confidence are the name of the game. They try to impress you. Aries loves to showboat. They might talk about their bench press weight, promotion, or huge group of cool friends. They’re protective of you. If an Aries is serious about you, they’ll start showing a need to keep you safe and happy. This is a sign that they’re falling!"

      "title": "What’s it like to date an Aries?",
      "content": "What’s it like to date an Aries? Dating Aries is a white-hot, passionate joyride. You’re likely to smile constantly, collect new experiences, and feel totally free by this fire sign’s side. Aries is part personal trainer, part life coach, part white knight, and full-time fun. You’ll probably feel like your life is changed for the better (and also, totally exhausted). Date night: A “beginner” hike. A paintball session. Go carting. The most competitive game night of your life. Downside: Aries can have a quick temper, lash out, and then act like it was all no big deal. Explain how this affects you emotionally, and it’ll encourage them to chill out."

      "title": "Leo & Aries.",
      "content": "Leo & Aries. What three words best describe a Leo-Aries romance? Passion, passion, passion. Their attraction will be instant and all-consuming. This is the stuff of epics, where every touch is electric, every word is long-awaited, and the connection feels divine. Beyond that powerful spark, these two share the same deep values and goals too, which will fan their love’s flames. And this fire is anything but friendly: Aries and Leo are destined for an earth-shattering romance. Passion, though, can be like a fog. Aries and Leo will need to avoid letting big feelings cloud their judgment. They should take their time and avoid rash decisions."

      "title": "Sagittarius & Aries.",
      "content": "Sagittarius & Aries. This relationship is brimming with joy and adventure. There’s no idea wacky enough, no joke silly enough, no destination far enough. Aries and Sagittarius are the couple that says yes. These two know how to make everything fun, whether it’s a cross-country road trip or a long line at the DMV. Plus, Sag and Aries are idea people at heart. They’ll both love that they found someone who thinks big. Fights, though, might spell trouble. Aries has a temper, and Sag is blunt and stubborn. Someone will have to give in, because their relationship will depend on it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Libra & Aries.",
      "content": "Libra & Aries. Libra is a gorgeous socialite; Aries, a confident charmer. The attraction here will be immediate and intense. Libra has a crowd of suitors, so they’ll be unlikely to commit to Aries early, which will only make Aries want Libra more. This cat-and-mouse dynamic will be exciting to both of them, and make way for a thrilling romance. Down the line, these two could be soulmate material. While Libra wants someone polite and diplomatic, Aries tends to speak first, think later. For these two to enjoy their compatible elements, they’ll have to meet in the middle."

      "title": "Gemini & Aries.",
      "content": "Gemini & Aries. This couple is the life of every party. They never leave the function before they’ve said every hello, landed a few jokes, and snapped a few pics. With their partner on their arm, there’s no one they can’t schmooze. But does this connection run deeper than Saturday nights and soirees? Usually, yes. Gemini’s mind attracts Aries’ ideological side, and Aries’ sharp focus fascinates Gemini. These two pair very well together. Aries and Gemini will put each other at ease and find a natural rhythm, but only if they go at the same speed. Aries needs everything now, but Gemini is slow to commit in love. If they can’t shift into the same gear, they could run into trouble."

      "title": "Aquarius & Aries.",
      "content": "Aquarius & Aries. Generally, these two are similar enough to find common ground, but different enough to challenge one another. And for both Aries and Aquarius, challenge is important. These two are visionaries—they have big ideas about everything. But then, where Aries is all heat, Aquarius is cool as ice. In love, they’ll balance each other beautifully. Aries will bring passion, and Aquarius will bring peace. To get their fairytale, first they’ll have to find each other. Though Aquarius and Aries are compatible deep down, on a surface level, they may find each other less appealing. So, Aries and Aquarius, be sure to give one another a chance!"

      "content": "Aries & Aries. What do you call it when a tornado meets a forest fire? Two Arieses in love! This romance will be full-steam ahead, full of passion, wild energy, and fun. These two are likely to experience their highest highs together, but also, a fair bit of chaos. This relationship is a freefall, but they’re sure to have a blast on their way down. And if two Arieses manage to find a sustainable wavelength for their relationship, they could find a safe place to land (and long-term potential). If they don’t find that balance, this romance could be explosive. These two may struggle to fight fair, find a balance, and maintain healthy habits if they constantly give in to their impulsive sides."

      "title": "Capricorn & Aries.",
      "content": "Capricorn & Aries. This is a union of two powerful, ambitious souls. Both of these signs are dynamic and strong, capable of hitting any target and climbing any ladder. There will be an instant attraction here—Aries will admire Capricorn’s work ethic, and Capricorn will appreciate Aries’ nonstop energy. Their long-term goals align, and on each other’s arm, there’s little that could get in their way. Still… Who wears the crown in a relationship like this? Capricorn will want to force Aries to organize and make a plan. Aries will resent that Cap is trying to control them. In short, these two will have to learn to accept their partners completely if this is going to work out over time."

      "title": "Scorpio & Aries.",
      "content": "Scorpio & Aries. What could the dark, complicated Scorpio see in the bright, bold Aries? A potential soulmate! These two are shockingly well-suited despite being near opposites. Aries and Scorpio are attracted to each other’s passionate nature and command over every room. But then, they complement each other, too—Scorpio teaches Aries how to make plans, and Aries empowers Scorpio to open up to others. If they’re not careful, this relationship could sour. Scorpio needs a partner who they can trust, and who respects their privacy completely. Aries, an open book through and through, might not understand this. If Aries breaks Scorpio’s trust, there’s no coming back."

      "title": "Cancer & Aries.",
      "content": "Cancer & Aries. Cancer is a nurturing homebody, and Aries, a bold trailblazer. These two look very different at first glance, but under the surface, their compatibility runs deep. Cancer wants someone who isn’t afraid to love them completely, and that’s Aries to a tee. Aries appreciates the balance that Cancer can bring to the chaos in their lives. These two could make amazing life partners if they can manage to stay together long enough. Down the line, these two may be perfectly suited for each other. But in the short term, there are major issues at play. Aries will need to avoid hurting Cancer’s sensitive feelings, and Cancer will need to allow Aries the freedom they need."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pisces & Aries.",
      "content": "Pisces & Aries. Aries is all about action, but Pisces enjoys a slower schedule. This will likely cause some issues at the get-go, especially if Aries’ confrontational communication style offends sweet, sensitive Pisces. On the whole, these two will have some hurdles to overcome, but that doesn’t mean all hope is lost. Aries and Pisces are lovers—their gigantic hearts lead them like the North Star. They’re likely to adore this about each other, and that admiration can easily eclipse their incompatibility. If Pisces has fire signs present in their chart (Aries, Leo, Sag) and Aries has water signs (Scorpio, Cancer, Pisces), this could also help a ton. Don’t give up just yet!"

    {
      "title": "Taurus & Aries.",
      "content": "Taurus & Aries. Aries and Taurus are actually pretty similar in a way—they have big hearts and a stubborn streak. But in love, this might be more of a challenge than a strength. Aries’ ideal romance is full of passion, spontaneity, and wild antics, but Taurus dreams of cuddle dates and a white picket fence. Aries’ will snap at Taurus, but then be over it in minutes. Taurus is careful with their words, but they never let go of the little things. In short, this is a tough matchup, especially when it comes to managing conflict. But sun signs aren’t the whole picture. If these two have compatible Venus and Mercury signs, they could have a gorgeous, flourishing romance. So before you pack it in, check your birth charts!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Virgo & Aries.",
      "content": "Virgo & Aries. This could be a tough match. To Aries, Virgo is boring and critical. To Virgo, Aries is childish and impulsive. These two will find it difficult to relate to each other, and this could make it hard to find and maintain a spark. In the long term, these two dream of committing to a dedicated, loving partner. But how will they get there when no matter how hard they try, Aries and Virgo can’t see eye to eye? Luckily, in their heart of hearts, these two have a lot in common. Both Aries and Virgo would do anything for the people they care about. If the rest of their charts can soften the rougher edges of an Aries-Virgo match, then it’ll be smooth sailing. For example, if Virgo has some wild fire signs in their chart and Aries has some responsible earth signs, this could still be a dreamy romance."
