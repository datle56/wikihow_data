      "content": "Decide what kind of firearm best suits your needs. Handguns are ideal for self- or home defense. They can be brought to bear quickly on intruders. If you want a weapon that can fill multiple roles, a shotgun probably is right for you. Rifles are best for hunters. Revolvers: Revolvers use a cylinder that rotates each time the weapon is fired, putting a fresh round in the chamber. They are simple to operate and seldom jam, but can be difficult to reload. Pistols: Semi-automatic handguns generally hold more bullets than revolvers. They rest in a magazine, or clip, that the user slides into the weapon. A spring mechanism ejects each spent cartridge and loads the next round into the chamber. Shotguns: Shotguns often are used in hunting and sport shooting, but also are effective weapons for home defense. They fire shells that can either disperse pellets or individual lead slugs. They can be single-action, pump- or bolt-action, or semi-automatic. Single-action shotguns must be reloaded after each use. Pump- and bolt-action shotguns hold multiple shells that must be ejected from the chamber manually. Semi-automatic shotguns work much like pistols. In general, shotguns are more powerful than handguns. They're also easier to use and have a wider range of uses. Rifles: Rifles fire high-velocity rounds at distances of several hundred yards. They are best for long-range shooting, and therefore aren't practical for most people."
