      "title": "These two signs keep each other interested.",
      "content": "These two signs keep each other interested. Scorpio and Gemini are located at an awkward angle from one another—5 signs apart, or a quincunx—and therefore are not normally seen as compatible. They do however have some things going for them in terms of chemistry. A Gemini can find Scorpio’s emotional intelligence and deep understanding of other people really attractive, while a Gemini’s illusive nature gives Scorpio a mystery to solve. Scorpio is a water sign, which gives them depth to their feelings and emotions. Gemini, an air sign, is a more analytical thinker. Water and air pairings can help each partner learn from the other’s strengths. If an air sign can put up with some drama from their water counterpart, and if a water sign can move past seeing their partner as superficial, this pairing can lead to growth. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "This initial chemistry can face some challenges. A Scorpio might end up finding a Gemini to be a little too superficial for their liking, while a Gemini can see a Scorpio as too intense and self-involved. But if they can find mutual respect for one another, their shared intelligence and sense of adventure can create a strong bond. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Geminis can find Scorpios thrilling in the bedroom.",
      "content": "Geminis can find Scorpios thrilling in the bedroom. Geminis enjoy being constantly entertained, and Scorpios are more than able to keep sex interesting and active. While a Scorpio’s intense and passionate approach to sex isn’t quite the same as a Gemini’s light-hearted take on romance, these signs can have a great time in the bedroom. Geminis are great communicators, so if they can start a conversation about what each partner wants in the bedroom, they can improve their sexual chemistry even more."

    {
      "title": "Scorpios might need to tone down the intensity.",
      "content": "Scorpios might need to tone down the intensity. While Scorpio’s interest in the darker sides of life can get them interested in BDSM or other in-depth role-playing scenarios, a Gemini wants to keep their fantasies brief and easy, which might mean a quick hook-up rather than a drawn-out session. Geminis can sometimes laugh things off when they get a little too intense, which can hurt a Scorpio’s feelings since they take sex so seriously. When it comes to sex, mutual respect between these two is crucial."
    },
    {
      "title": "These signs share a deep investment in people.",
      "content": "These signs share a deep investment in people. Geminis are fact-seeking machines—they always know what’s going on around them, and all the latest news and gossip. This is really appealing to Scorpios, who understand people on a deep level and tend to see information as a way to maintain power and security. As a duo, their strengths can build on another. If you’re in one of these relationships, try spending some time people-watching in public. Gemini’s perceptive observations and Scorpio’s analysis of social dynamics are bound to lead to a fun time."
    },
    {
      "title": "These signs can have needs that are out of sync.",
      "content": "These signs can have needs that are out of sync. Scorpios are cautious, and it can take them a while to feel secure in a relationship. Geminis can be quite non-committal—it’s not that they like leading people on, it’s just that they don’t know what they want. This can make deeply-attached Scorpios feel paranoid, and freedom-seeking Geminis feel trapped. Open communication keeps these signs emotionally happy. If a Gemini is clear about their feelings in a relationship with a Scorpio, the Scorpio won’t feel the need to obsess over what they’re really thinking. Similarly, if a Scorpio can be honest about their insecurities in a relationship, a Gemini can turn on the strong logical side of their brain and help their Scorpio partner find ways to work through their doubts."

    {
      "title": "Trust between these signs takes work.",
      "content": "Trust between these signs takes work. Scorpios can find it difficult to trust anybody, and Geminis, who can be pretty fickle with their own feelings, are no exception. But through patient communication, once trust forms between these two, they have a chance of forming a strong relationship. Body language is important to a Scorpio. If you’re a Gemini, try making eye contact and being upfront with your words and tone to earn a Scorpio’s trust."
    },
    {
      "title": "These signs have very different approaches to privacy.",
      "content": "These signs have very different approaches to privacy. When a Gemini is really into someone, they’ll gush about them to everyone they know. Scorpios, however, can have an almost obsessive need for privacy. This can cause some friction between these two signs. For example, a Gemini might love telling their friends about a Scorpio’s new promotion at work, but a Scorpio could feel really uncomfortable with this—they like being in control of how they’re seen by others. In order to overcome these differences with how they approach privacy, a Scorpio needs to make it clear to a Gemini what they’re comfortable with the Gemini sharing, and a Gemini has to respect these boundaries."
    },
    {
      "title": "Both of these signs are extremely intelligent.",
      "content": "Both of these signs are extremely intelligent. Gemini, as an air sign, is comfortable with abstract ideas and enjoys feeling intellectually engaged. As a water sign, Scorpios are gifted with a powerful emotional intelligence—they really get people, and will have plenty of observations that pique Gemini’s interest. Though they might not admit it, both of these signs love gossip. Talking about what’s going on in the lives of others draws a Gemini and a Scorpio closer together. Watching a human-centered dramatic movie or crime story will keep both Scorpio and Gemini engaged, so long as it has the artistic chops to keep aesthetically-oriented Gemini happy. Both of these signs also enjoy intellectual debates where they can exchange different ideas and stories. Reader Poll: We asked 424 wikiHow readers who’ve dated a Gemini and 57% agreed that their Gemini partner would most enjoy spending time together by having a meaningful conversation . [Take Poll] So it’s easy to see why Geminis and Scorpios match so well in terms of intelligence!"

      "title": "Sometimes Scorpios get a little too dark for Geminis.",
      "content": "Sometimes Scorpios get a little too dark for Geminis. Ruled by Mercury, Geminis are fantastic communicators and are capable of talking about all kinds of things intelligently and with humor. But when a Scorpio gets too dark and depressed, a Gemini might be ready to switch the subject a little too early for a Scorpio’s liking. A great question to use in a Scorpio-Gemini relationship is “Do you want to talk about something else?” While these signs have a lot of intellectual strengths, openly checking-in with one another during a conversation can keep them both engaged and satisfied."

      "title": "Although they might struggle to build trust, this pair has real strengths.",
      "content": "Although they might struggle to build trust, this pair has real strengths. The air sign brilliance of a Gemini finds a strong counterpart in the deep emotional intelligence of the water sign Scorpio, which makes them a couple that’s a force to be reckoned with. If Gemini can use their communication skills to facilitate mature conversations, and Scorpio is willing to open up, this relationship has a lot going for it.
