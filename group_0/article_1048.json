      "content": "Be aware. Cats are very territorial and think that if another cat is around, it will take its place. The first cat will then think that it's not \"king of the house\" anymore, and can lead to fights. Try to get them to play together and get used to their scent,or get them separate rooms. It's easier if they are kittens."

If the one you have isn't, try letting them just sniff first, or putting the new cat in a bedroom or something. If you plan on getting another cat before you get the first one, plan on making sure the first cat is friendly."
