      "content": "Apply rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide. Isopropyl alcohol and hydrogen peroxide are some of the most effective solutions for removing stains from a whiteboard, as they help remove chemical residue. Mix either rubbing alcohol or peroxide (not both) in a 1:1 ratio with water. Apply the solution to a microfiber cloth, then wipe the board clean. [1] X Research source For the best results, use 90-99% isopropyl alcohol. Lower percentages will also work, though it may take a bit more effort. For stubborn stains, apply the alcohol or peroxide directly to the area. Let it sit for a few seconds before wiping it away. Professional cleaning service Cleanzen says that a “mixture that is 50% tap water and 50% isopropyl rubbing alcohol” is effective at removing the “phantom remnants” of old dry erase marker.

      "title": "Try hand sanitizer.",
      "content": "Try hand sanitizer. Most hand sanitizers contain at least 60% isopropyl alcohol, meaning they can effectively clean whiteboards. Apply the sanitizer directly to the whiteboard and use a soft, clean cloth or paper towel to wipe it over the entire surface. Let it sit for about 30 seconds, then wipe it off with a fresh cloth or paper towel. [3] X Research source Because hand sanitizers generally have a lower percentage of alcohol, this method may take a bit more effort than using alcohol directly. Repeat the process as needed until the board is clean. Non-acetone nail polish remover can be used in a similar way. Cleanzen says, “When whiteboard cleaning products purchased in a store leave behind ghost remnants, you can use nail polish remover, hand sanitizer, or rubbing alcohol to get the job done.” [4] X Expert Source Cleanzen Cleaning Services Residential Cleaning Specialists Expert Interview. 4 February 2022."

      "content": "Make a vinegar solution. Vinegar is a safe, non-chemical way to clean a whiteboard. For light stains, mix 1 tsp (5 ml) of white vinegar per 1 cup (236 ml) of water. If you think the stain will be stubborn, mix the two in a 1:1 ratio. If desired, add a drop of dish soap, as well. Pour the solution into a spray bottle and spray the white board. Let it sit for a few minutes, then wipe it away with a clean microfiber cloth. Repeat as necessary until all the stains are removed. [5] X Research source Adjust your vinegar to water ratio as necessary until you find what works best."

      "content": "Spray on some hairspray. Hairspray typically contains isopropyl alcohol, so it can be used to clean whiteboards, though it may take a bit of effort. Spray the surface with the hairspray and let it sit for a few minutes. Then, dip a soft cloth into a mix of warm water and gentle detergent (like dish soap) and wipe the board. This should remove both the stains and the sticky residue left by the hairspray. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Try WD-40. Commercial degreasers like WD-40 can also be safely applied to a whiteboard. Spray it directly onto the board’s surface, then use a microfiber cloth to wipe it off. In addition to removing stains, WD-40 can revive the board’s finish and make it slick and smooth for writing. [7] X Research source WD-40 can stain clothes, so be careful when applying it."

      "title": "Use whiteboard cleaner for minor stains.",
      "content": "Use whiteboard cleaner for minor stains. Wipe off any fresh marks with a dry eraser or microfiber cloth, then spray a whiteboard cleaner on the board according to its instructions. Alternatively, wet your cloth with the cleaner and wipe it on the board. Let it sit for a few seconds to break down the ink, then wipe it away with a dry cloth. Rinse the cloth in clean water, then use it to wipe away any remaining cleaner. Use another clean, dry cloth to wipe the board dry. [8] X Research source Make sure not to use an abrasive cloth or pad, as this could scratch the surface of the board. If you don’t have a commercial board cleaner, make your own by mixing isopropyl alcohol and water in a 1:1 ratio, then apply it the same way. If any residue remains after wiping the board, apply more cleaner and repeat the process."

      "title": "Write over the stains with a fresh dry erase marker.",
      "content": "Write over the stains with a fresh dry erase marker. Remove permanent marker or old, stubborn dry erase marker by tracing over the stains with a new dry erase marker. Let it dry for a few seconds to loosen the old ink, then rub the marks with a cloth or whiteboard eraser. Both the new and old ink should come right off, but if any remains, repeat the process. When all the ink is gone, wipe the board with a cleaner and cloth. [9] X Research source If the permanent marker is particularly stubborn, apply rubbing alcohol or a similar solution to the area."

      "title": "Avoid using any abrasive cleaning products or solutions.",
      "content": "Avoid using any abrasive cleaning products or solutions. Harsh chemicals or abrasive products can scratch the whiteboard’s surface and remove protective coatings. This can lead to more staining in the future and make the board difficult to clean. While many of these solutions can technically clean whiteboards, they aren’t generally recommended: [10] X Research source Toothpaste Ben-Gay Comet cleaner Baking soda Black coffee/coffee grinds Scouring pads"

      "content": "How often should I clean a whiteboard? Clean your whiteboard with a whiteboard cleaner every 2-3 days to maintain its appearance. Start with a whiteboard eraser to remove fresh markers, then spray on the cleaner to remove stubborn marks. If you don’t have whiteboard cleaner, use your preferred cleaning solution, like isopropyl alcohol. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Can I use Windex to clean a whiteboard? It depends on the type of board. Windex is an effective cleaner for dry erase boards made of porcelain or glass. However, it (and other chemical products) can damage the porous surface of melamine boards. [12] X Research source If you’re not sure what type of board you have, it may be best to choose another cleaning solution."

      "content": "How do I remove tape or sticky adhesive from a whiteboard? One of the best ways to remove tape or sticky residue from a whiteboard is to apply a commercial adhesive remover, like Goo Gone . Follow the product’s instructions to ensure you use it correctly. [13] X Research source Do not use plastic or metal scouring pads, abrasives, or scraping tools, as these will likely damage the whiteboard’s surface."

      "title": "How do I clean whiteboard erasers?",
      "content": "How do I clean whiteboard erasers? Whiteboard erasers can get filled with ink residue, so it’s important to clean them regularly so they continue to work properly. Sweep a soft-bristled brush across the surface of the eraser to remove most of the residue. In the case of stubborn residue, deep clean the eraser by dipping the brush into a mix of water and dish soap before scrubbing the eraser, or submerging the eraser itself in the soapy water.
