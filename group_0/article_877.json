      "title": "Decide whether to do double-envelopes.",
      "content": "Decide whether to do double-envelopes. If you are planning a more informal affair, it’s okay to go with just one outer envelope. That way your invitees with open the envelope and see your invitation right away. If you prefer formality and tradition, opt for the double-envelope method. This means that your invitees will need to open two separate envelopes before seeing the event details. You can also consider the quality of the paper that you plan to use for your invitations. If the paper is high-quality and thicker, then a second envelope may not be necessary. And, it could add to the postage cost as well."

      "title": "Be more formal with the outer envelopes.",
      "content": "Be more formal with the outer envelopes. If you go with the two envelope style, then you’ll want to be consistently more formal with the outer ones and more casual with the inner ones. The outer envelope will contain titles and complete names. In contrast, the inner envelope can be addressed with simple first names and without accompanying titles. [1] X Research source If you don’t know the invitee that well, it’s still okay to lean toward the more formal and include their full name on the inner envelope."

    {
      "title": "Use complete formal names and no abbreviations in the address.",
      "content": "Use complete formal names and no abbreviations in the address. The outer envelope is generally considered more formal than the inner one. For that reason, you’ll want to use the full names of your invitees, not their simple initials. For the return and mailing addresses, spell out the full city and state names. Do the same thing with street locations. [2] X Research source For example, in the addresses, you should put “Lane” instead of “Ln.” Try to include your invitees’ middle names. However, if you don’t have it, go with the initial or just use the first and last name."

      "title": "Use Mr.",
      "content": "Use Mr. and Mrs. for a married couple on the outer envelope. You can refer to both members of the couple by “Mr. and Mrs.” followed by the husband’s full name. However, this strikes some people as no longer appropriate for today’s society. You could also refer to a couple as “Mr. John and Mrs. Emily Perkins.” [3] X Research source For the inner envelope, go ahead and shorten your greeting to, “John and Emily” or “John and Emily Perkins.”"

      "content": "Go with closeness if the couple has different last names. If you are inviting a married couple who go by their own last names, then the person who you feel closest to gets the first spot. If you are equally close to both people, then arrange them according to alphabetical order.

      "content": "Put your closest friend first if a couple is unmarried and living together. The closeness rule also applies if you are sending an invite to an unmarried couple, except you use 2 lines. The first line is reserved for the person who you know best. The second line is for their partner. [5] X Research source For example, the first line on the outer envelope might read, “Ms. Amanda Jones.” The second line might read, “Mr. Michael Adams.”"

Reach out to a family member of the widow and ask if she prefers to use her first name followed by her married last name or her husband’s full name for events. If you can’t get this information or are unsure, go with her full name, just to be careful. [6] X Research source For example, the outer envelope might state, “Mrs. Nancy Stevens,” or, with the husband’s full name, “Mrs. Charles Stevens.” For the inner envelope, shorten it to, “Mrs. Stevens,” or “Nancy.”"

      "title": "Go into the next line, if needed, for honorifics.",
      "content": "Go into the next line, if needed, for honorifics. Some titles are quite long, but formality on the outer envelope requires that you list them in full. It’s okay to continue on to the line below if you need the space to write everything out. This usually isn’t an issue in the inner envelope since abbreviations are okay. [9] X Research source"

[13] X Research source Mention that children are not invited on your wedding website. Include your reason if you think it will help parents' understand.
