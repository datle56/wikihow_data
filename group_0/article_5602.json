      "content": "Listen for single rings. Be suspicious if you hear your phone ring once. A single-ring missed call could be the work of a \"crammer\": someone who is trying to get you to call them back so they can charge you. If you only hear one ring, don't call the number back. If it wasn't a crammer, it was probably a wrong number. Telemarketers are required to ring at least four times, or for at least 15 seconds, before they hang up.

      "content": "Check the area code. If the number is displayed, look it up online. Crammers call from countries with the same international code (+1) as the USA, so they look like domestic calls. However, if you search the numbers, you can identify them as foreign by their area code. A good rule of thumb is that if you don't recognize the area code, don't answer. Many of these calls come from the Dominican Republic (809), Jamaica (876), British Virgin Islands (284) and Grenada (473). Don't pick up 900 numbers, those numbers are premium-rate numbers that bill the calling party. There are also services online that allow you to look up numbers. Search for \"reverse lookup\" or \"find out who called me.\""

If you get a missed call from a number you don't know, or a blocked number, it probably isn't important. Don't call back! If they do leave a message, or the number that called is an 800 (toll-free) number, go ahead and call them back. Crammers will never leave a message, because they are operating on an extremely limited profit margin and can't afford the international call."
