Age waivers are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. If you are 17, you may enlist with a signature from a parent. If you have previous Navy SEAL experience and would like to become an officer, you are eligible up to age 33. SEALS must have under 20/70 vision, and it must be correctable to 20-25 vision. The worst eye can be 20/70, while the best eye 20/40 All types of color blindness are disqualifying. In order to be a U.S. Navy SEAL, one must be a native-born or naturalized United States citizen, and must speak, read and write English fluently. Upon enlisting in either the Navy or to be a SEAL, you'll need to pass a secret security clearance. In order to do so, it's important to have a blemish-free record. If you were planning on a committing a felony any time soon, change your plans. It's important that you are not only physically sound, but mentally and psychologically sound as well. These traits will be assessed during your training."

[4] X Research source It's important to tell them that you want a SEAL Challenge Contract. If you enlist in the Navy and then decide to become a SEAL, you do not get a $12,000 SEAL sign-on bonus. You'll get a bonus, it just won't be as steep. When visiting the recruiter, take with you your birth certificate, Social Security card, a 10-year history of where you lived and worked, three references with name, phone number, and address, and the names and addresses of people who can verify this information. If all goes well, the Navy recruiter will put you in touch with the regional Naval Special Warfare/Special Operations Mentor or coordinator. They will help you train for your PST (Physical Screening Test). They will also give you your Delayed Entry Program qualifying PST. Specific locations and information are given out on a need-to-know basis, but more information can be found on the SEAL/SWCC website."

If it's not requested, there is only one way to calculate your score; requesting this gives you more flexibility).
