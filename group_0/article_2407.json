If you don’t have cupcake liners or a cupcake pan and still want to make cupcakes, you can make your own liners at home. You'll still need to double or triple the homemade liners so that they can stand up in the pan. [1] X Research source Parchment paper is the recommended material, but you can also use aluminum foil. The stiffer the paper, the more stable your cupcake liners will be."

      "content": "Cut the parchment paper into 6 in × 6 in (15 cm × 15 cm) squares. Pull off a stretch of parchment paper and use a ruler to measure out squares. Use scissors to carefully cut out each measured square. You'll be doubling or tripling the liners for each cupcake, so cut out enough squares for this to happen. [2] X Research source Most normal-sized cupcake pans make 12 cupcakes."
