A few recommended Genes include: DNA Gene - Metabolic Jump Travel Gene - Native Biome/Teracyte Evolution Gene - Sympto-Stasis Mutation Gene - Genetic Mimic Environment Gene - Extremophile (Or any unlocked)"

      "content": "Choose China as your starting country. China is one of the most ideal starting locations when you need to spread quickly as it has one of the highest populations, and infects surrounding countries quickly. China's airport and harbor mean the virus spreads to other countries quicker and easier."

      "content": "Evolve Transmissions. You need to spread the plague fast before the mutating starts, so start working on some basic transmission abilities. Upgrading Air and Water makes your virus effective in crossing countries by airplane or ships. Evolve the following transmissions, in order: Air 1 Water 1 Drug Resistance 1 Air 2 Water 2 Extreme Bioaerosol"
