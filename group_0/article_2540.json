      "content": "Stay in together. Best friends don’t have to do something crazy to have a good time. Sometimes, it’s enough to go over to one of your houses and just hang out. Invite your friend over even when you don’t have something special planned. Just enjoy each other’s company and relax. There are still fun activities you can do if you’re staying inside. Watch a movie, play video games, bake some cupcakes – whatever. Staying home doesn’t have to mean sitting quietly on the couch."

      "content": "Make friends with their family. Being best friends with someone probably means you’re spending a lot of time at their house. Get to know their family members and become friends with them. Ask them about their life and how things have been going when you see them. Try to remember details about them that you can bring up the next time you see them. You may not get along all the time, but in general you should make an effort to be friendly with their family. You may get invited on family vacations if you’re best friends with someone. Make sure to be on your best behavior and treat all their relatives with respect if you’re fortunate enough to be invited.

      "content": "Be there for your friend when they’re sad. We all have moments in life where we feel bad. If your friend is upset, talk to them and encourage them to express why they’re feeling low. Try to see things from their perspective and offer sympathy. They’ll see how important they are to you and return the favor when you need it. [1] X Research source Most of the time, people are more interested in someone sympathizing with them than they are with someone offering solutions. As tempting as it can be, don’t try to tell your friend how to solve their problem when they’re talking to you. If you really feel like you need to say something, wait until they have calmed down a little bit to bring it up. [2] X Research source If they’re truly in a slump, you may need to do more for them. Help them with things like running errands and basic chores. They’ll really value it once they’ve bounced back. Sometimes people experience awful things like the death of a family member that cause them to go through the grieving process. This pretty much always makes people do things that are out of character, but don’t mistake this for them not wanting your support. If someone’s dealing with a tragedy, stay by their side even if they don’t seem happy to see you. Your best friend still needs your help and will never forget that you supported them the whole time.

Go to your best friend if you’re sad or angry about something. Be open with your friend and talk about why you feel that way. Not only will it help you feel better, it will build the trust you two share and strengthen the bonds of your friendship as well. [4] X Research source This involves practice being vulnerable by opening up and sharing yourself even in the face of rejection. Vulnerability may seem difficult, but it can help lead to deeper relationships as it provides your friend with a space to open up, too. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Encourage your best friend. You should try to support your best friend at all times, not just when they’re sad. Encourage your best friend to try everything they want to and do their best in everything they try. It will help put them in a better mood and give them energy to chase their dreams, something they will definitely appreciate. They’ll always remember the people who cheered them along the way to achieving their dreams. Even if you don’t approve of what they want to do, you should still support your friend as long as it won’t hurt them and won’t get them in trouble. You don’t have to do all of the same things your friend does. Supporting your friend when they know you aren’t a huge fan of whatever they are trying to do will mean a lot to them."

      "content": "Be loyal to your best friend. Don’t tell other people things that your best friend told you to keep a secret. Don’t try to get them to do something they don’t want to do for your own gain. These things will betray their trust and ruin your friendship forever. This might mean making some tough decisions about who your loyalty lies with when two of your friends are in a conflict. At the end of the day, you should stand by your best friend’s side. This kind of unconditional loyalty is very important. If you want your best friend to trust you with their secrets, you will probably have to tell them a few of your own. If you ever have something you feel like you just have to get off your chest, your best friend should be one of the first people you turn to. Sharing secrets with one another will make it easy for the two of you to be loyal to one another."

      "content": "View friends as equals. You shouldn’t look down on your friends and you shouldn’t treat them like royalty either. People don’t like it when other people think they are better than them. At the same time, most people get uncomfortable when it’s clear that someone has low self-esteem in comparison to them. At the end of the day, we’re all just people. Try to remember this at all times. If this is something you continually struggle with, put an effort into thinking about what you are going to say and how people might see it. It shouldn’t like you’re trying to be mean to your friend to yourself. If you monitor yourself carefully, your habits will naturally change in time."

You’ll be happier finding the humor in the little things and people will want to spend more time with you. Don’t worry if you aren’t a natural comedian. A good way to be funny is to surround yourself with people, media, and things that make you laugh. Watch comedies and listen to comedians. Take some time to relax each day if you have a stressful schedule. It won’t happen overnight, but soon you’ll be more comfortable doing things and cracking jokes that make people laugh.

Unless they’re not terribly perceptive, they’ll be able to see straight through your act. No one wants to hang out with posers. Being yourself will attract friends who like you for you, not for what you’re trying to be. Being your genuine self means being open, honest, and sincere about who you are. It also means keeping your word and being trustworthy. Practice being genuine with yourself and others. This will help you build your relationships with others, as well as your self-confidence.
