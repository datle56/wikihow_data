When you're optimistic, you look for the potential benefits or life lessons learned from even the most difficult situations. [1] X Research source Think of negative things as temporary rather than a permanent state. When you have negative thoughts or feelings, examine them and think of alternative ways to respond. Life coach Leah Morris recommends that you \"look at negative situations with a curious mindset, ask what needs to change here, why is this so negative? How can I begin taking steps in a different direction, potentially? What lesson can I gain from this at the end of the day?\" [2] X Expert Source Leah Morris Life Coach Expert Interview. 19 June 2020."
