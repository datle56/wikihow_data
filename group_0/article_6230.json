      "content": "Have your Master Ball ready. The best method is to save your Master Ball for Latios, since it tends to flee. If you did not save your Master Ball, you'll need to see the next section of this article. You can scroll down or use the Table of Contents at the top."

      "content": "Travel to a good area. Latios is a roaming Pokémon and will be found just about anywhere. To make Latios easier to catch, you'll want to go in an area where you can reload easily, such as opening up a cave near a field using a secret power."

      "title": "Search for Latios.",
      "content": "Search for Latios. Search around through the grass or other environment until you find Latios. Don't waste time fighting other Pokémon; run from any other battles. If you haven't found Latios in an area after 5 minutes of running around, exit the area and reenter."

      "title": "Have your Pokémon ready.",
      "content": "Have your Pokémon ready. You're going to need a Level 40 Pokémon to take on Latios. Get a Trapinch or a Wobbuffet or any high level Pokémon that knows Mean Look (such as a Golbat or Crobat). Give a Pokémon that has Mean Look the Quick Claw ability and buy some Carbos for it (to be sure it's a top speed). Put this Pokémon at the top of your party. Wobbuffet and Trapinch are useful because their Shadow Tag (Wobbuffet) and Arena Trap (Trapinch) abilities will keep Latios from escaping."

      "content": "Buy tons of Ultra Balls. These will be your best bet for catching Latios. A regular Poké Ball is not recommended."

    {
      "title": "Use your abilities.",
      "content": "Use your abilities. If you chose Trapinch or Wobbuffet, whittle down his HP and throw tons of Ultra Balls. Otherwise, use Mean Look right at the beginning of the fight. If you make Latios faint, reset. If he gets away, you can now track him with your Pokédex, in the style you use to track the legendary dogs in G/S/C."
