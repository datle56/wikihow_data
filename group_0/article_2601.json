      "content": "Style your hair so that it looks loose and soft. Use a curling iron and a little finishing spray to style your hair into loose waves, perfect curls, or a casual updo. For a more cutesy style, try no-heat styles like pigtails or braids. To keep your hair soft, use a natural oil-based product such as an Argan oil heat protectant. Work a pea-sized amount of this product through the ends of your hair before you use heat tools. For this look, avoid angular cuts, razor cuts, and using lots of product. You can also add cute hair accessories, such as headbands and bows."
