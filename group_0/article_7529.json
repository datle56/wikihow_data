[4] X Research source If you mention the author's name in the sentence that introduces the quote, include the year in parentheses after the author's name, and the page number in parentheses after the end of quote. For example: In his poem \"Fire and Ice,\" Robert Frost (1923) says, \"Some say the world will end in fire.\" (p. 1) If you don't include the author's name in the sentence that introduces the quote, provide all three pieces of information, separated by commas, in parentheses after the end of the quote.

Do not surround the title of a poem with quotation marks. Use the title References at the top of your page. Alphabetize your entries by the author's last name. If you have more than one source by the same author, use the date of publication to list them chronologically.

Maintain the same double spacing you have throughout the rest of your paper.
