      "content": "Wet a sponge with water and mild soap. Paper money is fragile, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be cleaned! The best way to clean paper dollar bills is with a little bit of soap and water. Wet a clean sponge until it’s dripping wet, then squeeze out most of the water before placing a small dab of mild soap on it. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the sponge to wipe down the front and back of the paper bill. Place the bill on a flat surface. With a gentle hand, wipe the soapy sponge over the back and front of the bill. Be very careful with this, as wet bills are more prone to breaking. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Rinse the bill in a clean tub of water. Fill a shallow tub, bucket, or sink with clean water. Then, carefully dip the sudsy paper bill in the water to rinse it. Remove the bill quickly to avoid letting it sit in the water for too long. [3] X Research source Some say to run the bill under the tap with a low trickle of water. While you can do this, it may accidentally tear the bill due to the water pressure."

      "title": "Leave the bill out to air-dry.",
      "content": "Leave the bill out to air-dry. Lay the paper bill on a clean towel or paper towel to air-dry, flipping it periodically. You can also hang it on a clothes line or let it sit out in the sun to speed up the process. Only repocket the money once it’s fully dry."

      "title": "Place a few loose paper bills in a lingerie bag.",
      "content": "Place a few loose paper bills in a lingerie bag. Lingerie bags are small, zip-up bags made of fine mesh that are designed to safely wash delicate undergarments. But in this case, you can also use them to wash money in the washing machine! Place your dirty bills inside the lingerie bag. Make sure all the bills are separated and laid out flat. It may be a good idea to put a folded hand towel or another small washable item in the bag with the paper money to keep it from getting knocked around as much during the wash cycle. Disclaimer: There’s no guarantee that your paper money won’t be damaged when cleaning it in the washing machine, so hand-washing the bills is generally a safer option. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Wash the bills in cold water on a gentle cycle.",
      "content": "Wash the bills in cold water on a gentle cycle. Set the washing machine to a gentle wash cycle on a cold temperature setting and turn it on. Place the lingerie bag containing the money in the washing machine as it fills. Add a very small amount of detergent to the load. Let the money complete the cycle in the wash. Stop the washing machine and take a look at the bills every now and then to make sure they aren’t tearing or coming apart in the wash. If the bills you’re cleaning are especially old or fragile, consider stopping the wash cycle early to prevent possible damage. Why don’t the bills disintegrate in the washing machine? Dollar bills are constructed mostly of cotton and durable cellulose fibers, meaning that they can safely be cleaned in a washing machine under the right conditions. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Lay the bills out to dry.",
      "content": "Lay the bills out to dry. Take the lingerie bag out of the washing machine. Remove the loose bills from the bag. Be very careful: the wet money is delicate and can be easily torn. Separate the bills and lay them out on a towel or another flat, dry surface. Let the bills dry completely before handling. Leaving the bills beneath a ceiling fan on a low setting allows air to circulate around them, which can help dry them faster. Paper money should only be air-dried, just to be on the safe side. Never put loose bills through the dryer or use a hairdryer or other heat source to dry them."

      "title": "Fill a sink or basin with warm water and mix in a gentle soap.",
      "content": "Fill a sink or basin with warm water and mix in a gentle soap. Run some warm water into a sink or shallow basin. Add a small amount of mild liquid soap to the water and make sure it’s evenly distributed to form a soapy solution. For cleaning coins that change hands often, most standard dish or hand soaps will work. [6] X Research source Mild soaps are preferable if you’re a collector or wish to preserve the condition of the coin. Most detergents contain abrasive elements that can wear away a coin’s detailing. Disclaimer: This method should only be used on inexpensive coins, not collectibles. If you have a collectible coin you’d like to clean, bring it to a professional to avoid accidentally damaging it."

      "content": "Soak the dirty coins in the soapy water. Place the dirty coins into the soapy water solution. Cleaning expert Grettel Monge recommends letting them soak for 20 to 30 minutes, depending on how dirty they are. The warm water loosens the caked-on dirt and grime, while the soap kills bacteria and eats away at stains. [7] X Research source Use a sponge, scrubber, or Q-tip to lightly scour the outer surface of the coins after they’ve had a chance to soak. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Rinse the coins thoroughly. Once the coins have had ample time to soak, drain the dirty water from the sink or basin. Then, transfer the coins to a kitchen strainer to rinse them, or simply hold them up to the faucet by hand. Run cool water over both faces of the coins until all traces of soap have been rinsed away. [9] X Research source Failure to rinse the coins sufficiently can cause them to retain a thin coating of soap that dirt and grime can later stick to."

      "content": "Set the coins on a towel to dry. Lay out an absorbent towel and place the coins on top. Pat the coins with one end of the towel to remove excess water, then let them air dry. [10] X Research source In roughly 10 minutes, the coins will be clean, dry, and ready to be handled without worry! Don’t allow water to stand on coins that have been washed and rinsed. The moisture can damage or discolor the metal."

Cosmetic acetone, usually sold as nail polish remover, sometimes contains scents and other stripping chemicals that can ruin the finish of a coin.

You won’t need to use a lot—only enough to submerge the coins when they’re laid flat. Acetone fumes can be detrimental to breathe, so make sure to work in a well-ventilated area. [12] X Research source Use a glass or ceramic container. Acetone can eat through plastic, styrofoam, and other synthetic materials. [13] X Research source"

Acetone is a powerful solvent that’s perfect for dissolving all sorts of stuck-on messes. The coins only need to soak for a minute or two to remove the worst of the grime. [14] X Research source Direct exposure to acetone may cause irritation to the skin. Wear gloves to protect your hands when working with acetone. Move the coins around in the acetone periodically to shake off lingering dirt. Use a Q-tip to gently wipe away any remaining residue or grime."

      "content": "Rinse the coins with distilled water. Take the coins out of the acetone bath. Whisk them through the acetone one last time to remove any remaining loose dirt. Shake off the excess solvent. Then, transfer the coins to another receptacle containing pure distilled water. You can also pour the distilled water over both sides of the coins to rinse them. Blot the coins with a clean towel and leave them sitting out to dry. Distilled water should be used in place of tap water because it does not contain fluoride, chlorine, and other chemicals that might react negatively with the metals used to make the coins.

      "content": "Why do people wash dollar bills? Most people wash dollar bills to avoid germs; however, criminals may wash money to make it look older. Counterfeit money or fake money is often run through a washing machine to try and make the bill appear worn or used.

      "content": "Is it safe to wash paper money? It’s relatively safe to wash paper money. While it’s not expertly advised to run your paper bills through a cycle in the washing machine, sponging down a loose bill is pretty safe. However, wetting a paper bill can make it more fragile, causing it to rip and tear more easily. Because of this, it’s important to use caution when cleaning paper money. The safest way to wash paper money is with highly pressurized and heated carbon dioxide; however, this is only done on a professional level. [17] X Research source"
