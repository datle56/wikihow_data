      "content": "See your doctor for help to quit using Xanax. Whether you are taking Xanax for anxiety or recreationally, it can be highly addictive and difficult to stop using on your own. Withdrawal symptoms can also be severe when you stop taking Xanax, so it's important to be under medical supervision. Make an appointment to see your doctor and ask about your options for paring down your doses and eventually stopping Xanax. [1] X Research source Never stop taking Xanax abruptly! You may experience withdrawal symptoms, which can be life-threatening in some cases."

      "content": "Expect to wait up to 90 days depending on the type of test. You will test positive for Xanax for a different length of time depending on the type of test you need to take. Xanax may remain in your system for up to: [2] X Research source 36 hours for a blood test 48 hours for a saliva test 1 week for a urine test 90 days for a hair test"

      "title": "Call in sick if possible to delay the test.",
      "content": "Call in sick if possible to delay the test. If you have to take a blood, urine, or saliva test, your best bet for passing the test may be to buy yourself more time. This is because no method of cleaning Xanax out of your system is foolproof except for giving your body the time it needs to process the medication. If possible, call in to work the day of the test if you don't think the drug has cleared your system and claim that you are sick. For example, you could say something like, “I barely slept last night because I was so sick, so I won't be able to come in to work today.”"

      "title": "Drink a reasonable amount of water leading up to a urine test.",
      "content": "Drink a reasonable amount of water leading up to a urine test. Drinking water will dilute your urine, and it may help to dilute the amount of Xanax in your urine. This might help you pass a urine drug test. However, you do not need to over consume water to dilute the Xanax in your system. The amount of water a person needs varies widely based on weight, sex, and activity level. [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source A common recommendation is to drink eight 8 fl oz (240 mL) glasses of water daily. Do not drink large volumes of water leading up to your test in an effort to pass. Drinking too much water in an effort to pass a drug test can lead to acute water intoxication, which can lead to severe headaches, swelling of your brain, seizures, and even death.

      "content": "Use mouthwash and brush your teeth a few times on the day of the test. Frequent brushing and using mouthwash may help to reduce the amount of detectable Xanax in a saliva test. Brush your teeth, tongue, and gums with toothpaste, and follow it with 30 seconds of swishing 2 fluid ounces (59 mL) of an alcohol-based mouthwash. Repeat this 2 to 3 times before your test, including 1 time 10 to 15 minutes before the test. If you are unable to brush your teeth right before the test, chew a piece of gum instead. This may help to dilute the Xanax in your saliva."

      "content": "Look into commercial detox products for a urine test. There are many different drinks and pills that claim to clear drugs from your system to help you pass a drug test. There is no guarantee that these will work because they are not regulated by any sort of third party organization or government entity. However, if you want to try a commercial detox product, this is an option. These products are available online. Make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for how to use the product. Keep in mind that these products can be expensive."

      "content": "Beware of potentially dangerous techniques. You may come across various suggestions for passing a drug test that are unverified and in many cases unsafe. Do not try these techniques! They are unlikely to work and you may end up injuring yourself as a result. For example, some people try to take large quantities of niacin in an effort to pass drug tests, which can lead to hepatotoxicity (poisoned liver). [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source There is also a method for clearing Xanax and other drugs from hair follicles that involves washing your hair in vinegar, acne-fighting face cleanser, shampoo, and then laundry detergent. This will burn your scalp. Do not do this!"
