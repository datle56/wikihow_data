      "title": "Determine what type of costume you want to wear based on your style.",
      "content": "Determine what type of costume you want to wear based on your style. Ask yourself what you want people to say or think when they see your costume. Do you want them to think you’re sexy, cute, scary, or funny? Knowing this can help you decide what type of costume you want to wear. After all, Halloween is the time of year when you can be yourself or someone entirely different! For instance, if you have a bubbly, bright personality and want people to think you’re cute, maybe you could dress up as Glinda the Good Witch from The Wizard of Oz to match your vibe or maybe a devil to be something unlike yourself."

      "content": "Style a costume around or against your usual vibe. Take a look inside your closet. Do you usually wear a lot of dark colors or maybe pastels? Going off of or against your core aesthetic can help you find a costume that’s totally you or a step outside your comfort zone. For example, if you generally wear dark, edgy colors, you could be a vampire or witch to match your aesthetic. To go against your normal style, you might be a princess, fairy, or deer. This is also a great way to shop your closet! If you know you want to amplify your normal style, see what pieces you already have in your wardrobe. Then, try to build a costume off that. For instance, a pink dress could help you be a princess or fairy. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use inspiration from costumes you once wore. Think back to the styles of costumes you wore in previous years. Are they still something you’d like to wear? Maybe they’re something you could build off of or turn into a different costume. [2] X Research source Let’s say you still have a superhero costume from a few years ago. Could you use the cape for a witch costume this year? Maybe you could even repurpose the mask or boots and be a villain!"

      "content": "Find costume inspiration from your favorite movies or activities. Your interests and hobbies can play a big part in choosing the right costume! Make a list of the things you love, like movies, TV shows, artists, sports, or books. Then take a look at your list—is there any character, motif, or thing you’d love to dress up as? For example, if you like soccer, dress like your favorite soccer player or a fan of your favorite team. If you love the Marvel Universe, dress up like Iron Man , Captain America , or Black Widow . If your favorite food is Cheetos, dress as a Cheetos’s bag ."

      "content": "Budget. Halloween costumes can be cheap or very expensive, so it's important to have an idea of what you’d like to spend. This can help you determine what items you should thrift or make for your costume and what things you can buy new. Just keep in mind that more elaborate costumes require a higher budget, but you can also do incredibly creative things with just $10! We recommend budgeting between $20 and $50 for an average full costume and around $10 for a DIY costume or accessories. When choosing a costume, consider what’s included in the costume, as some may be better deals than others when add-ons are accounted for. For example, a costume with a shirt, pants, hat, wig, and belt is a good deal if you get the lot for a single price. Keep an eye on sales, especially at the end of the season. Before and after Halloween, many retailers or costume shops will have deals on costumes. You may find a great costume for a fraction of the original price! Want a free costume? Costume designer Alina Bokovikova recommends shopping your closet or cutting holes in a bedsheet to be a ghost."

      "content": "Your schedule. Are you planning on making your Halloween costume? Do you have a lot of spooky events to attend? If so, it’s best to work your costume around your schedule. Think and plan your costume at least a month in advance. This way, you’ll be set for every Halloween activity and won’t have to scramble to find something to wear at the last minute. Planning ahead is crucial if you’re making your costume, as thrifting, sewing, or DIYing can take extra time. Similarly, try not to buy costumes at the last minute. The closer you get to Halloween, the fewer costumes (and sizes) will be available, which can make it harder to find what you’re looking for."

      "content": "Weather. Anything can happen on Halloween, even rain. Consider the typical weather in your area around the Halloween season and plan accordingly. For instance, if it’s typically hot, plan a costume that has shorts or thin, breathable fabric. If it’s usually chilly, accessorize with a cloak, scarf, or jacket. [3] X Research source Check the weather beforehand, both in the days leading up to Halloween and on the day itself. This can help you make the right choices about what to wear."

      "content": "Comfort. What do you plan on doing while in your costume? Maybe you’re going trick-or-treating , attending a party , or lounging at a friend’s house. Whatever the activity may be, it’s important to consider, especially when it comes to accessorizing. For example, if you’ll be on your feet all evening, wearing heels may not be wise. Similarly, if you’ll be hanging out with a friend watching scary movies, opt for a costume that’s soft and easy to move in, like a onesie ."

      "content": "Theme. If you’re headed to a Halloween party or planning a group costume with friends, it’s important to consider what the theme for the evening may be. Plus, this can help you narrow down your costume options! For instance, let’s say you’re attending a party with a 90s theme. You might show up as Cher from Clueless , a Spice Girl , or an aerobics instructor . If you and your friends set a theme of “Things You Can Eat,” maybe you go as a ice cream , banana , or cookie ."

      "title": "Audience.",
      "content": "Audience. When choosing your Halloween costume, consider who will see your outfit and how it’ll be perceived. The last thing you want to do is offend anyone! So, ask yourself, “Is my costume appropriate for who I’ll be hanging out with?” and “Could my costume be offensive to a community and culture?” For instance, let’s say you’re going trick-or-treating with your kid cousins. You wouldn’t want to wear a scandalous or sexy costume when you’re around smaller children. There are many costumes on the market today that misrepresent specific cultures or are a type of cultural appropriation . These costumes can be perceived as disrespectful if the costume wearer does not belong to the culture associated with the costume. For example, a non-Indigenous person dressing up as an “Indian chief” can be offensive to Indigenous people and their Native American culture. [4] X Research source"
