      "content": "Talk to others about astrology. One of the best ways to improve your grasp on the basics of astrology is to talk with your friends about your interest, and even check out astrology groups, both online and in-person. Bringing up astrology with your friends can be daunting, but many people enjoy hearing about themselves. Ask whether they know much about their astrological signs, and if not, offer to tell them about their sun, moon, and rising signs. If your friend knows something about astrology, you may have found someone to have more in depth conversations with. You can use the internet to find astrology chat rooms, forums, and even meetups in your area. The National Council for Geocosmic Research has local chapters with meetings listed on its website."

      "content": "Study astrological charts. Astrologers do more than just write horoscopes for newspapers, and learning the ins and outs of natal and event charts will give you the foundation you need to become an astrologer. [1] X Research source Charts are the way astrologers attempt to capture and predict moments in time. Learning about the astrological houses, chart progressions, aspects, ephemera, retrogrades, and the like will ensure that you have the tools to perform a full astrological interpretation. Try a book like Chart Interpretation Handbook by Stephen Arroyo for detailed instructions on how to interpret a chart."

      "title": "Practice interpreting your friends' charts.",
      "content": "Practice interpreting your friends' charts. Once you learn the basics of how to interpret astrological charts, practice with your friends and get a feel for the kind of work you will be doing as an astrologer. You can use online tools to generate their chart, like http://www.astro.com or https://cafeastrology.com/ . Some resources will also provide interpretations you can check yours against to see how well you are doing. If you are known among your friends as an astrology fan, you can see if they will recommend you to friends you know less well. This will give you practice working with people you don't already know."

      "content": "Get your chart read professionally by multiple astrologers. Before you embark on the journey toward becoming an astrologer, going to see a few professional astrologers and getting readings done by them will help you learn about the kinds of readings astrologers offer. Make note of what you like and dislike about each one. There are multiple traditions and interpretation styles in astrology, and this will help you narrow down which ones you prefer."

      "title": "Continue to read charts and learn about astrology.",
      "content": "Continue to read charts and learn about astrology. Astrology is a field in which having a strong knowledge base is very important. Throughout your more formal education and certification, keep practicing your skills and learning about advanced astrological concepts and methods. One way to move from being a serious hobbyist toward becoming a professional astrologer is to learn how to construct astrological charts, rather than simply interpreting them. Professional astrologers also use transits and progressions to do astrological forecasting, or the prediction of future events. Applying your knowledge to this aspect of astrology will put you ahead of most amateurs."

      "title": "Take classes or pursue a certificate in astrology, online or in-person.",
      "content": "Take classes or pursue a certificate in astrology, online or in-person. While it is not necessary, formal education in astrology can kick start your career as an astrologer. Taking classes with a known astrological school will help establish that you are serious and knowledgable about the field. There are schools where you can earn degrees in astrology, like Kepler College in Seattle, Washington, as well as local classes in most major cities. Online certification programs include the International Academy of Astrology and the Faculty of Astrological Studies. You should be aware that most institutions of higher learning do not recognize certificates or degrees in astrology, and so they function more as professional accreditation within the field, rather than universally recognized academic qualifications."

      "title": "Choose a career path within the field of astrology.",
      "content": "Choose a career path within the field of astrology. You should decide whether you plan to work with individuals, locally or online, as a consultant for corporate clients, or as an entertainer, writing horoscopes for magazines and websites. If you don't know what kind of astrologer you want to be, look up professional astrologers in your area or on a professional astrology association website and see what kind of work they do. Of course, as in any field, astrologers change directions and switch jobs in the course of their career. You aren't stuck with whatever you choose, but having a good idea of where you want to go will help you find mentors and get peer support."

      "title": "Find an apprenticeship with a professional astrologer.",
      "content": "Find an apprenticeship with a professional astrologer. Once you have established yourself as being serious about becoming an astrologer, you can seek out a professional to see if they will allow you to work under them as an apprentice. Be prepared for rejection, and have a list of possible mentors who you would like to ask, rather than placing all your hope on one. This will give you valuable experience, in addition to feedback on your readings if the astrologer sits in on your consultations with clients. Visiting a potential mentor will help them understand your commitment, and give you a chance to offer to help as an assistant."

      "title": "Attain certification with an astrological society.",
      "content": "Attain certification with an astrological society. There are many astrological societies in the United States and around the world. Typically becoming certified requires completing at least one examination and, in some cases, observed readings. Being certified will put you on the astrological map and give clients a good reason to choose you. Some major astrological certification groups are the International Society for Astrological Research, the Organization for Professional Astrology, and the National Council for Geocosmic Research. Certification as an astrologer will help you within the field of astrology, but unlike a Certified Public Accountant, yours will most likely not be recognized by other disciplines and trades."

      "content": "Determine the legality of astrology in your locale. There are cities, states, provinces, and countries in which the practice of professional astrology is outlawed. You will have to do the necessary research on astrology in your location to see if starting an astrological business is permitted there. [2] X Research source If professional astrology is not legal in your location, relocating or initiating legal challenges are your best options. Check and see if there is a professional astrological organization that would help back your legal challenge if you choose to go that route."

      "title": "Find a location for your astrological business.",
      "content": "Find a location for your astrological business. Some astrologers work out of their own home, while others have an office space where they perform readings and hold consultations. Renting or purchasing a space can be cost prohibitive for a beginning astrologer, but eventually it may be a great asset for your business. Other options to consider are online astrology and client visitations, in which you would interact with the client virtually or in their home, respectively. Both of these avoid the cost of an office space without making your home available to clients."

      "content": "Acquire the necessary documentation. Depending on your location and the kind of practice you plan to start, you may need to apply for a business license.

      "content": "Invest in astrological tools and equipment. Every professional astrologer need certain tools of the trade, like a computer for building charts, astrological software, and a digital recorder, among other things. Investing in quality equipment will help you convey professionalism and deliver good results. If you previously worked as an assistant or apprentice for an astrologer, take their set of equipment as a guide for what you might need."

      "content": "Establish your rates for astrological readings. There is a lot of variation in the amounts astrologers charge for their services, so find a balance between a rate that will pay the bills and a rate that will be attractive to clients.

Compare your rates with those of other astrologers in the market your practice operates in."

      "content": "Identify your clients and market towards them. In order to be a successful astrologer, you will need clientele to frequent your business. There are many resources for astrologers to learn who their audience is in their community and successfully reach out to them. Marketing at New Age and metaphysical stores and newsletters is a classic way to build an astrology practice. Be sure not to underestimate the power of online advertising. Targeted ads can help you reach clients who may not otherwise have thought to get a professional reading."
