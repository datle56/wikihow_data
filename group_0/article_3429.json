[4] X Research source Having a focus doesn’t mean that you must only make a certain kind of video, but it does help to build a following. If you run a business, try promoting what you do. For instance, if you have a hair salon, you might post before-and-after transformations! [5] X Expert Source Brian Honigman Marketing Consultant Expert Interview. 16 April 2021. You could also try focusing on what you don't know, or things you're comedically bad at!"

TikTok is a platform that celebrates fresh and wacky ideas, so don’t hesitate to be bold and do something that hasn’t been done before. [6] X Research source Remember to use the same hashtags in your video as the original creator so your video is easy to find. It’s fine to use another person's video as a template for your TikTok. This isn’t usually seen as copying so much as it is perceived to be a user participating in the format."

[7] X Research source Never skip this step—hashtags are crucial, especially when doing challenges. Tap the Discover option at the bottom of the app to see the latest trending hashtags, sounds, and effects on TikTok. When you tap a trending hashtag, sound, or topic, you'll see popular videos that have used those features. If you can incorporate any combination of trending topics into one or more videos, you're more likely to wind up on peoples' For You pages. While you don't want to mirror someone's content exactly, you can gain inspiration from TikTokers who are already popular on the platform. As long as you're using at least one or two popular hashtags, you can add some goofy or ironic ones. For example, if you’re singing a love song to your cat, you could use #TrueLove, #HeHatesMe, or #We’rePurfect, to add a funny element to your video."

[8] X Research source Sometimes doing your cool, creative, or funny performance to a trending song is enough to make you go viral. For example, #FakeTravel was a popular hashtag that used foreign-language songs and weird costumes to make it seem like the user was in a different part of the world. Children’s songs like “Baby Shark” or \"Castaways\" from The Backyardigans are always trending and can make for some funny videos."

From Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” to the surprising time traveler, there is no shortage of memes that originated on TikTok. TikTok also makes it easy to add your take to someone else's video by stitching or duetting your spin on someone else's video, which is essentially how viral memes are created—a video takes off, and other TikTokers \"remix\" the original song or punchline to add their jokes, hot takes, lyrics, dances, or stunts. [9] X Research source Making people laugh is a great way to get views. Rather than telling straight-up jokes, most comedic TikTok creators tell funny or embarrassing anecdotes, record goofy missteps, and dig into the most hilarious aspects of day-to-day life ."

[10] X Research source Take your time when crafting challenge videos, since they’re more likely to be seen than your normal videos. Some popular challenges are the \"Waking up in the morning\" challenge, \"Tell me (insert topic here) without tell me you (insert topic here),\" #InMyFeelingsChallenge, and #UnMakeupChallenge."

[12] X Research source Consider things like: Location: Consider filming in weird or funny locations or switching up the lighting in your room. Lighting: Natural light is best, but if it's nighttime, you'll want to make sure people can see you. Consider investing in a good ring light if you don't have a location bright enough to film in. Volume: If people can't hear you over the music, why would they want to see more of your videos? Listen to your video before sharing it to make sure it sounds the way you want."

TikTok tailors each user's For You page to their interests, which means that no two For You pages are alike. [13] X Research source In general, people react to things they recognize.

If dancing isn’t your strongest quality, simply have fun and use goofy moves to draw your audience in. Have you noticed more than one video that contains a particular dance routine? It's probably a challenge. Try learning it, or at least film yourself stumbling through the process."

Another example is if you posted dishes that you cooked on another platform, show how you cook it on TikTok. Attract followers from the other platform. Let your followers know that you are now expanding to TikTok and they can now find you there. You will start getting more followers on TikTok from the other. Put the link to your TikTok on your other platform for easy and simple clicks. Keep the same uploading schedule. Sticking to the same uploading schedule is important so you won't be overwhelmed. It doesn't make sense to upload on Wednesdays and the other on Fridays. If you think you can handle it, sure, but this is just to keep it simple. Give reminders like, \"Just posted _____ on _______. Check it out!\""
