      "content": "Decide which type of toy you want to try. You have several options when it comes to sex toys, so consider which one best fits your needs. If this is your first toy, you'll likely be most interested in a vibrator, dildo, or Fleshlight. Here is an overview of the most popular sex toys for beginners: [1] X Research source Vibrators: Vibrators come in different shapes and sizes. Everyone can enjoy the sensation of a vibrator. You can hold it against your external genital area or insert it in your vagina or anus. Dildos: Dildos look like a penis and come in different sizes. You can use a dildo inside your vagina or anus. Some models also vibrate for added pleasure. Strap-on dildo: This toy looks like a belt with a dildo attached to it. You can wear it while having sex with someone. Fleshlight: A Fleshlight is a sleeve that resembles a vagina. You can insert your penis into it during masturbation. Penis ring: A penis ring goes around your penis. It can prolong an erection, and you can also get a vibrating ring that creates a pleasurable sensation. Anal beads: This toy looks like a strip of beads that come in different sizes. You insert the beads into your anus for a pleasurable sensation."

      "content": "Read reviews online to help you pick the best sex toy for your budget. Buying a sex toy can be tricky, especially if this is your first toy. Fortunately, most of the toys you'll find available for sale have been reviewed online. Do an online search for sex toy reviews and look for products that have good reviews. Pick 3-5 products that have good reviews so you'll have a few options as you shop for your toy. [2] X Research source If your friends have sex toys, ask them what they like and don't like about their toy. They may be able to recommend a good option for you. Don't buy a toy solely because it's cheap - toys that are extremely cheap are often not safe to use. Look at the reviews and item details, too."

      "content": "Choose a good-quality toy made of body-safe material. Not all sex toys are made equally, and some are safer than others. You don't want your sex toy to damage your vagina or anus, break inside you, or otherwise cause pain. To be on the safe side, stick to toys that have a smooth surface and are made of sturdy materials, like stainless steel, glass, and silicone. [3] X Research source Stainless steel has a smooth surface without any places for bacteria to grow. If a toy has holes or edges, it may scratch you when you're using it. This might cause pain or irritation, so it's best to skip these toys. Don't purchase \"jelly\" toys or toys made of PVC; these materials have been linked to cancer and can cause irritation. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source Toys made of TPR, TPE, Elastomer, and SEBS are not as risky as jelly or PVC toys, but these toys can't be fully cleaned due to the material's pores. This means the toy can grow bacteria once used, so it's best avoided if possible. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Make sure your sex toy has a flared end if you're inserting it.",
      "content": "Make sure your sex toy has a flared end if you're inserting it. This is typically important for dildos or vibrators that you want to insert into your body. You'll need to be able to grip the end of your sex toy as you slide it into your vagina or anus. This helps you keep control of the toy so it doesn't go further than you like and so you can pull it in and out. Check the base on each sex toy that you look at to make sure it widens at the base. [7] X Research source Similarly, anal beads will typically have a ring at the end that stays outside your anus and allows you to easily remove the beads. Toys inserted into your vagina can't get stuck inside you; your vagina is only a few inches long. However, anal toys without flared ends can get stuck inside you (and require an ER visit to get out), so do not use a toy without a flared base for anal play. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Purchase a water-based lubricant if you plan to insert your sex toy. You can use many sex toys, like dildos, anal beads, and vibrators, inside your vagina or anus. The lube will help the toy slide comfortably inside, and makes pain or injury less likely. Pick a water-based lubricant to help your toys easily slide in and out. [9] X Research source Avoid lubes that are scented or warming because they can cause irritation. Check the ingredients of lube before you buy it. Some lubes contain parabens or other ingredients that can cause allergic reactions. If you choose a plastic sex toy, you can use a silicone-based lube if you prefer."

Fortunately, anyone can buy a prepaid debit or gift card to use for online shopping. [10] X Research source It's not illegal to buy a sex toy from a website as a teen. The only reason you can't go into a sex shop is that they tend to restrict their stores to 18 and up."
