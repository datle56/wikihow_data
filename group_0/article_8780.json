Do not include the angle brackets in your command and make sure that they are separated by a space. Alternatively, you can also type /clone then tap the Tab key to get the results for the coordinates of the block you're currently looking at, then press Enter to send the chat. You'll get an error message that your command was incomplete, but you don't need to worry about that since you're still in the process of cloning. Move to the block in the opposite corner of your structure, then open the chatbox and press the UP arrow to refill the chat with your previous command (which includes the coordinates for the other block). Press the Tab key to get the coordinates for the block you're looking at, then press Enter or Return again. You'll still need to fetch the last set of coordinates (the destination) for the command using the F3 key and looking at the spot where you want the lowest point of your clone to build. Don't use this method if you're not looking at the block you want to use in your clone. [4] X Research source"

By default, the cloning mode is Replace , which copies every block in the selected area. If, however, you want to change this, type filtered or masked after the /clone command. Filtered clones only specific blocks. For example, “/clone 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 1 filtered normal minecraft:stone” will only clone stone from the area. You must specify a filter if you use this cloning mode. Masked will only replace air blocks and leave any existing blocks alone. [5] X Research source You can use another mode after replace , filtered , or masked , which is normal , force , or move . Normal is the default setting and puts the clone in the specified area, but it will display an error message if there is any overlapping. Use Move to place your clone in the area, but delete any existing blocks. Since any blocks that exist already within the specified space will be deleted, you may end up deleting or removing blocks from an original structure. Force allows the clone blocks to overlap any existing blocks; this mode will force the blocks overlapping to be replaced with the clone."
