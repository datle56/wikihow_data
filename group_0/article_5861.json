It also knows the move Roar , which ends the battle and causes Entei to flee. So, use a Pokémon with moves or abilities that will prevent Entei from fleeing. [1] X Research source Moves that prevent fleeing : Mean Look , Block , and Spider Web . Abilities that prevent fleeing : Arena Trap (Diglett, Dugtrio, and Trapinch) or Shadow Tag (Wynaut, Wobbuffet). Sleep moves : Hypnosis , Lovely Kiss , Spore , and Sleep Powder . Paralysis moves : Stun Spore and Glare . Moves with a 30% chance of paralysis: Body Slam , Bounce , Discharge , Lick , and Spark . Pokémon options and move sets : Jynx: Mean Look , Lovely Kiss , Lick , Body Slam Gastly/Haunter/Gengar: Mean Look , Hypnosis , Lick Snorlax: Block, Body Slam , Lick , Yawn Paras/Parasect: Spore , Stun Spore , False Swipe Spinarak/Ariados: Spider Web , Bounce (HeartGold only)"

Dusk balls have to be used at night to increase their catch rate. So, aim to capture the 3 Legendaries at night, because this means you can use both Ultra Balls and Dusk Balls. Dusk Balls have a 3.5x bonus catch rate if the time is 18:00-03:59 (6:00 p.m. - 3:59 a.m.) [2] X Research source Ultra Balls have a 2x bonus catch rate if used at any time. [3] X Research source Pokémon expert Ethan Dobbs also recommends using Quick Balls to catch legendary Pokémon. He says to “throw a Quick Ball immediately” when the battle starts, “because a Quick Ball has the highest likelihood of capturing a Pokemon on the first turn.”"

Simply walk, run, or bike to an area where the city limits meet a route (any city, including Ecruteak City, Violet City, and Goldenrod City). Then, continuously run in and out of the city and check your map. Eventually, you'll see Entei close to you on the map, so you can run over to its location. [4] X Research source For the best chances of an encounter , walk between Ecruteak City and Route 37. Entei and Raikou seem to spawn at Route 37, 38, and 42 more often, which all surround Ecruteak City. Do not fly to Entei’s location . If you fly, Entei will immediately move to a different part of the map. Walking, running, and biking are the only ways to get close to it."

Then, use a sleep or paralysis move so Entei can’t hurt you or use Roar , like Hypnosis or Stun Spore . Once Entei’s unable to move, use attack moves to lower its HP to the red zone. [8] X Research source Note : Entei (and Raikou) can still run away when they’re asleep. So, it’s important to use a blocking move first. They don’t typically use Roar at the beginning of the battle. Make sure your Pokémon has a high Speed stat so it’s more likely that you move first. To raise its Speed, give it X-Speed or the Quick Claw item. [9] X Research source Tip : Use the move False Swipe to quickly get Entei’s HP down. This move lowers Entei’s HP to 1. Tip : Have your Pokémon hold the item Leftovers to regain HP as Entei attacks.

Just go heal your Pokémon at the nearest Pokémon Center and stock up on more pokéballs. Then, walk between a city and route until it comes close to you again. Entei’s HP and status (like sleep or paralysis) will be the same as when you last encountered it. So, the next time you battle it, you just have to throw pokéballs to catch it. Note : Catching Entei can be a frustrating experience, as it's very difficult to capture. While lowering its HP and putting it to sleep increases your capture rate, catching Entei ultimately comes down to luck! Just be patient and keep throwing pokéballs until you catch it."
