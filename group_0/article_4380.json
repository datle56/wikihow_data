      "content": "“Boujie” or “bougie” means being interested in money and fancy things. If someone is described as “bougie” (boo·zhee), this usually means they like buying expensive things and living a luxurious lifestyle. [1] X Research source The adjective can be used in a silly way to say someone or something is really fancy, or it can be used as a bit of an insult toward someone who comes off as snobby or pretentious. The term is an abbreviation of the French word “bourgeois,” which means “middle class.” [2] X Research source For example, someone might be called “bougie” if they’re always posting pictures of themselves doing expensive things, like eating at fancy restaurants or buying luxury clothes. “Bougie” can also be an insult toward newly rich people who flaunt their wealth in a way that’s considered tacky, or toward people who try to appear richer than they actually are. The most common spelling is “bougie,” but it can sometimes be spelled as “boujie” as well. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "“Boujee” has a more positive meaning than “bougie.” “Boujee” is a hip-hop slang term that became popular following the release of “Bad and Boujee” by Migos in 2016. While “bougie” is often used to insult someone who is snobby or trying to act wealthier than they actually are, “boujee” usually describes someone who worked hard to gain their wealth and now lives a luxurious lifestyle, while still staying in touch with their roots. [4] X Research source Since the terms are similar, they’re sometimes used interchangeably or confused with one another."

      "content": "“Bougie” can be describe a person, lifestyle, object, or location. It can be used as an insult toward someone who is snobby or someone who’s showing off their wealth in a tacky way, but it can also be used in a more neutral way to describe someone who happens to have expensive tastes. It can also describe a fancy or luxurious location. Here are a few examples: “That couple is so bougie. They’re always going on nice vacations and eating at fancy restaurants and then posting about it all over their Instagrams.” “I’m planning a girls’ trip, and one of my friends is being super difficult. Apparently she’s too bougie to stay at a hotel with less than 4 stars.” “My bougie cousin saved up to buy a luxury sports car, and now it’s all he talks about. He wants everyone to know how expensive it was.” “When it comes to clothes, I’m a little bougie. I’d rather spend more money on one expensive thing than buy a bunch of inexpensive things that won’t last long.” “That place is really bougie. They only sell super overpriced avocado toast and organic kale smoothies.”"

      "title": "The term “bougie” is a shortened version of “bourgeois.”",
      "content": "The term “bougie” is a shortened version of “bourgeois.” “Bourgeois” or “bourgeoisie” are French words that refer to the middle class, and they play an important role in German political theorist Karl Marx’s work. Marx used the term to describe the social class that owns property and has power in a capitalist society, as opposed to the wage-earning or working class. [5] X Research source In the 1970’s, the slang term “bougie” emerged as an abbreviation of “bourgeois,” and it was used to mock people or things for being pretentious or consumeristic.

      "content": "The slang term “bougie” originated in the Black community. Like many popular slang terms today, “bougie” and the later variation “boujee” come from AAVE (African American Vernacular English). Over time, “bougie” has become very popular and widely used among the general public, and because it’s so similar to the term “boujee,” people sometimes get the two of them confused. [7] X Research source It’s important to remember, however, that “boujee” is often used to describe a distinctly African American socioeconomic experience, so it can be seen as cultural appropriation when someone who is not a part of that community uses the term.

Stereotypically, yuppies are seen as materialistic and concerned with buying luxurious possessions and living a fashionable lifestyle. [9] X Research source Similarly to “bougie,” the term yuppy is often used in a slightly insulting or disparaging way. Here are some examples: “When all the yuppies moved into the neighborhood, rent prices went way up and overpriced coffee shops started popping up all over the place.”"

[10] X Research source It’s usually used in a more positive way than “bougie,” but the two terms are similar because they can both indicate that something is very fancy, and they can both describe someone who lives a lavish lifestyle. “She lives in a super posh apartment building. Everything is top of the line and very luxurious.” “He has very posh friends. They’re always dressed in super expensive clothing, and they’re really elegant and chic.”"
