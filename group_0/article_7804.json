      "title": "Spray the solution on your grates.",
      "content": "Spray the solution on your grates. First, make sure your grill is off, and that the grates are cool enough to touch safely. Use the spray bottle to apply the vinegar-water mixture to your grill grates. Spray more solution on spots that are particularly crusty. Then, step back and allow the sprayed grates to sit for 5 to 10 minutes. [1] X Research source This will allow the acid in the vinegar to eat through the oil and grease sticking to your grates. It will also kill any potentially harmful germs left behind by raw meat, leaving your cooking surface both cleaner and safer."

      "title": "Crumple the aluminum foil into a ball.",
      "content": "Crumple the aluminum foil into a ball. Cut a sizable piece of aluminum foil– about 3 feet (0.91 m) long. Then, crumple it up in your hands, creating a wad that’s a little bigger than a softball. [2] X Research source If you have a grill brush, you can use it instead of a foil ball. However, many grill users prefer using aluminum foil because it is less likely to scratch the grates or shed potentially harmful metal wires on the grill. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Scrub the soaked grates with the foil ball.",
      "content": "Scrub the soaked grates with the foil ball. Spray a little extra vinegar-water mixture on the foil, and then begin scrubbing any residue off the grates. Any congealed oil and grease should loosen easily after being soaked in vinegar. When you’re done scrubbing the surface of the grates, flip them over and scrub the back sides as well."

    {
      "title": "Rinse off the scrubbed grates.",
      "content": "Rinse off the scrubbed grates. Remove the grates from your grill and rinse them with running water to remove any last chunks of residue. Dry them with a towel or allow them to air-dry before replacing them."

      "title": "Mix the baking soda and vinegar together.",
      "content": "Mix the baking soda and vinegar together. In a garbage bag that’s big enough to contain all the grates, mix together two cups of vinegar and one cup of baking soda. [4] X Research source The mixture will begin to froth almost immediately. Remove the grates from your grill while they're cool enough to touch, and place them nearby so you can put them in the bag as soon as possible. Take care to protect your eyes from the vinegar– it can be a serious irritant. If any foam or liquid splashes on you, make sure to wash the affected area thoroughly. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Seal the grates in the bag.",
      "content": "Seal the grates in the bag. Close the top of the bag tightly by tying a knot, or ideally by using a strong rubber band. Then, place the bag in a sheltered area (such as a garage) and leave the grates to soak overnight. Overnight soaking is ideal for stubborn, crusty grill residue that may not soften within a few minutes of spraying it with vinegar alone. If your grill grates have significant oil and grease buildup– or if you simply wish to reduce the difficulty of scrubbing them clean– consider soaking the grates overnight instead of simply spraying and scrubbing.

      "title": "Rinse the grates with water.",
      "content": "Rinse the grates with water. Using a large sink or a hose, rinse off the grates, targeting any residue that’s still visible. The residue should come loose easily, but if it doesn’t, scrub it away with a large ball of crumpled-up aluminum foil. Scrubbing should be substantially easier than it was before the grates were soaked."
