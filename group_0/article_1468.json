      "content": "Sketch out which sections of your paper you will be applying your gold. It is easiest to apply gold leaf when you know exactly where you want it. If you are adding it to a drawing or painting, block out the areas that you will be applying your gold leaf and leave those sections blank. [1] X Research source You can apply gold leaf on top of paintings or drawings if you’d like to. If you don't have a lot of experience with gold leafing, practice on a piece of scrap wood before starting your actual project."

      "content": "Apply a pea-sized amount of adhesive to the paper using a paint brush. Gold leaf adhesive comes in many different brands, but it should generally be white and dry clear. Use a paintbrush to pick up pea-sized amounts of adhesive and brush it onto the sections that you will be placing your gold leaf. If you have a lot of gold leaf areas, do 2 inches (5.1 cm) sections at a time so your adhesive doesn’t dry before you get to it. [2] X Research source You can find gold leaf adhesive at most craft supply stores."

      "content": "Pull your gold leaf on top of your adhesive using tweezers. Touch your gold leaf as little as possible, since it is super fragile and can tear easily. Grab the sheet of gold leaf with tweezers and gently set it on top of the area you have put adhesive on. [3] X Research source If you have a lot of areas you want to put small chunks of gold leaf on, you can use your tweezers to tear small pieces off of your sheet and apply them on your adhesive one by one."

Use gentle, quick strokes to make sure you don’t dent the gold leaf that is stuck to the adhesive. Brush away your excess gold leaf until your paper looks smooth.

      "title": "Use a paint brush to brush adhesive onto your stamp.",
      "content": "Use a paint brush to brush adhesive onto your stamp. Choose any stamp you’d like and brush gold leaf adhesive onto it with a paint brush. Apply a thin layer that covers the entire stamp, making sure to get every detail and line on the stamp. [7] X Research source If you have a foam brush, you can use that instead of a paint brush. The foam will absorb more of the adhesive and disperse it more evenly. Using a stamp to apply gold leaf will give your gold the design of whatever stamp you choose to use."

      "content": "Press your stamp down onto your paper. Set your paper onto a flat, even surface. Press your stamp down onto your piece of paper, applying even pressure all over. Hold the stamp onto the paper for about 3 seconds to make sure all of the adhesive gets transferred to the paper. Gently lift the stamp off of the paper in an upwards motion. [8] X Research source Lifting the stamp in an upward motion will make sure you don’t smear or smudge your adhesive."
