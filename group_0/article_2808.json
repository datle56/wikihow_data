      "content": "Work on seeing things from multiple perspectives. Acknowledge that other people have opinions too. You could do this with almost anything in your life: politics, religion, education, personal beliefs, etc. You don’t have to change your mind or bend any of your morals, but try to see things from the other side. You’ll become more open-minded and learn how to put yourself in someone else’s shoes . [1] X Expert Source Sandra Possing Life Coach Expert Interview. 15 July 2020. Let’s say you’re a very devout Christian. Can you try reading up on other religions, or understanding the reasons why someone might not believe in God at all? Make a list of these reasons and see if it makes it easier for you to understand differing perspectives. This doesn’t mean you have to change your mind, but it will help you have a more open-minded outlook."

      "content": "Get to know people before making any judgments about them. Pre-judging someone can close off a relationship before it starts. Try to keep your opinion neutral until you actually chat with someone and get to know them more. Even if you’ve heard about them from a friend, you don’t actually know much about them until you talk to them yourself. [2] X Research source The next time you meet a new person, try to really understand where they’re coming from before you form any kind of an opinion. If they talk loudly, maybe they’re used to being ignored or looked over. If they seem standoffish, they might just be anxious or shy. When you’re meeting a friend of a friend, try to see it like this: if your friend likes this person, then there must be something good about them. Try to seek it out."

      "title": "Ask lots of questions and learn something new from everyone you meet.",
      "content": "Ask lots of questions and learn something new from everyone you meet. You can do this with an old friend or someone you’ve never met before. Ask them what they’ve been up to, if they’ve read anything good lately, or how their last vacation was. The more interested you are in other people’s lives, the more you’ll learn from them. [3] X Research source If you know the person well, ask them about what their childhood was like. You may hear some really interesting details and will learn something new. For example, you might ask, “How are your parents doing?” “How’s the city life treating you?” “What do you do for fun?” “Did you like growing up around here?”"

      "title": "Make friends with people from different walks of life.",
      "content": "Make friends with people from different walks of life. Broaden your friendship horizons to get different perspectives. It’s fine to keep your close friends that you’ve known for 10 years, but you should also try to branch out a little. Make friends from work, your ceramics class, your favorite neighborhood bar, or from different classes in school as well. [4] X Research source Though you shouldn’t hand pick your friends based on their diversity, try to hang out with people that have a variety of jobs, interests, and backgrounds."

      "content": "Accept more invitations. Though you don’t have to say yes to every invitation, you can make a habit of saying yes 50% more. It could be a potluck at your neighbor’s house, your aunt’s yearly barbecue that you always skip, or even a poetry reading your friend has been trying to get you to go to for months. Exposing yourself to a wide variety of events will make you more open-minded. [5] X Expert Source Rachel Clissold Certified Life Coach Expert Interview. 26 August 2020. Try to accept invitations to different types of events. Just saying yes to party invitations may not necessarily broaden your horizons if you say no to everything else. The next time you say no to something, ask yourself what lies behind this impulse: is it a fear of the unknown? An unwillingness to step out of your comfort zone? Once you identify the reason behind your hesitance, you'll be able to face it and fight it. [6] X Expert Source Sandra Possing Life Coach Expert Interview. 15 July 2020."

      "content": "Mix up your routine. Shaking up your daily ritual can help you cultivate open-mindedness. “We get so stuck in the same routine that we always follow the same path,” says Rachel Clissold, a Life Coach and Consultant based in Sydney, Australia. “So it could be as simple as taking a five minute longer journey to work to go the scenic route, going to a different café, trying a different food, joining the gym.” [7] X Expert Source Rachel Clissold Certified Life Coach Expert Interview. 26 August 2020. Have you never checked out that new restaurant in town because you don’t know what it’s like there? Now’s the time to check it out. Have you avoided signing up for that English class you’re interested in because you don’t know anything about Romantic poetry? Go for it. Have you avoided the Barre classes at your yoga studio because you’re afraid you won’t know what you’re doing? Take a beginner’s class to dip your feet in."

      "title": "Be willing to try new things.",
      "content": "Be willing to try new things. Keep an open mind about things you’ve never done before. Close-minded people are famous for forming negative opinions of things they’ve never even tried. So, the next time you catch yourself espousing a negative opinion about something, ask yourself what evidence you have to support your ideas. [8] X Expert Source Rachel Clissold Certified Life Coach Expert Interview. 26 August 2020. Try researching a subject to learn more about it. If, for example, you aren’t sure why people are vegans, try searching online or checking out a book about it. If you find that there is absolutely no evidence to prove your case, then you should try that thing yourself before you say anything else."

      "content": "Get out of your comfort zone. Pick something you’re afraid of and try it out. Maybe you’re afraid of heights. Take a tour up to the top of a skyscraper! Afraid of meeting new people? Go to a singles’ mixer or a meet-and-greet in your town! Make a habit of stepping out of your comfort zone as often as you can and you’ll slowly feel your mind opening up. [9] X Research source Sandra Possing, a Life Coach based in the San Francisco Bay area, explains that many people are hesitant to try new things because they want to have everything completely planned out. She describes how she “love[s] to challenge them to let go of that perfectionist need, that over-analyzer, over-thinker tendency and challenge them to just take imperfect action.” [10] X Expert Source Sandra Possing Life Coach Expert Interview. 15 July 2020. This then leads to a “really active exploration where they’re willing to try things without being so analytical and having to have it all figured out.” [11] X Expert Source Sandra Possing Life Coach Expert Interview. 15 July 2020."

You should read widely: non-fiction, literary fiction, magazines, newspapers, blogs, or anything in between. Read a book about a country you’ve never been to, or a book about a political movement you don’t know much about. The more you know, the more power you’ll have to make educated decisions and to be more open-minded.

See what other people are reading and get inspired. Spend hours at a bookshop or the library perusing the shelves until you find a book that speaks out to you. Then, make a goal of finishing it by the weekend. Join a book club by looking for one online or in your area.

      "content": "Try to cultivate a positive mindset. Many close-minded people view things in a negative light, while open-minded people tend to be more positive. Sandra Possing recommends keeping a thought log to change a negative mindset. “Every time you write down an unhelpful thought, also write down a different thought you could be thinking instead,” she says. [15] X Expert Source Sandra Possing Life Coach Expert Interview. 15 July 2020. For example, let’s say you catch yourself thinking, “It’s freezing today. This weather sucks.” Can you think of anything good about the cold day? Instead, try: “But there’s nothing like drinking a pumpkin spice latte in your favorite café when it’s cold outside.” Or: “Maybe it’ll snow later. I love snow.” You can find the good in almost any situation. Maybe you hate your 2-hour commute, but you love the alone time you get to listen to your favorite audiobook."
