      "title": "Research hamsters and their habits.",
      "content": "Research hamsters and their habits. Go online and find out what hamsters eat, what cage is a suitable size, what they like to do, where to buy them, and other relevant information. Ask a friend who has a hamster if they have any advice or thoughts on getting a hamster. Go to your local pet store and ask an employee there for information on hamsters, including how much hamsters cost, how often you should feed a hamster, what they like to play with, and any other questions you have. Make sure if you are researching online to look at several different sources and reliable sources such as the RSPCA. Hamsters are illegal in Hawaii and Australia so if you live in Hawaii or Australia you might want to look into other pet options!"

      "content": "Decide which type of hamster is right for you. There are five main types of hamsters: Syrian, Campbell’s, Winter White, Roborovski, and Chinese hamsters. Most hamsters are between 3 and 5 inches (7.6 and 12.7 cm) long, though Syrian hamsters are larger and grow to between 6 and 7 inches (15 and 18 cm) long. Roborovski and Chinese hamsters live longer and Campbells and Winter White hamsters are dwarf hamsters. With all of these options, make sure you find the type of hamster that’s right for you!

      "content": "Prepare to answer questions about hamsters. Your parents will probably want to know how long hamsters live (roborovskis and chinese hamsters live 2-3 years, Syrians 1-2 years, winter whites and Russian campbells 1-1.5 years), whether or not they smell (they don’t!), what they eat (A high variety diet), and other practical things. Make a list of facts about hamsters, and have this information on hand so you can answer any questions your parents have. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Think about how a hamster might coexist with another pet. If you have another pet, your parents might be using that as an excuse to not get a hamster. Learn about hamster cohabitation, find a room to put your hamster in that your other pet can’t access, and prepare to play with your hamster when the other pet isn’t in the room."

      "title": "Budget",
      "content": "Budget for a hamster. Research how much a hamster will cost. Depending on where you live, a hamster will cost between $5 and $20. A hamster cage ranges from $30 to $50 (you can make a bin cage for under $50). Additional hamster expenses, like shavings for their cage bottoms (you need to be able to put in at least 6 inches of bedding, 10 is better also don't use pine or cedar shavings), hamster food, will cost anywhere between $25 and $50. [3] X Research source One way to show your parents you’re really dedicated is to try to save up for all or part of the hamster expenses, so your parents don’t have to pay for the whole thing. Save your allowance or offer to do chores for money around the house."

      "title": "Plan a meeting with your parents.",
      "content": "Plan a meeting with your parents. By planning a meeting, you know when your parents will be listening to you. At the same time, planning a meeting lets your parents know how important a hamster is to you! Ask your parents what date and time works for them, and make sure to pick a time where they’ll be well rested and, ideally, in a good mood! If your parents want to know why you’re plan a meeting, tell them you have a proposal you’d like to deliver. Good times to plan for are right after dinner or on the weekends - avoid meeting at high-stress times like in the mornings or before dinner."

      "content": "Demonstrate responsibility. Show your parents you’re responsible before asking for a hamster. Pick up small tasks around the house, like helping your parents unload the dishwasher or do the laundry. If you have another pet, help your parents feed, walk, or wash it."

      "content": "Save up . If you are planning on purchasing the hamster yourself or contributing money to the purchase, start saving money. Practice spending less, doing chores or other small tasks for money, or even getting a job. Showing your parents that you already have money saved during your presentation is another way to demonstrate your dedication and responsibility."

      "title": "Present for your parents.",
      "content": "Present for your parents. Use a clear voice, and state the facts about why you want a hamster. Make sure your parents are comfortably seated and can see your presentation clearly and easily. Ask them to raise their hands if they have any questions, but politely ask they don’t interrupt your presentation until you’re finished. If your parents get frustrated or annoyed during the presentation, ask why they’re reacting that way and try to adapt accordingly. For example, if they’re frustrated that the meeting is taking too long, try to speed it up."

      "content": "Answer any questions your parents might have. Hopefully you know all of the answers to their questions. If you don’t, show your parents that you really want a hamster by considering what they asked carefully and coming up with an answer. If you have no idea how to answer their question, ask them if you can do more research and present the information later. If you have another pet, your parents might ask how a hamster can coexist with that other pet. Make sure you’re prepared for this question, and have a good answer ready! Try to listen to your parents with an open mind and without being defensive. Sometimes, people see things differently—and that's okay!"

They might ask you to get good grades, or walk the dog, or demonstrate some other sort of responsibility before letting you get a hamster. If your parents are on the fence about getting a hamster, offer to be more responsible without them asking. If you jump to the chance of showing them how responsible you can be, that will impress them and help your chances!"

      "content": "Be patient . Patience helps show your parents that you really care about a hamster! Remind them gently that you still want a hamster, but make sure you don’t talk about it all the time - you don’t want to annoy them either. Eventually your dedication will show your parents that you really want a hamster!"
