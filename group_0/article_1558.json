      "title": "Seal your tile if it’s porous and absorbs water.",
      "content": "Seal your tile if it’s porous and absorbs water. Porous tiles need to be sealed or resealed to protect them and keep them from breaking down over time. You can test to see if your tile is porous by placing a wet sponge on it for a minute and then removing the sponge. If there is a dark spot where you placed the sponge, then your tile is porous and needs to be sealed. If the water in the sponge stays as droplets on the surface of the tile, then the tile doesn’t need to be resealed."

      "content": "Choose a penetrating sealer if you don’t want a film on the surface. [1] X Expert Source Art Fricke Home Renovation & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 1 July 2020. A penetrating tile sealer will penetrate and impregnate the surface of the tile to seal and protect it. A penetrating sealer won’t change the appearance of the tile and will not peel or flake off over time. Penetrating sealers will last longer than topical tile sealers, but will not enhance the appearance of the tile."

      "title": "Go with a topical tile sealer to add a high-gloss appearance.",
      "content": "Go with a topical tile sealer to add a high-gloss appearance. Topical sealers sit on top of the surface of the tile, forming a protective film. The film will add a glossy sheen to the surface of the tile and can enhance the color and aesthetic of the tile, but is prone to peeling and flaking after some wear and tear. Topical tile sealers will need to be reapplied more often than penetrating tile sealers, especially if it’s used in a high-traffic area such as a bathroom or hallway."

      "title": "Use a solvent-based tile sealer for ceramic and porcelain tile.",
      "content": "Use a solvent-based tile sealer for ceramic and porcelain tile. Petroleum or solvent-based tile sealers work best on glassy surfaces such as ceramic and porcelain. They’ll protect the tile from scratches and breaks and will adhere to the surface better than water-based sealers. [2] X Research source Ceramic and porcelain tile are much less porous than natural stone, so a solvent-based tile sealer is much more effective at coating them. You can find solvent-based tile sealers at home improvement stores and online."

      "title": "Select a water-based tile sealer for natural stone tiles.",
      "content": "Select a water-based tile sealer for natural stone tiles. The naturally porous stone tiles greatly benefit from being sealed by a water-based tile sealer. The larger pores absorb the sealer more easily and are better protected and enhanced by it. [3] X Research source The natural pores of the stone tiles more readily absorb the water-based tile sealer. Look for water-based tile sealers at home improvement stores and online."

The tile must be completely dry before you apply any sealer to it or it won’t properly adhere to the surface. When you’re finished rinsing it clean, leave the tile undisturbed overnight or for at least 6 hours. Then, check to see if it’s dry by running your finger over the surface to feel for moisture. [10] X Research source If the tile is still wet or damp, wait another hour and then check it again. Use towels to soak up the water or aim a fan at the tile to help it dry faster."
