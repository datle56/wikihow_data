      "content": "How can you take a good birthday photo? If you’re taking a birthday selfie, professional photographer Crystal Bear recommends “facing the window with your phone slightly above eye level and looking down at you to make your chin look thinner.” She also recommends using the back camera and “putting it on a tripod” or “having someone else take a photo for you.” Here are more tips to take a good photo: Take your photo during golden hour: This refers to the time right after sunrise and right before sunset when the light is soft and warm. Natural sunlight usually results in more flattering selfies, as long as you tilt the camera to avoid harsh shadows. Find your perfect angle: Generally, positioning the camera right above eye level is the best angle for everyone, but you should also turn to the side to capture your “good side” and highlight your best features. Play around with props: If you want to go all out, stage a themed photoshoot with birthday hats, balloons, streamers, cake, champagne, and 22 candles! Choose a fun background: This could be a colorful backdrop, a scenic view, or anything else that matches your birthday mood."
