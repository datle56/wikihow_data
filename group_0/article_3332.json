Writing down a specific list of the ways in which your addiction is negatively impacting your life can give you a jumpstart toward changing your behavior. Rather than framing the addictions effect in general terms (\"It's destroying my life\" or \"I'm not reaching my potential\"), write down the ways that your individual life has changed since your addiction began. Seeing it all written down on paper might be jarring, but having the list will help you through the tough steps to come.

[3] X Research source Withdrawal symptoms are the opposite of how the drug makes you feel when you are under the influence. If you feel energized when you are high, then you feel extremely tired and groggy when you are in withdrawal. If you feel relaxed and happy when you are high, then you experience intense anxiety and agitation when you are in withdrawal. You may feel sick when you try to stop using, and you need to keep using to feel normal. Keep a log of how you feel and how your addiction is affecting you physically. Depending on the drug you're using, it might be causing skin damage, organ damage, dental problems, and other physical issues. Even if the physical effects are subtle, like you've lost a lot of weight or your face is aging more quickly than it should, write them down."

A drug addict may neglect responsibilities such as school attendance, work, family, and other duties like laundry, housework, car maintenance, paying bills, etc. When a person is addicted to a drug, their world revolves around using, recovering from the effects of using, and then getting more drugs. [4] X Research source An addiction is not recreational or experimental use. It is a compulsion that requires intervention to bring it to an end. Write down how often you’ve been at work or school lately. Reflect on how attentive you are to your responsibilities. Think about whether the addiction has taken a financial toll. Write down how much money you spend to feed it every day, week, month, and year."

It is not unusual for the addicted person to steal valuables or money to pay for more drugs. An addiction affects not only the body but it impairs thinking to the point that the addict can even consider stealing from others.

For most people, being arrested would be so jarring that it would force you to reconsider the course of your life. But in a person who is dependent on drugs or alcohol, those consequences are forgotten or the memory fades as soon as the overpowering cravings to use return. You may have been arrested for a DUI (driving under the influence) or for possession of a controlled substance. Your relationships may be in trouble or they may have failed.
