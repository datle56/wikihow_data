      "content": "Get a no-lye relaxer if you have a sensitive scalp. There are two main types of relaxers, lye and no-lye. Both of these have benefits and drawbacks, but those with sensitive scalps should go with the no-lye because it’s less painful and irritating. However, no-lye relaxers often dry out the hair. For this reason, those who don’t have sensitive scalps should consider using a lye relaxer. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Go with a regular strength relaxer for normal to thick, coarse hair.",
      "content": "Go with a regular strength relaxer for normal to thick, coarse hair. Different relaxers have different strengths. Pick a relaxer strength based on your hair’s thickness and texture. For most, a “regular” strength relaxer should work just fine. Get a relaxer with mild strength if your hair is fine, color-treated, or damaged. If you have thick, coarse hair, you can try a “super” strength relaxer. Make sure to apply it as directed in the instructions, as improperly used relaxers can cause breakage. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Don’t shampoo or scratch your scalp before relaxing your hair. Applying relaxer will be painful if your scalp is already irritated in any way. For this reason, it’s best to not wash your hair or scratch your head at all for at least the week leading up to application. [4] X Research source If you do accidentally scratch your scalp, the relaxer will likely make your head tingle."

      "content": "Apply a protective base cream to the scalp and hairline. Because relaxer can irritate your skin, it’s a great idea to apply a base cream directly to the scalp to protect it. Part your hair in multiple places and apply the base to your scalp. Don’t forget to apply the base to your hairline and around your ears as well. Petroleum jelly is also a sufficient protective base option."

      "content": "Apply the relaxer to the new growth in small sections. Use your comb or the opposite end of your applicator brush to get a small section of hair that’s no more than ½ inch (1.3 cm) thick. Using an applicator brush, carefully coat your new growth with the relaxer. Do this over and over until you’ve applied it to every section. If you’ve never applied relaxer before, you’ll be coating all of your hair. If you have, then you should only be applying it to your roots. Avoid getting the relaxer on your scalp. Don’t apply the relaxer to the parts of your hair that aren’t new growth. You’ll over-process the hair and may cause damage."

Your hairline is the area that people will see first when they look at you, so you want to be extra sure that you don’t over-process the relaxer along the hairline.

Set a timer for however long the box instructs. Strictly follow the time instruction. Some people leave the relaxer on longer to achieve “bone straight” hair, but it’s typically more attractive to take the product off when you’re supposed to because then your hair will have some body. Also, leaving it on too long can damage your hair."
