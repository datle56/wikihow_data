      "content": "Mix the resin if you haven’t already. You’ll need to mix your epoxy resin with a hardening agent before adding your colorant to it. Follow the instructions on your resin container to determine what is the proper ratio of resin to hardener you should use. [1] X Research source While there are plenty of paints, inks, and tints available on the market, most are not specifically intended to be used to color resin. For best results, purchase a paint or tint designed to bond with resin and bring out particularly saturated colors. [2] X Research source You can buy resin tints online or at nearly any crafting store. Be sure to wear eye protection (e.g., goggles) and rubber gloves to protect your eyes and skin during this procedure. If you’ve already mixed your resin and would like to color your leftover resin, you can skip this step."

      "content": "Pour a small amount of resin into a 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) mixing cup. Before adding your colorant to all of your resin, you’ll want to test it with a small amount of resin to make sure it produces a color that you like. Use a mixing container that includes volume measurements on the side for easier measuring. [3] X Research source For example, a small measuring cup used for dispensing cough syrup would work very well for testing resin colorants."

      "title": "Add your colorant so that it makes up 2%-6% of the mixture’s weight.",
      "content": "Add your colorant so that it makes up 2%-6% of the mixture’s weight. Slowly add the paint, ink, or resin tint to the mixing container, using a toothpick or other small stick to stir the mixture as you go. You can roughly estimate how much to add to make up 2%-6% of the mixture’s weight, or use a digital scale to precisely weigh your colorant and mixture. [4] X Research source Avoid going over the 6% weight limit, as adding this much colorant might disrupt the delicate chemical process that takes place in resin and that is necessary for it to be properly used. There is no harm in adding so little colorant that it amounts to less than 2% of the mixture’s weight. However, this may not be enough colorant to produce a different color in your resin. If you’re not sure how much colorant to add, err on the side of adding less than you think you might want. If it isn’t enough, you can always add more."

      "content": "Stir for about 1 minute and make sure there are no bubbles. You’ll want to ensure that your colorant is completely mixed into your resin and that the new color is applied throughout the mixture. Stir the resin until your resin is smooth and without air bubbles to ensure a smooth finish when applied. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Adjust the amount of colorant you use to achieve your desired look.",
      "content": "Adjust the amount of colorant you use to achieve your desired look. If your newly colored mixture is not as colored as you wanted, add more colorant to the mixture and re-stir. If the color is more than you want, restart the process and add less colorant to the mixing container until you achieve the effect you want. [6] X Research source If changing the amount of colorant you use doesn’t produce results to your satisfaction, consider using a different type of liquid colorant or a non-liquid colorant from around the house."

      "content": "Repeat this process for the rest of your epoxy resin. Once you’ve achieved the results you wanted in the small mixing container, you can now repeat the process to safely color the rest of your resin. Make sure you use the same proportion of colorant as you did with the 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) mixture. [7] X Research source For example, if you used .25 fluid ounces (7.4 mL) of resin in your mixing cup to test the colorant and your overall amount of resin is 2 fluid ounces (59 mL), then you should multiply the amount of colorant you added to the mixing cup by 8 to determine the amount you should use in the rest of the resin."

You’ll want to test your colorant in a separate mixing container to see how it affects your resin before adding it to the whole mixture. For best results, use a mixing container that includes volume measurements on the side. [9] X Research source For example, a good container to use would be a small measuring cup that comes with cough syrup."

      "content": "Use powdered pigments to leave tiny particles in the finished mixture. Powdered colorants like chalk, toner powder, and even herbs and spices will not only color your resin, but will also produce a grainy finish that might enhance your project. [10] X Research source You should definitely avoid using powdered pigments if you want your colored resin to have a smooth finish. Paprika is perhaps the most commonly used spice for coloring resin, but feel free to experiment with other granular spices in your kitchen to see which one works best for you and your project."

      "content": "Color with liquid pigments for a smoother, more consistent finish. Colorants such as children’s watercolor paint or dyes for home use can also be used to color epoxy resin. These produce a much smoother finish in your resin and are arguably easier for amateurs to mix with epoxy resin. [11] X Research source Nail polish and alcohol inks are also commonly used to color epoxy resin."

Whichever colorant you use, you’ll want to make sure you don’t add so much that it disrupts the chemical reaction that naturally takes place in resin. Aim to add an amount of colorant that would make up 2%-6% of the finished mixture, stirring as you add it to the resin. [12] X Research source If you’re not sure how much colorant to add, start out by adding a very small amount and continually increase the amount you use until it produces a satisfying color. Stir the mixture for about 1 minute, making sure there are no bubbles in the end result."

Then, once you're satisfied with the color of the resin in the mixing cup, add that colorant to the rest of your resin, making sure to use the same proportion of colorant as you did with the 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) mixture. [13] X Research source If you’re unable to achieve the effect you were hoping for, consider using a different type of colorant instead of a different amount."
