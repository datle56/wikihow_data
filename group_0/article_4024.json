Store it in a spot where it won’t sit in direct sunlight for days on end and especially where it won’t get wet (too much water will make it brittle). [26] X Research source Scratches diminish obsidian’s glassy and reflective surface, but they also change how it conducts energy.

      "title": "Obsidian forms when volcanic lava flows cool very rapidly.",
      "content": "Obsidian forms when volcanic lava flows cool very rapidly. The fast cooling usually happens because the lava flow encounters a lake or ocean, which gives obsidian its glassy, reflective luster. Most obsidian is black or very dark gray, but some varieties are red, brown-green, green, yellow, and (very rarely) transparent. Depending on what minerals were in the lava, the obsidian can also have a golden, rainbow, or white speckled sheen to it. [27] X Research source Obsidian can be found naturally anywhere there’s ever been volcanic activity, like Argentina, Iceland, Indonesia, Japan, Kenya, New Zealand, and the US. Obsidian has been used by humans for thousands of years. Early civilizations used it to make knives, weapons, carvings, masks, and mirrors."
