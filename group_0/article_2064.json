      "content": "Libras struggle with low self-esteem so he’ll love the ego boost. Despite their impeccable style and laid back attitudes, men born under this sign often feel insecure. Libra is represented by double sided scales, which is why your guy has a dual nature—confident on the outside, anxious on the inside. Compliments are a great way to boost his confidence. Compliments about his looks are fine, but deep down he wants to hear positive words about his skills and talents. You might say something like, \"I am so impressed with your guitar playing skills. You have a real gift.\""
