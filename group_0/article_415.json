      "title": "My God,",
      "content": "My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart. In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good, I have sinned against you whom I should love above all things. I firmly intend, with your help, to do penance, to sin no more, and to avoid whatever leads me to sin. Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us. In his name, my God, have mercy. Amen. [1] X Research source This is the version that most priests expect to hear during the sacrament of Reconciliation, or confession. It’s the standard version taught in many schools and Church courses."

    {
      "title": "O my God,",
      "content": "O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee, and I detest all my sins, because of thy just punishment; but most of all because they offend Thee, my God, Who are all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace, to confess my sins, to do penance, and to amend my life. Amen. [2] X Research source This is an older, more traditional version of the prayer. Many priests are familiar with it, and it’s perfectly normal to use it during the sacrament of Reconciliation, or confession. This is the version found in the Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church ."

    {
      "title": "Short version:",
      "content": "Short version: Lord Jesus, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner. This is a quick version that’s easy to remember, and is best used in private moments to ask God for forgiveness for small sins."

    {
      "title": "Latin version:",
      "content": "Latin version: DEUS meus, ex toto corde paenitet me omnium meorum peccatorum, eaque detestor, quia peccando, non solum poenas a Te iuste statutas promeritus sum, sed praesertim quia offendi Te, summum bonum, ac dignum qui super omnia diligaris. Ideo firmiter propono, adiuvante gratia Tua, de cetero me non peccaturum peccandique occasiones proximas fugiturum. Amen. [3] X Research source This is a very traditional version of the Act of Contrition, and is more or less a direct translation of the traditional version given above."
    },
    {
      "title": "Parable version:",
      "content": "Parable version: Father of mercy, like the prodigal son I return to you and say: “I have sinned against you and am no longer worthy to be called your child.” Christ Jesus, Savior of the world, I pray with the repentant thief to whom you promised Paradise: “Lord, remember me in your kingdom.” Holy Spirit, fountain of love, I call on you with trust: “Purify my heart, and help me to walk as a child of light.” [4] X Research source This version of the Act of Contrition was inspired by various gospel stories, namely those of the prodigal son and the good thief at the crucifixion. It’s not typical, but still valid."

    {
      "title": "Gospel version:",
      "content": "Gospel version: Lord Jesus, you opened the eyes of the blind, healed the sick, forgave the sinful woman, and after Peter’s denial confirmed him in your love. Listen to my prayer: forgive all my sins, renew your love in my heart, help me to live in perfect unity with my fellow Christians that I may proclaim your saving power to all the world. [5] X Research source This is also an unusual version inspired by the gospels. Again, it’s uncommon, but still valid."

      "content": "Lamb of God version: Lord Jesus Christ, you are the Lamb of God; you take away the sins of the world. Through the grace of the Holy Spirit restore me to friendship with your Father, cleanse me from every stain of sin in the blood you shed for me, and raise me to new life for the glory of your name. [6] X Research source This version centers on Jesus and invokes his name, so that he might provide intercession for us so that God may grant forgiveness through His son."

      "content": "Psalm 51 version: Lord God, in your goodness have mercy on me: do not look on my sins, but take away all my guilt. Create in me a clean heart and renew within me an upright spirit. This version is inspired by Psalm 51, in which David begs God for forgiveness after he commits adultery. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "There’s no “correct” version, but the standard version is most common.",
      "content": "There’s no “correct” version, but the standard version is most common. The standard and traditional versions of the prayer (offered above) are the most recognizable and widely used versions. That said, each version of the prayer is valid—it’s the intention that counts, not the exact words you use to express it. [8] X Research source If you’re unsure of which version to use, go for the common or traditional versions. A priest will most likely accept any version of the prayer you choose to recite. However, if it’s one they’re unfamiliar with, they may lead you in reciting a more common version."

    {
      "title": "Recite the Act of Contrition during the sacrament of Reconciliation.",
      "content": "Recite the Act of Contrition during the sacrament of Reconciliation. The Act of Contrition is most commonly said during the sacrament of confession , after you’ve confessed your sins and the priest has given you penance to perform. This prayer is a declaration of your regret and intention to reconcile with God, yourself, and those you’ve hurt. It comes toward the end of the sacrament, just before the priest blesses you. [9] X Research source Often, the priest will tell you to pray the Act of Contrition (or to “make your Act of Contrition”), but more specifically, this prayer comes immediately after the priest assigns you penance and offers advice. Other denominations, like Anglicans and Lutherans, also have Acts of Contrition that they say during mass."

      "title": "Recite the prayer in private to ask God for forgiveness.",
      "content": "Recite the prayer in private to ask God for forgiveness. The Act of Contrition isn’t just for the sacrament of Reconciliation! If you don’t observe the sacrament, or just wish to express your remorse and penance to God, you can say it any time as a way to reflect on your wrongdoings and to resolve to do better in the future. It’s often said before bed each night. Note that in the Catholic Church, sins are officially forgiven when you attend the sacrament of Reconciliation, or when you receive Communion. That said, Catholics and other Christians also believe that God has the power to grant forgiveness at any time, as long as you are truly sorry. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "The Act of Contrition has its origins in the Psalms.",
      "content": "The Act of Contrition has its origins in the Psalms. The “Penitential Psalms” are found in the Old Testament, in the Book of Psalms. They’re prayers that focus on confessing sins and seeking forgiveness. Many modern Acts of Contrition are inspired by these Psalms. [11] X Research source These psalms often mention “contrition,” which is defined by the Catholic Catechism as “sorrow of the soul and detestation for the sin committed, together with the resolution not to sin again.” [12] X Research source It’s hard to say when, exactly, the common form of the prayer emerged, since it’s an old and ever-evolving prayer!"
