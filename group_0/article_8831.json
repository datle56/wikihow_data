      "title": "Develop a script.",
      "content": "Develop a script. Work though in your mind what you would say to someone when you get them on the phone. Never begin your conversation with asking, “How are you?” It comes across as disingenuous, so save your pleasantries for people with whom you have an established relationship. If you are calling to book an appointment, briefly introduce your company and service, confirm that they are the correct person and ask if it is a good time to talk. If it is, you can now give them the pitch (otherwise ask if there would be a more convenient time to call back and make a note to follow up). Make sure you include a couple of strong benefit statements as early into the conversation as possible. Incorporate questions into your pitch. It is important that you involve the prospect in the conversation and questions are a great way to allow for interaction. Using some of the insight gained from your pre-qualification, you can structure questions that can create an opportunity to close. For example; “John, I understand that you have an XYZ controls solution in place at the moment, but does your company have a mandate to try to further reduce your utility spend?” Structured this way, you create an opportunity to close for the appointment. Refer if possible to a project you just completed at another company that profiles similarly to theirs in terms of size or industry sector, for example: \"We just completed a project with Mount Sinai Hospital and through the implementation of our controls solution, we were able to reduce their utility bills by 30%, with a projected ROI of 2.5 years.\" Note, though, that you would rather have the prospect be talking/answering questions, than have you talking more about specifics. The more specific you are, the more compelling your statement will be. You can then ask if he would be interested in achieving learning more, if he says yes, then you have your opening to ask for the appointment. Finally, read your script aloud. Does it have a natural, conversational flow? Is it too long? Does it allow for interaction? Try practicing it on colleagues to get their feedback."

      "content": "Do some practice calls to people on your list. It is normal that you find your pitch isn't quite right, or that your list needs refining. Try it on some live prospects to make sure it works. Redo your list or your pitch should it be needed. Normally, you don't get it right first time."

      "title": "Enter your list into an organizational system.",

      "title": "Anticipate and respond to objections from this list.",
      "content": "Anticipate and respond to objections from this list. When you did your practice calls, you should have gotten some objections like, \"I don't have any money\" or \"I heard your company is horrible.\" You should practice your responses to objections. Remember, a prospect that objects is still engaging and talking with you. That is a good thing and gives you an opportunity to engage them in good conversation. Many sales people hear, \"I don't have a budget to buy this.\" The skilled way to handle this depends, but could include seeing if the prospect would be interested if there was a no money down or pay later plan. Objections allow you to ask questions to help identify if an objection is real or just a smokescreen, as well as how you can provide alternative solutions to address the problem. Write down your list of potential objections along with the responses and keep it next to your script when cold calling."

      "content": "Keep refining and call some more. Remember that a good script is a work in progress and your first attempt may not get you the results you need. Ask yourself these questions: In retrospect, were my pre-qualification questions the right ones and or, do I need to add or replace a qualifier? Were my benefit statements strong enough and early enough in the conversation? Did I show enough value? Do I need to rework my responses to objections? Did I effectively close for an appointment when an opportunity arose?"

      "content": "Learn more about your prospect. Once that you identify that a company is a good fit, find more information about the prospect before contacting them. Have a look at their website and news to get a better feel for the company. Jot down a few key facts that may be useful in your conversation. Learn all you can about what your buyer is looking for. In addition to web research, you can usually talk to someone fairly low down the corporate ladder to get this information. You can often find them on LinkedIn.

Many sales reps swear by calling their prospects early in the morning or at the end of the day. Senior executives are extremely busy so catching them before their meetings start for the day or after they finish is your best bet. In addition, you are more likely to get through to them rather than hitting voice mail or getting their assistant. This also leaves the rest of the day for managing your existing clients and active prospects."

      "title": "Only leave a voice mail as a last resort.",
      "content": "Only leave a voice mail as a last resort. Leaving a message is usually not recommended unless you really can't catch them live. If you leave a voice mail and they don't respond, how many more can you leave without it seeming like harassment? If someone does call you back, you may be caught unprepared (what did he say his last name was? What company does he work for? What was the message I left?), this can lead to you feeling flustered and lacking control over the conversation. If you have tried getting hold of someone for several weeks without success, leave a voice message as a last resort. Put a post it note on your computer screen with the names of people you have left messages for with their company names so that you at least have some advantage and make sure that your script is close at hand."

      "content": "Consider going through the administrative assistant. Truly, it would nice if there were no administrative assistants and you could get through to the decision maker every time. But, many admins are will be very helpful if you ask them nicely. Ask the receptionist if your 'contact' has an assistant; if so, ask for his or her name and enter it in your CRM system. If reception puts you through to your prospect and you get his or her voice mail, hit “0” to speak to the assistant. Sound very busy and professional. For example, say “Hi Joan, its Fred Smith. I just got John Doe's voice mail. Is he in the office today?” If she responds with “Yes, but he's in a meeting,” ask what time he is likely to be free. If the assistant asks what is this about, respond if possible with a single word i.e., 'controls.' Before he or she gets a chance to ask more, ask if your contact be available later that morning or afternoon. Nine times out of ten the assistant will give you this information, and you will save time by not calling people who are out of the office. If the assistant asks to take a message, you may want to say, “Actually, I'm in and out of meetings all day myself. To avoid telephone tag, I'll just try John a little later.\" Make sure you keep a good record of the results from your calls. You want to review them before contacting the prospect at a later date, or before any face to face meeting."

Use the call + email strategy in these situations: When your prospects are younger. Younger people use phones less that older people. When you can get a list of prospects that includes their emails. You may simply be able to guess emails correctly by trying something like first initial.lastname@companyname.com.
