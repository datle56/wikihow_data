      "content": "Adapt your behavior. Your rabbit is a fragile animal and is easily scared. Your voice or the screams of your children might be interpreted as a danger by the animal. [1] X Expert Source Jamie Freyer, DVM Licensed Veterinarian Expert Interview. 7 December 2021. Rapid movements are often mistaken for a predator's attack. Never scream at the rabbit. It will be terrified and may mistrust you in the future. Some rabbits liked to be carried, others hate it. If you can't make your animal relaxed in your arms, leave him/her alone. If it's essential to pick the rabbit up, such as to remove it from harm, then hold the rabbit in a towel to avoid getting your arms scratched and to help the rabbit feel safe. Rabbits are easily overwhelmed if there are too many people in the same room. Avoid loud music and flashing lights. Your rabbit needs peace and quiet. On the other hand, if your rabbit is scared, play some calming classical music. This will help them to calm down and feel more at rest."

      "content": "Offer physical reassurance. Gently hold your rabbit and pet it. Stroke the rabbit's head on the top, near the base of its ears. Keep your fingers at the top of the rabbit's head so it cannot nip you. Speak to the rabbit soothingly and kindly. Try to establish a regular routine of petting and talking to your rabbit. Remember that some rabbits dislike being stroked on the nose, belly or underneath their chin. Covering the rabbit's eyes can help reduce fear. While stroking the rabbit, gently cover its eyes with your hands. [2] X Expert Source Jamie Freyer, DVM Licensed Veterinarian Expert Interview. 7 December 2021. However, some rabbits don't like this. If your rabbit doesn't quiet down after a few minutes, slowly remove your hand.

      "content": "Entertain your rabbit. If your rabbit is nervous, give it its favourite toy and play hard. Agitation can be a sign of boredom or lack of intellectual stimulation. [3] X Research source Give a piece of rabbit wood bought at the pet shop. Your animal will be very tempted to chew it and it's excellent for its teeth. If the rabbit doesn't show any interest for the game, stop after a few minutes and look for what's stressing it."

      "title": "Offer your rabbit a treat.",
      "content": "Offer your rabbit a treat. Bunnies can rarely resist a piece of fruit or a slice of carrot. If your rabbit is scared, give him/her their favorite food to calm them. Don't do it too often to avoid obesity. Put a small piece of fruit on your hand and approach your rabbit gently. The rabbit will slowly understand that humans can be trusted. Never offer them sweets or bread. Avoid tomato leaves and potatoes. They are highly toxic for rabbits."

      "title": "Go to the veterinarian.",
      "content": "Go to the veterinarian. If there is no apparent danger and you have tried everything to quiet your rabbit down, take him/her to a professional for help. Your rabbit might be ill and would benefit from a check-up. Ask your veterinarian to make a visit to your house. There is no need to add more stress to your rabbit with a car ride. Don't medicate your rabbit without having consulted a specialist. You might kill your animal. If you have more than one pet, quarantine the agitated rabbit to avoid contagion. Wash your hands and take care of your personal hygiene. If you haven't been vaccinated against rabies and have been bitten by your rabbit, immediately go to the hospital. Also wash your hands before handling the rabbit to get rid of the smell of cats, dogs, or other animals you have touched which predate on rabbits."

      "content": "Understand the clues. Your pet might not know how to speak but it will give you important visual clues when upset. These clues are subtle and you will need to be observant and know your animal's usual behaviour to spot the signs of agitation or fear. Look for the following: [4] X Research source Hiding in its den and refusing to get out. A sudden change of behaviour. Your rabbit becomes aggressive or wants to hide. Chewing the bars of its cage.

      "content": "Check for predators. Your rabbit is usually upset for a good reason. It doesn't want to be turned into a meal! Cats and dogs can kill a rabbit easily and should be kept away. [6] X Research source There are many other animals, depending on where you live, which constitute a danger for your pet. The most common predators, aside cats and dogs, are foxes, ferrets and all birds of prey. [7] X Research source Rabbits have an excellent sense of smell.

      "content": "Adjust their environment. Rabbits are herbivores and are not equipped to fight back hunters. [9] X Research source Their strategy is to hide as quickly as possible in a dark and secured place. You need to make sure that they can access a safe place at all times. [10] X Research source Have an artificial tunnel in the cage and/or in the room where the rabbit plays. You can find one in a good pet shop. A cardboard box that is larger than your rabbit makes a good hidey too. If they go out, make sure that they have a place to hide but don't let them escape."
