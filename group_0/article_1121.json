      "title": "Turn off the power to your garage sensors using your circuit breaker.",
      "content": "Turn off the power to your garage sensors using your circuit breaker. Go to your home's breaker box and find the switch for your garage’s power. Simply turn the switch to the “Off” position to cut the power to the garage door sensors. [1] X Research source You won't actually be working with the electrical wiring when you align the sensors, but it's always best to be safe when working with electrically powered objects. Tuttle says it doesn't hurt to check the wiring first (with the power turned off) to ensure that your garage door sensors are receiving power."

      "title": "Loosen the screws that mount each of your garage door sensors.",
      "content": "Loosen the screws that mount each of your garage door sensors. Don't take the screws all the way out. Just loosen them enough so you can slide the mounting brackets up and down, but they won’t move or fall off by themselves. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Slide each garage door sensor as far down as possible.",
      "content": "Slide each garage door sensor as far down as possible. Pull the sensors downward so they are as low as possible. Just make sure you don’t slide them so far down that you unscrew the mounting brackets. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Tie a string between the 2 sensors.",
      "content": "Tie a string between the 2 sensors. Knot a string around 1 sensor and run it across the garage doorway to the opposite sensor. Then, tie the other end of the string to the second sensor. Tuttle advises that you position the knots so the string runs across the center of the sensors, where the lenses are."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check that the string is straight with a level.",
      "content": "Check that the string is straight with a level. To ensure the string is straight and the sensors are aligned, Tuttle suggests placing a level against the bottom of the string. If the string isn’t straight, adjust the sensor brackets by sliding them upward until the level is balanced."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tighten the screws to secure the sensors in their new position.",
      "content": "Tighten the screws to secure the sensors in their new position. If the string is completely straight, simply tighten the screws on the sensor brackets. As you tighten them, just make sure neither the string nor sensors get out of alignment again. [4] X Research source Gently tap and shake the sensors to ensure they’re secure and won’t move out of alignment."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the string and turn the power to your garage back on.",
      "content": "Remove the string and turn the power to your garage back on. Untie the string from the sensors and flip the breaker switch to your garage’s power back to the “On” position. Once the power is back on, test the garage door opener to make sure the sensors are aligned and working. If your garage door isn’t opening or closing, it’s possible that something else is causing it not to work properly. Don’t worry—we’ll provide some troubleshooting tips in the section below."

    {
      "title": "Ensure the sensors are making a connection.",
      "content": "Ensure the sensors are making a connection. When you realign the sensors, Tuttle says you want to make sure the “lasers meet up and the eyes from the sensors are making a connection.” Most sensors have LED lights on them that indicate if the sensors are connected. Depending on the brand you have, both lights might be a steady green or one might be green and the other yellow or red. [5] X Research source Check the user manual that came with your garage door sensors to determine what the different LED colors mean."

    {
      "title": "The garage door isn’t opening or closing.",
      "content": "The garage door isn’t opening or closing. A clear sign that your garage door sensors aren’t aligned is if the door doesn’t open or close when you tell it to. Because the sensors aren’t able to communicate, the door might stay open when you want it closed, or stay closed when you want it to open. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "The LED lights on the sensors are flashing red or yellow.",
      "content": "The LED lights on the sensors are flashing red or yellow. Most garage door sensors have LED indicator lights that signal when the sensors are working properly or when there might be an issue. In general, a flashing light that’s yellow or red means the sensors aren’t aligned. [7] X Research source Note : The LED lights mean different things depending on the brand you have, like LiftMaster and Chamberlain. So, consult your user’s manual to find out what colored lights indicate the sensors are misaligned."

    {
      "title": "The door closes even if an object is in the way.",
      "content": "The door closes even if an object is in the way. If the sensors aren’t aligned, it’s also possible that the garage door might close even when something is blocking the sensors. Since the sensors can’t communicate properly, they won’t know if something is in the way and might close the garage door anyway."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove any obstructions blocking the sensors.",
      "content": "Remove any obstructions blocking the sensors. Double-check that there isn’t anything blocking the path of the sensors, no matter how small. Make sure that everything in your garage is at least a few feet away from both sensors, like your car, tools, storage boxes, or outdoor equipment. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Clean the lens on the sensors.",
      "content": "Clean the lens on the sensors. Dirt, grime, and dust can cover the sensor lenses, preventing the sensors from properly sending and receiving the infrared beam. Just lightly dampen a soft, microfiber cloth and gently wipe the lens on each sensor until they are both clean. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Shade the sensors from the sun.",
      "content": "Shade the sensors from the sun. Direct sunlight can sometimes affect the sensors and prevent them from communicating. If possible, unscrew the brackets and turn the sensors on their sides so the sun doesn’t hit the lenses. Or, attach a toilet paper tube or sun shield onto the sensors so they shade the lenses from the sun. [10] X Research source You can quickly check if the sun is the issue by shading the sensor with your hand or another object and trying to open or close the garage door."

      "title": "Check if the sensor wires are damaged or disconnected.",
      "content": "Check if the sensor wires are damaged or disconnected. It’s possible that damaged or loosely connected wires are preventing your garage door sensors from working. Turn off the power to your garage and inspect the wires running from the sensors to the door opener, taking note of any that show signs of damage or are loose. [11] X Research source If you notice any issues with the wires, contact a garage door repair specialist to fix them."

      "title": "Call a professional to see if the sensors are bad.",
      "content": "Call a professional to see if the sensors are bad. If your garage door sensors still aren’t working, the sensors themselves might be damaged or simply too old to function. Call a garage door repair specialist to come check out the issue and replace the sensors."
