Organized boosting is against TripAdvisor’s policies, unethical, and can even be illegal. If you are contacted by a company claiming they can help optimize your listing, then report them immediately to TripAdvisor. Keep in mind that no company claiming to have an official relationship with TripAdvisor that allows them to manipulate listings is telling the truth.

Fill out all the requested information with as much detail as you can so that TripAdvisor can identify and remove future or already-posted blackmail reviews. [7] X Research source A blackmail review threat is when someone contacts the owner of a business and threatens to leave a bad review if they are not provided with something like a refund or upgrade, or some other request is not met. Although these are often just empty threats, it’s important to report them immediately to put them on the official record. TripAdvisor takes blackmail very seriously and will do everything possible to stop these types of reviews from appearing on the site. If a blackmail review has already been posted on your listing, then follow the process for reporting suspicious reviews and provide all the proof you have that a specific review is the result of a blackmail threat.
