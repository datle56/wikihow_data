As long as your package has a tracking number, is being handled by USPS right before delivery, and isn’t already out for delivery , it’s possible to update the delivery instructions and have it held at your local post office. From there, you can pick up the package as soon as it arrives so you don’t have to wait until the end of the day (or the following day) for delivery. [1] X Research source Alternatively, request a Package Intercept to redirect the package to a different facility that may be closer to you than the intended delivery address. Requesting to hold the package at your local post office does not come with a fee, but it does cost $17 to intercept, or redirect, your package to a different location. [2] X Research source Submit a request to hold your package or intercept it online at least 2 days before the expected delivery date, instead of showing up to your local post office the day of. Even if you show up early, it will be difficult to locate your package before it goes on the truck."
