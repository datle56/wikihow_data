      "content": "Yes, Christians can usually drink holy water. Technically, it’s not a sin. When it comes to Christianity’s official rules around holy water, things are a little murky. Most denominations don’t have any rules about drinking it, but other denominations, like Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Rite Catholics, drink it as part of certain celebrations and holy days, like on the feast of the Theophany. [1] X Research source If you’re not sure if your particular denomination allows it, ask a priest or another member of the clergy! Drinking holy water isn’t better or holier than just sprinkling it over yourself, or using it to bless yourself."

      "content": "Some priests say to avoid drinking it in a disrespectful context. Holy water is a blessed object that Christians are meant to respect, like a rosary or a cross. [2] X Research source That’s why, even though it’s not a sin, many people in the church say to be careful when using it. It might not be respectful to drink holy water just for fun, or because you’re a little thirsty. Before you drink holy water, make sure you’re using it to deepen your faith or spiritual connection to God, which is what it’s for! Many priests also remind us that drinking holy water because you think it’ll heal you is a superstition, and not encouraged."

      "content": "Some believe drinking holy water can help you grow spiritually. The whole purpose of holy water is to remind us of, and renew, our baptism. It’s a sacramental tool that fills us with grace, and helps us remember God’s love, as well as our salvation. [3] X Research source That said, there’s no advantage to drinking holy water instead of just blessing yourself with it. The effects are the same! Some say holy water has healing properties, but many priests say that’s just a superstition, and superstition is a sin. Even if holy water does sometimes heal, you shouldn’t expect it to. The Church urges its followers to put their trust in doctors."

      "title": "Drinking unfiltered holy water could make you sick.",
      "content": "Drinking unfiltered holy water could make you sick. Even though you probably won’t get into trouble with the Church for drinking holy water, you probably shouldn’t drink it, anyway. Most of the water you drink is filtered and purified for drinking. Holy water isn’t exactly clean or purified, even if it is holy, and can harbor unsafe bacteria that can make you sick. When in doubt, it’s best to stay away. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Especially avoid drinking holy water from springs or holy water fonts in churches. Many people, or even animals, have touched these, and they’re definitely not safe to consume. If you want to drink holy water, drink it from a sealed bottle, or drink holy water that’s just been blessed and hasn’t been handled by anyone but a priest."

      "title": "Holy water is normal water that’s been blessed by a priest.",
      "content": "Holy water is normal water that’s been blessed by a priest. Most holy water is just regular old water—at least until a priest gives it a special blessing, which turns it into holy water . Then, the water becomes a sacramental, which is a tool used by believers to help practice their faith. [5] X Research source There’s nothing physically different between regular water and holy water, but there is a spiritual difference, and that’s what matters! Some say holy water dates back to 400 AD, and was first used by St. Matthew, the apostle. [6] X Research source There are some holy water springs around the world. These are places where the water is thought to have healing or spiritual properties. Some holy water springs have been blessed, so that all the water that comes from them is automatically holy water."

      "title": "Bless yourself with holy water to remember your baptism.",
      "content": "Bless yourself with holy water to remember your baptism. Holy water fonts are in almost every church. When you enter and exit the church, dip a couple fingers into the font and make the sign of the cross . This is a sign that reminds us that we’re baptized and filled with God’s grace as we get ready for mass, and as we leave mass to live our lives in grace. [7] X Research source This is the most common use of holy water, and is the main way Christians use it. During mass, a priest sometimes sprinkles holy water over the congregation with an “aspergillum,” or washes his hands with it, to purify himself and others."

This helps remind you to live with virtue and grace, even as you do things like prepare for bed or cook a meal. It’s also one way to offer everything you do up to God, and to immerse yourself in faith. [8] X Research source Dip your fingers into the water and flick it, or use a pine branch as an aspergillum to sprinkle it around."

Sprinkle holy water over your crops or houseplants, or sprinkle it over your belongings, like your pillows, keys, glasses, or virtually anything else. This helps keep them safe, and reminds you that everything you own, you owe to God. It’s a great way to give thanks for the things you have. [9] X Research source"

Carry some holy water with you throughout the day, or bless yourself with it now and then, to keep the devil away to ward off other evil forces. [10] X Research source"
