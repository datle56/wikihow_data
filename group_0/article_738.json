      "content": "Check the \"Show bookmarks\" box. Click \"OK\" to close the Word Options dialog. Any text within the bookmarked section will be surrounded by brackets; if there is no text within the bookmark, it instead appears as an I-beam. Neither the brackets nor the I-beam print. Text within a bookmark can be edited the same as text outside the bookmark. If you cut or copy a portion of the bookmarked text to a new location, the moved text is not bookmarked. If you add to the text within the bookmark brackets, the new text becomes part of the bookmarked text; if you delete part of the text inside the bookmark brackets, the bookmark remains with the remaining text. If you cut and paste an entire bookmarked item, including the bookmark itself, to a new location in the same document, the bookmark moves with the moved text; if you do not include the bookmark, it remains where it is in the document. If you copy a bookmarked item to another document, including the bookmark brackets, both the original and the new document will have bookmarks. For this reason, it's a good idea to display any bookmarks before editing your text to make sure the bookmarks end up where you want them to end up when you're done editing."
