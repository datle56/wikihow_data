      "content": "Use powder blush if you have oily skin. Forms of blush made out of liquid and cream do not hold up well on oily skin. Powder blush, on the other hand, deals with natural oil extremely well, lasting far longer without the need for constant reapplication. [1] X Research source If you have oily skin, you'll likely notice that your skin looks shiny throughout the day, especially along your T-zone, or the area across your forehead and down to your nose and chin.

      "content": "Pick a blush shade that matches your skin tone . If you’re going for a natural look, you’ll want to pick a blush color that complements your skin tone. In general, light pink blush looks good on people with fair skin, peach and bronze tones work best on those with medium skin, and dark burgundy and mauve shades appear most natural on people with dark skin."

      "title": "Choose a blush formula that matches your skin type.",
      "content": "Choose a blush formula that matches your skin type. If you have extremely oily skin, go with a loose blush powder to ensure your makeup doesn’t look cakey. For dry skin, a pressed powder can conceal any unwanted wrinkles or flakes. If you have sensitive skin, look for a mineral-based blush formula. Pressed and loose blush both have mineral variants. Your blush will look more natural if your skin is hydrated. If your skin is dry, try spritzing it with a setting spray or a hydrating spray before you apply your blush.

      "content": "Pick a finish that emphasizes the look you’re going for. Go with a matte blush for most day-to-day activities since it will add color to your face without drastically altering your overall look. To make your face appear softer, look for a satin powder blush. If you want to bring a lot of attention to your makeup, try using shimmer or glitter blush. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Put blush on the apples of your cheeks for a cute, young look.",
      "content": "Put blush on the apples of your cheeks for a cute, young look. Apples are the small, circular parts of your cheek that stick out when you smile. If you cover your apples with a thin coat of blush, you’ll emphasize your smile and create the perky, childlike look most people associate with rouge. [5] X Research source This style of makeup works particularly well for people with oval faces. Avoid using this style if you have a round face. Unless you’re going for clown couture, apply only a small amount of blush to your apples."

      "title": "Emphasize your face shape by putting blush high on your cheekbones.",
      "content": "Emphasize your face shape by putting blush high on your cheekbones. To find your cheekbone, look for an imaginary line that connects the center of your ear to your nostril. Though most people apply blush directly below this line, you can add it on top to bring a lot of emphasis to your cheekbones and general facial structure. [6] X Research source This style of makeup is reminiscent of high fashion and will make you look more chic. High cheekbone blush works particularly well for people with long faces. It is not quite as effective on people with short faces."

      "content": "Apply blush to the cheekbones and temples to flatter a wide face. If you have a square or round face , long, emphasized cheekbones may not be the best course of action. Instead, apply makeup to the center of your cheek and curve it up toward your brow, creating a “C” shape. This will slim your face down while flattering your natural curves and the apples of your cheeks. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Brush blush out from the apples to flatter a long face.",
      "content": "Brush blush out from the apples to flatter a long face. If you have an oblong, oval, or heart-shaped face, place blush on or just below the apples of your cheeks. Then, blend the makeup out to your ears, slanting the blush up toward the temple as you go. This will bring emphasis to your cheekbones, making your face appear wider while giving you a bolder, more confident look. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply blush around your brows to better define your face.",
      "content": "Apply blush around your brows to better define your face. Many people think you can only use blush on your cheeks. However, you can also apply rouge to your forehead, giving your face greater definition. For a lifted or sun-kissed look, apply blush to your temples and buff it in. To emphasize your face’s overall shape, apply a small amount of makeup next to your hairline. When applying blush to your forehead, place a small napkin over your hairline to keep it from getting dirty. This style works with any face shape and you can combine it with any previous blush application option."

      "content": "Apply setting powder if you’re wearing non-powder makeup. If you’re applying rouge on top of a type of liquid or cream makeup, such as foundation, make sure to put on a coat of translucent setting powder first. Without the setting powder, your blush will create streaks of color that you won’t be able to blend properly. [9] X Research source You do not need to apply setting powder if you used powder makeup."

      "title": "Tie your hair back.",
      "content": "Tie your hair back. When applying blush, the goal is usually to make a smooth, clean line that blends naturally into your face. Getting powder in your hair will spoil the illusion, so hold your hair back with a tie, scrunchie, or pin before applying the makeup. People often apply blush close to their ears, so make sure to hold back any wispy side-burns as well. If any blush gets in your hair, rub the area with makeup removing wipes."

      "title": "Swirl the tip of a blush brush into your makeup.",
      "content": "Swirl the tip of a blush brush into your makeup. Open up your rouge container and place the tip of a blush or stippling brush into your makeup. Using gentle motions, swirl your brush around the blush for a few seconds, giving the powder a chance to build up on each brush hair. Then, blow or tap on the brush to remove loose powder."

    {
      "title": "Smile if you’re applying blush to your cheeks.",
      "content": "Smile if you’re applying blush to your cheeks. When your face is relaxed, it can be difficult to tell where your cheekbones and the apples of your cheeks are. Smiling will bring these elements into focus, making the application process far easier. If you prefer, you can suck your cheeks in to create a fish face instead. Once you’ve gained experience, you may be able to apply your blush without smiling."

      "title": "Stipple the makeup onto your skin.",
      "content": "Stipple the makeup onto your skin. To apply the blush, tap the head of the brush onto your skin in small, dotting motions. The powder should go in the center of each area you want to apply the rouge to. This method is known as stippling and will prevent you from adding too much makeup. [10] X Research source The more makeup you use, the brighter your face will look. Excessive blush may be perfect for a high fashion aesthetic, but you should probably avoid it for day to day activities."

      "title": "Blend the blush into your skin using circular motions.",
      "content": "Blend the blush into your skin using circular motions. With the tip of your blush or stippling brush, gently sweep the powder around in small circles. This will help blend the makeup into your skin, making it look cleaner and more natural. Depending on the specific look you’re going for, you may need to pull the blush around your face while blending it. [11] X Research source Some people prefer blending the blush with long, single strokes, so experiment and find the technique that works best for you. When finished, your face should have no solid lines on it."

      "title": "Set the makeup with finishing powder.",
      "content": "Set the makeup with finishing powder. Once you’ve put on the blush, apply a thin coat of translucent finishing powder over the entire affected area. This will help set your makeup, keeping it in place throughout the day. Without this powder, there’s a good chance your makeup will run or fall off. [12] X Research source If you’re adding another form of powdered makeup, you can save your finishing powder until after you apply it. To keep your blush from caking on your face, go over it very lightly with the beauty blender or brush that you used to apply your foundation. That will help take away texture and make it look more evenly blended. [13] X Research source Devorah Kuperland. Makeup Artist. Personal interview. 7 May 2020."
