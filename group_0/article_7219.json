      "content": "Detach the thermostat wires. The dryer thermostat will have 2 wires connecting it to the heating element. Label each wire prior to removal so you will know how to reconnect them. [2] X Research source Identify the metal slip connector attached to the wires. Pull the wires by these connectors. If necessary, use needle-nose pliers."

      "title": "Measure the thermostat's ohms.",
      "content": "Measure the thermostat's ohms. Ohms are used to indicate electrical flow. [3] X Research source Use a multimeter to test the thermostat's resistance by setting it to the RX 1 setting. Place each of the meter's probes onto the wire terminals. You should receive a reading of 0. Resistance that is low, or near 0, means that the electrical flow is good. If the meter does not indicate 0, but reads infinity, your thermostat should be replaced."
