      "title": "Examine the group dynamics closely.",
      "content": "Examine the group dynamics closely. Does this new person try to get between you and your friend, or do they naturally fall together? Does anyone make an effort to include you in the discussion? Perhaps your friend is just making new friends, and nobody intends for you to feel left out. Maybe the new person is interested in befriending your friend, but doesn't click as well with you. Or you and your friend are drifting apart."

      "title": "Evaluate your relationship with your friend.",
      "content": "Evaluate your relationship with your friend. Have you ever teased your friend to the point of hurting their feelings, pushed them around, or argued with them a lot? Or do the two of you seem to not have much in common anymore? It may be that the new person isn't the cause of the problem, but that there is an issue between the two of you. If you're growing apart, it might be time to let the friendship fade."

      "title": "Start with the best possible assumption.",
      "content": "Start with the best possible assumption. It's possible that nobody is meaning to make you feel left out or forgotten. This may be happening without your friend, or your friend's friend, realizing that you feel hurt."

      "title": "Try asking a trusted adult for advice.",
      "content": "Try asking a trusted adult for advice. Choose someone who listens well, and often has good perspective. Try asking a parent, good friend, relative, school counselor, clergy member, or other trusted mentor. Explain what's going on, and ask for advice. Ask if you can get their advice on a problem. [1] X Research source If they're busy at the moment, you might need to try later. It's okay to ask multiple adults for advice. You can think carefully about it and see what feels best."

      "title": "Take your friend aside and explain that you're feeling a little left out.",
      "content": "Take your friend aside and explain that you're feeling a little left out. Be honest and considerate. It might be that your friend didn't realize this, and will then fix the problem by including you more. Or, if something is upsetting them and causing them to get distant, they might tell you about it. Here are some good examples: \"Kaja, I need to talk with you. Lately, when we're hanging out with Melanie, I feel a little left out. I'm glad that you're making new friends, but I'd like it if we could hang out a bit more together.\" \"I felt sad about not being able to go to your party. I really value our friendship, and I worry that we're growing apart.\""

      "title": "Consider telling the other person that you feel left out.",
      "content": "Consider telling the other person that you feel left out. The other person may not realize that you feel like a third wheel. Try non-aggressively expressing your feelings, using \"I\" statements . If the other person means well, they're likely to care about your feelings, and want to help fix the situation. \"Sometimes, when you and Emily talk a lot about Star Trek, I feel a little left out, because I don't watch the show. I'm glad that the two of you have stuff you enjoy together. But I feel lonely. Maybe, when it's the three of us, we could focus more on things we all have in common?\" \"Sometimes when the three of us hang out, it ends with you and Joaquin talking a lot about cute girls while I just kind of sit there awkwardly. It makes me feel sad sometimes. I don't know what to do about that.\""

      "title": "Remain polite towards the other person if possible.",
      "content": "Remain polite towards the other person if possible. Most people do not intend to \"steal\" friends; they just naturally click better with one person than the other. Assume that they mean well, unless they have proven otherwise. Even if they have been rude or mean to you, stay civil. Ignore their behavior, or set a firm boundary (like \"I need you to stop calling me names\"). Ask an adult for help if they are routinely mistreating you."

      "content": "Schedule one-on-one time with your friend. This way, you will maintain a strong relationship. If your friend wants to invite someone else, say \"I'd rather it just be the two of us this time,\" and be willing to sometimes do group hangouts and sometimes do one-on-one hangouts. Plan outings together: to the beach, around town, to an amusement park, et cetera. This will give you and your friend bonding time. Do arts and crafts. Try painting, making friendship bracelets, drawing pictures of your favorite characters, et cetera. Get your friend's phone number (if you haven't already)."

      "content": "Consider inviting the new person to join you sometimes. Despite the rocky start, you could become a great trio! Try planning some events that involve only you and your friend, and inviting the new person along to some other events. It's okay if you don't want to befriend the new person. However, don't actively avoid them or try to separate them from your friendâ€”this is hurtful, and could lead to bullying."

      "title": "Don't start friend group drama.",
      "content": "Don't start friend group drama. Don't involve mutual friends in this problem or try to get people taking sides. This means you shouldn't vent about your friendship problem to mutual friends. That can worsen friendship fractures. It's okay to need advice and support for this problem. Just get it from people outside the group instead of people inside it. If a mutual friend insists on knowing what's wrong, try to say something neutral that doesn't blame any party. Instead of \"Ryan is stealing Lamar away from me,\" try \"I'm worried that Lamar and I might be drifting apart and I don't want us to. But that's not your problem to solve and I'm trying to work it out with him.\""

Here are some ways to tell if you're being excluded on purpose: When you enter the room, people walk away from you People say upsetting things about you behind your back You're being threatened People make jokes that hurt your feelings, even if you say that it's upsetting you People don't listen when you ask them to knock it off The idea of talking to a certain person gives you a stomachache"

Sometimes, upsetting social situations happen without one person necessarily doing anything \"bad\" or \"wrong.\" If nobody is intentionally treating you badly, then do your best to keep a forgiving attitude. Good people can make mistakes, and upset other people without realizing or meaning it."

      "content": "Let out your feelings. Bottling up your feelings isn't healthy, and it can poison your relationships. Instead, find ways to express yourself and deal with your feelings. It's okay to have emotions about what's going on. Write in a journal. Talk to a good listener. Express yourself through art. Listen to sad songs and look out the window. Cry."

If the dynamic is causing you stress, so much that it's hurting your mental health or daily life (like sleep or school performance), then it may be time to take some space. Take a temporary or permanent break if the situation is causing too much stress. If people ask, you can say \"I need some time to myself right now\" or \"I need some space.\" Use this time to talk to loved ones, take care of yourself, and do things that help you feel better."
