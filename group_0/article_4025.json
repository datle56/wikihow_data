      "content": "Check for physical damage. Some laptops have a case that you can remove so you can fix and clean the insides. If this applies to you, open your laptop by unscrewing the edges, and look for damaged wires or loose connections inside your laptop. Take note of the outside appearance as well: look for dents or bowing that indicate damage. For example, if you dropped your laptop, you may have bent the casing enough that it puts pressure on the backlighting of your screen, which causes black spots, lines, and shadows. You might be able to fix it yourself if you're confident, but if the components are too badly damaged, you'll need to buy a new laptop. Some laptops have faulty LCD panels, so replacing them with the same make and model could result in the same dark spots, lines, and shadows appearing on the screen."
