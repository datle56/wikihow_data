      "content": "Turn off and unplug your washing machine. Before locating and removing your filter, it is important to disable your machine. Start by turning all of the buttons to a neutral position or hit the “Off” button, if your machine has one. Then, turn off the power from the wall socket and unplug your washer. [1] X Research source Leave the plug in a safe location where it cannot get wet during the cleaning process. Put down some old towels in front of your washer to soak up any water stuck inside the filter."

      "title": "Find your washing machine filter.",
      "content": "Find your washing machine filter. For front-loading machines, the filter is usually in the bottom right corner on the outside of the washer. If you have a top-loading machine with a self-cleaning filter, look under the agitator. For older top-loading washers, check for your filter in the bottom right-hand corner of the machine. [2] X Research source The agitator is the device located directly in the center of the machine that rotates back and forth during the wash cycle. Self-cleaning filters still need to be cleaned every 3 to 4 months. If your filter is in the bottom right-hand corner of the machine, it typically has a rectangular or circular cover over it. If you are unable to locate your filter, consult your machine’s manual."

      "title": "Remove the cover of your filter.",
      "content": "Remove the cover of your filter. Simply grip the cover and pull it away from your machine to take it off. If your machine’s cover is childproofed, use a thin object, such as a screwdriver, to pry the cover off. Then, turn the cover counter-clockwise until it comes off completely. [3] X Research source For top-loading washers with the filter under the agitator : remove the agitator first. Take the cap off of the agitator and put your hand inside the shaft until you feel a wing-nut screw. Twist the screw counter-clockwise until it comes out, then lift the agitator off. With the agitator removed, lift the filter cover out of position. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Take out your filter.",
      "content": "Take out your filter. Just pull the filter out of your machine once the cover is off. If the filter gets stuck, wiggle and move it around as much as you can. This helps to loosen up any lint or detergent that might cause it to stick. [5] X Research source As you remove your filter, you’ll likely see a layer of wet lint mixed with detergent. In some washers, the draining hose is located directly in front of the filter. If the drain hose blocks the filter from coming out, remove it and then pull out the filter."

      "title": "Use a paper towel to remove any lint from the filter.",
      "content": "Use a paper towel to remove any lint from the filter. A build-up of excess detergent mixed with lint leaves behind residue on your filter. To remove it, use a clean paper towel to wipe the screen. [6] X Research source If the layer of lint is on the thicker side, use a small brush, such as an old toothbrush, to remove the debris."

      "title": "Remove the screen from the filter and soak it in hot water for 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Remove the screen from the filter and soak it in hot water for 10 minutes. If your lint screen is removable, take it off and place it in a bowl of hot tap water. Soaking it removes any lingering lint, fabric softener, or detergent that can’t be cleaned with a paper towel. If you cannot remove the screen from the filter, hold the filter under hot running water until all of the residue is removed."

      "title": "Inspect the inside of the machine for excess lint.",
      "content": "Inspect the inside of the machine for excess lint. Before replacing the filter, check the inside of the machine for any loose lint. If there is lint in the drum of the washer, use a paper towel to remove it or scrub it with a wet sponge. [7] X Research source If your filter is in the bottom right-hand corner of the machine, inspect and remove any lint from the drainage hose. The hose is usually located in front of where you removed the filter, or directly next to it."

      "content": "Replace the filter and the outer cover. Once your filter is free from all residue, put it back in the machine. There’s no need to let it dry, as it gets wet when you use your washer. If you removed the drainage hose, put it back before securing the cover. [8] X Research source If your filter is under the agitator, set the filter back in its spot and secure the cap. Place the agitator over the filter and secure the wing-nut and the cap of the agitator."

      "content": "Run an empty washer cycle to test for leaks. Before resuming your regular washes, check that you placed the filter and cover back on correctly. To do that, simply run your washer through a small cycle. Just keep your washer empty while you run the cycle. If your washer is leaking, the filter is not on correctly. [9] X Research source If you had to remove the draining hose, check that it is properly secured, as the leak could also be coming from there."

      "content": "Clean your filter at least 4 times a year. It is recommended that you clean your filter every 3 months. The filter collects hair, coins, and tissues, so it is important to clean it regularly. If you don’t have time to do a thorough clean every 3 months, regularly check your filter for any possible build up. [10] X Research source Cleaning your filter regularly also prolongs the life of your washing machine. A dirty filter can also cause your washing machine to start smelling.

Being proactive about your washer’s problems keeps it in tip-top shape and prevents you from dealing with a washer that decides to stop working mid-cycle.

      "content": "Wipe the door seal out after every use. Even if you clean your filter regularly, anything stuck in the door seal can get trapped in your filter. This residue might clog your filter, depending on how long it’s been since you cleaned the seal. This often makes the filter harder to clean and can reduce its life. So, to prevent clogs, use a rag to wipe the exposed area of the door seal after each wash. [13] X Research source The door seal is a rubber piece that is located right inside the washer door. It is the part that keeps water from escaping when the washer is full."
