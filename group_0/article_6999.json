      "content": "Check your iPod's battery level. For the 3rd-, 2nd-, and 1st-generation iPod shuffles, there will be an LED light on the same side of the unit as the headphone jack. The battery level depends on the color that the light displays: [1] X Research source Green - 50 percent to 100 percent charge (4th and 3rd generations); 31 percent to 100 percent charge (2nd generation); \"high\" charge (1st generation). Orange - 25 percent to 49 percent charge (4th and 3rd generations); 10 percent to 30 percent charge (2nd generation); \"low\" charge (1st generation). Red - Less than 25 percent charge (4th and 3rd generations); less than 10 percent charge (2nd generation); \"very low\" charge (1st generation).

      "content": "Attach the charger cable to a power source. Connect the electrical plug end of the cable to a power outlet. This will leave the charger end of the cable, which resembles a headphone jack, available for use. Alternatively, you can separate the cable from the electrical plug by tugging on the rectangular connector at the base of the cable. You can then plug this into a USB port, which you can find on most computers. If you choose to use a USB port instead of an electrical outlet, you'll need to use a USB 3 port. These ports have symbols resembling upside-down tridents next to them."

An hour's charge will get your iPod shuffle to a usable state. You don't need to turn off your iPod in order to charge it."
