According to Facebook's algorithms, if you pose a question that asks if anyone has any idea for good services or products in a specific location , the question will be marked as a recommendation. For example, “Where can I get a good burger in New York?” is a good example of a post asking for a recommendation in a specific area. [2] X Research source Make your request specific if you want specific results. Include the type of service you’re looking for in your request. For example, if you’re looking for a mechanic, you may want to specify the type of work you need done, such as an oil change or bodywork. It might be a good idea to include your budget as well, especially when dealing with restaurant recommendations. This will ensure the recommendations are appropriate for your needs. Here’s an example of a well-worded request: “Hi guys! Does anyone know of a good place for sushi in downtown Seattle? Looking for no more than $50 for two people! Thanks!”"
