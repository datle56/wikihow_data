      "content": "Get confident . Confidence is an attractive trait, but cockiness really isn’t. People who are confident know their talents, but also recognize that there is room to improve, while those who are cocky believe they are the best. One of the best ways to show your confidence is to be the leader and help others if they're having a hard time. Allow girls to see you in the role of leader or expert. Saying “I know I’m going to ace this test. I’m smarter than the teacher!” is an example of cockiness. Instead, confidently say “I’m prepared for this test so I think I’ll do well.”"

Explain how interesting and well thought-out the fantasy kingdom is, and tell them how important the books have been to you while growing up. Don’t allow yourself to be manipulated. If a person only talks to you when they want or need something, chances are you will do just fine without them in your life."
