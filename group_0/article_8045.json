Do not enter a house or other building affected by fire until you have received word from a professional that it is safe to do so. How soon after a fire you are allowed back in the building will depend on the severity of the fire and the measures employed to put the fire out. Assess the damage to your belongings once you are back inside. Decide what you want to try to clean, and what you need to discard."

      "content": "Allow fresh air to circulate. As soon as possible, open windows in each room for increased ventilation and bring in a small fan to increase the amount of air flow into the room. This will help clear the building of any residual smoke, minimize the smoke odor, and provide fresh and soot-free air for you to breathe. Run a dehumidifier with the windows closed if you live in a climate with warm, humid weather and have associated water damage along with smoke damage. In this situation, multiple powerful fans will be key. Change your furnace filter daily if your heat is running. Do this until it the filter shows no soot."

However, if water hoses were used to put out the fire, it may be best to hire professionals to do fire/water damage combination cleanup. Contact your insurance company for approved restoration contractors that you can contact. Visit the Better Business Bureau website or Angie’s list to find trustworthy contractors. If you attempt to dry out your house yourself, beware of any mold or mildew underneath beneath carpets and floors. Remove all carpets from the home. The presence of mold can be a serious health risk and can damage your floors beyond repair. If possible, invest in some large swamp fans to help dry and air out your home."

      "content": "Get rid of loose soot on the surface of the walls. The first step to cleaning smoke damage is to remove any loose soot clinging to the walls. This can be done with a vacuum cleaner or with a dry chemical sponge. Fix the plain attachment onto the vacuum cleaner hose, and hold the nozzle slightly above the surface of the wall. Move it back and forth until all loose soot is removed. You may also want to try using the brush attachment to brush off any additional soot. Anything that is not sucked into your vacuum cleaner should fall on to your drop cloth. Try a dry chemical sponge as an alternative to vacuuming. [1] X Research source This chemical sponge is highly recommended because it is impregnated with a chemical that removes soot and smoke from your wall. [2] X Research source Using a dry sponge, wipe the soot stain on the wall repeatedly. When the sponge becomes saturated with soot, wash it out in a sink and allow to air dry. If there is severe soot damage on walls or ceilings, they may need to be replaced."

      "content": "Remove soot with Trisodium Phosphate (TSP) solution. A popular cleaner for smoke-damaged walls is Trisodium Phosphate (TSP). While this is a more powerful cleaning solution, it still requires a great deal of time and effort to clean the damage to your walls and/or ceiling. Put on a pair of heavy duty gloves to protect your hands and forearms and a pair of goggles to protect your eyes. Wear old clothes that you don’t mind having ruined. Fill a standard bucket with 1 gallon warm water and add 1 tablespoon of TSP. Wet a sponge with the TSP solution and wipe your wall or ceiling vigorously with the sponge. Work one section at a time. Rinse the section you have just cleaned with a rag dipped in clean water. Continue until the entire wall and/or ceiling has been cleaned. Repeat the wash/rinse step several times depending on the severity of the soot buildup. Be cautious not to oversaturate your walls with water or let the water seep between your walls and baseboards. If the smoke damage is still visible after this cleaning process, you will likely need to prime your walls and/or ceiling and repaint. However, it is important to make sure they are as clean as possible before you do so. Beware that TSP is a harsh cleaner and can have irritating effects to skin and eyes. Be careful not to allow it to touch your skin, and if it does, wash it off immediately and be on the lookout for severe irritation."

[3] X Research source Several common household items, or those found easily in grocery stores, can be used to remove the stubborn smoke odor from the walls of your home, even if they don’t appear smoky or dirty at first. Place a plastic sheet around the base of the walls to avoid water seeping in between the walls and baseboards. Fill a bucket with warm water and add a few tablespoons of detergent, just enough so you create a few bubbles. [4] X Research source . Wipe down walls with soapy water using a soft cloth or sponge. Use white vinegar as an alternative. Try wiping down washable walls with white vinegar (this can also be used on furniture and floors). Vinegar, while strong smelling itself, can be used as a powerful odor-neutralizer. Spray walls and surrounding area with Febreeze . Febreeze, sold in many stores, uses cyclodextrin to absorb odor. Try spraying the walls and affected area down with Febreeze to reduce smoke odor. The smell of Febreeze will be a welcome change from the odor of smoke!"

      "content": "Remove soot from textiles with a vacuum cleaner. Hold the vacuum cleaner nozzle slightly above the surface of the upholstery, drapes, or carpet and move it back and forth across the item. Soot is oily and stains very easily so it will need to be removed as soon as possible, before any further cleaning or deodorizing occurs. Do not use vacuum attachments or an upright vacuum. The brushes tend to force soot further into fabrics and will make them much more difficult to clean. An upright vacuum will ground the soot into the fabric or carpet."

While professional assistance is recommended to make sure that the smoke odor is completely removed from these items, it is possible to attempt to deodorize them yourself using at-home methods. Dissolve 1 cup of dishwashing detergent in 1 gallon of warm water. Completely submerge all items (including furniture covers, curtains, etc.) and let them soak overnight in a washing machine or bathtub. Drain them and launder as usual the next day. For items that can be bleached, mix 4-6 tablespoons TSP with 1 cup Lysol or household bleach and 1 gallon of water. Add textile items, rinse with clear water, and dry. For especially stubborn odors, call a professional who will do an ozone treatment. This deodorizing treatment actually breaks up the smoke molecules to eliminate the order. This can be done by a professional fire restorer with an ozone generator. Talk to a local dry cleaner about using counteractants. Tell them that there has been smoke damage, and they can use these chemicals to remove odors from your textiles and clothing."

Wipe off this mixture, and then wipe furniture with a clean damp rag. Do not saturate the leather. Steam cleaning can also be effective for leather furniture. You can buy a steam cleaner for your home or hire professionals to do it for you. Sprinkle baking soda liberally over the leather and allow it to sit overnight. Vacuum it up in the morning, and repeat if needed. Remember to clean each cushion and pillow separately if your furniture has removable pieces."
