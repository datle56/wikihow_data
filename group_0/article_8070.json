      "content": "Remove loose debris with a dry suede brush. Before you start cleaning, gently buff the surface of your suede item to remove loose dirt and debris. Use a suede brush and drag it back and forth with light pressure so you don't damage the nap of the suede. Focus on the stained area, but brush the rest of the surface to even out the texture of the suede. [1] X Research source Alternatively, you can use an old, clean terrycloth or soft-bristle toothbrush instead of a suede brush. Suede brushes also help restore the texture of the suede, which can start to look messy or flat when it gets dirty, greasy, or wet. Just brushing the suede may be enough to remove most minor stains."

      "content": "Rub a suede eraser to remove dry stains and scuff marks. Suede erasers are similar to high-quality pencil erasers (which can be used in addition to suede erasers). Gently rub the stain with the eraser to remove stubborn dirt and discoloration. Use the suede brush to clear away the eraser fibers as you go. Continue until the stain disappears. [2] X Research source Use a colorless white or brown gum eraser (which are often used for pencils and art) instead of a pink eraser, as it can transfer pink dye onto your suede items. If the pencil eraser doesn't work, gently rub a nail file over the dry stain. You can also rub the dirt out of suede with a slice of stale bread! Ensure the bread is stale enough to be hardened and rough so it can effectively buff out the stain. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Blot away minor surface stains with a damp microfiber cloth. Some stains, such as mud, scuff marks, or water stains, may easily come out with a gentle spot cleaning. Spray a clean, white cloth with enough water that it's damp but not soaking wet. Pat the stained area gently to lift out the dirt, but try not to rub any water deep into the fibers of the suede. [4] X Research source Home Cleaning Specialist Daniel Olin advises against using cleaning products made with bleach as this can stain the suede and completely change its color.

      "content": "Soak up excess water with a towel and let air dry overnight. Lay a towel on the item to soak up any excess water. Place something heavy on top, like a large book, to create better contact with the suede and soak up the moisture more effectively. Leave it to air dry for a few hours or overnight. Afterward, re-fluff the suede using a toothbrush or suede brush."

      "content": "Treat blood stains with a cloth dipped in hydrogen peroxide. If possible, start cleaning the stain while the blood is still fresh. Dab the area with a cloth dampened with cold water, then blot the stain with a clean, dry cloth. Keep doing that until you've soaked up as much blood as possible. Moisten another clean cloth with hydrogen peroxide, then dab the stain. Gently rinse the area with a cloth or sponge moistened with clean, cool water. [9] X Research source Be careful using hydrogen peroxide on colored suede, which may cause bleaching or discoloration. Test the hydrogen peroxide in an inconspicuous spot first. Unfortunately, it can be tough to get blood stains out of suede and other forms of leather. If all else fails, you may be able to cover up the stain by dying the suede . [10] X Research source Hydrogen peroxide may also help treat a variety of other stains, such as urine, mildew, wine, or juice."

      "content": "Rub ink stains out with sandpaper. Choose a fine-grit sandpaper and test it in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn't damage the suede. Buff the stain very gently until most of the ink appears to be gone, then rub it with a soft-bristle toothbrush or suede brush dipped in white vinegar to take out whatever is left. Finally, brush the area with a dry toothbrush or suede brush to restore the texture of the suede. [11] X Research source You can also use an emery board to remove ink stains."

      "title": "Mix 1 part suede shampoo in 2 parts of water for large stains.",
      "content": "Mix 1 part suede shampoo in 2 parts of water for large stains. If nothing else works, try a suede shampoo or leather cleaner designed for suede. Follow the instructions on the bottle to ensure you're using the product correctly. [12] X Research source Typically, you'll need to dilute 1 part shampoo in 2 parts water, then work the mixture into the suede with a brush to create a nice lather. Focus on the stained area, but go over the rest of the surface of the suede item. This will prevent the suede from developing an uneven appearance when it dries. [13] X Research source If you're cleaning shoes, stuff them with paper towels before drying them. This will soak up excess water and help the shoes maintain their shape."

      "content": "Brush suede daily to remove scuffs and restore the nap. Suede brushes usually have a wire-bristled side for brushing off debris and a rubber-bristled side for buffing up the nap of the suede. Every day or after each wear, gently brush your suede jacket, shoes, or accessories with the soft side and then the wire-bristled side. Brush in the direction of the fabric's grain to avoid tearing or damaging it. [15] X Research source If you don't have a suede brush, use a toothbrush or white terrycloth towel. If your item is muddy, allow the mud to dry before brushing it off. Avoid brushing too hard with the wire-bristled side. Use gentle, short strokes to freshen the nap."

      "content": "Spray your suede with a protectant spray. Suede protector sprays may be purchased at leather stores, shoe stores, or other places that sell suede. They protect the suede from water, oils, and other elements that might stain or damage it. [16] X Research source Spray the protector over the item, taking care not to soak any one area. Allow it to dry according to the instructions on the package. Use the suede protector at least once a year to keep the suede in top condition. Ideally, you should apply a protective spray to your new suede item before the first time you wear or use it.

      "content": "Blot away water immediately to prevent stains. Use a clean, white cloth to blot the liquid. Don't apply too much pressure, as this will force the water deeper into the fabric. Rough the area for 1-2 minutes with a soft suede brush or toothbrush. Allow the water to dry after blotting the area. [18] X Research source If possible, go over the surface of the suede with a blow dryer while you brush it. If the dried water stain is a different color from the rest of the item, try spraying the entire surface with a light mist of water and allowing it to dry. This will help the spot blend in. If your suede shoes got soaked, stuff them with paper or a shoehorn before letting them dry to prevent the suede from getting misshapen. [19] X Research source"

However, be careful about how you dry suede. Heat-drying your item could damage and warp it. Instead, gently shape the item and allow it to air dry lying flat or on a hanger. [20] X Research source If you're drying a garment, such as a jacket, hang it on a plastic hanger. A wood or metal hanger could stain the suede as it dries. [21] X Research source"

[22] X Research source Store it in a cool, dark place, away from heat, humidity, or sunlight. Avoid storing suede with newspaper since the ink may rub off on the leather and stain it. Wrap items you don't use often in sheets or pillow covers, or store them between sheets of white paper."

Paint fabric glue on the bald spot with a paintbrush, then sprinkle the area with flocking powder in a color that matches the suede. Allow the glue to dry for 12-24 hours before wearing or using the item again. [23] X Research source You can buy flocking powder and fabric glue online or at a craft supply store."

Before you start, brush the suede clean. Remove the laces if you're working with shoes. Follow the directions on the package to apply the spray. Typically, you'll need to spray the suede all over from about 7 or 8 inches (18 or 20 cm) away so that the color appears even and consistent over the entire surface. [24] X Research source Protect your work surface by laying down newspaper or paper towels under the suede item. You can also protect any areas of the item that you don't want to dye (such as the soles of your shoes) by covering them in masking tape. [25] X Research source Alternatively, you can dye the item with a liquid suede dye . These dyes often come with a wool dauber that you can use to apply the dye. [26] X Research source You may need to remove the original dye with a leather preparer and deglazer first."
