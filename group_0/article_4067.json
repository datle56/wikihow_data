You can leave it in for up to 30 minutes if desired, but rinse it out with cold water when it reaches your desired color.

Sectioning your hair will help you make sure you treat every last lock with peroxide. If you want a very even bleach, the claw clip method is highly recommended. It takes more time, but it looks more professional and it offers more even highlights. Leave the first section of hair that you want to treat down. You'll unclip further sections as you go."

Use a cotton ball to apply peroxide to the bottom half of your hair all around your head. To avoid a blunt, horizontal line through your hair, apply the peroxide to a different spot on each strand of hair. You should still aim to apply it somewhere near the middle of the strand. You can go as far up the strands of hair as you want, but make sure to begin the application at your ends. This way the tips will be a brighter blonde and the color will fade to a darker shade as you move up towards your roots. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Repeat the process to lighten your hair further. The first time you use the peroxide treatment, your hair may get just a little lighter. If you want to lighten your hair more, then you'll have to repeat the treatment one or more times. Your hair will become much lighter if you repeat this process in smaller doses every day for a week than if you use a whole bottle of hydrogen peroxide on your hair one night. The final color also depends on what color your hair was to start out with. If your hair is very dark, your peroxide-saturated hair might seem a bit more orange at first. Keep continuing the treatment and your hair should seem blonder."

It is best to use heat if you have bleached your hair with peroxide before and have a good idea of how it will turn out. If you are not sure, then avoid using a hair dryer. Go slow instead and see how the peroxide affects your hair as it air dries. [4] X Research source"
