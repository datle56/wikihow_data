      "content": "ChatGPT has a hidden limit of about 500 words or 4,000 characters, but this depends on the request. Users have reported that asking the AI for its official word or character limit results in a reply of \"none,\" but that's not entirely correct. While there's no officially stated character or word limit, you'll need to keep your prompt underneath 500 words to ensure success. https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/easily-bypass-the-chatgpt-word-limit/#dt-heading-what-is-the-chatgpt-word-limit Additionally, if the request is too complex or if the website is at capacity , you may have trouble generating responses. In most cases, the AI's text will stop suddenly around 500 words. Subscribing to ChatGPT Plus won't increase the AI's word count; though you'll have quicker response times and priority access to new features. As long as you aren't violating the usage policies , you can continue to use ChatGPT. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Ask ChatGPT to \"Continue\". ChatGPT can stop suddenly if the request is too complex, and it can stop typing mid-sentence or thought. Similar to other AI , ChatGPT is constantly learning, which means there will be parameters that it hasn't been programmed to understand yet. [2] X Research source If ChatGPT stops suddenly, ask it to \"continue from [text that was cut]\". In most cases, ChatGPT will continue where it left off."

      "content": "Use a more specific prompt. You can ask ChatGPT to \"write 500 words\" of your prompt. Specifying an exact number of words will help the AI understand the goal and will limit itself from going over its hidden word count. Be sure to enter a word count under 500 or character count under 4,000. [3] X Research source"
