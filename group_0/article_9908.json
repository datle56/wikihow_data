      "content": "Thaw scallops for recipes that call for a sear—otherwise, frozen is fine. If you’re pan-searing, baking, or grilling scallops and want a nice caramelized, crunchy sear, thaw your scallops fully before cooking (otherwise, they may hold too much moisture and turn out tough or rubbery). [1] X Research source It’s also recommended to thaw scallops before cooking them in the microwave to avoid overcooking the outsides and ruining the texture. If you’re making a sauce, stew, soup, or braise that doesn’t require a sear, add your scallops frozen. Since they’re small, they’ll thaw quickly and cook evenly, even from frozen. For air fryers and Instant Pots or pressure cookers, add your scallops frozen. These appliances will thaw and cook the scallops evenly and quickly."

      "content": "Pry open and clean the scallops if they’re frozen in the shell. Insert a shucking knife (or any shark knife) into the hinge of the shell and twist to pop it open. Slide the knife around the inside of the shell to separate the meat, then use your fingers to remove the large piece of white meat from the other organs. Rinse the scallop under cold water to remove sand or grit before cooking. [2] X Research source If your frozen scallops aren’t in the shell, skip this step. Only use cold water to rinse off your scallops to prevent them from getting mushy."

      "content": "Put the scallops in the fridge 24 hours before you plan to use them. Place the scallop meat in a large bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Keep the bowl refrigerated for at least 1 day before you want to cook them. [3] X Research source The next day, check if the scallops still feel icy or solid. If so, leave them in the fridge for another hour before using them. Use a bowl large enough to hold the scallops and any water from melted ice. Use the scallops within 1–2 days of putting them in the fridge. The fridge is the safest thawing method since the scallops will warm up so gradually. The low temperatures mean bacteria will be unlikely to multiply."

      "content": "Or, put scallops in cold water 1 hour before cooking them in a pinch. Fill a bowl or your sink with cold water and set the package of scallops inside. Make sure the package is completely sealed so water doesn’t get inside. Let them sit for up to 1 hour so they can slowly come to temperature. [4] X Research source Check and replace the cold water after 20 or 30 minutes. When the water warms, it’s easier for bacteria to begin growing on the scallops. Only use this method if you plan to cook your scallops immediately afterward. If your scallops get waterlogged, it will affect their texture (especially if you try to sear them in a pan). If you have unpackaged scallops, put them in a resealable bag before putting them in water."

Put the scallops in a microwave-safe container and cover them with a paper towel to prevent splatters and keep them evenly heated. Use the “defrost” setting on your microwave in 30-second increments until they’re completely thawed. [5] X Research source Set your microwave to 30% power if it doesn’t have a defrost option. To avoid pre-cooking the scallops and inviting bacteria, remove them when they are still slightly icy, but the flesh has become pliable.

Ingredients: [7] X Research source 1½ pounds (0.68 kg) of thawed, dried sea scallops Salt (to taste) Black pepper (to taste) 1 tbsp (14 g) of unsalted butter or 1 tbsp (15 mL) of olive oil Chopped fresh herbs (optional, to taste) Lemon wedges (optional)"

[8] X Research source Don’t move the scallops while they’re cooking so they turn golden-brown on the bottom. The scallops should easily release from the pan when you pick them up with tongs. If not, let them cook for a few more seconds before trying again. Serve right away while the scallops are still hot with a few drops of lemon juice or some freshly chopped herbs on top (optional)."
