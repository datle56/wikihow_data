Check the temperature with a thermometer on your guinea pigs ears. Additionally, you can feel the ears with your fingers if you can pick up on changes easily. You can purchase a thermometer suitable for guinea pigs from your vet clinic or pet shop. A healthy temperature for your guinea pig should be about 99-103.1 F. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Weigh your guinea pig.",
      "content": "Weigh your guinea pig. A rapid and sudden weight loss is another a sign of pneumonia which is a common result from lack of eating. If you don't know your guinea pig's original weight you can check from the guidelines of what a healthy guinea pig should weigh. Boars should weigh around 900-1200 grams whilst females should weigh a healthy 700-900 grams. The weight guideline is different to baby or growing guinea pigs. [3] X Research source It's important to weigh your guinea pig weekly nether-the-less to spot symptoms of illness early so that you can treat them early. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "See an exotic vet swiftly. If symptoms persist, it's time for a vet check. Look for a reliable exotic vet that specialises in guinea pigs with experience.

      "content": "Avoid jumping to any vet. Some veterinarians aren't knowledgeable with guinea pigs. It may sound odd but there have been numerous reports of vets with the improper study of guinea pigs that end up giving out the wrong information. If a clinic doesn't have a vet specialised in guinea pig's then they may just turn you away. However, most small animal clinics should have employed vets available to treat guinea pigs. But not all will have a specific exotic vet . In a critical situation where there is no exotic vet available near-by, ignore this step."

      "content": "Look specifically for an exotic vet . The difference between a general veterinarian and a specialised exotic vet is huge. An exotic vet specialises in dealing with guinea pigs and studies for a completely different range of animals. Their knowledge should be greater specifically on guinea pigs, they should have more experience and of course know how to diagnose and treat a problem better that is to do with your cavy."

      "content": "Administer any medication to your guinea pig. Your vet should prescribe you with medication or antibiotics to raise your guinea pig back to health. Or you can purchase most antibiotics at your nearest vet clinic. Antibiotics should be syringe fed to guinea pigs as they may refuse to eat or drink if you apply it to their food or water. Baytril is a recommended antibiotic to use for bacterial infections. The antibiotic can be syringe fed to your guinea pig with fruit juice to coat the flavour. [5] X Research source Feed your guinea pig antibiotics three or more times a day unless said otherwise by a vet. Pain killers (or medication) should only be administered to your guinea pig under the supervision of a vet. [6] X Research source"

As much as they are said to be unnecessary, they can drastically help your guinea pig in a critical situation. As mentioned above, Baytril is a recommended antibiotic as is Bio-Lapis, Avipro Plus and Pro-C as a probiotic. Some antibiotics can be dangerous or inaccurate so get them signed off by your vet. Additionally they can clarify what antibiotics should be used and where you can buy them."

      "content": "Hand-feed your guinea pig. If no signs of eating (or drinking) persist it is important that you step in and hand-feed your guinea pig via a syringe. Guinea pigs cannot go 24 hours without digesting anything so it's critical that you act fast. You can purchase critical care from a vet clinic or pet store. Additionally you can grind pellets down with water to make a mash. You should be feeding your guinea pig 4-5 times a day or every 2-3 hours with 10ml at a time. [7] X Research source Syringe feeding can be time consuming and difficult to do when your guinea pig has laboured breathing. Ask your vet for advice and remember to apply the food slowly. Baby food can also be mixed with the critical care or pellets. Look for an all natural food that is low in sugar. Pumpkin, carrot, squash, apple and kale are all good ones to try. Oat mash will help your guinea pig gain weight and should be available at your nearest super market."

Switch these three bedding's permanently to something more suitable for your guinea pig such as fleece or hay. While your guinea pig is in their critical incubation period, keep them on old white towels to keep track of their droppings. A sick guinea pig may have trouble moving on loose bedding.

An easy home-made remedy that will eliminate urine odour is by using a vinegar-based spray made of 1 part water and 1 part white vinegar. The acid should kill off any dirt and bacteria. Make sure to thoroughly rinse the cage with clean water afterwards to eliminate the chemicals left behind. Wear disposable gloves when you clean out the cage.
