When you’re out and about, smile and make eye contact with boys to signal to them that you’re open to chat. [2] X Research source Don’t get too discouraged if boys don’t always respond positively. Boys are often taught to be “manly” at a young age, so it may take more time for a boy to warm up to you. Remember that if boys are rude to you when you are just being friendly, it says a lot more about them than it does about you. When you’re looking for guys to be friends with, look for ones who respect women. Making friends with guys who only keep you around to poke fun at you or make derogatory marks about your gender is bound to get exhausting after a while."

Boy-girl friendships are most likely to occur outside of school, so take this as an opportunity to pursue something you like and hopefully find some new friends in the process! [3] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Join a sports team or take an art class to meet boys with similar interests as you. Find an activity that you genuinely enjoy. For example, join an intramural soccer team if you like playing soccer, but don’t do it just to meet boys! Boys are everywhere and, though there is a stereotype that they're only interested in sports, they have a wide range of interests too. You could also join a movie club or volunteer at the local animal shelter. Chances are, there will be at least a couple boys there who are interested in the same thing, and you’ll be able to bond over a genuine shared interest.

See if any of your other girl friends are also interested in becoming friends with boys and invite them to do simple things, such as sitting together to eat lunch. After all, there’s no law saying that friend groups need to be divided by gender. Keeping other friends around is a great way to send the signal that you aren’t romantically interested in any of your guy friends. If your girl friends ask you why you want to be friends with boys, explain that you are looking for platonic friendships. After all, boys make up about half the human population, so you are all going to need to learn how to interact with them in a healthy and positive manner sooner or later! [4] X Research source"

This is especially true of boys, because they are taught to talk and share less about their emotions and personal lives as an expression of their masculinity. [5] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source Do fun activities together to get to know one another. Activities as simple as going to the park, watching TV, doing homework together, or hanging out with other friends are all great, low-pressure situations which will gradually develop the friendship. Or, go to the bowling alley, play golf, or ride bikes together. Female friendships tend to be built on spending quality time together and talking, while male friendships are more about doing activities together."

      "content": "Be less affectionate than usual. Girls tend to be more physically and verbally affectionate with one another, while boys tend to show they care through less obvious means, such as doing favors for each other. When you’re hanging out with a guy friend, show him how much you care through actions instead of words. If things start seeming flirty or romantic, don’t spend time alone together, and put some distance between you two. Though your instinct may be to give your boy friend a hug when you see him, a simple wave and “hi” will suffice. Show that you’re glad to have his friendship by giving small compliments or offering to help him with a class he’s struggling with. Establish boundaries and follow them so there is clarity about the type of relationship you wish to share from the beginning. For instance, you might say, “I really like hanging out with you, but just as friends.”"

Otherwise, any friendships you do make will be based on a false persona, and it won’t be a real friendship.

Whether you’re hanging out with one or multiple boys, it’s likely that the time you spend with boy friends will be very different from when you’re with your girl friends. [7] X Research source Knowing and being open to this difference will help you and your new friends enjoy your time together. Going with the flow can be as simple as letting go of expectations of what you will do with your guy friends. For example, if you’re invited over to a new boy friend’s place, don’t be surprised or annoyed if you spend the next few hours vegging out on the couch and watching sports. If your guy friends call you up out of the blue to hang out, take them up on it. Sometimes, guys get together spontaneously without much planning ahead."

If you’re already an active person, try taking up a new sport. Even just watching a sport or keeping up with a specific team will give you a lot to discuss with your new friends.

If you’re getting picked on but you know that you are actually friends with the boy, come up with some funny rebuttals . For example, if your friend makes fun of your poor performance in something, laugh along to let them know you aren’t too sensitive. Poke at one of their weaknesses in a funny way. Just be sure to keep it lighthearted! For instance, you might say, “Oh yeah? Well at least I can hit a ball! I don’t strike out every time like you, Connor.”"

While it’s always going to be clear that you are different from boys, you can make this difference less noticeable by noticing how guys treat each other and imitating them. For instance, guys might call each other “bro” or “dude.” Guys might also tease each other about girls. With this step, just make sure you are not going overboard. Display your natural personality but pick up little gestures, like fist bumps as greetings and common topics that boys discuss."
