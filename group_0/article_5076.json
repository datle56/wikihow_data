[2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source At a minimum, women need 46 g of protein daily and men need 56 g of protein daily. This is easily met when you consume a source of protein at every meal and snack. Do not consume less than this amount. Stick to high-quality sources of protein such as lean red meat, poultry, seafood, beans, lentils, tofu, nuts or natural nut butter, eggs, and low-fat dairy. One serving of protein is about 3-4 ounces or a cut of meat that's about the size of your palm or a deck of cards."

[7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A low-carb diet focuses on limiting how many carbohydrates you eat within a day. Depending on your diet, it could range from 60–200 g of carbohydrate daily. The fewer carbs you allow in your diet, the more restrictive your food choices will be. Carbohydrates are found in many food groups including grains, fruits, starchy vegetables, dairy, and legumes. Consume just one to three servings of these daily to support weight loss. Read packages or use a food journal to find out how many carbs are in the foods you're eating. A low-carb diet with higher protein has shown the best potential for fat loss and maintaining muscle mass.

While safe for the general healthy adult, following a low-carb diet might not be appropriate for everyone."

      "content": "It's important to focus on proper nutrition right before and after a workout. This is especially true when you're dieting, working out, and aiming to maintain or build muscle mass. Prior to a workout, it's ideal to consume a lot of hydrating fluids and also a small carbohydrate-rich meal. This should be eaten at least 30 minutes prior to your workout to make sure you don't have any GI upset during your exercise program. Pre-workout snacks include a small bowl of oatmeal, a small piece of fruit, individual yogurt, or a serving of whole-wheat crackers. Immediately after a workout, it's also important to continue drinking hydrating fluids. In addition, you should consume a small meal or snack that contains protein and carbohydrates. This combination in particular helps muscles recover. Try to eat within 60 minutes of completing your workout. Post-workout snacks include hummus and whole-grain pita chips, a small apple and peanut butter, chocolate milk, trail mix with dried fruit and nuts, or a fruit smoothie with added protein powder."

      "content": "One key part of fat loss is exercise. Cardiovascular (cardio) or aerobic exercise helps your body burn calories and can support your weight loss. [9] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Maintaining the body’s lean muscle mass and burning calories can be accomplished by performing cardio exercise regularly. Aim for about 150 minutes of cardio each week. Ideally, the exercise performed should be at moderate intensity. This is any activity that raises your heart rate and breathing to a level where it's still comfortable for you to say short sentences without stopping for a breath. [10] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Different types of aerobic activity can include: walking/running, biking, using the elliptical, swimming, or dancing. Interval training is a combination of strength training and cardio in short bursts of high and moderate-intensity exercises. You can do these types of activities for shorter amounts of time. Studies show that this type of activity helps support fat loss. [11] X Research source"

Consistent weight training helps prevent muscle mass loss and can increase the amount of lean muscle mass. Strength training should be done for about 20–30 minutes per session. [12] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Try to work every major muscle group during each training. Make sure to work: core (back, abs and glutes), chest, arms, and legs. Strength training activities include weight lifting, isometric exercises, and classes like yoga or pilates. If you're just starting out with weights or strength training, start with low weights and a few repetitions. Do not start out with overly heavy weights or train for long periods of time - this could cause injury. Limit your training frequency for each muscle group to every other day at a maximum. Each specific muscle group should only be directly stimulated 1-2 times per week in order to allow for full recovery time.

      "content": "Protein supplement drinks are moderately low in calories and high in protein. Getting another 15–30 g of protein daily from these drinks may help you meet your minimum protein intake, increase weight loss and prevent loss of muscle mass. [15] X Research source Whey protein is a high-quality protein for your body. It has all the essential amino acids your body needs and cannot make itself. If purchasing a protein supplement, try to purchase whey protein if possible. If you have a whey allergy, or do not want to use whey, consider using another source of protein. Egg and soy protein are appropriate alternatives. Protein supplements have been shown to be especially effective at maintaining and even building lean muscle mass when they are consumed after a workout. [16] X Research source If choosing to use a protein supplement to help increase weight loss, make sure to pick a supplement that's not overly high in calories. Also don't mix a lot of ingredients or high-calorie ingredients that increase your supplement's total calorie level. This may cause weight gain if it adds too many calories to your diet. You can purchase protein supplements at a variety of stores. Look for them at a well-stocked grocery store, some pharmacies, health food stores, sports/nutrition stores, or online."

      "content": "Safe weight loss is considered losing about 1 or 2 pounds per week. Losing weight faster increases your risk for muscle mass loss. It's generally recommended to never consume less than 1200 calories daily. Calories that are too low for your age, gender, or activity level put you at risk for muscle mass loss as you're not consuming adequate nutrients for your body to function normally. Losing 1-2 pounds per week results from cutting out about 500 calories daily. Do not cut out more than this."
