The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is reported to have commented on the importance and benefits of saying “Allahumma barik” in several hadith, such as: [9] X Research source It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: “Whoever is given food by Allah, let him say: Allahumma barik lana fihi wa arzuqna khairan minhu (O Allah, bless it for us and provide us with something better than it). And whoever is given milk to drink by Allah, let him say: Allahumma barik lana fihi wa zidna minhu (O Allah, bless it for us and give us more of it). For I do not know of any food or drink that suffices, apart from milk.” [Sunan Ibn Majah 3322] It was narrated from `Aqil bin Abu Talib: that he married a woman from Banu Jusham, and they said: “May you live in harmony and have many sons.” He said: “Do not say that, rather say what the Messenger of Allah said: 'Allahumma barik lahum wa barik `alaihim (O Allah, bless them and bestow blessings upon them).'” [Sunan Ibn Majah 1906] Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “If the one who is looking fears that he could cause harm by his evil eye to the object that he is looking at, then he may ward off its evil by saying ‘Allahumma barik ‘alayhi (O Allah, bless it for him),’ as the Prophet (PBUH) said to ‘Amir ibn Rabi‘ah, when he looked at Sahl ibn Hunayf: ‘Did you not pray for barakah for him?’ In other words, did you not say ‘Allahumma barik ‘alayhi? (O Allah, bless it for him)’” [Zad al-Ma‘ad] [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Saying “Allahumma barik” brings blessings and protection. According to hadith, Abu Dharr reported that Allah's Messenger (PBUH) said: “There is no believing servant who supplicates for his brother behind his back that the Angels do not say: The same be for you too.” [Sahih Muslim 2732a] [11] X Research source In other words, when you say “Allahumma barik” to or about someone, the angels say it back to you and you receive their blessings, too. [12] X Research source Saying this phrase also protects against the evil eye, protecting you and others from harm, and reduces jealousy. This helps you promote goodwill, kindness, humility, gratitude, and positivity. Saying “Allahumma barik” to thank or congratulate people also helps you build strong relationships and promote peace and happiness in your life and others’ lives."

      "title": "“Allahumma barik” invokes blessings while “Mashallah” acknowledges them.",
      "content": "“Allahumma barik” invokes blessings while “ Mashallah ” acknowledges them. Both “Allahumma barik” and “Mashallah” are joyful and thankful phrases that you use to express your appreciation and congratulations, or to ward off the evil eye. While they are very similar and often interchangeable, “Allahumma barik” is basically a dua, as it calls upon Allah to bless someone or something. Saying “Mashallah” is a way to express gratitude for the blessings Allah’s given you or someone else—it’s not a direct supplication. [13] X Research source “Wow, your new car looks awesome! Mashallah.” “Congrats on becoming a father! Allahumma barik.” “Mashallah” is commonly written as “Ma Sha Allah” or “Masha Allah.”"
