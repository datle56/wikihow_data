      "content": "Understand how a blocking code works. If you just need to block your caller ID for one call, you can add a prefix to the number when dialing it to temporarily block your caller ID. You'll need to enter this prefix whenever you call the number to continue blocking your caller ID. This method may not work if the person whom you're calling has an app or service that unmasks blocked caller IDs."
