      "content": "Drill 4 holes around the side of an oil drum, 7 in (18 cm) from the top. Use an electric drill and a step bit to drill four 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) holes into an unlined, unpainted, 55-gallon, metal oil drum . Evenly space the holes around the circumference of the barrel, and place them 7 in (18 cm) down from the lid. [1] X Research source We’ll screw bolts into the holes, and the bolts will act as rests for a grill grate. Optionally, drill 4 more holes about a foot beneath the original holes to accommodate an additional grill grate."

      "content": "Drill 3 more holes around the sides, 4 in (10 cm) from the bottom. Using the same bit, make 3 evenly spaced 1 in (2.5 cm) holes around the circumference of the bottom of the barrel. These will act as air intake holes to provide oxygen to the burning wood chips. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Install 3 steel pipe nipples, 2 steel pipe caps, and a ball valve. Screw 3 .75 in (1.9 cm) steel pipe nipples into the 3 exhaust holes. Then, add a matching pipe cap to 2 of the pipes. Finally, attach a .75 in (1.9 cm) ball valve to the last pipe nipple. [4] X Research source The ball valve can be opened and closed to regulate the heat inside, and the caps can be removed to quickly cool the barrel after smoking."

      "content": "Drill 8 .25 in (0.64 cm) holes in the lid of the drum, and add a handle. Evenly space the holes around the top of the lid. These will act as air output holes that allow the smoke inside the drum to escape, while regulating the temperature inside. Then, drill 2 additional holes and fit a metal door handle to the center of the lid, for easy access. [5] X Research source While you’re here, sink a grill thermometer through one of those holes, for easy temperature monitoring."

Monitor the temperature and make sure it stays around 225–240 °F (107–116 °C), opening and closing the ball valve at the bottom of the drum to heat and cool it, respectively. Let your meat smoke for 6-8 hours, or according to your recipe. [8] X Research source Afterward, let your smoker close the valves of the smoker and place aluminum foil in the holes of the lid, to extinguish the coals."

To make the whole thing more stable (and ensure you don’t have a wobbly smoker), place the pot on top of 2 or 3 bricks, to create a raised platform to accommodate the burner cord. [9] X Research source Set the hot plate to high now, while you still have easy access to it. Plug it in later when you’re ready to cook to get the heat going."

Choose a pie pan small enough to sit atop the burner, but large enough to just about meet the sides of the flower pot, for maximum heat and smoke. That’s where the damp wood chips come in. Fill the pie plate full of ‘em, so that the chips sit level with the lips of the plate. [10] X Research source We recommend using hickory, mesquite, or oak chips for general-purpose smoking. Soak them in water overnight to get them good and damp before cooking, to make for plenty of smoke. [11] X Research source"

Smoke smaller cuts of meat, like small chickens, bacon, or cuts of pork, for a couple hours, or until they hit 170 °F (77 °C). Use a meat thermometer every half hour or so to monitor the temp. [14] X Research source Always use heat-proof gloves to handle any part of the DIY smoker. Also monitor your wood chips, adding more as they burn down. Use a grill hook to lift the grill plate from the pot when you need to access them. Keep small children and animals away from the smoker any time it’s in use."

[17] X Research source The grill plate from a standard charcoal grill will work great. Soak your wood chips in water overnight to saturate them, which makes for more intense smoke. Go for apple or cherry wood chips for some heavy-hitting Texas flavor, or allspice wood to add a Jamaican tang to your dish. [18] X Research source"

The metal of the trash can may heat up quite a bit, but the large space inside will take some time to get up to temperature. [19] X Research source Use oven mitts to handle any component of the smoker while it heats. Don’t worry about temperature here, since this is a cold smoker; we’re just giving the wood chips some time to burn and get going."

[20] X Research source Then, remove the meat from the smoker and cook it according to your taste. Remember, this is a cold smoker, and won’t actually cook your meat so only use it to smoke preserved cuts like salted, cured, or fermented meats."

      "content": "Drill 1.5 in (3.8 cm) holes in the drawers of a filing cabinet. It’s crucial that the filing cabinet be unpainted, as painted filing cabinets may contain harmful chemicals. With an electric drill and a circular drill bit , bore 2 rows of holes (about 7 holes each) in the metal bottom of each upper drawer. [21] X Research source Space the holes about 3 in (7.6 cm) apart. These will allow smoke to filter through all levels of the cabinet. Also bore a hole on the bottom right corner of the front of the bottom drawer, to snake a hot plate cord through. Optionally, bore additional, smaller holes in the side of the filing cabinet for thermometers, boring 1 hole on the level of each drawer. Thermometers will provide increased smoking accuracy when smoking according to a recipe."

Then, place soaked wood chips in a metal container like a tea kettle or pie plate, and set them on the hot plate. Make sure that the wood chip container can fit when you close the drawer. [23] X Research source Soaked wood chips give off more smoke. Use a variety like oak or cedar for a strong flavor."

      "content": "Set the hot plate to high and smoke your meat for 4-6 hours. Place your meat on the wire racks—meat in the lower drawers will get smokier, faster—and let the wood chips do their thing. Remember, this is a cold smoker, so anything you smoke will have to be cooked properly later! [24] X Research source Only cold smoke preserved meats, like fermented, cured, or salted cuts, since cold smokers require the meat to be held at unstable temperatures for extended periods. Alternatively, swap the hot plate and wood chips for a pellet tube smoker . Place a few bricks on the floor of the bottom drawer, pour wood pellets into the tube and light it to get smoking.
