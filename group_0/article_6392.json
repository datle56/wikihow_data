      "content": "Collect and stack the wood. Make your bonfire in an open space away from trees, and have an adult light it. The day the holika is burnt is called \"Choti Holi\", literally meaning, \"Small Holi\". The next day is called \"Rangwali Holi\", meaning the \"Holi of colors.\" Traditionally, 40 days before the Holi celebration, there would be a log placed in the center of the town to signify it was time to collect wood for the Holika bonfire. Gather enough wood and combustible material to create a medium-to-large sized pile for your Holika bonfire. Place any wood or flammable scrap materials on top of the log, so you have a large pile of wood ready to burn. Clean your home before the festivities."

Burning Holika in the bonfire symbolizes the triumph of good over evil. She is said to have tried to kill Prahlad, the son of Hiranyakashipu (her brother). Prahlad was a devoted follower of Lord Narayana which infuriated his father who craved all the praise for himself. He plans to kill his son but he escapes because of his faith while holika gets consumed in the fire for her wickedness, despite her gift of escaping fire. [1] X Research source You can tie the logs together so they stay in place vertically."

You can also buy abeer, which is small crystal chips of mica that create a sparkly silver color. People frequently combine the two to create a fun red-orange sparkly colored powder. [3] X Research source Red, pink, yellow, green and violet are the most used colors. Try a test patch on your wrist to check you aren’t allergic to the chemicals in the colored powder, especially if you are celebrating it for the first time.
