      "content": "Be social and join in on the fun. Libra is definitely an extrovert who loves to socialize and be around other people. [1] X Research source You'll often find him in groups, standing out as the life of the party. To attract him, your best bet is to cross paths with him as often as possible in his natural setting: a crowd. Libras tend to be compatible with other air signs (Gemini and Aquarius) because it’s the most social element. Air signs are known for being intelligent and talkative. They usually adore being the center of attention and can get along with anyone. But when an air sign meets another air sign, they tend to just get each other."

      "content": "Make an effort to stand out from his crowd of admirers. Libra males have a tendency to be friendly. Get his attention by doing more than just hanging around and hoping he notices you. Make a witty joke. Show off your secret talent. Above all, flirt outrageously…Libras can’t get enough of it. [2] X Research source Instead of lingering in the back of the room where no one can see you, make yourself the center of attention , even if only for a few moments."

      "content": "Be easy-going about his habit of flirting with other women. Libra is friendly—sometimes, a little too friendly. Your Libra man probably flirts with a lot of other women without meaning anything by it. For some women, this is a big turn-off. If you have any hope of winning your Libra man's affection, accept that his flirting is no big deal. He hates conflicts, so making a big fuss sends him running in the other direction. [3] X Research source Be the one still there when the rest of his admirers lose patience with his overly flirtatious ways. Keep in mind that Libras rarely have favorites. Even if you attract him quickly, he might also be attracted to several other women in his social circles. Yes, “circles.” He is a social butterfly, after all. However, he’s not disloyal or untrustworthy once he decides you’re the one."

      "content": "Be feminine and elegant, not frilly or flashy. Aesthetics is important for a Libra man, says Eyedealism. [4] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 December 2021. Visually speaking, women with a notably feminine appearance are the most likely to catch the Libra man's eye and attract him on a purely physical level. Develop a classic, elegant , and refined style. Avoid fashion choices that are excessively bold or those that are too cutesy. Avoid jarring color choices, bold patterns, or temporary trends that are here today and gone tomorrow. Excessively girly fashions, like lace and bows, can also be a turn-off. Opt for classic, clean-cut styles in a traditional color palette. Choose elegance rather than trendiness. Choose refined make-up and accessories, too. Use your make-up to enhance your natural beauty . Avoid caking it on or trying out dramatic looks. Wear jewelry that accents your look without competing for attention. Don’t worry if you don’t think of your style as “elegant” or “refined.” Just keep things simple, neat, and tidy, and you’re already halfway there."

[5] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 December 2021. When you start talking to him, be calm and pleasant. A mild-mannered attitude and peaceful, balanced vibe will make him feel right at home. Libra men appreciate social grace in a partner…and everyone else. Be polite, calm, and well-spoken to impress him. Similarly, when you invite a Libra into your own personal space—your office, your car, your apartment—make sure you keep your space chic, comfortable, and uncluttered to appeal to your Libra guy."

      "content": "Let him talk about himself. Everyone likes to talk about themselves, and your Libra guy is no different. [6] X Research source It's not that Libra is narcissistic. It’s just that someone with such an outgoing personality naturally likes to ramble on about himself and the things that interest him. To really impress him, let him talk to his heart's content and follow along with the conversation sincerely. Asking open-ended questions is a great way to get your Libra guy talking. For example, “What’s your favorite memory from childhood?” or “What was the highlight of your day today?” Use questions like, “And then what happened?” or “What did you do then?” to keep him talking. Libra is a chatty social butterfly, so they’re perfectly willing to talk about something else, too. Share some juicy gossip or a silly joke, and he won’t mind if you change the subject.

      "content": "Engage in light intellectual debate. Most Libra men run from direct conflict or confrontation, but they’re also an air sign. And if there’s one thing an air person loves, it’s intelligent conversation. Your Libra man is no different. Plus, he can’t help being fascinated by another person’s perspective. [8] X Research source Bring up a topic that’s open for debate and discuss both sides with him. Just remember to keep the conversation intellectual rather than emotional."

      "content": "Pay him a sincere compliment. Libra men are usually rather confident and have positive opinions about themselves, but they love to get compliments as much as anyone. A genuine, well-timed compliment or word of praise can go a long way toward capturing his attention. [9] X Research source When choosing something to compliment, focus on a typical Libra area of interest, like his taste in art, sense of style, or interest in creating a just society. No one trusts an obvious flatterer, not even a Libra man. While he might pardon a blatant appeal to his vanity more than some of the other zodiac signs, a compliment that’s clearly untrue or forced is a turn-off. Stick to compliments that are as meaningful and truthful as possible."

If you can keep him intellectually stimulated, he’ll find your personality more attractive and enjoyable. Eyedealism says, the Libra man is an intellectual, so he wants a woman who is refined and intellectual. [11] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 December 2021. Libras naturally have somewhat of an airy personality, so they feel most inspired by moving about from subject to subject. Fixating on any one topic for too long quickly bores a Libra man. They may get distracted if you only have one hobby or interest you always talk about. Let him see all of the things that interest you so he thinks of you as a balanced, well-rounded person."

When he starts getting to know you, stay cool and calm. Avoid showing too much emotion, either positive or negative. When Libra falls in love, things get emotional very quickly. This makes him a little hesitant to make a bad decision when feelings are involved. [13] X Research source Try to understand why he feels uncomfortable with emotion. Feelings are messy, especially once those feelings get deep and complicated. The Libra avoids emotions mostly to maintain the sense of harmony and balance he loves so much. Of course, if you want to be with your Libra man for the long haul, you’ll eventually face your emotions together. When the time comes, stay calm and rational.

Libras are naturally curious about everything. [15] X Research source Be a little mysterious to really piques this inquisitive sign's curiosity. And keep him interested. Make him think of you as a “mysterious beauty.” Of course, the longer you're with your Libra, the more that mystery will fade.

If you already volunteer your time, consider asking your Libra crush along, especially if you are supporting a cause he also happens to believe in. In doing so, you'll become someone who helps him satisfy his own desires to do good deeds."

Make his heart skip a beat by inviting him to an art museum or giving him a book with photographs of beautiful scenery. Showing him that you understand what he loves can be a huge plus in your favor. When you extend an invitation, pick a place that your Libra man will probably enjoy, like an art gallery, arts and crafts fair, or museum. [17] X Research source Appeal to him even more by inviting him out during an active time. For instance, ask him to a special one-day-only exhibit instead of inviting him to the museum during a quiet \"off\" time."

Dote on him as much as you want when the two of you are together, but avoid smothering him or forcing your way into other areas of his life without an invitation. [19] X Research source Keep in mind that Libra is a pretty single-minded guy when he falls for someone. Once he takes a liking to you, you'll know it.

Try giving him a small gift or note for no reason, or offer a massage at the end of a long day or week. [20] X Research source Refined, tasteful gifts tend to work better than gifts packed with too much sentimentality. You don’t have to give him a designer watch or pricey cufflinks. Give him a gourmet treat or any beautiful item, whether it has a designer label or not. For a free alternative, write him a beautiful note. Again, heavy emotions aren’t quite Libra's cup of tea, but a letter with a few scribbled verses can make a big impact as long as those verses focus on the beauty of things rather than the intensity of your feelings."

They tend to avoid women who seem manipulative or who live for drama. When you make your move, avoid getting too serious too quickly. Keep things light, and win him over with gestures of traditional romance: candlelight dinners, moonlit walks, and so on. Once he starts to return your attraction and affection, be prepared for him to show you what he likes in the romance department. Libra is a natural-born charmer, so when he wants to charm you, he’ll use a range of romantic tactics to do so. Take note and increase his attraction to you by responding with similarly romantic gestures."

Let him work through his feelings without pushing for a commitment. Remember, Venus, the planet of love, rules Libra. Libra men want to fall in love and settle down. But they also want to make sure they do it with the right person because when they’re in a relationship, they are in it for the long haul.

If you pressure or rush them, they might decide committing to you is a bad move."

And even though he’d never admit it, he likes letting someone else make a decision once in a while. Just for the little things like dinner or an evening out, though. Libra is a cardinal sign, which means he usually likes to be in charge. [22] X Research source Try dropping by unannounced with some hot chicken noodle soup when he’s feeling under the weather. Surprise him by cooking his favorite meal, and this Libra man will be yours forever."

      "content": "Gradually be more vulnerable with him. Building trust takes time. Share more and more of your feelings with your Libra man as you spend time together. Tell him when he upsets you and explain why…but do it calmly and fairly to activate his analytical mind instead of his fear of conflict. Show him more physical affection by cuddling, holding hands, and hugging. [23] X Research source Remember to take things slow so your Libra doesn’t get overwhelmed. This can cause him to back away. By slowly and steadily getting closer, he’ll be ready to settle down before he realizes what happened."

      "content": "Libra guys are more compatible with some signs than others. Libra guys get along with everyone, but their connections with Geminis, Leos, and Sagittarians take it to the next level. On the other hand, Libra has a harder time connecting with Aries and Capricorn. They can still live happily ever after, though. They just have to work a little harder at it. [25] X Research source Gemini: As air signs, these two are super-communicators with a tendency to flirt and have deep conversations. When it comes to what they need to feel comfortable and centered, they understand each other. Plus, they’re both lighthearted romantics, making them the perfect couple. Leo: Both Leo and Libra love to be the center of attention and are absolutely head over heels for romance. However, Leo can get annoyed with Libra’s indecisiveness, and Libra hates Leo’s bossiness. Sagittarius: Libra and Sagittarius like to entertain, go on adventures, and be the center of attention. Sag can be a little aggressive for Libra’s peace-loving nature, but overall they’re a good fit. Aries: Aries and Libra are cardinal signs on opposite sides of the zodiac. This makes them feel like they’re exactly the same, but somehow, they don’t understand each other at all. In reality, they’re total opposites. For example, Aries loves a fight, while Libra hates it. Capricorn: Capricorn is another cardinal sign that doesn’t mesh well with Libra. They both have take-charge personalities. But where Libra is lighthearted about being in the lead, Capricorn likes to maintain more control. This sets them up for a clash…and you know how much Libra hates that."
