If you are connecting a wired and wireless connection, you can easily do so by connecting to your Wi-Fi network and then connecting to your computer using an Ethernet port on your computer. However, if you are connecting two wired or two wireless connections, or your computer doesn't have an Ethernet port, you will likely need to purchase a USB Ethernet adapter to connect a second Ethernet cable or a wireless USB adapter to connect to a second Wi-Fi connection. If you are using a Mac, you will need to install additional drivers to be able to use a wireless USB adapter. Make sure the adapter you purchase is compatible with MacOS. You will not be able to use a USB ethernet adapter."

If you have no Ethernet port and at least two USB-C (Thunderbolt 3) ports, you can buy two Apple USB-C Ethernet adapters to create the two Ethernet ports. If you have only one USB-C (Thunderbolt 3) port and no Ethernet port, you can't combine two Internet connections via Ethernet. Try using a load-balancing router instead. Since your Mac can only combine two connections which both use 802.3ad-compliant connections, you cannot use a USB 3.0 to Ethernet adapter."
