[1] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source It is specific to symptoms caused by allergies, and will not relieve similar symptoms with other causes. For example, it will stop a runny nose from allergies, but not from a cold. In the past, doctors prescribed it if you had constant allergy symptoms that don't respond to over the counter (OTC) medications. Recently, though, Flonase was approved for over the counter use, and may be available at your pharmacy. Intranasal steroids (INS) like Flonase act on many inflammatory substances and help block the body from producing them while antihistamines block only the histamine release."
