      "content": "Buy some standard aluminum alloy metal parts. Anodizing works particularly well with aluminum, so, if careful, you can do it at home. Use small aluminum pieces to begin with so that you can submerge it in small quantities of acid. [2] X Research source You can find small aluminum parts for this purpose relatively affordably from most home improvement stores, as well as online. During this process, the part that you are anodizing will function as your anode."

      "content": "Buy a thick plastic tub to submerge your metal. Choose a type of plastic that is extremely hard and durable. The exact size of the tub you will need depends on what you're working with, but it should be large enough to hold your metal piece and the aluminum and still have some extra room for the liquids.

This is the process Apple uses to color iPods. [4] X Research source You can also buy special dye for anodizing that may produce better results."

Most of these items can be found at your local hardware or home improvement store. These include: A degreaser product 2 lead cathodes long enough to overhang your plastic bin A roll of aluminum wire Enough distilled water to fill your plastic tub Baking soda Rubber gloves"

      "content": "Find places to purchase the hard-to-source supplies. For anodizing, you will need several gallons of sulfuric acid (battery acid), lye, and a constant power supply of at least 20 volts. The battery acid may be hard to find; however, it is usually available at auto parts stores. A large battery charger should work as a constant power supply."

      "content": "Wash your metal with soap and water. Cleaning off dirt and debris helps keep the anodizing process running smoothly, and reduces the chances of imperfections as you work. Wash the object you want to anodize using a gentle detergent and warm water. Then, dry it completely with a clean rag or paper towel. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Dilute lye in water to create a scouring solution. In a small plastic tub, mix 3 tbsp. (44 ml) of lye in 1 gallon (3.8 l) of distilled water. Wearing a pair of rubber gloves, place the object you want to anodize into the lye solution. Allow it to sit for 3 minutes, then remove it and rinse it thoroughly with warm water. [7] X Research source The lye will remove any existing anodizing on the surface of the metal. Once it is removed, water should pour off the surface easily, instead of beading. Wear rubber gloves whenever working with lye. Do not use measuring spoons or cups that are used for food products. The materials used in this process are toxic."

Set it on a piece of plywood and/or a thick drop cloth in case of spills. A garage with an open door or a shed with all doors and windows open is usually a good location. [8] X Research source For best results, do this when the indoor temperature is between 70 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 22 degrees Celsius)."

      "content": "Tie one end of the long aluminum wire to your anode. 12-gauge aluminum wire works well for this use. Wrap it or connect it to the part in an inconspicuous area. If your anodizing a key, for example, you may wrap the wire around the join between the blade and the bow. [10] X Research source The area of the part that connects to the wire will not anodize. Make sure it is very tightly wrapped for a more consistent charge."

Make sure you have extra wire extending toward your power supply after you wrap it. [11] X Research source Test the wooden handle to make sure your aluminum part will be fully submerged in the acid mix, but not touching the base of your plastic tub."

You should have enough to completely submerge your anode. Be very careful not to spill as you mix. [13] X Research source Put on a mask or respirator before you start working with acid. Turn on a fan to ventilate the area. Always pour the water in before the acid. If you spill any acid, cover it quickly with baking soda."

The anode will also start to change color, turning brown, then yellow. [16] X Research source If you don’t see bubbles forming within about 30 seconds of starting your power supply, turn your power supply off and check your connections. This is usually an indicator that your power supply wasn’t properly connected."

Different dyes will have different requirements, so prepare your dye as directed on the product packaging. [17] X Research source Heating the dye will help increase the amount of pigment your part picks up. However, the dye should not be heated to a temperature over 122 °F (50 °C).
