      "content": "Endermen won’t become hostile unless provoked. There are 2 ways to provoke an Enderman: looking directly at it (by putting the camera crosshairs at the center of your screen) or attacking it yourself with an object or your empty hand. If you’re trying to avoid an attack while playing Minecraft , it’s easy to refrain from striking an Enderman—but remember to turn away and redirect your crosshairs when you see one, too. [1] X Research source Even if you accidentally look directly at an Enderman, it won’t move until you look away. Keep making “eye” contact with your crosshairs directly on it to make the Enderman stand still. This also gives you a chance to back away! Endermen are faster than player characters in Minecraft, but you can get a head start on your getaway plan if you keep looking at them. Not sure whether you provoked an Enderman? If it’s hostile, you’ll see it start to shake, and its mouth will open. It’ll also start making a loud, angry noise that sounds like static distortion."

      "content": "Wearing a pumpkin on your head will stop them from being hostile. When you have a carved pumpkin equipped (meaning your player character is wearing the pumpkin on their head), you’ll be able to look directly at Endermen without provoking them. However, remember you’ll still provoke an Enderman if you hit it. So long as you leave them be, you can pass by Endermen safely with your pumpkin helmet! [2] X Research source To carve a pumpkin, all you’ll need is a pair of shears. Select the shears in your hotbar, then position your pointer over the pumpkin and use the shears to carve it! Carving a pumpkin will also drop pumpkin seeds—so pick those up for use later if you want them. Pumpkins generate naturally in most Overworld biomes; they’re especially common in the Windswept Hills, Windswept Gravelly Hills, and the Plains."

      "title": "If an Enderman attacks, entering the water will make it retreat.",
      "content": "If an Enderman attacks, entering the water will make it retreat. Endermen don’t like water and teleport away if they touch it—so if you find yourself under attack, run for the nearest body of water. Entering a river, lake, or other water will stop an angry Enderman from getting to you. It may even help to travel by swimming rather than passing through dry land if you know that Endermen are around. [3] X Research source You may even be able to create a potion of water breathing in order to swim underwater rather than traveling on land! It’s also a good idea to carry a bucket of water around with you in your hotbar at all times! Simply place the water at your feet and stand in the puddle if an Enderman attacks. They won’t cross into the water, enabling you to avoid the attack. If you want to kill Endermen without getting attacked, stay near the edge of the water and hit them as they get close. They still won’t be able to reach you while you’re in the water."

      "title": "Endermen can’t enter an area less than 3 blocks high.",
      "content": "Endermen can’t enter an area less than 3 blocks high. Endermen are taller than your player character in Minecraft, standing 3 blocks tall. So, if you’re in a structure (or even a cave or hastily-built shelter) with only 2 blocks of vertical space, an angry Enderman won’t be able to get you there. If you can’t find natural shelter, use your pickaxe to dig a 2-block-high shelter into a vertical surface (like a rock face or cave). [4] X Research source Alternatively, carry enough blocks around to create an impromptu shelter if needed! Simply stack 3 blocks vertically, then create a “roof” for your shelter from the tallest block. That’ll ensure only creatures less than 3 blocks high (like your character) can enter and keep Endermen out. If you build a temporary shelter, remember that Endermen can move certain blocks, including dirt, gravel, and sand. Build a shelter with a material they can’t move, like bedrock, cobblestone, ice, or obsidian."

      "title": "Endermen don’t like the sun and take damage from rain.",
      "content": "Endermen don’t like the sun and take damage from rain. While Endermen won’t burn in the sun (like zombies and skeletons do), they definitely don’t like it. So, when you’re in the Overworld during the daytime, you likely won’t see Endermen spawn. The same goes for rain; Endermen don’t like water, so if it’s raining—regardless of the time—they won’t spawn. That’s why it’s a good idea to travel during the day or while it’s raining!

      "title": "An angry Enderman can’t get to you when you’re high on a tower.",
      "content": "An angry Enderman can’t get to you when you’re high on a tower. If you need to stand your ground in an Enderman attack but want to avoid taking damage or actually getting hit by it, simply stack 3 blocks on top of each other to build a quick, improvised tower. As long as you’re standing on top of those blocks, you’re taller than the Enderman, so it can’t reach you. [6] X Research source This method also allows you to strike an Enderman when it gets close to you without getting hurt in return, making it an easy way to kill Endermen safely ."

      "content": "You won’t be attacked if Endermen can’t get into your base. Feel like building a cool house in Minecraft? Endermen can teleport inside home bases at night, especially if your home isn’t properly protected, so safeguard your home against them! [7] X Research source One of the easiest ways to do this is by making the solid ceiling of your home low (with 2 blocks of vertical space) so Endermen can’t fit inside it. Other protective measures include: Using non-solid blocks. Endermen won’t teleport onto non-solid blocks like glass, glowstone, or slabs, so using them may stop Endermen from spawning. Lighting torches. Endermen don’t like light, so a well-lit home base may deter them from entering. Installing glass windows. If you look at an Enderman through a glass window, they won’t be provoked and start attacking. Making a pool. A pool filled with water gives you a safe place to retreat if you need to defend your home . Endermen tend to teleport into houses on nights when there’s a full moon—so make sure your home base is well-protected before the night of a full moon!"

      "title": "Water or lava may stop Endermen from teleporting into your base.",
      "content": "Water or lava may stop Endermen from teleporting into your base. Surround your base with a wide moat filled with either water (which Endermen are afraid of) or lava (which damages them) to prevent them from spawning in or around the home. Since Endermen can teleport up to 32 blocks horizontally, and hitting water causes them to teleport again, try making a moat at least 65 blocks wide. [8] X Research source With a 65-block moat, even if an Enderman teleports in the direction of your home after hitting the moat, the likelihood of them getting inside is slim (since teleporting twice still only lets them travel 64 blocks horizontally)."

      "title": "The End is where Endermen spawn most frequently.",
      "content": "The End is where Endermen spawn most frequently. Therefore, it’s the most dangerous spot if you’re trying to avoid Endermen attacks. Try not to visit the End if you’re nervous about dealing with lots of Endermen and want to refrain from seeing them at all. However, the End is also a great source of Ender pearls—so you may need to go there occasionally. [9] X Research source If so, consider the following strategies to avoid Endermen: Wear a carved pumpkin on your head at all times while finding an End portal and visiting the End. So long as you don’t attack any Endermen, they should leave you be. Keep a bucket of water equipped in your hotbar. In case of emergency, pour the water onto the ground and stand in it to stop swarms of Endermen from getting close."

      "title": "Broken ender pearls may spawn endermites, which Endermen will attack.",
      "content": "Broken ender pearls may spawn endermites, which Endermen will attack. Ender pearls only have a 5% chance of spawning endermites, but when you’re in a bind and there are Endermen very close to you, it may still be worth trying. Carry several ender pearls with you (or try to find them in the area). Throw the pearls when an Enderman approaches; if an endermite spawns, the Enderman will immediately attack it instead of you. [10] X Research source To throw a pearl, all you need to do is press “use” and choose a direction; the ender pearl will be consumed, and an endermite may spawn at the landing site. This technique is also a great distraction if you need several Endermen to flock to a particular place—especially somewhere with many of them, like the End."
