      "title": "Make a cleaning solution with lukewarm water and dish soap.",
      "content": "Make a cleaning solution with lukewarm water and dish soap. To make a homemade cleaning solution, mix lukewarm water with a few squirts of mild dish soap. Then, mix the ingredients together to create a sudsy solution. How much soapy water you need will depend on whether you're cleaning a whole bag or just an isolated stain. [1] X Research source For a few small stains, use 1 cup (237 mL) of water and 1 ounce (29 mL) of dishwasher soap. You can double or triple this amount for a whole bag. Do not use hot water when mixing a homemade solution. Hot water can set any dirt or stains, making them harder to get out."

      "title": "Dip a microfiber cloth in the soapy water and wipe down the bag.",
      "content": "Dip a microfiber cloth in the soapy water and wipe down the bag. Wet a microfiber cloth with the soapy water and squeeze it out so the cloth is damp, but not soaking wet. Then, wipe down the bag using small, circular motions. This helps ensure that you clean every part of the purse. [2] X Research source Clean the inside of the bag, too. Remove the contents of your purse and wipe down the inside with the soapy water. DeCorte suggests adding a bit of baking soda to help remove any unpleasant odors. Warning : Avoid getting any leather trimming or accents wet with the soapy water. Water can potentially damage leather."

      "title": "Use a soft-bristled toothbrush to scrub any stains.",
      "content": "Use a soft-bristled toothbrush to scrub any stains. Dip a toothbrush into your cleaning solution. Then, with your hand holding the bag from the other side, scrub small areas of the bag at a time. Move the brush in a circular motion to bring up any dirt or stains. [3] X Research source You will create a bit of a lather as you do this. How long you have to scrub just depends on the size of the stain. In general, you may need to scrub for at least 1 minute."

      "title": "Wipe down the bag with a damp cloth.",
      "content": "Wipe down the bag with a damp cloth. Once you're done cleaning the bag and scrubbing any stains, wipe down the area with a cloth dipped in clear water. You may need to repeat this step more than once to get all of the soap off the nylon. [4] X Research source Wiping down your purse with water prevents any soapy residue from staining your bag."

    {
      "title": "Blot the bag and let it air dry.",
      "content": "Blot the bag and let it air dry. Nylon is pretty water-resistant, so it should be easy to blot it dry. Use a clean microfiber cloth or towel to dab the bag and remove as much excess water as possible. Then, set the bag in a well-ventilated area and let it completely air dry before you use it. [5] X Research source For instance, place the bag on a clothes drying rack or in front of a fan to speed up the drying time. It may take your bag 1 to 2 days to fully dry. If your bag has cloth straps, they might take longer to dry. Warning : Do not dry your bag with heat (i.e., using a dryer or hair dryer) or set it in direct sunlight. Heat and sunlight can damage and discolor your bag."

    {
      "title": "Use the cool or cold water setting.",
      "content": "Use the cool or cold water setting. You want to wash your bag in cool to cold water, as this prevents any stains from setting while your bag is being washed. Simply set your washing machine's water temperature to the coolest setting it has. [6] X Research source Warning : Use caution when machine washing a bag that has leather trimming or accents. While many people still clean their bags in the washing machine, like the Longchamp Le Pliage , the water can potentially damage the leather."

      "title": "Add a small amount of dye and fragrance-free detergent.",
      "content": "Add a small amount of dye and fragrance-free detergent. You can use the detergent you normally use for clothes to clean your nylon bag. This could be powdered detergent, liquid detergent, or detergent pods. Just use a very small amount—about ¾ or ½ of the normal amount of detergent you would use when washing a small load of laundry. [7] X Research source If your bag isn’t very dirty, feel free to skip the detergent. The water and agitation from the washing machine are usually enough to get your purse clean. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Wash it by itself with a gentle cycle inside a mesh laundry bag. Select your laundry machine’s gentle or delicate cycle. While nylon is pretty tough, it can still potentially get damaged by a normal cycle. [9] X Research source Then, place your bag in a mesh laundry bag to further protect it from any damage. [10] X Research source Make sure to remove any clothes or other items from the machine, as they can damage the bag as it gets washed."

    {
      "title": "Let the bag air dry.",
      "content": "Let the bag air dry. Nylon is pretty water-resistant, so the spin cycle of your washing machine should wick most of the extra moisture off. It’ll likely still be a bit damp out of the machine, so set it in a well-ventilated area to dry. If the bag has fabric—not nylon—straps, those definitely need to air dry. [11] X Research source Warning: Do not dry the bag in the dryer or use a hair dryer. Heat can damage the fabric. Keep the bag out of direct sunlight, as it can degrade and discolor the nylon. To help speed up the drying time, aim a fan at the bag. It might take 1 to 2 days for your bag to dry. Wait to use or store it until it is completely dry."

      "title": "Soak up excess liquid as soon as possible.",
      "content": "Soak up excess liquid as soon as possible. If you spill any type of oil on your nylon bag—whether it’s salad dressing or car oil—you'll want to remove as much of it as possible immediately. Using a towel or napkin, dab at the oil until most of it is gone. [12] X Research source The longer the oil is allowed to sit on the fabric of your bag, the harder the stain will be to remove."

      "title": "Cover the stain with baking soda, cornstarch, or talcum powder.",
      "content": "Cover the stain with baking soda, cornstarch, or talcum powder. The Zimmermanns agree that these powders “help absorb grease stains from fabric.” They say to simply cover the stain with baking soda, cornstarch, or talcum powder after you've removed the excess liquid. In the Zimmermanns’ experience, cornstarch is the best at absorbing oil stains. However, both baking soda and talcum powder work well, too."
    },
    {
      "title": "Leave the powder on overnight, then brush it away.",
      "content": "Leave the powder on overnight, then brush it away. The Zimmermanns advise you to leave the cornstarch, baking soda, or talcum powder on overnight to ensure it absorbs the oil. Then, in the morning, just gently brush the powder away with a toothbrush. This should leave the nylon on your bag stain-free."

    {
      "title": "Repeat as necessary.",
      "content": "Repeat as necessary. Depending on how much oil soaked into your bag, you might have to repeat these steps to get it all out. Simply add more powder, leave it on overnight, and brush it away. Just keep in mind that you might not be able to remove all of the oil from your bag. If the grease stain still isn’t coming out of your bag , try a different solution: Scrub the stain with cornstarch and vinegar. [13] X Research source The vinegar adds an extra punch to break down grease and grime. [14] X Research source Dab the stain with rubbing alcohol. [15] X Research source Apply a commercial stain remover. Then, wash the bag in the laundry machine."

      "title": "Clean your bag whenever you notice it’s dirty.",
      "content": "Clean your bag whenever you notice it’s dirty. To keep your nylon purse looking brand new, regularly wipe it down to remove dirt, dust, and other debris. This helps prevent it from getting dingy-looking or stained, and keeps the material in tip-top shape so it doesn’t degrade as quickly. If you use your bag often, aim to clean it once per week. Otherwise, regularly clean it about every 1 to 3 months. [16] X Research source For extra protection , spray your bag with a nylon protectant spray . These products can protect your bag from water, sun, and dirt damage. Just follow the directions on the back of the spray to properly use it."

      "title": "Place your bag on a flat surface in a cool area when you’re not using it.",
      "content": "Place your bag on a flat surface in a cool area when you’re not using it. When you get home from work, school, or running errands, set your purse on a table, counter, or shelf instead of hanging it up. This helps it keep its shape and prevents it from stretching out. Just make sure wherever you keep it is cool and dry, whether that’s your bedroom, closet, or living room. [17] X Research source Heat and humidity can damage your bag and cause bacteria to grow, making your purse smell. Keeping it in a cool, dry spot helps prevent this. Keep your purse out of direct sunlight, as sunlight can cause fading and discoloration."

      "title": "Store your purse in a dust bag or pillowcase.",
      "content": "Store your purse in a dust bag or pillowcase. If you’re storing your purse away for the season, place it in a dust bag and keep it in a cool, dry location (like your closet). This prevents dust and dirt from accumulating on your bag and potentially staining it. It also protects your bag from damage, like scratches, and discoloration. [18] X Research source Tip : Stuff your bag with tissue paper or newspaper to help it keep its shape and prevent wrinkles from forming."
