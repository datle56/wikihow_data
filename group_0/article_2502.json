      "content": "Fill a shallow container with water. The container should be small enough on the sides that your tortoise should be able to climb out of it. Add lukewarm water to it. Make sure the tortoise's head pokes above the water when he's in it, but it should be about chin deep. [1] X Research source You can also place one end of the tub on a book to create a slight angle, making a shallow end and a deep end. Place the tortoise's head at the shallow end."

      "content": "Let the tortoise soak. The tortoise will spend time in the water, using it to rehydrate his body. Tortoises use water to rehydrate their bodies. They absorb it through a vent in the tail know as the cloaca. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Take the water out. Once the tortoise has soaked, you can take the water out. Discard the water in the toilet to avoid spreading any germs. [4] X Research source You can also take the tortoise from his cage to put him in a basin and simply take him out when he's done."

      "title": "Give the bath at least once a week.",
      "content": "Give the bath at least once a week. How much water you need to provide depends on the type of tortoise, the time of year, and whether he's inside or outside. Inside, you may need to do it as often as once a week, especially if the humidity is low. [6] X Research source Outside in the heat, the tortoise will need it twice a week, and you can let the water dry up in between. [7] X Research source It's especially important to provide a bath when the tortoise is coming out of hibernation, as the tortoise will need to rehydrate. [8] X Research source When the tortoise is hibernating and inside, you may only need to provide water about once a month. [9] X Research source"
