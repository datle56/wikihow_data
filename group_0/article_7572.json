If you’re claircognizant, trusting your gut feels easy and natural. You can intuitively tap into every aspect of your life—from personal relationships to ambitious professional goals—to find guidance for yourself and others. You don’t need explanations; you just know the right thing to do. Claircognizance is one of the four intuition types known as the Four Clairs. The other types include: [1] X Research source Clairvoyance is the ability to see clearly. You may receive visions of things as a flash or image or experience things in your mind’s eye like a movie. [2] X Research source Clairaudience refers to being able to hear messages outside your mind. [3] X Research source You may hear a song that captures what you’re going through perfectly, or a friend says exactly what you needed them to say, unprompted. Clairsentience is the ability to connect to the emotional energies and auras surrounding you. [4] X Research source For instance, if someone is having a bad day, you can feel their energy as if it were your own."

It helps reduce stress and lessen anxiety so your judgment (or intuition) isn’t clouded by external factors. To practice meditation, sit in an area where you can be distraction-free. Close your eyes and concentrate only on your breath without analyzing it. If your mind wanders, that’s okay! Let your thoughts come and go, then return to your breath. You can also count your breaths if you’re having difficulty focusing. There are plenty of meditation resources, like guided meditations, that can help you get into the habit of meditating."

[11] X Research source It involves taking the time to notice where we are, what’s going on and how that connects with our bodies. In situations where answers or behaviors aren’t clear, claircognizants rely on this skill to practice compassion and empathy for others. For instance, if you hate washing the dishes, instead of complaining about it internally, consider it an opportunity for self-reflection. Take notice of how the water feels against your hands. What does the soap smell like? If your sink is next to a window, what do you see? Mindfulness can help your body relax and unwind after a long day, bringing more gratitude, appreciation, and stress reduction into your life.

It’s an exercise of listening to your subconscious feelings and ideas by writing whatever comes to mind. It may be helpful to ask yourself a question. It can be about something that may be troubling you or something you want to achieve. Then, set up a timer for as long as you want, let go, and let your pen do the work. Don’t think, just be free. You can also use writing to help you identify your claircognizant abilities. Make a note whenever you feel complete certainty with your decision, and jot down how you felt when trusting your intuition. [13] X Research source"
