      "content": "Bring all the necessary equipment for the test. On some tests you just need a pen or pencil, but for math tests you may need more tools. Remember your calculator, protractor, ruler, compass, and anything else that you need to take the test. You’ll be at a big disadvantage if you’re allowed to use these tools and you don’t have them.

      "content": "Read all the directions before starting your work. Understand exactly what you have to do on this test. The teacher may have written specific instructions that you have to follow. Read and follow all the directions given to avoid losing points. [2] X Research source Don’t lose silly points for not following directions. For example, your teacher may have instructed you to circle all your final answers in pen. If you skipped reading the instructions, you wouldn’t see this, and you’d lose points that you otherwise would’ve gotten."

      "title": "Write down all the formulas you need at the start of the test.",
      "content": "Write down all the formulas you need at the start of the test. Most math tests involve remembering numerous formulas to solve different problems. Even if you studied and know them well, you could forget some if you get nervous during the test. Prevent this by doing a “brain dump” and writing down all the necessary formulas at the beginning of the test. Then refer back to this list if you forget any formulas. Also briefly write down the situation you would use the formula in. Instead of just writing “Pythagorean Theorem: a2 + b2 = c2,” add “Find the sides of a right triangle” so you know what the formula is for. If there isn’t room for extra writing on the test, ask your teacher if you can use a blank piece of scrap paper. Show the teacher that there is nothing on the paper. Then write all your formulas on this paper and use it as a reference."

      "title": "Pay careful attention to word problems.",
      "content": "Pay careful attention to word problems . Word problems are especially tricky because it isn’t always clear what the question is asking, or you may be confused by how the question is worded. Take extra time on word problems to identify the point of the question. Read through it slowly and underline important words that guide you to the calculations you have to make. [3] X Expert Source Daron Cam Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 29 May 2020. Put the word problem into mathematical form to make it clearer. If a problem says, “Johnny has 5 apples and Sarah has 3 times more. How many apples does Sarah have?” Write out 5 x 3 to put the problem in mathematical form. It probably makes a lot more sense that way. If you get stuck, break the question down to its components. Cross out words that aren’t important. Then translate words into math terms. For instance, the word “of” usually means you have to multiply, and \"per\" usually means division. Keep an eye out for words like these that you can turn into math terms. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Show all your work if partial credit is allowed.",
      "content": "Show all your work if partial credit is allowed. Some teachers allow partial credit if you set up an equation correctly and are on the right track to working it out. Get as much credit as possible by writing all your work neatly. Even if you can’t get the right answer, you can get a few valuable points. For example, you might know that a problem requires the Pythagorean Theorem, a2 + b2 = c2. First write that equation out without plugging any numbers in. Then plug the numbers you know into the correct place. This demonstrates to the teacher that even if you get the wrong answer, you know which processes you're supposed to do. You could earn partial credit from that. Showing your work also helps you even if there is no partial credit. With a neat rundown of your work process, it’s easier to spot any mistakes. If you are stuck on a problem, go back through your work. See if you made a mistake somewhere or if you set up the equation incorrectly."

      "title": "Skip questions you’re stuck on and return to them later.",
      "content": "Skip questions you’re stuck on and return to them later. It’s probably inevitable that you’ll hit a question that stumps you. If you come to one of these questions, skip it for now. There are probably other questions on the test that you can get quickly. You could spend too much time solving this one and run out of time for the rest of the test. Come back to these harder questions after completing the rest of the exam. [5] X Research source If there are 20 questions and you have 40 minutes for the test, that means you have 2 minutes to spend on each question. If a minute has gone by and you don’t know where to start with a question, skip it. You risk running out of time if you keep mulling it over. As a reverse strategy, you could go through the test and do all of the ones you know right away first. Then you have plenty of time to work out harder problems."

      "title": "Make sure all your answers are in the correct unit and value.",
      "content": "Make sure all your answers are in the correct unit and value. Some math tests say that your answers have to be in the correct value like miles per hour, kilograms, and the like. If a problem uses any units like these, put them in your final answer. [6] X Research source Also be careful with positive and negative numbers. If a number should be negative but you forget the negative sign, the answer is wrong."

      "title": "Use extra time to check your work.",
      "content": "Use extra time to check your work. If you finish early, make the most of the extra time and look over your test. Read the directions again to make sure that you’ve followed all the rules. Make sure you’ve shown your work and all your answers are in the correct units. Try reworking some of the questions you thought were hard and confirming your answer. [7] X Research source Remember that math works in two ways. Check your answers by doing the reverse operation. For example, if you find in 8x = 40 that X = 5, try multiplying 8 by 5. If you get 40, the answer is correct. If in the same equation you get X = 6, multiplying 8 by 6 would produce 48, so you'd know the answer was wrong."

      "content": "Use relaxation techniques if you get flustered from a hard question. Getting stuck on a question is definitely stressful, but don’t let that ruin the rest of the test. Stress can stop your mind from working properly. Take a minute to relax yourself if you feel anxious. Then return to the question with a clear mind. You may realize that you know the answer after all. [8] X Research source Do some deep breathing to relax your heart rate and release your anxiety. Close your eyes and focus on relaxing each muscle group if you’re feeling tense. Stretch your arms a little to get your circulation flowing again."

Take a step back and look at the problem again. Think about what this problem is asking. Is it asking for speed? Is it a geometry question? If so, what shape is involved? All these questions will help you identify what you have to do. [9] X Expert Source Daron Cam Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 29 May 2020. If it’s a numerical problem, think about what formula you might need. Go back to your list of formulas and see which one this problem corresponds with. If it’s a word problem, break the question down to its components. Cross out words that aren’t important. Look for words that tip you off to which operation you have to use. For instance, the word “of” usually means you have to multiply."

      "content": "Eliminate multiple choice answers you know are wrong. The process of elimination is a big help if you’re stuck on a multiple-choice question. Look at the answers and cross out ones that seem wrong. Then try to discern an answer from what’s left. [10] X Research source There are a few ways to tell if an answer seems wrong. For example, if the result you’re getting is close to 3 answers but nowhere near the 4th, eliminate that one. If you can narrow the answers down to 2, run your calculations again. If your result is closer to one of the 2 answers, pick that answer."

Remember that this is only one question and if the rest of your test is good, you’ll do fine. Do your best to pick an answer. You might get lucky and choose the right answer. [11] X Research source For a multiple-choice test, choose the answer that seems the best. If this isn’t a multiple-choice test, write down the answer that you got.

This is especially important with math, because using different formulas and equations requires a lot of practice. Do all the homework that your teacher assigns so you're ready for the test. [15] X Research source Get comfortable, but not too comfortable. Doing homework on your bed tempts you to take a nap. Remove distractions, turn off the TV, and sit in a quiet room to do your work.
