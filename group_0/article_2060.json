      "content": "Leos are attracted to bold and charming personalities. Play up your sociability and confidence to become extra appealing to this fire sign. Typically, a Leo man hates having his spotlight stolen. But when he finds someone that he deems equally worthy of an audience, his attraction goes through the roof. When you're at a party together, make sure everyone's eyes are on you. Run the room. Tell jokes to the group, greet everyone at the party, kill it on the dancefloor, and just generally be a ton of fun. Project confidence when the two of you interact. Hold your Leo crush’s gaze, maintain great posture, and use hand gestures while you speak."

      "content": "The longer you let the tension brew, the more exciting it'll be to hook up. A Leo man will definitely want to pursue his crush, so make sure you ruffle his curiosity, then sit back and wait for him to follow up. Let the anticipation build to drive this energetic, amorous Leo man completely wild. First, grab his interest. Send him a flirty text , approach him at a party, or tell a friend you think he’s cute (then have that friend \"let it slip\" to your Leo crush). Next, pull your attention back. Wait a few hours to respond to his texts, flirt with another party attendee, or duck out of your conversation with him early. Now, wait for him to chase you. By playing hard to get, you’ll have him completely charmed."
