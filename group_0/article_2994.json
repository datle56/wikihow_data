      "content": "Improv training develops your humor in a fast-paced environment. Look online or at comedy clubs in your area to see if they offer improv courses. Sign up for a class and work with the other students in the class to do funny scenes together. Eventually, you can incorporate some of the random humor of improv into your comedy routine, or just use the skills you develop to help you be more nimble with your humor based on the situation. [1] X Research source If you can’t find any improv classes in your area, you may be able to take improv clinics online. Improv can also help you get better at listening and working with peers."

      "content": "Use the stuff you like as inspiration, not as something to copy. Pick out a wide range of comedians, from all-time legends to unheralded locals, and listen carefully to their routines. Pay attention to what they’re telling jokes about and how they present them. For example, do they tell lots of traditional one-liners, or do they use more of a storytelling style? Or do they have some other unique comedy style? [2] X Research source If you want to try one-liner jokes, listen to comedians like Mitch Hedberg, Demetri Martin, or Steven Wright. If you want to tell jokes that are more like a story, try listening to Mike Birbiglia, Aziz Ansari, Brian Regan, or John Mulaney. Get inspired by their joke-telling styles—but never copy their actual jokes!"

      "content": "Focus on how they manage the stage as they deliver jokes. While checking out the joke-telling styles of other comedians, also be sure to notice details like their tone of voice and the speed of their delivery. Look at how they move around the stage, make eye contact, and interact with the crowd. Do they take charge of the stage and the crowd, or do they seem to let the crowd dictate their style? [3] X Research source Remember that your goal is to get ideas and inspiration, not to try to copy someone else’s unique style. Richard Pryor might be your favorite comedian of all time, for instance, but that doesn’t mean you should try to be Richard Pryor. Instead, take cues from his style that you can mesh with your own unique comedic voice and stage presence."

      "content": "Work on making people laugh in everyday situations. First and foremost, a comedian needs to make their audience laugh! Practice exaggerating things and changing the tone of your voice while you speak so you sound funnier. Watch comedy movies and read humorous books so you can develop a sense of what you think is funny. Try goofing around with friends or telling them jokes to see if you can make them crack up. [4] X Research source Here’s an added bonus: getting in touch with your funny side can have health benefits! Having a good sense of humor can help you deal with feelings of tension, sadness, and frustration."

      "content": "Take steps to manage anxiety so you can focus on being funny. Comedians make a name for themselves by performing in front of all kinds of crowds, so you need to feel comfortable getting up on any stage at any time. Before stepping on stage, close your eyes, relax your muscles, and take a few deep breaths to calm yourself. It also helps to pick out a few “friendly faces”—people in the audience who naturally put you at ease—to look towards when you’re feeling nervous. [5] X Research source Don’t discount another key way to reduce anxiety: prepare and practice a lot so you know your material backward and forwards. While some comedians use their apparent (or even real) discomfort onstage as part of their persona, it’s typically much easier to get people to laugh when you look and act at ease on stage."

      "content": "It’s just reality—jokes will fall flat, you’ll bomb on stage, and so on. Doing comedy is a blast when everyone’s laughing, but you also have to accept that failure and rejection are commonplace when you’re a comedian. [6] X Expert Source Kendall Payne Standup Comedian Expert Interview. 3 April 2020. Even the funniest, most successful, and most famous comedians have many tales of bad jokes, awful sets, and canceled gigs. Like them, instead of seeing each setback as a sign that you should give up, view it as an opportunity to learn and improve so you can be better the next time around. [7] X Research source For example, say you tell a joke that you’re sure is a winner and yet it gets zero laughs during your set. Instead of tossing the joke aside, think about ways you can rework it. Sometimes just a little bit of rephrasing or adjustment in your delivery can make a big difference. So how do you know when you’ve experienced so much failure and rejection that it really is a sign that you aren’t cut out for comedy? That’s all up to you. As long as you still feel the drive to keep at it, you should keep at it!"

      "content": "Be yourself on stage, but make it an exaggerated version of yourself. While some comedians create stage characters that are nothing like them in real life, most elevate certain qualities of their true selves to ramp up the humor. Start developing your stage persona by brainstorming words that you would use to describe yourself, such as shy, angry, or energetic. Take those qualities and try to incorporate them into your jokes and style. [8] X Research source For example, if you tend to get easily agitated, you might ramp this up and be an “angry” comic in the vein of Lewis Black. Or, if you’re naturally energetic and excitable, you might channel this into your stage presence and delivery style like Eddie Murphy in his younger days."

      "content": "Keep a notepad or digital device handy to jot down joke ideas. Joke topics are endless—the key part is putting your own personal and funny spin on them. Keep a running list of things you find funny—mundane everyday items, relationships, workplace drudgery, political shenanigans, and so on. Use your list of joke topics to develop new bits and refine your existing stuff. [9] X Research source If you want to do topical humor, watch the news to stay up to date with current events. Don’t consider anything “off-limits” at this point. Once you move from brainstorming joke topics to creating structured jokes, you may decide that some of the material doesn’t suit your comedy persona or goals."

      "content": "Personalizing your joke ideas helps you shape them into great jokes. Turning funny ideas into funny jokes is essential work for a comedian—but that doesn't mean it's easy work! Expect to go through lots of trial and error until you craft the best possible joke (or series of jokes) out of one of your joke topic ideas. To help yourself out, try personalizing the topic—use your own life experiences related to the topic to help build out the details of the joke. [10] X Research source For example, if your topic is about going on a date, you might write down one of your own awkward dating experiences in the style of a joke."

      "title": "You don’t have to use a rigid structure, but your jokes do need a payoff.",
      "content": "You don’t have to use a rigid structure, but your jokes do need a payoff. In a classic joke structure, 2 or 3 setup sentences might lead to a 1 or 2 sentence punchline, all in 250 words or less. This kind of “setup, punchline, laugh, repeat” format (think of Rodney Dangerfield with his famous “no respect” persona) may not suit your comedy style, but make sure your jokes build up to a laugh-inducing zinger. The punchline needs to make sense, so the audience doesn’t get confused, but also be surprising enough that the audience can’t guess what you’re going to say. [11] X Research source Write multiple punchlines for each joke, then decide which one works best. One-liners have the set-up and punchline in rapid succession, but they can be more difficult to write. For example, take this famous one-liner from Mitch Hedberg: “I like rice. Rice is great when you're hungry and you want 2,000 of something.” Sometimes you might find it easier to write the punchline before figuring out the setup."

      "content": "Set up a killer joke with smaller jokes that lead up to it. The setup for each bit (a series of related jokes) includes the introduction to the topic you’re riffing on and a few shorter jokes. Introduce the topic in just enough detail so the audience can easily follow along, but don’t give too much backstory or the setup will feel long-winded. Pull together 2 or 3 jokes that tie into the topic and naturally lead into the strongest joke in the bit. Assemble 5 to 10 bits and you’ll have yourself a solid 5-minute standup comedy set! [12] X Research source For example, if your topic is about online dating, this might be your setup: “I downloaded a dating app to give it a try and I didn’t get a single match for 2 months.” From there, you might tell a joke about making a profile, followed by one about getting your first match, and finish off with one about going on a date with your match."

      "content": "This is the standard length for a standup set at most clubs. To create your 5-minute set, put together 2 or 3 of your high-quality bits (each with 3 or 4 jokes) into a “chunk,” then assemble 2 or 3 chunks to fill out your 5 minutes. End the set with the joke you think will get the biggest laugh from your audience. Outline the set on a piece of paper so you can memorize the order. [13] X Research source For example, your first chunk might start with a bit about your frustrations with online dating, move on to a bit about how it was easier to date before cell phones, and finish with a bit on how you ended up in your current relationship. Your subsequent bits might continue on related themes or transition into different territory. If you’re having difficulty creating smooth transitions between your bits and/or chunks, try throwing in a few unrelated one-liners as transition markers. Over time, assemble multiple 5-minute sets that you can put together if you get a 10, 30, or even 60-minute time slot."

      "content": "Take note of their reactions and ask for honest feedback. Before you get on stage in front of an audience, ask your close friends and family to listen to your set. As you perform your jokes, watch how they react to the punchlines and see how often they laugh. When you finish the set, ask them to be honest about how they felt about your jokes. Write down their feedback and use it to help you edit your jokes so they're funnier. [14] X Research source If your jokes don’t land while you’re practicing, try revising your word choice to see if your jokes flow better. [15] X Research source If you don’t feel comfortable performing in front of a group of people right away, record yourself as you perform your set in front of a mirror. That way, you can watch the video to see your mannerisms and delivery."

[16] X Expert Source Kendall Payne Standup Comedian Expert Interview. 3 April 2020. In addition to perfecting your set, focus on your delivery style. Don’t rush through your material. Take brief pauses so people have time to laugh. When you’re finished, thank the audience and say your name so people remember you better. [17] X Research source Record your performances so you can look back at your sets to see how they went. You may also be able to upload clips from your set to share with others. Keep telling jokes even if your set isn’t going as well as you'd like. You’ll learn as much from the nights you bomb as from the nights you nail it!

Each night you’re doing a set, talk to the other comedians about their sets and what jokes you really enjoyed. Ask them how they felt about your set and what worked for them. [18] X Research source If you’re performing before a headliner or a comedian with more notoriety than you, ask them about their “home base” clubs and what the submission process is like. They may be able to put in a good word for you if they think you’d be able to perform well there. Don’t arrive just before your set and leave right after—watch, listen, learn, and share with the other comedians."
