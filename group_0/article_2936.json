      "title": "Determine your definition of success.",
      "content": "Determine your definition of success. Being successful on YouTube can range from gathering a certain number of subscribers to making money; before you set out to optimize your YouTube channel for \"success\", you should know exactly what you need to accomplish in order to meet that goal. Subscriber success is usually a matter of promoting your videos as aggressively as possible. It will take time, but you can usually build up your subscriber base in this way. Monetary success is a bit trickier on YouTube, as you'll need to reach a lifetime video view of 10,000 and verify your account before you can start earning money. Keep in mind that success on YouTube is still largely contingent on luck. You can do everything correctly and still not gain subscribers or amass channel views due to YouTube's algorithm."

      "content": "Figure out your content area and audience. If you don't already know what genre your videos belong to or who they're for, you'll have a hard time sticking to a specific content area, and your subscriber base won't grow due to having no real niche. Figuring out the what and the who of your videos will help streamline and focus your content. Once your videos begin to fit a specific pattern, you can make micro-improvements to them to help them continue to fit your audience as it grows."

      "content": "Create a channel if you haven't yet done so. If you don't already have a YouTube channel, you'll want to set up a new YouTube channel for success by doing the following: A unique, easy-to-remember username which summarizes your content An eye-drawing profile picture A concise but complete explanation of your channel's purpose"

      "title": "Remove dissonant videos from your channel.",
      "content": "Remove dissonant videos from your channel. If you have a channel which you've had for a while, you might want to delete the videos from your channel. This will help prevent confusion if viewers stumble across your older content while looking for your new-and-improved stuff. You don't have to delete your old videos if they fit your content area and production value."

      "title": "Link directly to your subscription box.",
      "content": "Link directly to your subscription box. Any time you paste your channel's web address somewhere (e.g., in a video's description box or on social media), you can add a tag at the end of the address to link directly to the Subscribe button. Anyone clicking the link will be prompted to confirm that they want to subscribe to you: Open your channel's page. Select the URL in the address bar. Copy the URL by pressing Ctrl + C (Windows) or ⌘ Command + C (Mac). Paste the URL somewhere by pressing Ctrl + V (Windows) or ⌘ Command + V (Mac). Remove the \"?view_as=subscriber\" section from your channel's address. Type ?sub_confirmation=1 at the end of your channel's address."

      "content": "Stick to making videos which align with your content area and audience. Deviating from your established formula may cause you to lose subscribers. Remember that your viewers are on your channel to see a certain type of content. On the other hand, if your current videos aren't receiving much in the way of engagement from your audience, it may be time to change things up."

    {
      "title": "Make sure that your videos engage viewers throughout.",
      "content": "Make sure that your videos engage viewers throughout. Since YouTube changed their algorithm in late 2017, creators are rewarded for the length of watch time rather than individual views. This means that engaging viewers all the way through a 15-minute video will be more lucrative than losing them at the halfway point. An easy way to ensure that users are engaged throughout the video is to minimize filler content. If you have to transition from one topic or point to another, keep the transition brief and in line with your content."

      "title": "Try to lengthen your videos.",
      "content": "Try to lengthen your videos. While you shouldn't add filler for filler's sake, if you have exceptionally short YouTube videos (e.g., under three minutes), you may want to increase the length by one or two minutes where possible. Ideally, your videos will be between 8 and 12 minutes. [1] X Research source This is especially important if you're trying to make money while operating with a small initial subscriber base. Don't extend your videos if your content persuasion clearly relies on short, punchy content (e.g., Tasty videos)."

Knowing when users are losing interest in your videos can help you change your video layout, especially if your videos all follow a specific format. You can see the point at which users stop watching your videos by doing the following: Click your profile icon in the upper-right corner of YouTube. Click Creator Studio Click ANALYTICS on the left side of the page. Look at the \"Average view duration\" section on the right side of the page."

      "content": "Use video cards to direct viewers to your other content. Adding annotations with links to your other content will both keep your audience aware of your other content and encourage longer viewing sessions. Make sure not to overcrowd the video player with annotations, as this can be annoying and unconvincing."

      "content": "Use high-quality equipment. When recording anything other than on-screen content (e.g., video game playthroughs), using high-quality camera and audio equipment can be the difference between YouTube success and average videos. Try to use the following: A dedicated camera with high-definition (1080p) recording capabilities A dedicated directional microphone Lighting While many smartphones also have HD recording capabilities, you'll want to stick to a dedicated camera when possible."

You can ensure that people are actively viewing and responding to your content by uploading during the following times: [2] X Research source Monday through Wednesday — Between 2:00 PM EST and 4:00 PM EST.

      "content": "Upload consistently. It doesn't matter whether you upload 12 times per week or once per week—just make sure you're uploading at approximately the same time for each upload. Your subscribers will come to expect this kind of consistency, so make sure you honor their time. For example, if you establish a routine of uploading once every Tuesday and Thursday, don't randomly jump around to other days. Uploading more than 7 times per week isn't recommended, as doing so will both flood your subscribers' subscription boxes and invariably lower the overall production value of your content. If you have to miss a day, make sure to update your subscribers both on YouTube and in linked social media."

Knowing what your video is about and generating a title based on appropriate keywords will help search engines and viewers alike find your videos.

      "content": "Respond to comments on your own videos. Once you start gaining comments on your videos, you can interact with a few people per video by replying to their comments, engaging in a conversation, and/or liking their comments. Many viewers will appreciate your interaction and view it as an incentive to visit the next video."

      "content": "Implement viewer suggestions. While you don't have to take every suggestion which comes your way, making popular tweaks to your content will both show viewers that you read their comments and demonstrate that you value their opinions. If you don't want to take suggestions from your viewers, you can also try doing a contest with a reward or shouting out different subscribers at the end of your video."

      "title": "Link social media to your channel.",
      "content": "Link social media to your channel. Social media pages such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram all allow your viewers to see a different, non-YouTube side of you. While subscribers often enjoy this intimate peek into your private life, having social media pages for your YouTube channel also means that you can reach more people outside of your YouTube channel. It's also good to have social media accounts in case you have to update subscribers outside of YouTube."

      "title": "Add a link to a Patreon.",
      "content": "Add a link to a Patreon. Many YouTubers rely on subscriber support from Patreon, which is a service that allows subscribers to pay a small monthly donation to you. Patreon is less invasive than asking for donations via PayPal or similar, and it allows you to reward your subscribers based on how much they donate per month. [4] X Research source This is also a great way to begin making money when you haven't yet hit the 10,000 lifetime channel views mark."
