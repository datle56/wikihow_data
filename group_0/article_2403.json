If you're cooking more than one chicken breast, keep them slightly apart. You do not want them to touch. You can also add something like lemon slices or wedges to add extra flavoring to your chicken. [3] X Research source If using skinless chicken, cover the baking dish with parchment paper. Take one sheet of parchment paper and cover one side with butter. Lay it on top of the chicken. Then, tuck the edges of the parchment paper underneath the breast to keep the chicken fully covered. The parchment will act almost like the chicken skin helping it to remain moist and keeping it from drying out. [4] X Research source"
