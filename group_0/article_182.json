Many times, this means that one aspect of your life—a relationship, a job, a spiritual or mental state of mind—is coming to a close to make room for something deeper or more meaningful in your future. Whatever the reason, rest assured that your guardian angels (or God, or the universe, or the higher power you believe in) have your back during this transitional time. [1] X Research source These changes aren’t always easy and may seem intimidating or sad. Remember that the universe’s plans for you always seek to help you find your true, higher calling. Think of the end of a phase like the pruning of a plant. You’re clearing away old beliefs or baggage to make room for new, healthy growth."

Seeing 99 when you’re in a relationship is a wonderful thing—it confirms that your bond is based on mutual respect, understanding, and love.

Since it’s all about new beginnings, you might be on the verge of a raise or promotion, finding a new or more satisfying job, or being able to support yourself on your passion projects. Keep your eyes peeled for opportunities that could propel you forward. For example, say you always pass a billboard with 99 on it on your way to an unfulfilling day job. This might be a sign it’s time to move on to a job that feels more meaningful to you. Surround yourself with positive, motivating people to help you on your way. This could mean networking with successful colleagues in your industry, or building a social support system outside of work that encourages you to chase your dreams."

Each time you spot 99, jot down every detail you can recall about the experience—where you saw it, who you were with, what emotions you were feeling right before, and more. No detail is too insignificant! For example, say you exchange phone numbers with an intriguing stranger at a bar and notice their number ends with 99. This could be a sign they’re your twin flame or a potential partner. Or, imagine you’re lamenting your low-paying job while sifting through your coin jar and you count exactly 99 cents. This might be a sign that it’s time to request a promotion or move on to greener pastures."

      "content": "Trust your intuition and stay open to new opportunities. Angel number 99 is a symbol of new beginnings, but you’re unlikely to find one if you're stuck in the same old daily routine. Make an effort to try new things , like exploring a sport or hobby you’ve been curious about or signing up for a class to develop a new skill, like pottery or flute lessons. If you get a “gut feeling” that this new activity is for you, stick with it! For example, if you notice you feel more confident after taking up rock climbing, then something about that activity (the mental focus, the physical challenge, the people you’ve met) could be important to your overall personal growth."

      "content": "Help other people, especially those in your community. You’ve most likely received help, support, or encouragement at some point in your life. Now that you’re approaching a new, more enlightened beginning, pay that energy forward. Volunteer at a local community center or organization you’re passionate about, reach out to your loved ones who may need support, or donate clothes, old items, or money to good causes. [6] X Research source Many people think of large national or international organizations when they’re feeling altruistic. These organizations do meaningful work, but there are also opportunities for you to make a big impact locally as well. Helping others will also boost your own mental and emotional well-being and can help reduce feelings of depression or anxiety, too."

      "content": "Let go of past hurts that are holding you back. A new beginning is a time to drop negative beliefs or work through past problems that make you feel insecure, powerless, or less than. Try using positive affirmations to counter negative self-talk, or clearing the air with people that may have wronged you in the past. You don’t have to forgive them exactly, but gaining closure can free you to explore your higher self. [7] X Research source Forgive yourself for any wrongdoings or mistakes you’re holding on to as well. Remember that no one is perfect and it’s OK to fumble while you find your path in life."
