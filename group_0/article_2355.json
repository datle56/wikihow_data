In this section, you’ll be able to navigate to a list of your online purchases. Look for the specific purchase and cancel it. Remember, though, the quicker you cancel, the better your chances of not having to pay anything.

    {
      "title": "Give a valid, specific reason.",
      "content": "Give a valid, specific reason. Many companies will not let you cancel a purchase freely if you just changed your mind about a product. Thus, you need to provide a legitimate reason for why you no longer want the product. Some reasons may include: The ad listing misrepresents the product. You found a cheaper price. The product is damaged or is not the exact product you ordered."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write down the transaction or cancellation ID number.",
      "content": "Write down the transaction or cancellation ID number.

    {
      "title": "Verify you received a refund.",
      "content": "Verify you received a refund. After your order is cancelled, you should receive a refund.

If you purchased with a credit card, your money must be refunded within a billing cycle."

      "title": "Retract your bid.",
      "content": "Retract your bid. Under certain circumstances, you may be allowed to back out of a winning auction bid without penalty. Retracting your bid may be as simple as hitting “cancel” or “rescind bid.” There are, however, other cases in which an online auction site may allow you to back out of a purchase, they include: The seller materially changed the advertisement of the product. The seller misrepresented the product. You entered the wrong amount for your bid. This should be obvious. For instance, if the last bid was $200 and your winning bid was $2,000."

      "content": "Contact the seller by email. If the auction site is unwilling or unable to cancel the bid, you may need to contact the seller of the product directly.

[2] X Research source They may want you to pay any fees associated with them relisting their item. The seller may let you out of the sale if they think there weren't enough bidders and the price of their item did not go high enough. In addition, they could also profit if you volunteer to pay them for the trouble of relisting the item."

      "title": "Read the company’s cancellation policy.",
      "content": "Read the company’s cancellation policy. Most companies will post their cancellation policy or a link to it on the order page. As a result, before you cancel, you should read the cancellation policy. Some companies require you to cancel an order within 30 minutes or an hour of placing it. Some companies may allow you 24 hours to cancel an order. Many companies will not allow you to cancel an order after it has shipped."

      "title": "Pay a cancelation fee.",
      "content": "Pay a cancelation fee. The company’s cancellation policy may stipulate that you must pay a cancellation fee.

Most Visa, MasterCard, and Discover cards may not cancel a purchase unless it was somehow fraudulent."
