      "content": "Yes, you can safely line an air fryer with parchment paper. Parchment paper is a lightweight, heat-resistant material that's been treated with a thin layer of silicone to make it non-stick. It's perfectly safe to use in your air fryer as long as you cut it smaller than the basket or tray and weigh it down with food. Parchment paper can be a fire hazard if it blows around inside the fryer or touches the heating element, and these simple safety precautions can help prevent that. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut the parchment paper smaller than the air fryer tray or basket. This will prevent extra material from sticking up the sides of the air fryer and potentially touching the heating element. It will also leave a gap around the tray for increased airflow throughout the appliance, which will help your food cook thoroughly. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Poke holes in the parchment paper with a wooden skewer. Parchment paper typically comes in solid sheets which can block some of the air flowing throughout the air fryer and potentially increase your cook time. Adding holes to your parchment paper piece before placing it in the air fryer will help address this issue. [3] X Research source If you don't want to cut or poke holes through your parchment paper, purchase perforated parchment paper air fryer liners . These are disposable pieces of parchment paper that are already cut to size to fit most air fryers."

      "title": "Avoid putting parchment paper in the air fryer during preheating.",
      "content": "Avoid putting parchment paper in the air fryer during preheating. The air flowing through the air fryer will blow your parchment paper around, increasing the risk that it will touch the heating element and scorch – or worse, start a small fire. Put the parchment paper in the air fryer only after it's done preheating to your desired temperature. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Weigh the parchment paper down in the air fryer.",
      "content": "Weigh the parchment paper down in the air fryer. Parchment paper is so lightweight that the air fryer can easily blow it around if it's not weighed down. Ensure the food you're cooking is heavy enough to pin the parchment paper to the air fryer basket or tray. Heavier foods like chicken, fish, and potato wedges should keep it from moving. [5] X Research source When cooking lightweight foods like chips or thin apple slices, add pie weights to the parchment paper to help hold it down."

      "title": "Spray with cooking oil to make your air fryer non-stick inside.",
      "content": "Spray with cooking oil to make your air fryer non-stick inside. If your biggest concern when cooking in an air fryer is food sticking to the appliance, spray or brush cooking oil onto the bottom of the air fryer basket or tray. This strategy prevents most sticking, allows for the most airflow, and will ensure that your food not only cooks thoroughly but crisps up, as well. Use a cooking oil with a high smoke point like vegetable oil or beef tallow while cooking at high temperatures above 400 °F (204 °C) to prevent your food from adopting a bitter flavor.

      "title": "Use aluminum foil to catch grease in an oven-style air fryer.",
      "content": "Use aluminum foil to catch grease in an oven-style air fryer. Aluminum foil works best as a liner on the bottom of an oven-style air fryer to catch grease and fat drippings from food as it cooks. However, it's not recommended to use it as a liner for the tray in an oven-style air fryer or the basket in a basket air fryer. It blocks more airflow than parchment paper and may cause your food to turn out less crispy and more soft and soggy. [7] X Research source If you're cooking acidic foods like tomatoes, lemons, or vinegar, you may want to avoid lining the air fryer tray or basket with foil. The chemical reaction between the acid in these foods and the foil (combined with the high air fryer temperature) may cause aluminum to leech out into your food. [8] X Research source Experts say the amount of aluminum that would leech into your food isn't a cause for concern, but it's something to be aware of if you're worried about heavy metal buildup in your body."

      "content": "Try silicone liners when you don't want to clean out your air fryer. Silicone air fryer liners are non-stick and easy to clean (plus, some of them are already perforated). They're made of a plastic that's generally considered safe to use in cooking; however, some research has shown that exposure to high temperatures may cause it to release a small amount of chemicals into your food. Experts recommend heating silicone before cooking with it to release those chemicals so they don't migrate to your meal.

      "content": "Give it a try if you want to make cleanup quicker and easier. The parchment paper will prevent the food from sticking to the basket or tray making cleaning the air fryer a simple task that takes only seconds. To use parchment paper safely and ensure your food cooks all the way through, cut a piece of it to a size slightly smaller than your air fryer tray or basket and poke holes in it with a wooden skewer. For a more eco-friendly option, opt for unbleached parchment paper. Unbleached parchment paper is brown and hasn't been treated with chlorine like the regular, white variety. This reduces its environmental impact, as well as the amount of chemicals you're bringing into your kitchen. [10] X Research source"

Foil blocks more air than parchment paper does, which could result in your food cooking unevenly or coming out soft instead of crispy. It also has the potential to leech aluminum into your food."
