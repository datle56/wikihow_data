If you do not have the owner’s manual, try using a search engine to find your car’s torque. For instance, search “torque” and your car’s make, year, and model, and a helpful result should come up."

The first calculation you want to do is multiply the torque and the engine speed. [1] X Research source For example, a Porsche generates 480 of torque at 2,500RPM. Expressed in terms of the equation, that is (2500 * 480), which equals 1,200,000."

The resulting number you get is expressed in watts. [8] X Research source For example, if you weigh 180 lbs, and climb a 12-foot staircase in 4 seconds, that equals ((180 * .454) * 9.81 * (12 * .3048)) / 4 = 733 watts."

[9] X Research source In this example, we can use the formula (m*9.81*h)/t=HP because we are assuming that the only force acting on the runner is the force of gravity. Since the only force acting on the runner is the force of gravity, we know that all the horsepower the runner produces is used to push upward (vertically) against gravity. We are not accounting for friction, which would normally slow a runner down by exerting a force in the horizontal direction. In the real world, a runner would also have to push forward against friction, just as they would have to push upward against the force of gravity. You’d need a more complicated formula to account for friction and gravity together."
