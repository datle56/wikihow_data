If you think that your parents might already suspect your sexual orientation and that they will likely be supportive, then move forward with making a plan. If you think this will be a complete shock to your parents, then consider how they might react. [1] X Expert Source Inge Hansen, PsyD Transgender & Diversity Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2019. If you think your parents might react negatively, you should wait to tell them. Consider questions such as whether your parents make homophobic comments, whether you would be crushed if they reacted negatively, or whether you are financially dependent upon them. If any of these thoughts leads to a \"yes,\" then it is probably better to wait until you are independently living and supporting yourself or until you feel more prepared with a stronger support system. [2] X Research source Drop hints if you want to get a better sense of how they might respond. If coming out could put you in danger, it might not be the right time. Remember that an immediate negative reaction won't necessarily be how they feel forever. Their thoughts can change over time, and many parents often become very accepting after a child comes out to them.

      "content": "Decide how you want to tell them. There are different ways that you can go about doing this, such as a face-to-face conversation or with a letter. Consider your family dynamic as you contemplate how to tell them, and consider how you feel most comfortable communicating. Explaining everything in a letter might feel easier for you and might give them more time to digest the news. On the contrary, perhaps your family likes to talk things through, or perhaps you express yourself better verbally. Stick to your decision once you make it. This will prevent you from delaying telling them or being disorganized when you do so."

Once you have decided how you will tell them, the next step is to build a support system of people who will always be there for you. [4] X Expert Source Inge Hansen, PsyD Transgender & Diversity Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2019. If you have relatives, friends, teachers, or counselors who already know that you are LGBTQ, establish a support system with them. Make sure that they are okay with you coming to them for advice and in the event that coming out to your parents goes negatively. Ask the parents of other LGBTQ individuals to act as a support system for your parents. Being able to send your parents to another set of parents who have gone through the same experience can help them accept your sexuality. Have another set of parents prepared to meet with your parents prior to coming out. Make sure that you are mentally prepared to have this conversation and that you are open to answering your parents' questions. Also consider being open to going to therapy, if they suggest it, because it will likely confirm for them that you are, LGBTQ. If you are transgender/nonbinary or otherwise feel that you need to change something about the way you present yourself or your appearance in order to feel comfortable, consider having an honest conversation about mental health with your parents. Confiding in them about your mental health can not only help you to convince them to believe you or allow you to make the changes you need, but can also help you yourself feel better. Openness can be beneficial on all sides of this situation, as long as you believe your family will be receptive."

For example, if your parents cut you off financially or ask you to leave the house, you need to have somewhere to go and someone to help support you through this time. [7] X Research source Reach out to a friend, relative, teacher, or counselor to whom you have already come out. Ask them if you can stay with them, or if they can help you find somewhere safe to stay, in the event that your parents kick you out of their house. This is also a good place to go in the event that you do have your own housing but need someone to talk to and to support you after a negative experience coming out to your parents. Take time to save some money so that you have a means for supporting yourself. This could mean getting a part-time job, if you are of legal working age, or savings another means of income. If you do not have your own transportation, figure out a means for how you will get around to where you need to go. This could involve getting rides from the person or family with whom you are staying, getting rides from another friend or supportive person, or using the public transportation system in your city. Figure out a way to thank the person or family with whom you would stay during this time. This could look like paying them \"rent,\" if you are able, or helping to pick up some chores and errands to make things easier for them."
