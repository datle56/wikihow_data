To see how many contributions you have, visit your user page and scroll to the bottom. It will say \" (Your Name) has made (number of) contributions to wikiHow .\" You need a valid working email address to complete the NAB exam—it’s the only way to receive any tests and/or responses."

Don’t worry, though—you’re free to double-check these policies while you’re taking any portion of the test.

If you become a booster, some articles you’ll come across will need copyediting, formatting, and general cleaning up before they’re ready to go live on the site. Use the Copyedit, Format, or Cleanup Greenhouses to automatically help you find articles based on your interests. You can also try patrolling and editing some new articles at Special:NewPages. Make your best judgment about whether the articles should be promoted or demoted. If you think that the article should be promoted, you can help polish it up so it’s ready to go. If you think that the article should be demoted, you don’t have to edit it."

If you don't get part two of the NAB test after five days, please email jayne@wikihow.com . What if I don’t pass this portion of the test?

During this trial portion of the test, you'll be able to carry out all the regular boosting activities (promotion, demotion, title changes, etc), except for voting in the NFD Guardian. You'll receive feedback based on your edits, actions, and messages as you go, or after you complete the batch as asked. After you get that feedback, you will generally be asked to continue trial boosting for several other rounds of boosting, each time tackling up to the assigned batch quantity. Be sure to check in for feedback when you reach each limit, and to use the feedback to help you hone your skills as you go. Also, feel free to ask questions! As long as you stay reasonably active and continue to do trial boosts when you can, there's no set time limit to how long you can take for your batches of boosting. However, if you go inactive during your trial, you'll get some follow-up reminders and check-ins about the status of your trial. If you still are active over a longer period of time and just aren't doing any trial boosting, your trial may be put on hold and your provisional rights removed until you can devote more time to the task."
