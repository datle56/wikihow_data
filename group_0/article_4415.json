      "content": "Wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner . Make sure to wash your scalp with a non-sulfurous clarifying shampoo to get it as clean. Use a moisturizing conditioner to fortify your hair and make it as soft as possible before you braid it. [1] X Research source Read the label on the shampoo and conditioner and make sure that it's intended for your hair texture. You can read the ingredients label to make sure that it doesn't have sulfur. Sulfur can dry out and damage your hair, especially if your hair is naturally dry or coarse."

      "title": "Detangle your hair with a brush or comb.",
      "content": "Detangle your hair with a brush or comb. Brush your hair right after you wash it to get all of the knots and tangles out. Opt for a wide-toothed comb if your hair is more coarse and/or curly. If your hair has dried since you've washed it, you'll need to re-wet it with water by misting it with a spray bottle. Continue brushing or combing until your hair is smooth and there aren't any knots in it. [2] X Research source Getting the knots and tangles out of your hair with a brush or a comb will make braiding it much easier. To remove stubborn knots and tangles, begin at the ends of your hair and work your way up to the roots."

      "title": "Create a center part in the middle of your head.",
      "content": "Create a center part in the middle of your head. Use the teeth of a comb to create a part, from the front of your hair to the back. Drag the teeth of the comb across your head so that it separates the hair into two portions. When done correctly, you'll see a line where your scalp is. Make sure to make this part as straight as possible, as it will affect the placement of the other braids. [3] X Research source From here on out, braiding your hair will be difficult to do yourself, so you may want to get someone to help."

      "title": "Part your hair into sections.",
      "content": "Part your hair into sections. Use your comb to create additional parts that run parallel to the center part that you created. The hair in between these parts will be the hair that makes up your braids, so keep this in mind as you're parting it. [4] X Research source Decide how many braids you want and how large you want the braids to be as you create your parts."

      "title": "Moisturize your hair.",
      "content": "Moisturize your hair. As you create the parts, hair will start bunching up in one area. Grab these strands of hair and put moisturizer in it. This will soften the strands and make them easier to work with as you braid. [5] X Research source Shea butter, argan oil, hair butter, leave-in conditioners, and olive oil can all be used as hair moisturizers. [6] X Research source You can purchase moisturizers online or at the salon."

Do this with the rest of your hair after it's been moisturized. Once you're done, you should have several visible parts and the hair in between them should be pinned with bobby pins or hair clips.

Use a two strand twist if your hair is 1 inch (2.5 cm) or shorter, as creating a Dutch braid is difficult with shorter hair. If you have more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) of hair, you can try a dutch braid style. [8] X Research source"

Continue to twist the strands over each other and work towards the back of your head along the part that you created.

Once you become proficient at tying braids, try to mix up your part placement.
