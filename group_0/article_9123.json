Millions of tiny moments that create your love story.” — Jennifer Smith “To love and be loved is to feel the sun from both sides.” — David Viscott “Maybe love isn't something you find.

If you know them well, reminisce on your favorite memories you share with the two of them. The more personal details you include will show the couple how truly happy you are for them. If you don’t know them that well, it’s okay to keep your congratulations brief. Focus your message on the future rather than the past by wishing them luck with their marriage."

Like your greeting, base the formality of your sign-off on your relationship with the couple. Something like “Yours sincerely” may seem too formal, while simply writing “From” is too casual. Aim for something like “With love” or “Lots of love.” Then, sign your name so they know who the card is from."
