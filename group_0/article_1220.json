      "title": "Provide interesting food.",
      "content": "Provide interesting food. Good parakeet food mostly consists of seeds and fresh fruits and vegetables. Trying to introduce pellets in the diet, as well as a seed-only diet, can lead to obesity. Vary the presentation to make it more exciting for the bird. Rotate among food items to keep them interested in the food you offer. Never feed your bird avocado, chocolate, caffeine, or alcohol. These are toxic to the bird. Make sure the bird has enough water to drink in its dispenser. Add more water if the bowl or dish is low. Change the water daily to prevent bacterial build-up. Add a cuttle-bone. This is a good source of natural calcium for birds. Mineral blocks can also be offered for calcium. Don't feed your bird too many watery fruits or veggies, as this could cause your bird to get diarrhea. Diarrhea can cause dehydration and if left untreated, may cause it to die."

      "content": "Add a few perches. Perches are a great way for your bird to be comfortable in the cage. Parakeets are a very active bird and will love to have a variety of perches in its home. [1] X Research source Try to vary the perches to keep them interesting to your bird. Look for different thicknesses, shapes and textures. Rearrange and rotate perches weekly. This allows you to clean the ones not in use and keep things interesting for your bird. Make sure that the perch is stable to avoid any injury. Check that the wood is safe for the bird, such as eucalyptus. Natural wood perches are a great choice as the irregular shape helps your birds feet to keep strong and stay healthy. Dowel perches or plastic perches can cause foot problems due to the lack of foot exercise. Some types of wood should be avoided. Do not use perches and toys made out of Prunus or Oak trees as they might contain cyanogenic glycosides and tannins. These chemicals may harm your bird. [2] X Research source Try to avoid concrete perches, as they are hard on the bird's feet. Don’t crowd the cage with too many toys or perches. Your parakeet must be able to spread its wings and move around."

      "content": "Weigh the pros and cons of a mirror. Adding a mirror in the cage can keep the bird entertained for hours. Be aware however that there are debates about potential psychological damages. Instead of a mirror, consider a second bird. Parakeets love company and will probably welcome a new friend. If you decide to install a mirror, make sure that it’s fixed to the cage and doesn’t present a risk to your bird. Look for a mirror offered at your local pet store. They will have ones specifically designed for a bird to use. Don't simply place any mirror you find in the cage. Mirrors for birds are usually housed in a plastic case to prevent any sharp edges from hurting your bird."

      "title": "Examine the size of the cage.",
      "content": "Examine the size of the cage. The cage itself will need to be of adequate size to house your bird. Of course, the size of your bird will determine how large your cage will need to be. There are some general guidelines you can follow when selecting the right size cage for your bird: Avoid tall circular cages. These cages might look nice, but they don't allow for enough room for your bird to fly in. Your bird should at least be able to fully stretch its wings out while inside the cage. Ideally, your bird will have enough room to fly from perch to perch without trouble. Keep in mind how many birds you are going to put in this cage. The more birds, the more space will be required. Make sure the cage is easy to clean. Keeping the cage clean will help keep your bird happy and healthy."

      "content": "Talk to the bird often. Your bird will love the interaction and is likely to become very chatty. Keeping your bird company will keep it happy and well adjusted, as well as build a better bond. Try reading stories to your bird or even just tell them about your day. Parrots listen more than you think. If you don't want them to pick up bad language, keep it clean around them."

      "content": "Play games. Parakeets love to interact with their owner. Try different games to see which your bird likes the best. Birds love to play “Peek-a-boo” You could teach your bird to climb up on your finger. Put a few seeds on your finger and let your bird feed from it. Gently stroke its belly and it will be encouraged to jump on the finger. Try to teach it tricks. Buy a bird ladder and position your little friend on the bottom step. It will learn how to climb it. Position your parakeet on a tennis ball and let it find its balance. Encourage it with a treat. Your parakeet will eventually balance itself on its own on the ball. Every time your bird goes up or down, say ‘up’ or ‘down’ and do a hand gesture. Your bird will understand these actions after a while and obey your orders."

      "content": "Let the bird fly freely in a room. Your bird will love the chance to fly freely in a safe room. Parakeets are migratory and extremely active, so the open flight will be enjoyed greatly by them. You can let your bird fly in a room with all of the windows and doors closed. [3] X Trustworthy Source Animal Humane Society Leading animal welfare nonprofit organization providing medical care, training education, and resources for animal owners Go to source To call your bird back, turn off all the lights but one, or leave a single curtain open. The bird will fly towards the light. Pick up and hold your bird gently and put it back inside the cage. Have a play stand for your bird so it can have somewhere else to sit besides the cage. Make sure that the bird is safe. Put the cat away and look out for potential escape routes or other hazards. Think about your own hygiene. Your bird is likely to void on the floor. Don’t let it fly in a carpeted room. Always supervise your bird when it is out of the cage, so it won't get hurt. Don't force your bird to come out of its cage if it's not in the mood."

      "title": "Introduce them to new areas of your house.",
      "content": "Introduce them to new areas of your house. New environments can be stimulating to your bird. Taking them around the house with you on your shoulder can be a great way to spend time together. Talk with your bird as they ride on your shoulder. Let them explore new places, such as the surface of your dresser or nightstand. Always monitor your bird as it explores on its own. Keep it safe from any hazards. Make sure any areas your visit together are free from dangers. Keep cats and other pets away, close all doors and windows, and turn off any fans. Be careful when in certain rooms. Cooking or cleaning around your bird can release harmful elements into the air. Dust, smoke, and especially Teflon from a hot Teflon pan, can injure your bird's respiratory system."

      "content": "Introduce a new parakeet friend. Parakeets love company and will welcome a new friend, especially if you’re often at work. If you decide to buy an additional bird, make sure that the cage is big enough for two parakeets. Separate the birds at first. Put them in different cages to let them look at each other. Bring the cages closer after a few days. They will get used to each other. After two weeks, put the new bird in the cage of the resident parakeet. Always monitor the reaction. If any conflict occurs, separate the birds and try to reintroduce them again later."

      "content": "Turn on the radio. If you are often away, your bird might get lonely and depressed. It’s always good to turn on the radio or the TV and provide your bird with entertainment. Budgies can become so amused by the TV or radio, they can and might pick up words if they hear these noises quite often. You could also record your voice and play it when away. Make sure to put music you like. Your bird might start singing what it heard. If leaving a radio or television talk show on, consider the language being used as your bird may repeat some of the dialogue. Think about the volume. You don't want the sound to be too loud as the bird must be given the opportunity to sleep."

Toys are a necessity, not a luxury, for birds. Rotate toys regularly to keep them fresh and interesting for your bird and allow you time to clean them. Toys will help keep your bird entertained and happy. Try different toys to see which your bird really enjoys. Any metal, except stainless steel isn't safe, because it could contain zinc. Always check toys for safety, making sure there is no way your bird can get stuck in or on them. Make sure toys are of appropriate size for your bird."

      "content": "Place the cage near a window. Placing the cage near or in a window can provide an entertaining vantage point into the outside world. Your bird will be able to enjoy watching all the events that take place outside while you are away. Avoid any windows with direct sunlight. This can be too hot and too bright for you bird to be comfortable in. Check the window for any cold drafts or air. If the window allows chilly air to pass through, don't put your bird near it, as cold temperatures can be harmful to it. Make sure your window is shut. Even if your bird is in a cage, take no risks. The bird may find a way out, or something could find a way in, if the window is open."
