You’re making the rest of us look bad.” “Congrats on the promotion! Now you can officially boss people around and get paid for it!” “Congrats! With great power comes great… meetings. Lots of meetings.” “Promotion = more responsibilities, but also more excuses to bring in a cake for the team.” “We’re already wondering how your new role may benefit us… Congrats by the way.”"
