Simply write down the article's title followed by a period. For example, if you were citing an article on Jimmy Carter the beginning your citation would look like this: Jimmy Carter. [1] X Research source If you want to lead with an author's name, Wikipedia suggests using \"Wikipedia contributors\" as the name."

The date of the last revision is at the bottom of the Wikipedia page; if you cannot find the date, you can simply write \"n.d.\" in parenthesis after the entry title. After the date, add a period.

As Wikipedia articles do not have authors, you would simply skip to the article name. Put this in quotations and include a period inside the quotations.

In MLA style, you write the date, then the month, then the year.

Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia, 25 Sept. 2014. Web. 2 Feb. 2016."
