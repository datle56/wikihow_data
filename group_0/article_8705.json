      "title": "Identify the source of the smoke and remove it from the room.",
      "content": "Identify the source of the smoke and remove it from the room. If the smoke is from a cooking mishap, scrape off burnt food from pans or pots and throw it into the trash outside of your home. If you leave the burnt food in the trash inside, the smell will linger. If the smoke is from tobacco, toss out used cigarettes, cigars, and other smokable materials. Make sure cigarettes and cigars are put out completely before throwing them in the trash. Keep snuffed-out candles, ashtrays, and similar items outdoors or in an airtight box. Get any people or pets who may be in the room outside right away, especially individuals who may suffer from medical complications due to the smoke."

      "title": "Open doors and windows to clear out any lingering smoke.",
      "content": "Open doors and windows to clear out any lingering smoke. Open at least two windows or doors on opposite sides of the room. This creates a cross breeze that will suck fresh air in through one opening and push the smoke out of the other. If the smoke isn’t moving toward the window on its own, use something like a blanket or towel to fan the smoke in the right direction."

      "title": "Place a box fan in a window to clear stuck smoke.",
      "content": "Place a box fan in a window to clear stuck smoke. Place the fan inside a window so that the air is being pushed outside and turn it on. The spinning blades should suck the trapped smoke into the air outdoors. If the smoke is in your kitchen, turn on your stovetop fan as well. Another option is to set up a stand fan and position it so that it’s blowing the smoke out through an open door or window."

      "content": "Scrub your walls, floors, and other hard surfaces with mild soap. If the smoke was particularly heavy, it may have seeped into your walls, floors, and other hard surfaces like countertops and cabinets. Add 1 or 2 drops of mild dishwashing soap to a half gallon (1.9 L) of warm water and use a sponge or clean rag to wash any hard surfaces. [1] X Research source Another option is to combine ½ cup (118 ml) of white vinegar with 2 cups (473 ml) of water and pour the solution into a spray bottle. Spray the diluted vinegar onto hard surfaces and use a clean rag or sponge to scrub the area. Or, mix 4 teaspoons (4.9 ml) of bleach with 4 cups (946.4 ml) of room-temperature water and use this bleach solution on counters, tables, and floors.

Check to make sure that each item can safely be washed in the washing machine. To clean your items, use bleach during the wash cycle if you know it won’t damage the fabrics you’re washing. Or, pour ½ cup (78.8 ml) of vinegar into the washer during the rinse cycle to help get rid of the smoky odor. [3] X Research source Another option is to add ½ cup (136 g) of baking soda during the rinse cycle to help remove the odor. [4] X Research source You may need to run your clothes and other fabrics through multiple wash cycles before the smell disappears. If have a dryer, use dryer sheets to further eliminate and mask the smoky odor."

If you’re using vinegar, combine 1 part white vinegar with 2 parts water in a spray bottle and spray the solution onto your upholstered furniture and carpet. If you’re using baking soda, sprinkle a liberal amount on your carpet and upholstery and let it sit for about 15 minutes before vacuuming it up. [5] X Research source Both baking soda and vinegar will naturally work to remove and neutralize odors, and white vinegar acts as a mild disinfectant. When spraying the vinegar solution, spray the affected area lightly and avoid overly saturating your carpet or furniture."

Clean things like toys, picture frames, and trinkets with soap and water. If the smoke was in the kitchen, wash any pots, pans, cutlery, and serving dishes that might have been left out. [6] X Research source If you have anything made of leather in the room, such as shoes or purses, wipe them with a damp rag and let them air dry away from direct sunlight or heat.

Throw in a cinnamon stick or some cloves, then bring the whole thing to a boil. Once everything is boiling, reduce it to a simmer and let the mixture work its magic. Citrus will deodorize the odor while the spices will mask the scent with something more pleasant.

Soak cotton balls in a bowl of vanilla extract and set them out in the smelly room. Another option is to bake 2 to 3 tablespoons (29.6 to 44.4 ml) of vanilla extract in the oven for about 1 hour at 300ºF (148.9ºC). Not a fan of vanilla? Use extracts like almond, orange, coconut, or anise instead."
