      "content": "Download the Tinder app. Tinder is one of the most popular dating apps at the moment. It makes dating easier and fast, as you get to pick from the people near you and know pretty quickly if they could have any interest in getting to know you. You \"swipe\" people you're matched with and select those who meet the preferences you set for age, distance radius, gender, and so forth. Swiping left means you're not interested; swiping right means you are. You have to let the app have access to your Facebook account, although it will not publish things on your wall. It will allow the app to go through your photos and help you set your profile. You'll get to chose your discovery preferences, which include the radius in which you'd like to swipe that is up to 100 miles and the age range. The most common age range on Tinder is 18-24, but there are people on the site of all age ranges. [1] X Research source"

The left-most dot controls your minimum desired age range, and the right-most dot controls your maximum desired age range. So, if your current age range is 20-30 and you would like to include matches up to 35, slide the right-most dot towards the right until the numbers display 20-35.

If you are 30 and want to date, try to adjust the Tinder age around or above your age.

If you are under 18 you will only be able to see ages 13-17 max. The lower limit is the first white bubble, and the upper limit is the second white bubble. Your age range is every age in between them. Slide each of these bubbles with your fingertip to control the minimum and maximum ages that will appear on your Tinder. If you're underage, you can't see adults. If you're an adult, you can't find underage people."
