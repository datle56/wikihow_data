You can purchase brand items second hand online [2] X Research source , though you can also find items locally if you are careful. Mainstream stores are unlikely to have dresses or skirts that are full enough to fit a petticoat; while it is possible to find blouses that can work in these stores, it's important that they cover your shoulders, have no cut-outs, and are not cropped nor low-cut. If you wish, you may create and sew your own lolita clothing. Check out second-hand stores for good deals on accessories and shoes. Check for lacy vintage tops, vests, and mary janes. Additionally, you can try to find jewelry to match your existing pieces. Check here for cheaper options. How to Be a Budget Lolita.

      "content": "Find matching pieces. Lolita outfits are called coordinates, or coords, because everything in each outfit is carefully matched to the rest of the outfit. It's about looking elegant with a Victorian, Rococo, and/or Edwardian influence. Based on your preference, the look can be either cute or elegant or a mix of both. The most common type of lolita blouse is a button-down shirt with a peter-pan collar, which is a round type of collar. Remember that lolita is a modest fashion- high collars, sleeves, and layers are necessary to properly pull off the look. Think elegance and modesty."

      "content": "Achieve the lolita silhouette. Common lolita skirt or dress shapes are the cupcake, bell, and A-line. [3] X Research source Petticoats/panniers are nearly always necessary to achieve the lolita silhouette, [4] X Research source while bloomers are also often used to add volume, modesty, and sometimes warmth to the outfit. A lolita skirt should be approximately knee-length, though a bit below or above is acceptable. If a skirt is particularly short (more than 4-5\" above the knee) it's often best to consider an underskirt to make it longer. Make sure that your petticoat is the right shape! A square-dancing petticoat will not fit under a bell-shaped skirt correctly; you need a bell-shaped petticoat for a bell-shaped skirt."

Sheer tights are sometimes thought to be too \"sexy\" for lolita, and ankle socks aren't always fitting for the style (though short socks with lace at the top edge can make a nice accent when worn over tights)."

Rocking-horse shoes often feature a curved front and a part cut-out of the back."

      "content": "Consider a more masculine lolita look. While lolita is often thought to be pretty whimsical, some looks incorporate traditionally masculine styles. Ouji (prince), is a more masculine related style. It does not involve the iconic petticoats and skirts of lolita. Instead, short capri-style pants that cut off at the knee and usually have details on them such as lace-edged cuffs or ruffles are worn. Kodona, or \"boy style,\" is similar to Ouji, in that pants are exchanged for petticoats, but shorts or pumpkin shorts are worn instead of pants, and mini top hats are more common than top hats in this style. Kodona focuses on cuteness rather than a princely appearance. Other common additions to your look are suspenders, ties, vests, and long socks. The more extravagant styles can include things like spats, canes, top hats, and other Victorian accessories."

Sometimes the language in this subculture can be difficult to type out or say efficiently so there are a lot of abbreviations. There are also a number of Japanese loanwords and style-specific terms. Here are some of the most common: OP = One Piece (dress with sleeves) JSK = Jumperskirt (a dress with straps, no sleeves) SK = Skirt (a heckin' lolita skirt) Cutsew = a pieced cotton shirt- not as fancy as a blouse, often knit. OTT = Over The Top (referring to how a style is executed in a way that is described as extravagant. The person may be wearing a lot of hair clips or have an especially fancy coordinate.) \"Brand\" = Refers to popular lolita brands. Motif = This refers to a reoccurring subject of the dress or coordinate. Ex: apples, breakfast, or Alice in Wonderland. Comm = Community (of lolitas or fans of alternate fashion in general) Concrit = Constructive criticism (the only type of criticism that is helpful to you) Coord = An outfit (short for coordinate) Kawaii = This is the Japanese word for cute. Usually, kawaii is used instead of cute when referring to a specific style originating in Japan. Be careful using this word, it can be cringe-inducing. Best to just use it as a search term.

Brolita = Usually a cis male lolita. This term is inaccurate and outdated because a male lolita is simply a lolita. Try not to use this term. Lace Monster = A coordinate with excessive and/or cheap lace. Also not nice to use, so please refrain from using it even if you see others doing so. Here's a link to tell if your lace is cheap.
