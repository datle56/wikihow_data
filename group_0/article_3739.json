      "content": "Set ambitious but realistic goals. Throughout history, individual activists have helped topple empires, liberate the oppressed, and open minds to new ideas. And today, even teens can improve their local neighborhoods or build social equality movements through their own efforts. [2] X Research source If you want to achieve something, it’s important to be specific about what you want to see happen and how you can really get there. A good tip for making goals is to \"think global act local\". Basically, you should know how you will benefit the whole world, but you should do the action in your own community. For example, if you want to reduce carbon dioxide, make a change to stop emitting too much carbon dioxide yourself. For instance, while halting human-caused climate change is a noble goal, it’s too broad to be directly actionable. You can, however, advocate for tougher emissions standards for vehicles and industries in your area."

      "content": "Join (or start) an organization that supports your cause. If you share a passion for the same cause as many other activists, you can probably find one or many existing organizations to join. These could be anything from a student club to a national organization (like the American Civil Liberties Union or the National Organizers Alliance). Most activist organizations offer different levels of involvement. So you can do whatever you feel most comfortable with, whether that means attending meetings and demonstrations, making phone calls to your local representatives, or just donating a little money when you can. Or, you can set up your own activist organization, whether it be a recycling club at school or an anti-racism group online. It’s okay to start small."

If they are interested, share literature about your cause or just talk to them about what you have learned. If you do volunteer work, invite an interested friend or family member to volunteer with you. If you’re not sure how to begin, start by coming up with a list of five friends or family members you feel you can talk to about your cause. Think about how you would feel most comfortable approaching them (e.g., over email, over the phone, or in-person), and reach out to them in the way that feels right to you. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Lead by example. One of the simplest and most important forms of activism is practicing what you believe in, or “conscious activism.” Practicing conscious activism means incorporating activism into your everyday life by living and acting in ways that directly support your cause (e.g., reducing your carbon footprint, using sustainably produced products, and so on). For example, if you are interested in minimizing animal cruelty, you can start by not using products made from animals (like fur or leather) and avoiding businesses that exploit animals (like circuses or SeaWorld)."

Some will never be persuaded no matter what evidence you provide, but others may be willing to listen to reason, thoughtful explanations. [9] X Research source Appealing to others’ emotions (“This product is harmful to our children’s health!”) works best when supported by evidence (“Check out the following scientific studies…”).

There are numerous websites and social media platforms that house petitions, including change.org and petitions.whitehouse.gov. To drum up support for a petition: Establish a clear, specific, and realistic goal — “Protect the wooded area adjacent to Veterans' Park from development.” Personalize the cause by telling your story — “I, like many kids in this area, developed an appreciation for nature by walking through those woods.” Mix online and offline efforts.
