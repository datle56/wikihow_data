      "content": "Talk to your medical professional. Having a safe pregnancy is important to a healthy birth and baby. As certified obstetrician and gynecologist Jennifer Butt says, making sure you’re getting proper obstetrical care from a doctor, nurse practitioner, or midwife can help ensure that your pregnancy is progressing normally. [3] X Expert Source Jennifer Butt, MD Board Certified Obstetrician & Gynecologist Expert Interview. 13 March 2020. Along with this, they’ll be able to tell you if it’s safe for you to check your cervix for dilation. Be aware that beginning in your ninth month of pregnancy, your doctor will begin looking for signs that your labor is getting closer. This includes palpitating your abdomen and performing an internal exam to check your cervix. They will see if the baby has “dropped,” which means that the cervix has begun to dilate and get softer. Ask your doctor any questions you may have, including if the baby has dropped. You should also ask if it is safe to check dilation on your own. If your pregnancy is safe, then you can proceed. Warning: While it’s possible to check your cervix for dilation yourself, it isn’t medically advised and could pose a risk to you and your child, so it’s best to go to the doctor.

As Butt explains, checking your cervix requires inserting a hand or fingers into your vagina. [5] X Expert Source Jennifer Butt, MD Board Certified Obstetrician & Gynecologist Expert Interview. 13 March 2020. It’s imperative to your health and that of your unborn baby to wash your hands before you check your cervix for dilation. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Use soap and warm water to clean your hands. Wet your hands with running water and apply your soap, lathering well. Rub your hands vigorously for at least 20 seconds, making sure to scrub each surface of your hands. Rinse off the soap and then dry your hands thoroughly. Use a hand sanitizer of at least 60% alcohol if you don’t have soap. Apply enough of the sanitizer for both hands to the palm of one hand. Just as with soap, rub your hands together and cover every surface. Keep rubbing until your hands are dry."

      "content": "Get into a comfortable position. Before you can effectively check your cervix for dilation, you need to be in a comfortable position. You might want to sit on your toilet or lie on your bed with your legs spread, just do what is most comfortable for you. If you're very pregnant, consider sitting on the toilet with one foot on the floor and the other propped up on the toilet seat. [7] X Research source Take off your clothes on your lower half before you start. This way, you don’t have to awkwardly remove them when you’re comfy. Sit or squat on the toilet with one foot on the floor and the other on the toilet seat. You can also squat on the floor or lie on your bed if these are more comfortable Remember that you have nothing about which to be ashamed. You’re doing something completely normal and natural."

      "content": "Insert two fingers into your vagina. You’ll need to start your exam by getting an initial sense of how far you may be dilated. Instead of putting your entire hand into your vagina, which may cause discomfort, use your pointer and middle fingers to start checking your cervix. [8] X Research source Locate the entrance of your vagina with the tips of your fingers. The back of your hand should be facing your spine, and your palm should face upwards. Angle your fingers back towards your anus to most effectively feel your cervix. If you feel any pain or extreme discomfort, remove your fingers. Remember to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before inserting your fingers into your vagina."

      "content": "Push your fingers to your cervix. A cervix feels like a pair of puckered lips when pregnant. After you’ve inserted your fingers into and up your vaginal canal, keep pushing them until you reach what feels like puckered lips. [9] X Research source Be aware that some people have a high cervix while others have a low one. You may need to insert your fingers further up your vaginal canal, or you might reach it relatively quickly. The cervix is basically the “end” of your vaginal canal, no matter its position. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Use a gentle touch to feel for your cervix. Pressing or poking it with your fingers can lead to bleeding. Recognize that one finger may easily slip into the middle of your cervix if it is dilating. You may feel the bag of water covering the baby's head at the center of the opening, which may have the sensation of a latex balloon filled with water."

[11] X Research source If one of your fingers entered the middle of the cervix easily, you can use additional fingers to figure out how far along you’re dilated. Continue to insert fingers gently into your vagina until you’re using your entire hand, or it causes discomfort. Remove your hand to see how many finger widths you used. This can give you a general idea of how far your cervix is dilated. Keep in mind the following: If you can slip one finger into the middle of your cervix, you’re about one centimeter dilated. Likewise, if you can insert two fingers, you’re 3 centimeters dilated. [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

Be aware that your contractions can also help indicate that you should go to the delivery center. They will be more regular and stronger. They should be about five minutes apart and last for 45-60 seconds. [14] X Research source"

This can be especially helpful if you are in pain or discomfort. Most people will make some type of sound when they’re in labor. Listening to what types of sounds you’re making can cue you into how much your cervix has dilated. The following sounds can accompany the various stages of labor and cervical dilation: [15] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source At 0-4 centimeters dilated, you may not make much noise and can talk through a contraction with little effort. At 4-5 centimeters, it may be difficult to nearly impossible to talk. Your noises may still be quiet. Between 5-7 centimeters, you may make louder and staccato noises. It should be nearly or completely impossible to talk through contractions. Between 7-10 centimeters, you may be making very loud noises and unable to talk through a contraction. If you’re a silent laborer, you can also check your dilation. Tell someone to ask you a question at the start of a contraction. The less you can say a sentence, the farther along your dilation is."

If you notice a change in the smell of the room where you’re laboring, your cervix may be between 6 and 8 centimeters dilated. Keep in mind that this isn’t a scientifically proven sign; however, some mothers note that it was present during their active stage of labor."

At 6-8 centimeters dilated, however, a lot of blood and mucus may be present. Looking for these substances can indicate that you’re somewhere between 6-8 centimeters dilated.

[19] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Recognize that in the early stages of labor, the purple line will be closer to the anus. As your labor progresses, it will creep up between your buttocks. At full dilation, the purple line will extend to the top of your natal cleft."

The more you dilate, the farther down your back the pressure will be. It generally moves from the rim of your pelvis down to your tailbone. [20] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This is often felt during “laboring down,” a practice that delays pushing for one to two hours after the second stage of labor begins to allow the body to naturally do more of the work. Some studies suggest that delayed pushing could put the mother and child at risk."
