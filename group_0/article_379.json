      "title": "Act cool and stay aloof.",
      "content": "Act cool and stay aloof. Sasuke is calm, cold, indifferent, cruel, cynical, a bit sarcastic and somewhat arrogant. [2] X Research source In other words, he’s got a cool superiority about him that comes from his confidence and power. If you want to act like Sasuke, you want to exude a sense of that superiority. [3] X Research source In general, when people approach you, don't give the time of day, even if it's your best friend, or a romantic interest. They are so much below you in skill and knowledge, you should act like you're bored by their presence."

      "title": "Keep a chip on your shoulder.",
      "content": "Keep a chip on your shoulder. Sasuke has something to prove, and always seems to be dwelling on some inferiority complex. He’s unwilling to acknowledge when someone is stronger than him, and obsesses when it becomes clear that he may be outmatched. Start cultivating a grim and serious demeanor. Go on long contemplative walks like Sasuke does. Scowl while you do it. Try to stop laughing at jokes, or at little trifles. Sasuke is deadly serious at all times, making it important that you focus on the gravity of life and the most important things. No time for jokes!"

    {
      "title": "Be smart.",
      "content": "Be smart. You are smart, and you know it. Show people that you are smarter than them. Sasuke is hailed as a genius, even by the battle-adept Uchiha clan's standards, excelling at all that he does and finding little difficulty in more challenging tasks. Try to learn everything easily, and be the top on your class. Study hard, especially the serious subjects like history and literature. Study the great works and commit to being a warrior monk, able to quote poetry at length and do battle in equal measure."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be quiet.",
      "content": "Be quiet. Sasuke rarely talks, but when he does, he keeps it brief and to the point. Start buttoning up some and you might notice the same thing happen. If you're less likely to talk, when you do choose to speak, make sure it's to the point and serious, and you'll quickly get a reputation as a person to be listened to. When you do speak, speak clearly and confidently and make pauses between sentences, for more effect. You must not look uncertain when you speak, just say what you mean and mean what you say. Don't stop in the middle or start fading your voice. Confidence shows that whatever you are talking you mean it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Depend on yourself.",
      "content": "Depend on yourself. Difficult challenges, easy tasks, big goals: whatever you've got on your plate, try to do it yourself without asking for help from others. Sasuke views help as a sign of weakness, and wants very much to be seen as a leader, like someone who is to be trusted, and capable. He does not take orders kindly, a sign of his self-reliance. Don't look to others to validate your pride and your confidence in yourself. Sasuke's favorite word is \"power\" (力, chikara). So, try to gain it, in everything you stumble upon. Find your inner light and your inner strength and use that as your source of confidence, not the opinions of others. Please yourself. Be sexy. You have a load of self-confidence and you show it. Be yourself and definitely don't flirt with that goofball blonde."

      "title": "Perfect Sasuke’s famous Death Glare.",
      "content": "Perfect Sasuke’s famous Death Glare. If Sasuke's resting face is a scowl, the Death Glare is there to let you know when he's getting really intense. It's basically just a scowl with a million percent more intensity. Learning to pull off a great Death Glare [4] X Research source is essential to any good Sasuke impression or impersonation. Tighten your brow and arch your eyebrows dramatically to scowl, then open your eyes and stare with great intensity, as if you're trying to bore a hole through the wall with your sheer power of will."

    {
      "title": "Wear blue and black.",
      "content": "Wear blue and black. Sasuke is typically adorned in dark blue and black clothes, usually loose fitting comfortable garments that allow full range of motions. Ninja clothes, in other words. If you want to get a good Sasuke wardrobe together, a loose fitting blue tunic with a V-neck would be a perfect top, while some baggy pajama-style pants of a dark blue color would pair nicely. A rope belt and headband would complete the look."

      "title": "Give yourself a 'duck' hair-do.",
      "content": "Give yourself a 'duck' hair-do. Sasuke has a classic manga hair style, with long emo-like bangs in the front and spiked hair in the back. Grow your hair out a bit, if it's short, to give yourself more to work with, and practice spiking your hair with mousse or hairspray. It'll take a considerable amount of product to get your hair to look like Sasuke's is drawn. If you want a slightly tamer version, keep your hair short in the back and grow out your bangs, sweeping them to the side of your face. Sometimes called the \"swoop bangs\" or \"emo hair,\" this look is closely linked to the manga look."

      "title": "Take care of your skin",
      "content": "Take care of your skin . Pale and penetrating, Sasuke's face is like a chunk of ivory. Try to minimize your exposure to the sun and maintain healthy skin with moisturizer, and medicated acne soap, if necessary, to help reduce blemishes."

    {
      "title": "Get in shape",
      "content": "Get in shape . Increase your tolerance, endurance and stamina level with aerobic exercise. In a near-blind, battered, and visibly exhausted state from his fight with Danzō, Sasuke still had enough stamina to fight against Kakashi, restrain and disarm Sakura, and later match Naruto's Rasengan with his Chidori. Getting in good fighting shape is essential to a good Sasuke impression. Yoga, aerobics, strength-training are all excellent ways of getting in shape for a Sasuke vibe. Try to find a Cross-Fit style total-body workout that you can do a few times a week to get into a healthy weight and improve your stamina. These workouts combine strength training and aerobic exercise, helping to build muscle, burn fat, and improve your cardiovascular health."

      "title": "Learn to speak Japanese",
      "content": "Learn to speak Japanese . Really want to take your Sasuke to the next level? Learn some Japanese. Even learning a few phrases of Sasuke's language will set you above other impersonators and cosplayers, as well as open up whole new ways of experiencing Naruto. Who knows what might happen if you become fluent!"

    {
      "title": "Study a martial art",
      "content": "Study a martial art . Learning to defend yourself with martial arts will help you become more disciplined, centered, and in touch with your body. The martial arts have much less to do with fighting and more to do with learning about kinetic motion, movement, and fluidity. Whether you want to study karate , ninjitsu, or tae-kwon-do, getting a fundamental study of martial arts under your belt will help you become more like Sasuke. The seriousness and meditativeness of martial arts may also center you and improve your impression of Sasuke from an attitude perspective."

    {
      "title": "Study swordsmanship",
      "content": "Study swordsmanship . Sasuke is an expert swordsman, lethal and versatile, possessing powerful strikes with equally impressive speed and precision behind them. Learning to use a sword and studying the art of moving with a blade can be a powerful experience and form to study. Swordsmanship is a skill that requires lifelong practice and dedication. You're not going to pick it up in an afternoon, and playing around with sharp swords is a good way to injure yourself seriously. Study swords in a professional environment, and never use a sharp sword if you don't know what you're doing."

      "title": "Practice being ambidextrous",
      "content": "Practice being ambidextrous . While it's somewhat difficult to become purely ambidextrous, if you weren't born that way, you can improve your ability to use both hands and both feet with lots of practice. Practice being physical and versatile on your dominant as well as your weak side. Although he leads with his right, Sasuke uses his Chidori with his left, making him unpredictable. Practice writing with both hands, seeing if you can get your \"weak\" hand as strong and as clear as your \"strong\" hand."

    {
      "title": "Eat healthy and light foods.",
      "content": "Eat healthy and light foods. Sasuke is often seen 'eating healthy.' Sasuke's favorite food are Rice Balls, Skip-jack Tuna and Tomatoes, while his least favorites are Soybeans and anything sweet. If you've got a sweet-tooth, try curbing it in favor of lighter fare. Snack on some carrot sticks instead of candy, or try out some sushi for dinner instead of eating that burger. Think light."

    {
      "title": "Speak like Sasuke.",
      "content": "Speak like Sasuke. Learning some good Sasuke quotations and one-liners is a good way of making sure everyone knows who you're supposed to be. Lower your voice, don your Death Glare, and speak one of the following lines: \"My name is Sasuke Uchiha. I hate a lot of things, and I don't particularly like anything. What I have is not a dream, because I will make it a reality. I'm going to restore my clan, and destroy a certain someone.\" \"If you think I'm just a foolish kid ruled by his emotions, that's fine. Following Itachi's path would be childish, the whispering of fools who don't know hatred. If anyone else tries to ridicule the way I live, I'll slaughter everyone they ever cared about. And then maybe they'll understand what it's like to taste… a little of my hatred.\" “There is no question that you are special... unfortunately you're not quite as special as I am!\" \"With my hatred ... I'll turn the illusion into reality!\" \"I am on a path the rest of you can't follow... \" \"I have long since closed my eyes... My only goal is in the darkness.\""
