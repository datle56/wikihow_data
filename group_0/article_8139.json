      "content": "Test the substance with water to confirm that it’s white mold. Put some water in a spray bottle. Spray the substance and observe whether or not it dissolves. If it doesn’t dissolve, it’s probably white mold. If it does dissolve, it is another substance, such as efflorescence. White mold can be confused with efflorescence, a mineral deposit caused by water seepage. White mold is usually found in cool and damp areas, such as basement walls. It appears white or light gray, like a coating of unsettled dust. Closer inspection under good lighting will reveal a fungal growth pattern of spots like tiny mushrooms.

      "content": "Turn off the HVAC system if there are signs of contamination. Look for mold near the intake for your heating/ventilation/air conditioning system. Check inside the air ducts for a musty smell or visible mold growth. [3] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source If you don’t find any of these signs, and no one in your household has unexplained symptoms, illness or allergies, your air ducts are probably not contaminated. If you suspect or find signs of contamination in your HVAC system, don’t run it until you have the air ducts cleaned.

      "content": "Call a professional mold removal service for serious mold growth. Consult with a professional if there’s a strong odor, damage from contaminated water, and/or areas of mold larger than ten square feet (three meters), approximately three feet by three feet (91 cm by 91 cm). [5] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source The area may need to be sealed off with plastic sheeting, while the HVAC is closed and sealed. For instance, a potent, moldy odor could mean there is unseen mold growth under flooring, behind walls or beneath baseboards. Read online reviews or get a referral for a qualified mold remediation contractor. You may be able to obtain a free estimate and report on what services are needed. If you hire a contractor, check their references first and ask them to follow current EPA recommendations or other professional guidelines."

Absorbent materials like carpet and ceiling tile with visible mold growth will be difficult or impossible to thoroughly clean, so you may want to replace them. Hard surfaces can usually be scrubbed with soapy water.
