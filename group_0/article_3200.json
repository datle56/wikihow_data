      "content": "Join a reputable escort agency if you’re new to the industry. Working for a reputable escort agency gives you a much stronger sense of safety and security than working on your own. Look online, talk to other escorts, or contact your local sex worker advocacy group for agency recommendations. Visit several different agencies and ask any questions you may have before you sign up so that you find one that suits you. [1] X Research source Although the agency will take a portion of your income, the advantages of being safe, having your bookings handled, and having your clients screened first all outweigh the cost. A reputable agency will respect your limits and boundaries, provide a safe and hygienic working environment, and will be willing to answer any questions you may have. Reputable agencies will also provide security at the establishment. If possible, it can also help to talk to an escort who works there to get another perspective."

      "content": "Pick a first and last name for your escort identity. Having a unique name helps to advertise your services effectively and to protect your true identity. Before you settle on a name, check online first that there are no other local escorts using the same name to avoid any confusion and miscommunication. Use the same name throughout all of your advertising platforms to maintain consistency. You will often be allowed to use a fake name for sexual health procedures so that you can stay anonymous. This helps to further protect your identity and to maintain your privacy. Some first names for escorts are quite common, so it's a good idea to have a last name too so that your clients can recognize you."

      "content": "Set up online profiles to advertise your services. Escorts often do all of their own marketing and advertising. Use a search engine to find the escort websites that are prominent in your region or country. Sign up to the websites and then write up a short statement about yourself that's warm and approachable. Try to advertise with multiple escorting websites to increase your marketing reach. [2] X Research source Some websites may require a physical description of yourself with different body measurements such as clothing size. Whether or not your profile can include the services that you offer depends on the laws in your region."

Look for professional photography services online or ask for recommendations from other escorts. Then contact the photographer and arrange for a session. Before your session, decide whether you are comfortable showing your face in your photos or not. [3] X Research source Your agency may be able to provide you with professional photos. It's recommended that you get your photos taken by a professional, as they know what lighting, angles, and photography styles to use to portray the image that you want."

      "content": "Find out the laws in your region or country before you begin working. The laws and regulations about escorting differ between locations, which can result in large differences within the industry. In some areas, prostitution is illegal but other types of escorting such as companionship are legal. Contact your local escort or sex worker advocacy group for specific information about your region. Ask for information about your rights at the same time so that you are prepared to work in the industry. For example, the services that you can offer, where you can work, and what information you have to disclose to police on request depends entirely on your location. [4] X Research source"

In some locations, you are only allowed to provide escorting services if you have applied for and received a business license. Find out through your local escort or sex worker advocacy group if you need a licence to work in your location. Contact your governmental business licensing authority and fill out the application form. Then submit the application form and wait for a response before you begin working.

Find tax information such as how much to pay and when on your government website. In most situations, declare your income at the end of the tax year and pay the income tax at the specified rate. It can be helpful to work with an accountant if you need help paying your taxes. Alternatively, contact an escort or sex worker advocacy group in your area to get the best tax advice for your location. Even if escorting is illegal in your location, it’s still recommended that you pay your taxes to avoid any penalties."

      "content": "Dress professionally and arrive on time to meet clients. Regardless of the type of escorting services that you provide, providing a professional service is key. If you are attending an event with a client, make sure that you ask what the dress code is first so that you know what sort of attire is appropriate to wear. Whether you are meeting the client at their home or in a public space, make sure that you have planned your travel arrangements well in advance so that you aren’t late. For females, long or knee-length dresses are usually best for high rise events. If the event is more casual, try a halter or backless dress. For males, a collared shirt is a good option for most events."

      "content": "Maintain a polite, professional conduct at all times. How you treat your clients plays a big part in your success as a professional escort. Be courteous, polite, and warm with every client, yet remember to also remain assertive and in control of the situation. Try to build rapport with your clients so that they are more likely to work with you again. Another important part of building a good relationship with your clients is simply listening to them. Many clients will just want to talk and to enjoy spending time with you, with other services having a less important role."

      "content": "Take payments upfront before you begin working. With any escorting service, it’s important that you are paid before you begin working. Request the payment straight after introducing yourself to the client. You can either take cash or credit payments depending on what you feel comfortable with. If the client does not have the payment or refuses to pay you, leave straight away. It’s best not to wait until after you have finished working, as otherwise, the client may reveal that they don’t have money to pay you."

      "title": "Remain assertive with your clients and specify your boundaries.",
      "content": "Remain assertive with your clients and specify your boundaries. It’s important to be entirely transparent about your boundaries with every client before you begin working.

Always stick to your own rules and limits, and never let yourself be persuaded or controlled by a client. Never be afraid to say no to a client and always remember that you are the one who has the final say."

Always use either male or female condoms depending on the type of service you are offering and use lubricant to help prevent the condoms from breaking. Before you work with any client, do a quick visual examination to check for any signs of STIs such as genital swelling, rashes, or discharge. Some escort agencies will screen and check your clients for STIs before you work with them."

Attend sexual health checks at your local sexual health clinic or doctor’s office and follow any necessary treatment plans. Getting checked 3-4 times per year is only a recommendation. Each escort agency will usually have a specific requirement for how often you need to get tested. Sexual health checks usually involve blood tests and swab tests."

If you are having serious problems with your mental health that you are struggling to deal with on your own, contact your local sex worker advocacy group for support."

      "title": "Leave any situation immediately if you feel unsafe.",
      "content": "Leave any situation immediately if you feel unsafe. If a client’s behavior is abusive, threatening, or violent, leave the situation as soon as you can safely do so. Contact your agency and your local police authority immediately. Similarly, if a client refuses to wear protection, leave the situation. Although you need to reimburse the client’s payment if you leave, it’s best to lose some money and to get yourself safely out of a dangerous situation. If you work for an agency, there will usually be a bouncer at the establishment who has been hired to help protect you."
