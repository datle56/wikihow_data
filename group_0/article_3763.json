It helps if you have experience working with vehicles, either as a dealer or a mechanic, but it's not mandatory. [1] X Trustworthy Source US Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. government agency that collects and reports labor-related information Go to source While the batteries and motors are electric in an EV, a lot of the underlying principles are the same when it comes to electronic and traditional vehicles. That’s where the automotive experience helps."

      "content": "You need EV training and experience to become a pro mechanic. You have a lot of options for getting the background and training you need to work in this field. EV mechanics are in high demand, so you may not need to earn a college degree or certification to get started. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Sign up for an EV training program at a trade school. There are electronic vehicle training programs at trade schools where you’ll learn everything you need to know about working on EVs. These intensive programs could be anywhere between 2 to 24 weeks long. This route is usually the fastest way to get qualified and find work in the field. [3] X Research source The Universal Technical Institute is a popular trade school that has an electric vehicle technician training program. Training programs typically cost at least a few hundred dollars; it depends a lot on how long and in-depth they are. EV manufacturers usually offer their own specialized courses to train mechanics on their vehicles. These programs are often free, but you typically need to be licensed mechanic to take them.

If you want an in-depth education as an EV technician, enroll at a local community college that offers a degree in electronic vehicle technology. These programs take 1-2 years to complete, and you’ll learn everything you need to know to become an EV technician. [5] X Research source If you’re passionate about cars and you want to be qualified to work on anything and everything with 4 wheels, double major in automotive technology and EV technology!

      "content": "Look into internships or apprenticeships to skip the classroom. If you’re new to the field and you know you want to work as an EV mechanic but you want on-site training, look for an internship/apprenticeship with an EV manufacturer, mechanic, or dealer near you. Read the qualifications on postings carefully to see if you can find something that offers on-site training. [8] X Research source Many internships and apprenticeships are paid positions. There's such a huge need for EV technicians that these companies will bend over backwards to get you into the field."

As the market shifts from gas to electric vehicles, these companies need to train a ton of new technicians. If you can get your foot in the door at a dealership for a company that sells hybrids or EV vehicles, it's likely that you'll eventually be trained to work on EVs. [9] X Research source Audi, BMW, Ford, Volkswagen, GM, Nissan, Hyundai, Volvo, and Mercedes-Benz all sell EVs in addition to their traditional ICE vehicles."

      "content": "It’s not mandatory, but the ASE certification will set you apart. Taking the initiative to earn your ASE shows your potential employers that you are serious about an automotive career, and continuing education is always needed in this field. Once you have at least 2 years of professional experience as a mechanic, you can become ASE certified through the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellent, a nonprofit that issues specialized certifications for vehicle mechanics. [10] X Research source Once you pass the A6 (automobile electrical systems) and A8 (engine performance) exams, take the L2, L3, and L4 exams to become certified in EV systems. [11] X Research source These tests are multiple choice and are available year-round. Register for an account and find a testing center near you by visiting ASE’s website . The L2 exam focuses on electronic diesel engine diagnostics. The L3 test covers hybrid and EV vehicle technology. The L4 exam deals with advanced driver assistance systems (i.e. autonomous driving)."

In this 16-week course, you’ll learn everything you need to know about working on Tesla’s vehicles. You will complete a combination of online courses, on-site training, and several exams. If you pass the course, you will be certified to work as a Tesla mechanic immediately! [12] X Research source START program students earn $9.46 an hour while they’re training. Once you graduate and work for Tesla, you’ll start off at roughly $25 an hour. [13] X Research source You will likely need to relocate after you graduate if you want to start working for Tesla right away. You can find more information and apply for the START program here . If you are not accepted for the START program, you can apply for the Pathway to START program, which is an 8-week pre-training course that qualifies you for START if you pass. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "No, this is a growing field that badly needs new technicians. With climate change and fossil fuel shortages on the horizon, electronic vehicles are the future. As EVs become cheaper and continue to become more popular, there will be a growing need for more technicians and mechanics. Dealers and EV manufacturers know this, so if you reach out and tell them you want to learn how to work on EVs, they’re likely to help you out. [15] X Research source This is why EV internships are often paid and training programs are often cheap (if not free). There is massive demand in this field, and so many mechanics out there know absolutely nothing about EVs."
