      "title": "Buy an indoor cage or outdoor hutch.",
      "content": "Buy an indoor cage or outdoor hutch. Some people like to let their rabbits roam freely in their home. This may not be an option for you, however. Either way, your rabbit will need a cage. This cage should be a place where it can be safe, and not interrupted. This cage should be at least 4 feet (1.2 m) by 2 feet (0.61 m). Your cage can have a plastic or wooden bottom, but wire will hurt your dwarf rabbit's feet. This cage should be filled about 2 inches (5.1 cm) deep with bedding. In the cage should be a litter box, a hideaway box, a food bowl, hay rack, and a water bottle for each rabbit. Having more than 1 of each item will help to prevent territorial conflict. Provide your rabbit with a supply of Timothy hay at all times and ensure it always has access to clean water. Rabbit pellets and alfalfa hay and vegetables should be given once a day according to the size, age, and weight of your bunnies."

      "title": "Build an exercise pen.",
      "content": "Build an exercise pen. You can put the pen outside if your lawn isn't fertilized and doesn't have other animals using it. Otherwise, you can designate an enclosed area in the house to let your dwarf rabbit play. However, if you build a pen indoors, you should read how to rabbit-proof your home. If you decide to have your rabbit outdoors for part of the day never leave it unattended. There are many predators that can easily get to it. Keep in mind that some exposure to sunlight can be good for your rabbit because the rabbit’s body will make vitamin D, which is crucial for strong bones. However, don’t leave your rabbit outside for too long in hot weather as it may get overheated."

      "title": "Put a litter box in its cage.",
      "content": "Put a litter box in its cage. Rabbits tend to urinate and defecate in the same area, rather than all over their living space. Put a litter box in its cage where you notice most of its urine and pills are located. This will keep its living space cleaner and will also make cleaning out the cage easier for you. Go with an organic litter option made from alfalfa, oat, citrus, or paper. Don’t use softwood shavings, as they can be harmful to your rabbit’s liver. Clean your rabbit’s litter box with vinegar. Your dwarf rabbit will use its litter box much more willingly if it's desexed and if the box is located somewhere private and protected. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Offer an unlimited supply of hay.",
      "content": "Offer an unlimited supply of hay. Hay is the main part of any rabbit's diet. Your dwarf rabbit should always have a fresh, unlimited supply of hay available to him at all times. Do not feed your rabbit alfalfa hay as it is bad for it. Feed it timothy hay or some kind of grass hay."

    {
      "title": "Feed your rabbit pellets daily.",
      "content": "Feed your rabbit pellets daily. Choose a good quality rabbit brand of pellets that doesn't contain extra seeds or sugar. Avoid muesli type rabbit pellets since your rabbit might pick out only its favorite bits and this may lead to a nutrient deficiency over time. You should feed 1/4 cup (15 grams) of pellets per 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of rabbit. Timothy hay is good for rabbits over 7 weeks old. Change out your rabbit’s food twice a day to keep it fresh."

    {
      "title": "Give your rabbit fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "content": "Give your rabbit fresh fruits and vegetables. Two cups (72 grams) a day of greens should be fed to your rabbit. A piece of carrot, apple (without seeds), banana, or strawberry are a great treat for your dwarf rabbit. Make sure you research what fruits and vegetables are safe for your rabbit to eat as some can be toxic."

      "content": "Use a litter that’s made for rabbits. This will likely be a grain-based or paper litter that comes in the form of pellets. Not only will the litter soak up your pet’s urine and feces, it will be appropriate for your rabbit to chew on sometimes. [2] X Research source You can find rabbit litter at a local pet store or online."

      "title": "Place the litter box where your rabbit already urinates.",
      "content": "Place the litter box where your rabbit already urinates. Your bunny will naturally pick a spot to urinate, so put the litter box in that location. Often, this will be in a corner that's far away from the bunny's food. If you put the litter box where your pet already goes potty, the rabbit will want to go in the box. [3] X Research source It’s helpful to have a litter box in the cage and in your rabbit’s play area. This encourages your bunny to always use a litter box. If your rabbit isn’t using the litter box, figure out where it’s going potty. Then, move the box to that location."

      "content": "Put a little bit of soiled bedding in the litter box at first. Scoop up some poop and urine and place it into the litter box. The soiled bedding will help your rabbit understand that urine goes in the box. It will smell the urine in the bedding and know that it’s okay to relieve itself in the litter box. [4] X Research source You just need a little bit of soiled bedding to trigger this response in your rabbit."

      "content": "Approach your rabbit slowly and get down low. In the wild, rabbits are prey animals, so they scare easily. Don’t surprise your rabbit or hover over it. Instead, get on its level and calmly move toward it. As you approach, speak to it in a calming voice so it knows you’re there. [5] X Research source Say, “Hi, bunny. It’s okay.”"

      "content": "Minimize how often you pick up your rabbit. Rabbits don’t particularly like being picked up, carried, or cuddled, so do these things as infrequently as possible. Your rabbit will most likely be jumpy, but may be willing to sit still on your lap after developing trust over time. When you do hold your rabbit, comfort it by supporting its back legs in one hand and softly pressing it against your chest with the other. Never pick your rabbit up by its ears.

      "content": "Put your hands under the rabbit’s belly and hindquarters when you pick it up. Make sure you’re supporting the hindquarters so that the rabbit doesn’t kick out. It’s natural for the rabbit to kick its legs out when you try to pick it up, but this motion can hurt the bunny’s spine, potentially causing a serious injury.

Different types of dwarf rabbits have different types of fur, so brushing may be optional or very important, depending on your dwarf rabbit’s fur. If your dwarf rabbit is longhaired, you’ll need to keep it clean and brush out the tangles regularly to protect your rabbit from catching diseases. If your rabbit’s fur is shorter, you should still brush it for comforting and bonding purposes.

Wrap the rabbit in a towel while you cut so that you can keep a good hold on it if it gets squirmy. If you’re unsure about how to go about cutting or how much to cut, make an appointment to have your vet do it. Your rabbit can get seriously hurt if you try to cut its nails without being educated on how to do so. Ask your vet to show you how before attempting to do it yourself. [15] X Research source Never attempt to cut your rabbit’s teeth if they get too long. You can severely injure your rabbit if you trim them too far.
