If you use an automated shipping service, it will total any taxes and customs duties for your customer when they put in their address, so they'll know exactly how much they'll pay for an item. [2] X Research source You can always lump in any customs duties with shipping and handling charges. This allows you to pass those costs onto the customer without them realizing it."

Taking care of any import duties owed means your customer will get the items they bought more quickly and not have to worry about paying import duties. [3] X Research source If you don't use automated shipping services, take the package to your local post office. They should be able to estimate the duties you'll owe for you based on the item, its location, and where you're sending the item."

If you've sold something that's one-of-a-kind or costs several thousand dollars, your customer will appreciate it if you offer courier service. Although these services can be expensive, they'll help your customer feel more secure and show that you're doing everything you can to protect your customer's purchase.

      "content": "Confirm that the shipment includes a detailed invoice. While you can't avoid import duties, the information on the invoice can keep you from paying too much. Ask the seller for a copy of the invoice to make sure they've included specific information about the items in the shipment (not just general categories), along with the number of units of each item and the total value of the items shipped. For example, instead of a single line that says \"computer parts,\" a correct international shipping invoice lists each part specifically along with the quantity of each one and the country where each part was produced. The country of origin for each item included in the shipment is important because items from some countries are duty-free. The country of origin may not be the same as the country where you purchased the items. For example, you might purchase items from a company in Italy that were actually made in Israel. Many online shipping services offer electronic trade documentation, which submits the required invoice to customs electronically so you don't have to worry about a paper invoice getting damaged or destroyed during shipping.
