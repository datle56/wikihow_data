      "content": "Wear rubber gloves when handling the bones. Throughout each step of the bone cleaning process, it’s important to wear gloves, as you’re working with bones, other animal matter, and tissue. This will help protect you from any viruses or bacteria the bones or tissue may contain, as well as from any harsh chemicals you use during the cleaning process. Be sure to throw the gloves away when you’re done with your project so the animal matter doesn’t contaminate anything else. [1] X Research source Even if the bones look old and clear of soft tissue, they may still carry diseases, so wear your gloves until you’ve properly cleaned them yourself. Depending on the stage of decomposition, it may be a good idea to wear a respiratory mask as well. Cleaning bones is a long and smelly process that can take several weeks or months. If possible, work outdoors in a well-ventilated area, preferably somewhere downwind of your windows and doors (and neighbors)."

      "title": "Remove any soft tissue.",
      "content": "Remove any soft tissue. Whether the specimen is fully or partially decomposed, most bones will need to be thoroughly cleaned of any soft tissue so they’re safe to handle and don’t smell. It’s best to let the material decompose naturally, either by burying the bones in the ground or by soaking them in water for several months. [2] X Research source To soak the bones, put the corpse in a plastic container with a lid or a garbage bag, then cover it with cold water to soften the tissue and tendons. Keep the container somewhere children, pets, and wild animals can’t access it and check on it monthly to see how it’s coming along. Burying the bones is less smelly, but often makes the decomposition process take longer. If possible, leave the corpse above-ground for a few days before burying it to attract flies and maggots that will eat the flesh. Then, bury the corpse and leave it alone for at least 3 months. If you’re burying an entire corpse, consider wrapping the animal in wire mesh to help keep all the bones together in one place. While these are often the best ways to remove soft tissue, there are plenty of other methods, as well. Check out the next section for other ways to clean bones."

      "title": "Scrub the bones with soapy water.",
      "content": "Scrub the bones with soapy water. Once all the soft tissue has been removed, fill a container with water and dish soap. If your bones are relatively small, scrub them with a toothbrush. If they’re larger, use a scrub brush . This will help remove any grease, oils, and odors that have collected on the bones during the decomposition process. [3] X Research source This step is called “degreasing.” Some bones will need more degreasing than others. For example, pigs, boars, bears, and possums produce a lot of oil and will likely need to be degreased. If your bones are yellow, clear, or shiny, they probably need to be degreased. Depending on the condition of the bones, some small bones, like teeth, may fall out during this process. Hold onto them so you can glue them back in after the bones are clean and dry.

      "content": "Soak the bones in fresh soapy water for 24 hours. The degreasing process isn’t over after you’ve scrubbed the bones clean. Fill another container large enough to contain the bones with clean water and dish soap. Submerge the bones for at least 24 hours to continue removing grease and oils. If a lot of grease collects at the surface, change the water and continue soaking the bones until they’re fully degreased. [5] X Research source Fat leaks out slowly, so repeat the scrubbing and soaking process until no grease remains. If you have the time, leave the bones in the soapy water for even longer, like 1-2 weeks."

      "title": "Soak the bones in hydrogen peroxide to whiten them.",
      "content": "Soak the bones in hydrogen peroxide to whiten them. Rinse the bones and place them in an empty bowl or container. Then, wearing gloves, add a 1:1 ratio of hydrogen peroxide and water until the bones are entirely submerged. For best results, use a hydrogen peroxide with a concentration of at least 20-30% . Cover the container with a lid and let the bones soak for up to 24 hours. If you’re happy with the whiteness, take them out, rinse them, and let them dry. [6] X Research source The water will start to bubble and foam, which lets you know that the hydrogen is working. Hydrogen peroxide with a concentration over 20% is considered laboratory grade, so it may be difficult to obtain if you’re just cleaning bones as a hobby. In that case, a hair developer with 12% hydrogen peroxide will also work. Regular 3% hydrogen peroxide can work as well, though it typically takes a lot longer to whiten the bones. If the bones aren’t white enough after 24 hours, change out the hydrogen peroxide mixture and soak them for another 24 hours. If your bones are particularly large, it would take a lot of hydrogen peroxide to fill a container big enough to hold them. As an alternative, mix 1 cup (160 g) of baking soda and a bit of hydrogen peroxide to create a thick paste. Wearing your gloves, use an old toothbrush to apply the past to the bone. Let it sit for 24 hours, then rinse. Never use bleach to whiten bones. Bleach will destroy the bones and leave them brittle and flaky."

      "title": "Leave the bones outside to dry for several days.",
      "content": "Leave the bones outside to dry for several days. Never put bones on a radiator or other heat source because the extreme heat can cause them to become brittle and crack. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Instead, place them outside away from direct sunlight and anything that would disturb them. Depending on their size, it may take several days for them to dry completely, so check on them every day or so to see how they’re coming along. If your bones still look “dirty” after you take them out of the water and hydrogen peroxide, don’t worry, as this is completely normal. Once they dry, they should be the right color. If you can’t leave the bones outside due to the weather, set them on newspaper in an out-of-the-way area. If any teeth or small bones fell out during the cleaning process, use a small amount of white glue to glue them back in place after they’re dry. [8] X Research source If the bones are large or the white glue doesn’t seem to be strong enough, super glue will also work. If you notice any remaining soft tissue in tiny crevices, use tweezers or another small apparatus to remove it. Be sure to dispose of the tissue afterwards."

      "content": "Store your bones in a cool, dry area. Once your bones are dry, they’re ready to display. There isn’t an exact temperature at which you need to store them, but it should be relatively cool and shouldn’t fluctuate too much. Rapidly changing temperatures and high humidity can cause bones to swell and shrink repeatedly, which can eventually cause them to crumble. [9] X Research source Display your bones on a shelf, in a box, or by mounting it on the wall. They also make great gifts. If you’re feeling creative, turn small bones into jewelry. People even sell bones and skulls for a fair amount of money. Small raccoon skulls can sometimes go for as much as $85, depending on their condition."

      "content": "Let the body decay naturally above ground for 2-3 months. If you live in the country or away from people who would be disturbed by the smell, an easy way to remove the soft tissue is to leave the body alone for several months while it decomposes. If possible, put up a wire perimeter around it to keep other animals from scavenging it. Check the corpse once per month to see how the decomposition is progressing. Once most of the skin and meat is gone, simmer the bones to get the rest of the natural matter to fall away. [10] X Research source Depending on the time of year, it could take upwards of 6 months for a corpse to decompose, which is why it’s a good idea to check it once a month. Note: While these methods do a good job of cleaning the bones, they will likely still need to be degreased with dish soap and water, then whitened with hydrogen peroxide."

      "title": "Remove small amounts of tissue with biological washing powder.",
      "content": "Remove small amounts of tissue with biological washing powder. This is a great way to clean bones that you find out in nature that are already mostly clear of soft tissue. Biological washing powder contains enzymes that break down things like fat, skin, and ligaments. Put your bones in a plastic container, cover them with warm water, then add a small scoop of biological powder. Leave the bones alone for 3-4 days, then rinse them off thoroughly. [11] X Research source Use this method to clean off any residual tissue no matter what condition the corpse was in when you first found it. Buy biological washing powder from a local grocery store (usually in the laundry aisle) or online."

      "title": "Simmer the bones in water to quickly remove soft tissue.",
      "content": "Simmer the bones in water to quickly remove soft tissue. This is another smelly option, but it gets the job done faster than most other methods. Put your bones in a large pot and cover them with water. Bring the water to a simmer—not a boil—and leave the bones alone until the flesh falls away. This usually takes 12-24 hours, so make sure you can withstand the smell for that long. [12] X Research source Be careful to not burn yourself—use tongs to remove the bones from the hot water. Dump the water outdoors rather than down your sink. Never put bones in boiling water. This causes the fat to soak into the bone and lock it inside when the bone cools. Over time, the fat will come to the surface of the bone and make it look bad. If you accidentally boil the bones, try using biological washing powder to remove the fat."

      "content": "Let dermestid beetles eat the flesh if you have access to them. Dermestid beetles are often used by taxidermists and museum curators to clear bones of flesh. If you happen to have access to these beetles, place a fresh carcass in their tank and allow them to eat the soft tissue over several days. They typically get the bone nice and clean. [13] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source These beetles are kept in special tanks with constant care, so it isn’t recommended to create a dermestid beetle tank yourself unless you plan on rotting things down regularly. They rely on dead flesh to survive. This method works best for small animals. For larger animals, a lot of flesh will need to be removed beforehand so the beetles can get to the middle before it starts to rot."

      "content": "How do I clean bones without hydrogen peroxide? Hydrogen peroxide isn’t technically necessary to clean bones. It’s mainly used to whiten them, though it can also remove lingering odors. If you don’t want to use hydrogen peroxide, simply remove all soft tissue, scrub the bones clean, degrease them, and let them dry. If you’d like to whiten bones without using hydrogen peroxide, try laying them in the sunlight to lighten them naturally. [14] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Generally, the preferred hydrogen peroxide percentage for whitening bones is 20-30%, but smaller percentages can also work."

      "title": "Where do I find bones?",
      "content": "Where do I find bones? Look up the laws in your area to determine how you can legally obtain animal bones. In the U.S., many states require you to have a permit to collect wildlife specimens, and some species are protected by federal and state law. Do not kill an animal to obtain its bones and be aware of your impact on the environment as you collect. [15] X Research source Do not collect a large quantity of specimens at a time and always wear gloves to protect yourself from diseases. If allowed, check in the woods and around bodies of water for specimens. Some places also allow you to collect roadkill. Ask hunters or farmers if they have any bones you can have, as they often don’t use the bones themselves and might want them off their hands. If you owned an animal that passed away, you’re allowed to collect their bones, as well."

If the bones have been out in the open, are free of soft tissue, and don’t have an odor, they’re probably relatively clean and will be unlikely to carry disease. However, it is still possible to catch a disease from bones like these, so it’s best to clean them yourself to be safe. Remember to wear gloves when handling bones. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "How do I remove bones from a mummified body? It’s rare to find a mummified animal, but it may occasionally happen on beaches due to exposure to sun and salt. It’s difficult to keep a mummified body because it will absorb moisture and start to rot again. [17] X Research source If you want to keep the bones, soak the body in water for a few days, then bury it to encourage rotting so it’s easier to remove the soft tissue from the bones. Be warned, however, that it will smell disgusting."
