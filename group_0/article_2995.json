      "content": "Understand the plight of the proletariat. The proletariat is a member of the working class; people who provide work to an employer in exchange for wages, but do not have any ownership of the company they work for or the \"means of production,\" meaning the land, tools, factories, office buildings, raw materials, etc. that make their work possible. Most members of the proletariat have little control or say over their own labor, and do not share in the profits of their employer. [2] X Research source Because the proletariat has no control over their labor and are dependent on wages to survive, they are easily exploited by their employers. The oppressors of the proletariat are called the \"bourgeoisie\" in Marxist terms, the wealthy capitalists who own the corporations, factories, and land, and consequently, most of the world's wealth. [3] X Research source The modern concept of the 99% is very similar to Karl Marx's concept of the proletariat, and the 1% is analogous to the bourgeoisie. A key tenet of communism is that the proletariat should strive to gain control over the means of production, and own and manage it collectively."

      "content": "Contemplate how private property creates social injustice. Private ownership over the means of production is what gives the bourgeoisie the power to exploit the proletariat (working class). Marx argued that if the ownership of the means of production were seized and handed over to the proletariat to own communally and equally, workers would fare better, exploitation would cease and the social classes that arise from the unfair distribution of property would disappear leading to a one proletariat class society. Some modern companies are partially or completely employee-owned, in that they give their employees stock, but these are relatively few. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider communist critiques of capitalism.",
      "content": "Consider communist critiques of capitalism. Marx believed that it was capitalism, itself, along with the market economy, and the unbridled quest for profit that brought about the current state of injustice and inequality. Marx felt that the remedy for this was the total abolition of capitalism through a proletarian revolution. Numerous communist revolutions have taken place in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, although few truly communist states remain to this day. [5] X Research source Most modern communist parties now focus on the reform of capitalist societies, rather than on revolution. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Become familiar with the core texts of Marxist communism. If you identify yourself as a communist, people will presume you are familiar with these texts and expect you to be able to discuss them knowledgeably. Begin with Frederick Engels' The Principles of Communism , a pamphlet he wrote in 1847 outlining the key tenets of Marxist communism. [7] X Research source Move on to the Communist Manifesto , published by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels in 1848. [8] X Research source Read Marx' 3-volume Das Kapital when you are up for a real challenge. [9] X Research source"

Marketing is ubiquitous in modern society and most of us think little of it, but it is also a powerfully manipulative tool of the Capitalist machine.

      "content": "Choose where you spend your money wisely, for money is the lifeblood of Capitalism. Giving money to exploitative companies only increases their power over the working classes. Research the various corporations that produce the food, medicine, clothing, and other items that you use. Avoid doing business with corporations that are known to exploit labor. Buy goods directly from the person who manufactures them and avoid the corporate middleman whenever possible. Look for labor-friendly companies to do business with. Shop at the union, or better yet, employee-owned stores. Avoid using multinational companies such as Starbucks and amazon.com; which have a reputation for tax avoidance."

      "content": "Minimize your consumption of consumer goods. Avoid purchasing disposable products of any kind. (cutlery, plates, cups, napkins, barbecues, sanitary products, razors, gloves, nappies, and chopsticks are all perfect examples) Avoid the unnecessary acquisition of personal property. Before making a purchase, analyze whether or not you really need it, and consider how long you will be able to use the item. If possible, go in on large purchases (for instance, a lawnmower) with one or more other people, and share the item that you buy amongst the co-owners. Learn to sew and repair things. Mend and reuse old items before purchasing new ones. Buy as much as possible from second-hand stores. Eschew the latest technological trends and gadgets. Only buy what you really need. iPhone 10? Forget it! Learn to garden and begin to grow your own produce, if space permits, or if a neighborhood allotment is available."

      "title": "Consider forgoing car ownership.",
      "content": "Consider forgoing car ownership. Cars are a particularly wasteful and expensive form of personal property that with a few adjustments, can be made unnecessary for most people. Use mass transit whenever possible. Take advantage of car-sharing programs in your area. Consider buying an older, used car that is in good working condition, rather than a new vehicle if you have to buy a car. Unlike brand new cars, used cars are much cheaper and don't contribute to feeding capitalism as much as buying a new one from a dealership does, because a new one is not being produced."

Keep in mind that many people, particularly members of older generations, may become immediately hostile to the term \"communism\" or \"communist,\" as they equate it with Cold War politics and propaganda. Do not take it personally, and do not antagonize people needlessly. Teaching by example will win more converts than aggressive confrontations and debates."
