      "content": "Find common interests. One of the simplest ways to be closer is to find activities and interests that you and your crush both like. Talk with your crush about something they like. Identify the interests that match your own, and spend more time on those activities. Consider asking things like, \"What's it like being on the soccer team? I used to play soccer\" or, \"I noticed that you like to draw. What kind of things do you sketch? I like to sketch in a journal sometimes.\" Do more of the activities that you both enjoy. Just make sure that not all your time is spent on this. Look at the ways that you and your crush are different. Sometimes getting to know someone involves seeing how common interests may be different in approach. Reader Poll: We asked 2661 wikiHow readers who've talked to their gym crush, and 54% of them agreed that the best way to break the ice is by making small talk about their workout routine. [Take Poll] This is a great example of how to talk to your crush about your common interests!"

      "content": "Start off as friends. Though your romantic feelings may be hard to control, it's important to get to know the 'real' person that is your crush. Wouldn't you want that person you like to be someone you also want to be friends with? [1] X Research source If you don't feel like your crush would be a good friend, or that your interests are too different, think about what that may mean. Would you want to be close to someone who you don't think would be a good friend? Allow your friendship to lead into romance, rather than the other way around. Don't rush into something. Try to find ways to keep your mind off your crush, and focus on how to be their friend first. Consider asking your crush and their friends to hang out with you and your friends for a weekend event. Keep the interactions casual at first, rather than trying to find out if they like you."

While being approachable and friendly may get your crush to notice you, they may be hesitant to be your friend, or let you be close if you're rude, cold, or stand-offish.

      "content": "Take care of your appearance. Be presentable by taking care of your body. Have clean hair and nice clothes. You don't need to get \"dressed up\" every day, but someone is more likely to talk with you or notice you if you have a nice appearance. Avoid wearing provocative clothes. You may be sending the wrong message to more than just your crush. For girls, you don't need a ton of makeup or high fashion clothes. But having a presentable and healthy appearance is good. Consider wearing a mild perfume. For guys, avoid looking like you just rolled out of bed. Make sure to have clean outfits. Consider wearing cologne."

Avoid idealizing your crush. They are still a regular person, just like everyone else. It takes time to develop a new friendship or relationship. Your crush will not notice you overnight. Realize that your crush may not intentionally be ignoring you. If it's a large class, school, or workplace, oftentimes you may not notice someone until you interact with them a few times one-on-one."

      "content": "Use your body language. There are various ways to give non-verbal cues that you're interested. Make eye contact. Smile. Laugh when they say something funny. Put your hand on their shoulder. Place your hand near your lips while they talk. If they seem sad or worried about something, give a hug. If you are sitting next to your crush on a long car ride, you can put your head on their shoulder. See how your crush responds to your body language. Do they act the same way? Or do they pull back?

[3] X Research source Consider saying, \"I really like talking to you\" rather than just blurting out, \"I like you.\" Or consider saying things like, \"I like your hair\" or \"I like hanging out with you\" or \"You're really cool.\""

It's the same for your friends, family, or anyone you spend time with. Showing that you are independent can actually make you more attractive. Don't center all your time around your crush. Remember that there are lots of cool people and fun things to do out there. And your crush shouldn't be the only thing that matters. Your crush may notice you more after you've had some time apart. Let them miss you a little. Hopefully, they notice when you're not around."
