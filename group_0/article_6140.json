      "content": "If you’re lucky enough to find running shorts with a pocket, that is. Try to find shorts or pants with zippered pockets so your phone can’t fly out as you run. [1] X Research source Skin-tight shorts, like Spandex, are less likely to have pockets than baggy pants or shorts.

      "content": "You can still glance at your screen with this accessory. Strap an armband around your upper arm, then attach your phone to keep it with you as you run. [2] X Research source Look for an armband that fits snugly around your upper bicep. Make sure you purchase a model that fits your phone! Some armbands can fit different models, but not all. Watch out for bad weather—if it’s raining, you might want to seal your phone in a plastic bag before you head out. Armbands are great with tank tops and T-shirts, but they can get a little bit annoying over jackets or sweatshirts."

      "content": "Similar to an armband, this wallet uses your wrist instead. Zip your phone into this pouch and slide it onto your arm to carry your phone with you. [3] X Research source Try to find a wrist wallet made of a lightweight material, like a cotton blend. That way, it won’t weigh down your arm as you run. This is a great option if you’re worried about tiring out your arms with a heavy armband. Wrist wallets also protect your phone from the elements, so they’re good for rainy days."

[4] X Research source While phones don’t weigh much, adding weight to one side and not the other can get a bit irritating on a long run. Adding a strap is much easier than holding your phone the whole time, since you can relax your hand slightly without dropping your phone."

      "content": "These belts are a little smaller than fanny packs, so they’re super lightweight. Tuck your phone, your keys, and your wallet into the zippered pouch to keep them contained on your run. [6] X Research source [7] X Expert Source Kai Ng Certified Running Coach Expert Interview. 25 May 2021. Make sure your belt fits you well! Too big and it could fall off; too small and it could compress your breathing. Running belts are made specifically for runners, so they won’t bounce up and down or give you any chafing as you move. Belts can take a little bit of getting used to, but most of them are so light that you can’t feel them at all."

      "content": "Hydration belts are like running belts, but they’re bigger. Strap your water bottle to the outside and zip your phone into the pocket on the front. [8] X Research source Since these belts are a bit bigger than running belts, you might get a bit more bouncing and swaying as you run. Look for a hydration belt that fits your waist perfectly to avoid unnecessary bouncing and movement. If you run in bad weather a lot, find a hydration belt made of synthetic materials to keep water out."
