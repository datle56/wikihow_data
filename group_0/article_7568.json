For both, add the abbreviation in parentheses after the first time you write out the full name. Every other time you mention the WHO in your text, just use the abbreviation. If the full name appears for the first time in a parenthetical citation, change the parentheses to square brackets. [6] X Research source Narrative citation example: According to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2021), the main cause is a rise in infectious disease.

If the source isn't paginated, count paragraphs and use the abbreviation \"para\" instead of \"p.\" For a narrative citation, put the year immediately after the name of the organization, then add a parenthetical with the page or paragraph number at the end of the quote.
