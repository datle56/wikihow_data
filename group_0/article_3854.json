      "title": "Separate physical measurements from believing.",
      "content": "Separate physical measurements from believing. Think of knowing God not by measurable events, but through an intangible presence in everything you do. God is Spirit, experienced intuitively, somewhat like experiencing love, air and gravity, and unfathomable love and grace. Knowing of God has more to do with the heart (core beliefs) than with objects. The belief you form through faith and in a Higher Power than yourself, does not just happen. You do not wake up one morning, brush your teeth, and say, \"today I am going to believe in God. Today I am going to have faith\". Something has to happen for you to need and to seek out that faith. [1] X Research source If you approach faith from this premise, then you will see that believing in God is about reflecting on the impact He has on you and on others. You'll find that believing is not by material means but by personal development of spiritual faith, since God is generally viewed as a living spirit, not having a decaying body, [2] X Research source He can be measured by intangible things, like acknowledging His presence, our beliefs, plus our ways and reactions. Think about all the things you believe in. You may believe that a team is the best team in your sport, for example. But what is this based on? Do you favor them because they have superior statistics and more championships? Chances are you favor them because of the specific impact they have on you as a fan. Your appreciation for them is based on something inside you, individual, and immeasurable."

      "content": "Replace proof with trust. Having faith involves taking a choice . This means deciding to trust without absolute certainty. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Chances are you make decisions on faith every day. If you've ever ordered food from a restaurant, you've taken a step of faith. That particular restaurant may have a high customer rating and stellar health score, but chances are you haven't witnessed firsthand your food being made. You have to trust that the chefs have washed their hands and prepared your food properly/safely. Seeing isn't always believing. There are still things science can't measure, yet people still believe in them. For example, astronomers cannot actually see black holes in outer space, because by definition they absorb materials and the light that is necessary for us to observe them. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source But by observing the behavior of matter and the orbits of stars around a black hole, we can predict that one is present. God is also non-viewable but has knowable qualities and observable influence, that draws people to Him. Think of a time a family member has been sick and gotten better. Did you ever pray or hope to something higher for their recovery? Maybe this event is like an orbiting star, and God is like gravity that is exerting His pull on all things."

      "title": "Stop trying to control everything.",
      "content": "Stop trying to control everything. Probably across all religions that have a concept of God, this belief is constant: God created all things . [5] X Research source Because God is the creator, only He is in full control. Relinquishing control of certain aspects of your life does not mean you are powerless. Don't think of God as a puppeteer pulling your strings, but as a parent keeping you safe. You still choose the course of your life, but life may not turn out the way you plan or wish. In times like this, it's important to remember that God is there to help you. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Knowing that you are not in control of everything can be empowering. Recovery programs like Alcoholics Anonymous are founded on the premise that people are not fully in control, and that belief in a higher power restores balance by yielding one's broken ego. Once we accept that we cannot control everything, we learn to accept things we can control. Consider the Serenity Prayer: \"God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference.\" [7] X Research source There are many things you can change but things you can't. You may believe that there are higher powers that shape your life's outcome. This is a great starting place for discovering faith in God."

      "title": "Go to places of worship.",
      "content": "Go to places of worship. Try attending a Jewish, Muslim or Christian service. Listen to the words that the minister, rabbi, imam or pastor is saying and try relating it to your life. Clergy often deliver a speech, called a sermon, that relates every day life to beliefs in God. See if things they are saying connects with you on a personal level. Though you may not know the specifics of your religious text, maybe a sentiment or point the speaker makes will connect with you in a big way (for example, treating your neighbor as you would treat yourself). [8] X Research source Don't worry about not being of that faith. Though you may be restricted from partaking in certain practices, like receiving communion, [9] X Research source there are no restrictions for listening. In fact, Christians should be and usually are very happy when new people become curious and interested in the teachings of God. Church services fall on Sunday and usually last about an hour. Synagogue services fall on Saturday. Jumu'ah prayer occurs on Fridays just after midday. It is customary for regular patrons to arrive on time and stay throughout, although it is not mandatory for casual attendees. Catholic mass is usually a formal to semi-formal event. Be sure that you dress appropriately. Collared shirts, dress pants, and long dresses are acceptable attire. Also remember to be respectful; no cell phone usage and no chewing gum during church services."

      "title": "Talk to people who believe in God.",
      "content": "Talk to people who believe in God. Maybe someone you know has a well-founded relationship with God. Talk to him or her about why and how faith is so strong. Ask questions. \"Why do you believe in God?\" \"What makes you sure that God is there?\" \"Why should I believe in God?\" These are all questions that a friend might have a unique insight to. [10] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Remember to be respectful and ask questions in a curious but non-aggressive manner. Pastors aren't only available during conversion or confession. If you attend church on a weekday, chances are you will be able to talk to him before or after a service. Such teachers of God will likely be happy to answer any questions you have about believing in Him."

      "title": "Pray and acknowledge God in all you say and do.",
      "content": "Pray and acknowledge God in all you say and do. Many religions believe that a good relationship with God starts with steady prayer of communication with Him. [11] X Research source God will likely not respond verbally to your prayers, but there are other signs that show He is listening. Prayer is especially important in times of need. Many people have a misconception that prayer is a vehicle for wish fulfillment. Actually, prayer is not asking God to solve all your problems for you; it is asking him to help you deal with your problems/opportunities. [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You might have a tough decision ahead of you: pursue a job or continue on with your education? Try praying to God for guidance. See what choice you make and observe the outcome. Though things may not end up how you plan, think of this as another opportunity to pray."

The Bible emphasizes the fact that God works in mysterious ways. [13] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source Think of God as a teacher, helping you learn important life lessons not by just giving you the answer, but by helping you arrive at that answer yourself. Think back to school and ask yourself, \"Did my teachers tell me the answers, or teach me how to understand issues and solve problems?\" Think of events in your life as \"lessons\" more so than \"answers.\""

      "content": "Volunteer. Try giving to others less fortunate than you by helping out at a soup kitchen or food drive. [14] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Believing in a higher power means shifting the emphasis off yourself. Helping others is a great opportunity to look at your life from a different perspective. Interacting with others who are less fortunate often helps you appreciate things you take for granted in your life. Basic things like having shelter, eating food, or being able to sleep soundly are luxuries that some don't have. These are all things that you can thank God for and can help you believe God is looking out for you. Be thankful and be persistent. Notice how people who have been not had certain things can still thrive. Tony Melendez, a man born without arms, recently played the guitar for Pope John Paul II using his feet. [15] X Research source Being thankful for the things you have shifts attention from all the things that are missing in your life. Focus on the positive; optimism is a stepping stone to believing in something greater than yourself."

      "content": "Show love and concern to find God. You can team with God to serve as His hands and feet. Simply holding open the door for someone can brighten that person's day. Little things like smiling, giving up your seat to the elderly on public transportation, or just saying \"thank you\" can bring you closer to God. Don't underestimate the effect a good deed can have on your feeling and believing how a higher power affects others through you. [17] X Research source Think of times when someone, maybe even a complete stranger, has done something good to you. Maybe you dropped your cell phone and someone picked it up and stopped you to return it. Did you ever pause to think about that person's actions? Maybe that person was an answer to your simplest prayer: \"Please God, just help me get through today.\" \"God bless you\", have you ever helped someone and been told that? Try letting those words truly sink in and appreciate that deeply. What if a good deed is really God telling you that He hears and sees us and allows your intents and purposes to express His love?"
