      "content": "Choose an area near water to set your trap. Select an area where frogs have been spotted to try to catch one with your trap. Frogs love water, so areas near ponds, rivers, lakes, and streams are good places to try to catch them. [1] X Research source Frogs mostly live on land but will frequently visit wet, shady areas and shallow water."

      "content": "Use a hammer and nail to poke 3-4 holes in 2 medium-sized buckets. You don’t want your buckets to fill with water when you’re trying to catch frogs with them, so take a hammer and a nail to puncture a few holes through the bottom of them. Be careful not to crack the bottom. [2] X Research source Smaller frogs may be able to escape through cracks or breaks in the buckets."

      "content": "Cut a slot in both buckets large enough to fit a plywood board. The slots will have a 4 ft (1.2 m) by 8 ft (2.4 m) plywood board that is 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) thick fit into them. Use scissors or clippers to cut out a 4 in (10 cm) deep slot on the rim of each bucket. Make sure the slot is as wide as the thickness of the board so it can fit into it. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Dig a hole big enough to fit 1 of the buckets in it. After you’ve chosen the location for your trap, dig 1 hole deep and wide enough to fit your bucket into without any of the rim sticking out. Place the bucket into the hole and make sure the rim is even with the ground. [4] X Research source If you’re near a body of water and can’t dig a hole deep enough without it filling with water, try to move further away from the water to place your trap."

    {
      "title": "Fill the area around the bucket with dirt.",
      "content": "Fill the area around the bucket with dirt. Use the dirt from the hole that you dug to fill in any gaps around the bucket. There should be no space between the bucket and the ground, and it should be held in place firmly. [5] X Research source Try to shake the bucket to make sure it’s secure in the hole."

      "title": "Make a trench",
      "content": "Make a trench 4 inches (10 cm) deep and as wide as your board. Start the trench at the slot that you cut into the bucket. Make the length of the trench 4 inches (10 cm) shorter than the total length of the plywood board. [6] X Research source Make sure the walls of the trench are even and consistent."

Use the dirt you remove to fill in the space around the bucket so it’s secure. [7] X Research source Make sure the slot that you cut is facing towards the other bucket. The rim of the bucket should be level with the ground."

It should be able to stand upright on its own. Use dirt to fill in any space in the trench to help support the board. [8] X Research source You can hammer stakes into the ground next to the board to help support it."

      "content": "Leave the trap for 12 hours and then check it for frogs. As frogs hop along, they won’t be able to jump over the plywood board and will be safely guided into one of the buckets, where they’ll be trapped. Frogs like to come out at night, so you need to leave the trap alone overnight or for 12 hours. Check the buckets in the morning to see if any frogs are trapped in them. Don’t leave the trap for too long or any frogs that you catch could die from dehydration, hunger, or predators."

Choose a net with a handle that is at least 3 feet (0.91 m) long so you can reach far enough to catch a frog. You can find nets at a local department store or online."

      "title": "Wait until dark to try to catch frogs.",
      "content": "Wait until dark to try to catch frogs. Most frogs are active at night, so you’ll have a much higher chance of catching one after dark. Don’t wait in the area for the sun to go down or the frogs may not approach where you are. [9] X Research source You can kill time by practicing catching tennis balls or something similar with your net."

They are often found on the banks of ponds or rivers, so use your flashlight to shine along the bank. Look for bright white eyes shining in the light. [10] X Research source Be mindful of snakes as you walk along the bank!"

      "content": "Drop the net on top of the frog. Use 1 swift motion to drop the net directly on top of the frog. Hold pressure down so the frog can’t escape as you make your way to the end of the net. Wait for about 2 minutes to allow the frog to settle down a little bit before you grab it. Try not to squish the frog with the edge of the net."

Take the frog out of the net with your other hand and place it in a container with a lid so it can’t jump out. Make sure the container has ventilation so the frogs can breathe."
