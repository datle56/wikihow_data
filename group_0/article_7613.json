      "content": "Clean new stains or soiling as soon as possible. The less time you give dirt, grime, etc. to set in, the easier it will be to wipe away. If you place a high value on keeping your basketball shoes looking like new, clean them after every wear. The only exception is if your shoes have an absorbent material like canvas, mesh, or suede. In this case, let caked on mud dry so that you can brush the dirt off with a stiff brush, then start cleaning. Otherwise, you’ll just smear the mud further."

      "content": "Create a gentle cleaning solution. Fill a bowl or small bucket with warm water. Add a few drops of a mild detergent (dish soap works well) and swish it around so that the solution is just a bit bubbly. [2] X Research source Avoid harsh detergents or chemicals, bleaches, or abrasive cleaners. Remove the shoelaces before you get down to cleaning the shoes. You can clean them separately with the same solution."

Wipe the shoe thoroughly, cleaning off and re-wetting the cloth or brush as needed. Use your fingertip under the cloth — or a toothbrush — to get into seams and creases. Scrub a bit more aggressively in a circular motion on stubborn stains. If desired, add a tiny dab of plain white toothpaste to your dampened cloth or toothbrush."

      "content": "Store valuable shoes for safekeeping. Once they’re dry, you can pitch your run-of-the-mill basketball shoes in your gym bag or by the front door. If you’ve got high-end or especially meaningful shoes, however, special storage techniques are advisable. Make sure the shoes are completely dry. Remove any crumpled newspaper from inside and check. Place the shoes into individual, large zip-close bags. If you have access to desiccant packets (like those silica gel packs that probably came in the original shoe box), place one in each bag before sealing them."

Add a dab of plain white toothpaste to a toothbrush, dip it into a cleaning solution of warm water and a touch of gentle dish soap, and scrub away at stains or scuffs. Wipe away the excess with a clean, damp cloth, and repeat as needed. [7] X Research source You can also make a paste by putting a few spoonfuls of baking soda into a bowl, then stirring in a small amount of water until you reach a toothpaste consistency.

Add a small dab of plain white toothpaste to the fingertips of your first and middle fingers, then dip them in warm water. Rub the leather in a circular motion, then wipe away the toothpaste and dirt with a damp cloth. Dry the surface with a clean cloth, then let the leather air dry overnight."

Basketball shoes with uppers or components made of canvas or similar absorbent materials can be cleaned in much the same way as any other pair. Use warm water and gentle soap, clean them with soft cloths or brushes, and allow them to air dry. You can, however, get canvas a bit more wet and scrub it a bit more aggressively if needed to remove stubborn stains. If the canvas gets saturated, blot or squeeze it with a dry towel, stuff newspapers into the shoes, and let them dry overnight."

Once you remove the laces, you can dampen and scrub them with the same gentle cleaning solution as for the shoes. Or, you can toss them in the washing machine.

[10] X Research source You could try throwing them in the washing machine, but you run the risk of them being damaged; hand washing is safest. For overnight deodorizing, you can also dry putting a dryer sheet inside each shoe."

In most cases, the maker of your basketball shoes will recommend that you not put them in either a washing machine or a clothes dryer. It is particularly wise to heed this advice if your shoes are expensive or otherwise valuable to you. [11] X Expert Source Marc Sigal Shoe Care Specialist Expert Interview. 15 January 2020. In reality, your shoes will probably make it through a wash cycle just fine. However, only you can decide if you’re willing to take the risk that “probably” entails."

Add less detergent than you normally would, if possible. Remove insoles and shoestrings before starting the wash. You can wash them along with the shoes."

If your shoes are filthy and you’re just not all that worried about whether they’ll emerge unscathed, you can try adjusting the washing machine to the warm or hot water settings. Set it to a regular wash cycle, but keep it on a low spin setting. Once again, throw in a few old towels to reduce banging around. [12] X Research source Since you’re being a risk-taker anyway, go ahead and throw the shoes in the dryer afterward as well. But don’t get too wild — put the dryer on its low heat setting."
