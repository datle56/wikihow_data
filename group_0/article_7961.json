      "content": "Blot the stain with a paper towel. If the stain is still fresh, pat the wet spot with a paper towel (or absorbent cloth) until it’s mostly dry, using new paper towels as needed. Don’t rub the stain or you’ll spread it further into the fabric of the couch. Act as quickly as possible; if the pee settles on the couch for too long, it will become more difficult to remove.

      "content": "Spray the spot with a mixture of vinegar and water. Mix 1 part distilled white vinegar with 4 parts water in a spray bottle. Spray the urine stain until it’s completely saturated. This will re-wet the stain to ensure it’s completely removed from your couch, as well as remove the smell. [2] X Research source The vinegar and water solution neutralizes the ammonia in the urine, which in turn breaks up the smell. If your stain smells really bad, using 100% vinegar will neutralize the odor. If the stain is old and dry, consider using a steam cleaner with vinegar to tackle the built-in odors. Don’t use this solution on microfiber, as water stains it. Use rubbing alcohol instead since it dries quickly and doesn’t leave water stains. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Sprinkle baking soda on the fabric while it’s still wet. Baking soda is great at neutralizing and removing odors like urine. Use enough baking soda to thoroughly cover the wet spot—about 1 cup (520 g) should be sufficient. Spread it evenly, but not too thickly, across the entire stain.

      "content": "Let the baking soda sit overnight, then vacuum it up. In general, it’s best to let the baking soda sit for at least 12 hours to ensure the fabric underneath it is dry. If you’re in a hurry, however, check the spot after 4-6 hours. Once the couch is completely dry, run a vacuum cleaner over the spot to remove the baking soda. The stain and the smell should be gone.

Put 2-3 drops of dish soap, 3 tbsp (42 g) of baking soda, and 1.25 c (300 mL) of 3% hydrogen peroxide in a spray bottle and shake it to mix the solution. The hydrogen peroxide will disinfect the fabric and break down the acid in the pee, making the stain easier to remove. [8] X Research source If you don’t have any hydrogen peroxide, substitute it with white vinegar. If your couch is made of microfiber, opt for an enzyme cleaner instead."

      "content": "Hire a pro if you can’t remove the stain or odor yourself. Urine is a surfactant, meaning it can break down surface tension to easily penetrate the fabric and padding of your couch. Because of this, topical treatments can’t always fully remove the stain or odor. If this is the case, consider hiring a professional cleaner to tackle the stain for you. [16] X Research source Professional cleaners often have stronger cleaning solutions and equipment unavailable to the public, so they may be able to remove the stain more easily and effectively. Some cleaning solutions can also damage delicate fabrics, so it may also be a good idea to call a professional if your couch is particularly delicate."

      "content": "Consistently potty train pets. Accidents happen, but it’s important to encourage pets to use a designated spot to relieve themselves. When potty training dogs or other pets, be sure to give them regular bathroom breaks outside or in their designated bathroom area. This will help prevent them from holding it all day and relieving themselves on your couch. [17] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source If you’re also potty training toddlers , encourage them to let you know when they need to use the restroom to avoid accidents. If a toddler is acting squirmy or distracted, or grabbing at their crotch, this could signify that they need to pee, so it might be best to keep them off the couch just in case. If a cat peed on your couch, this might mean that it is marking its territory, which is called spraying. This is most common among unneutered tomcats, although neutered tomcats and female cats (known as mollies, or queens if nursing or pregnant) may do so as well. If you have an unneutered tomcat who sprays, getting him neutered may stop him doing it. Both cats and dogs may pee in the wrong place if they have a UTI or similar. If a previously housetrained pet starts peeing in the wrong place again, especially if there are other symptoms as well, take them to the vet. If a child is known to wet the bed, do not let them sleep on the couch."
