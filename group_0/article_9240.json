      "content": "Check your cable modem and its accessories. Take the modem out of the box and determine if what you have is indeed a cable modem. It should have a coaxial port, or a small cylindrical protrusion located on its back. A DSL modem won't have that; instead, DSL modems have telephone cable ports like those you find on telephones into which you can plug in the telephone line coming from the wall. Accessories should include the following: An ethernet cable for connecting the modem to your computer The cable modem's power adapter A coaxial cable for connecting the modem to the cable line"

      "content": "Connect the modem to a power source and turn it on. Plug the power adapter into the power port on the modem (located along the area of the coaxial cable). Take the other end of the power adapter and plug it to a power outlet. If the modem doesn't come on automatically, press the power button to turn it on. Before you plug a modem, read the voltage rating on the adapter to make sure that it matches your outlet. Doing so will help avoid shorting any circuits. As it boots up, the lights on the cable modem will blink, telling you that it's trying to connect to the ISP's server. Once the cable modem establishes a connection, the lights will become steady."
