      "content": "Celebrate your birthday with unique but easy-to-plan activities. These adult birthday activity ideas think outside the box but include something for everyone. Go rugged with a hiking trip (or make it all about glamping), or head out for several fun activities if you live near a city. A fun day or night out is about great ideas and the people close to you who make them come alive. Comedy Show : With a little planning, it’s surprisingly easy to book a block of tickets for a comedian the whole group likes. The pressure to plan a great birthday now rests on the comedian’s shoulders, so pick a funny one! [1] X Research source An “Around the World” Party : All it takes is setting up each room or space as its own particular country. Guests can dress up as their favorite country while you organize activities for each area. Set up a Tahitian beach in the spare room or an Italian soccer game in the yard. Treat guests to a Parisian class on making croissants in the kitchen or learn Irish step dancing in the living room. The world is yours to discover so your guests can enjoy every moment. [2] X Research source Ice Skating : Even if your birthday doesn’t fall during the winter months, it’s super fun to take friends and family to an ice skating rink. You can rent one out if planning on a big party, or just head to the rink with a few special guests to hit the ice together. It may be an opportunity to deck out the birthday cake with an ice skating theme too. [3] X Research source Food Truck Crawl : Take the concept of a pub crawl and, instead, visit your favorite food trucks for the ultimate tasting menu. Head to where the food trucks congregate and start with Korean BBQ, move on to burgers and burritos, and finish with Belgian waffles or ice cream cones. The meal is yours to plan—just be sure everyone tries something new in the process. Wilderness Hike : Few adult birthday activities are as special as those spent walking through nature, climbing a mountain, or sightseeing forest trails. Help guests prepare ahead of time by including a list of tips for “what to bring,” so they can have a comfortable outdoor experience. Stay over for a camping trip (or a glamping trip if you need to add some sparkle to your outdoor gathering). [4] X Research source Museum Tour : A trip through the worlds of history, art, and architecture feels like a destination birthday without having to leave town. You can also rent out a private room at a museum or simply take your closest friends on a guided tour. Spend the day in ancient Egypt or Rome, Renaissance Italy, or a Japanese garden–everything is possible. [5] X Research source Indoor Rock Climbing : Leave the mountains for another day while still getting a workout in for your rock climbing birthday bash. Book a rock-climbing space or take a class with your favorite group as a challenging start to this special day. Puppy Party : Dog lovers will appreciate this surprising birthday theme that brings pooches front and center. Decorate with puppy-friendly decor and invite guests to bring their dogs along for a day of doggie play that celebrates the birthday guy or gal, along with their precious pups. Guests can donate to their local shelter in place of gifts for added meaning. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Inexpensive adult birthday activity ideas are just as fun as pricey ones. It all depends on how creative you get with planning. Take your guests to enjoy a cheap group activity or start with a theme that allows fun to unfold at home. Picnic in the Park : You don’t have to rent out a space, look for expensive decorations, or arrange entertainment. Show up, set up a picnic in the grass, and invite some friends along. Keep things simple by ordering a pizza or having everyone bring one food item. Then, focus the day on fun activities, like touch football, telling stories, or relay games. Open Mic Night : Set up a fun space and grab a karaoke machine. Guests can sign up for their slot and perform their hearts out. They can do a comedy set, sing a song, tap dance, or act out a speech from their favorite play or movie. Find out how talented your closest friends are. [7] X Research source Pub Quiz : Don’t just meet friends at a local bar—choose one that features a pub quiz night worth attending. As long as guests can eat well, have a few drinks, and engage in games and quizzes, you’ve just saved yourself from overspending on a birthday gathering. Sports Viewing Party : Make the big game or final tournament part of your birthday by watching sports with your buddies. Set up the man cave (even if your guests include ladies) and provide lots of delicious treats for your home team. Make some sparks fly by asking everyone to wear the jersey of their favorite team to keep things interesting. Potluck Competition : A potluck is a great way to keep a birthday budget under control, but why stop there? Arrange everyone’s dishes and set up a food competition worthy of the Food Network. Comment cards and a rigorous judging process will help everyone figure out which dish is number one. [8] X Research source Bowling Alley : Large parties sometimes rent out lanes at the bowling alley, but if your group is small, you can simply head there and book your lanes in person. Many bowling alleys also have lots of fun activities in addition to bowling, from roller skating and ping pong to darts and arcade games. [9] X Research source \"Year You Were Born” Party : If you were born in the 1980s, make it all about vintage video games, neon costumes, and dancing to big beats. If you’re a late 90s/early 2000s kid, set up an area to skate and rollerblade all you like. It turns out you can travel through time without even leaving home. [10] X Research source Adult Pajama Party : Arrange a girl’s night in and turn it into anything you like: a streaming series watch party, a DIY spa, or a party game extravaganza. Slumber parties are just as fun for adults, especially when everyone can dig into a pancake bar in the morning. [11] X Research source"
