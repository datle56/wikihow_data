      "content": "Obtain a sound. To add a sound to your Soundboard, it must be a maximum of 5 seconds long, in MP3 format, and smaller than 512kb. There are a few ways to get sounds: Record your own. You can record sounds on your phone or computer using a built-in voice recorder, or with a free program like Audacity. If you record a sound on your phone, send it to your computer to add it to your Soundboard, as Discord's mobile app doesn't support uploading to your Soundboard yet. If you didn't record in MP3, convert it to MP3 before uploading. Use a pre-existing audio or video source. If you don't already have the audio or video downloaded, download it by using a video downloader , or record the audio from your computer using Audacity . Then, use Audacity to trim the sound clip to fit Discord's specifications. Download pre-made sound clips. Use a site like Myinstants to find funny or meme sounds that are already made that you can download and add to your Soundboard."
