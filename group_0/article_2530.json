      "content": "To become a more assertive person, practice thinking like one. If you tend to be more aggressive or more passive, thinking somewhere in the middle might not come easy, but with practice, it’ll become second nature. An assertive person might adopt the following mantras: I won’t be taken advantage of, or attack another person. I will stand up for myself in a respectful manner. I will express myself directly and openly."

      "content": "Proper enunciation and a calm tone will help you get your point across. Maintain a considerate, non-threatening tone, but speak confidently and enunciate your words. Speak loudly enough to be heard, but avoid yelling or talking over anyone else. In a respectful dialogue, there’s no need to raise your voice. Even if you disagree with the person you’re addressing, try to maintain an even tone anyway. This doesn’t mean hiding your displeasure: you may frown or state that you disagree, but keeping your emotions in check will help both of you remain calm so you can come to a compromise more readily. Reader Poll: We asked 431 wikiHow readers which rude behavior they think they need to work on most, and 57% of them said speaking in an inappropriate tone or volume. [Take Poll] Remember, being assertive isn’t the same as being rude, so be mindful of your tone."

      "content": "Assertive language is confident but considerate. When you speak assertively, you’ll convey respect, sincerity, and firmness. Be patient and specific when communicating your needs, offering constructive (rather than destructive) comments and compromising as needed. Try to use “I” statements when asking for what you want or confronting someone. “I” statements convey that you are willing to take responsibility for your own thoughts and behaviors: “I feel upset when you talk over me,” or “I would appreciate it if you CC’d me on future emails.” State your feelings, wants, opinions, and needs in simple sentences. This will help the other person clearly understand what you’re asking. [1] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source For example, instead of speaking to a family member in long sentences full of hints and indirect statements, be brief and direct: \"I love when you call me just to talk! It's hard for me to have a long conversation during work hours, though. I'd appreciate it if you called during the evening instead.\""

      "content": "Assertive body language is respectful, but confident. Non-verbal assertive communication conveys consideration, sincerity, and self-esteem. Use your body language to show you’re paying careful attention to what someone else is saying and to express confidence in your own stance. Practice active listening to show you respect the other person. Even if you disagree with them, face them as they speak and nod occasionally to show you’re paying careful attention. Maintain eye contact with them to indicate interest. Experts recommend holding eye contact for about 4-5 seconds at a time before glancing away. [2] X Research source Have confident body language . Keep your shoulders squared and your chin up. Avoid fidgeting or covering your mouth when you speak."

      "content": "Assertive communication doesn’t mean being a robot. While aggressive people may get their way by being a bully, assertive people may have to compromise from time to time, because assertive communication is about finding the balance between aggression and passiveness. You’re bound to disagree with someone now and again, and authentic communication means expressing your feelings without letting them take control of an interaction. Smile when you’re happy or when negotiations are going your way, but don’t fake being OK if you’re not. Remember that a sincere smile engages the whole face, not just the mouth. If you’re unhappy, say so or show it, but keep your emotions in check. Remember that being angry is not the same thing as being aggressive, and hiding your true feelings about something that displeases you is passive (or passive-aggressive). You might express displeasure by frowning, or you might say so directly but calmly while still making it clear you’d like to find a solution that works for everyone: “I’m not happy with that idea. Could we keep hashing this out a bit?”"

      "content": "Journaling can help you understand your feelings and keep them in check. In order to learn how to communicate assertively, it is important that you learn how to effectively manage your emotions. Keeping a daily journal can be a helpful way to get your feelings out so you can understand what caused them and therefore manage them a bit better. Write down situations that trigger your emotions. Stick to facts and try not to make any interpretations yet. For example, you may simply write, “I asked my friend to go out to eat, and she said ‘no.’” Identify the emotions and thoughts you experienced in the situation. Be honest about how you felt. Specify what emotions you were aware of at the time and what thoughts, assumptions, and beliefs you had."

It can be challenging to keep your emotions under control when you’re stressed, especially if you feel like the person you're talking to doesn’t understand you or won’t help you meet our needs.

      "content": "Think through a problem carefully before making a decision. Being assertive means taking control of your life and making decisions that best suit you, rather than letting someone else make decisions for you or allow yourself to become swayed by someone else against your better judgment. By identifying the problem and considering all the possible solutions and outcomes, you’ll become better equipped to make decisions under pressure and to feel confident about your choices. Consider the IDEAL method for decision-making: I – Identify the problem. What is the basic situation that needs to be addressed? D – Describe all possible solutions. These might include handling it yourself, asking for intervention from someone else, or doing nothing. E – Evaluate the consequences of each solution. Evaluate your feelings and needs to determine the best outcome for yourself. A – Act. Choose a solution and try it. Use “I” statements to express your feelings and needs. L – Learn. Did the solution work? Evaluate why or why not. If it didn’t work, look at the other solutions on your list and work through them."

Setting healthy boundaries will help you protect your personal space and self-esteem as well as make it easier to separate your own feelings from those of others. Unhealthy boundaries increase your likelihood of exposure to being adversely affected by others’ feelings, beliefs, and behaviors.

      "content": "Seeing yourself in a positive light makes it easier to be assertive. If you don’t hold a high enough opinion of yourself, you might experience great difficulty asserting your own thoughts, beliefs, needs, and feelings. Furthermore, you may feel intimidated or reluctant to ask questions when you need clarification, focus too heavily on your own negative traits, and lack trust in yourself. Thankfully, if you’re not naturally confident, you can fake it till you make it: act and look confident, and practice speaking assertively in the mirror before talking to people.

Maintain good hygiene and wear clean, matching, unwrinkled clothes. It may garner other people’s respect—and it’ll also make you feel good about yourself. Rehearse what you're going to say. Practice in front of the mirror, into a recording, or even with a trusted friend, pretending he or she is your boss, significant other, or whomever you plan to speak with."

Counselors, coaches, and psychologists have education and training specifically in helping people communicate in healthy and meaningful ways.
