      "content": "Empty the crate of all items. You can't leave anything in the crate while it is collapsed. This includes blankets or comfort pads, food and water bowls, toys, and any other things you or your dog placed inside. The bottom liner needs to be removed as well. It is usually removed by sliding it out a small opening at the bottom of the crate where it was inserted in the first place. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a clean cloth to wipe the crate clean, including the liner. If the crate is a bit dirty scrub it with a non-toxic cleaner. This is a great time to get it sparkly clean. If the other items are dirty this makes a great opportunity to clean them as well. Blankets and pads can be laundered and dried along with any plush or cloth toys. Food and water bowls can be washed just like any other dishes in the sink or dishwasher. Other toys can be cleaned with plain soap and water and rinsed."

      "content": "Close all the doors on the crate. This includes the front door and any side or top doors or openings. Make sure they are latched fully using the provided latches. The crate will not close properly without the door closed and latched securely."

      "content": "Consult the owner's manual for your particular crate model. Since the process of collapsing a crate may be different for some models and manufacturers, it is best to consult the directions that came with yours. If you no longer have the instructions, or your crate did not come with instructions, you can contact the manufacturer to try and get a copy of them."

      "content": "Detach the sides of the crate. This is done by detaching the latches that connect the short side panels (at the front and the back of the crate) to the long panels. Push in on the short side panel while simultaneously pulling out on the long panel. This should unhook the connecting latches, releasing the panels from each other. Do this on both the front and back short panels."
