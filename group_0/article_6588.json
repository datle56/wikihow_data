When you use the CSS font-size property, you can change the size of your header font in two different ways: In relative units: For accessible web design , you'll usually want to adjust the font relative to other elements. This ensures the size of your headers will adjust automatically when the user resizes the window. In absolute units: If you want to be specific about the number of pixels (px), points (pt), inches (in), or other specific sizes, you can use absolute units. However, this can cause problems when it comes to responsive web design, as the user won't be able to adjust the size of the text in their browser, even when magnifying the page.

      "content": "Common relative units. To make sure your header sizes stay consistent no matter the screen size of the user, you'll want to stick to relative units. The most common relative units you'll use with the font-size property are: em: Adjusts the header size relative to the font size of the element. Using em is great because it changes the size of the font based on the font the reader is using on their computer, phone, or tablet. [2] X Research source For example, using font-size: 1.2em increases the size of the heading 1.2 times, or 20% larger than the default size. [3] X Research source Or, if the header tag is inside of another element that has a font size specified, such as a div , using font-size: 1.2em in your header code would make the size of the header 20% larger than the font size specified in the div . rem: Similar to em , but changes the size based on the root (HTML) element's font size instead of the parent element. If you set your header size using rem as the unit of measurement, the header will always adjust based on that of the root element, even if the header is within another container. For example, if the HTML body font size is set to 100%, using font-size: 5rem in your H1 tag would make the H1 header size 5 times as large as the default font. vh : Changes based on the height of the viewport (the area of the screen visible to the user). [4] X Research source For example, font-size: 10.0vh makes the font 10% of the viewport's height. vw: Just like vh , vw adjusts the size relative to the viewport, but to the width rather than the height."

Once you've chosen a unit of measurement, you can change the size of a header by creating an (or editing an existing) element for your header tag in your website's CSS file or the WordPress CSS editor . Here are some examples to get you started: For example, if you want to change the size of the H1 to be 20% of the viewport size, you'd use: h1 { font-size : 20 vh ; } In this example, we'll use CSS to also adjust the size of the H2 header tag, which we want to be a little smaller than H1 tags. Let's make it 17% of the viewport height: h1 { font-size : 20 vh ; } h2 { font-size : 17 vh ; }"
