      "content": "Check your spouse's phone for clues. If you can get your hands on your spouse's phone, you can poke around in their text apps and messages to see who they're talking to. But keep in mind that if they are cheating, they probably won't leave the evidence right out in the open. You still might be able to find something that at least points you in one direction and gives you more of an idea of where to look next. [2] X Research source For example, if you see that your spouse is making a lot of calls to a phone number that isn't listed in their contacts, that could be someone they're trying to keep secret. Copy the phone number so you can do a reverse lookup and see whose number it is. As tempting as it can be, don't install trackers or spyware on your spouse's phone. Since it's their personal property, it's illegal for you to track activity on it without their consent—even if you're technically paying for the phone. If your spouse is cheating on you, it's probably going to be next to impossible to even get their phone. They're likely going to keep it on them at all times—they might even take it with them to the bathroom.

      "content": "Analyze your spouse's social media activity. Changes in social media activity might indicate that they're using social media to hide something. This might include frequently logging out of their account, opening a new account, suddenly using a different email address, or changing their passwords. [4] X Research source For example, if they suddenly log out of their account the second you walk in the room, they might be having a conversation they don't want you to know about. If they suddenly have new profile pictures, that could indicate something's going on as well—especially if they've switched from a family photo to a photo of them alone."

      "content": "Pull up your spouse's browser history and saved passwords. If you have a shared computer at home, it's highly unlikely you'll find anything there—but check the browser history and saved passwords for clues to your spouse's online activity. Look at the domains with saved passwords and see if any of them are suspicious. You might also note passwords saved on social media sites under multiple email addresses or user names. [5] X Research source Open your browser and type a single letter into the search bar and see what comes up. Browsers suggest sites you've frequently visited. For example, you might type in \"a\" and see if \"ashley madison\" (a notorious cheating platform) appears as a suggestion."

      "title": "Check previous destinations in your spouse's GPS app.",
      "content": "Check previous destinations in your spouse's GPS app. When someone is trying to hide an affair, they often meet the person in a remote or isolated place far away from anywhere they usually frequent. If your spouse's GPS shows that they've been frequently traveling to an unusual or out-of-the-way spot, that could be an indication that they're trying to hide an affair. [6] X Research source Most people don't think to clear their GPS history, so this can be a great way to figure out where your spouse has been. Write down the addresses so you can look them up and see what's located there. Then, you can ask your spouse about it. If you bring this up, keep it innocent. For example, if it's a restaurant, you might say, \"Have you ever been to Luigi's Italian Deli? I've heard good things about it.\" Then, see what they say and go from there."

      "content": "Go through files on your cloud service. If you have a shared cloud service, your spouse might be keeping files related to their affair on the cloud. You'll likely need to comb through layers of folders to find what you're looking for. Pay attention to folders with seemingly random or vague titles, such as \"junk,\" \"misc.,\" or even \"untitled.\" [7] X Research source If a folder is password-protected, that's a pretty good sign that it contains something your spouse doesn't want you to see. Ask your spouse about any password-protected folders. For example, you might say, \"I was looking for last year's tax returns on the cloud and found this password-protected folder. What's that for?\""

      "content": "Open the computer's trash folder. Most people don't empty the trash every time they dump a file there, so you might be able to use this habit to your advantage. If your spouse had photos or other files related to their affair that they deleted, they'll show up in the trash folder until they're permanently deleted. [8] X Research source If you do find something there, it's fairly easy to play this off as something you innocently stumbled upon: \"I accidentally deleted a letter I was writing, and when I was pulling it out of the trash folder I found this.\""

      "title": "Make a surprise visit to your spouse at work.",
      "content": "Make a surprise visit to your spouse at work. Cheating spouses frequently hide affairs by claiming they have to work late or that they have a looming deadline on a big project. But in reality, they might not even be at work at all. [9] X Research source This gives you an opportunity to play the kind, caring spouse. For example, if your spouse says they're working late, you might bring a home-cooked dinner to their office to surprise them. If they work near a place you visit often, such as the gym, you might stop by randomly and just say that you happened to be in the neighborhood and thought you'd say hi."

      "content": "Place a GPS tracker in your spouse's car. These little devices can be hidden from view and will track the vehicle so you'll always know where your spouse is driving. Be careful, though—only do this if your name is also on the title of the vehicle. [10] X Research source If your name is on the title, you also own the vehicle and have a right to track it. But if the vehicle is solely in your spouse's name, tracking it is likely illegal."

      "title": "Analyze phone bills and bank statements.",
      "content": "Analyze phone bills and bank statements. This literal paper trail can help you uncover clues about your spouse's infidelity. Request paper bills and statements, then go through them line by line. Highlight anything that's unfamiliar to you. Keep in mind that a spouse trying to hide an affair will likely take measures to keep evidence out of joint accounts. [11] X Research source For example, your spouse might open a new credit card in their name only or buy a prepaid mobile phone. Frequent cash withdrawals could also be suspicious. Cross-reference the suspicious charges with the dates and times that your spouse was mysteriously or unusually absent. That can help you uncover a pattern. For example, you might notice a charge to a local restaurant that's too high to be a single diner, charged on a day your spouse claimed they were working late. Be careful opening statements that aren't addressed to you—that's illegal. If your name isn't on the bill, you technically can't open it. But if your spouse just leaves it out on a table in plain sight, it's fair game."

      "content": "Go through the dirty laundry. Your spouse's laundry can provide a lot of clues if you're trying to catch them cheating. Clothing that smells like strange cologne or perfume is a good indicator, as are any questionable stains or makeup smears. Did your spouse recently buy new underwear without saying anything to you about it? That could be a sign that they're cheating as well."

      "title": "Chat up your spouse's friends.",
      "content": "Chat up your spouse's friends. Cheaters often use their friends as excuses. If your spouse seems to be going out with their friends a lot more than they used to, text a friend and ask about it. You don't have to mention that you suspect your spouse is cheating—just ask how their evening was. [12] X Research source For example, you might say, \"That was a long poker game last night—who won?\" If your spouse wasn't playing poker as they said and the friend isn't in the loop, they might reveal at least a piece of the truth. Be careful hitting up your spouse's friends randomly. If you never talk to them, they'll be suspicious if you start texting them out of the blue. It helps to have a cover reason, such as planning a surprise party for your spouse."

If you still haven't found any clues but you're convinced your spouse is cheating on you, a private investigator can get to the bottom of the situation for you. Even better, they're licensed and follow local laws so you can keep your own nose clean. [13] X Research source Most private investigators are hired by businesses or attorneys. If you've gotten to the point where you're ready to hire a private investigator, consider hiring an attorney as well. Some private investigators do take on personal matters for private individuals, but they tend to be fairly selective. It might take some digging to find someone reputable who's willing to take your case. Check into the background of any investigator you hire and ask for references. Make sure anyone you hire has a good reputation and experience with cases like yours."

Include enough details to make your fake profile believable, with photos you think your spouse will find attractive. Make sure you open the account using a new email address that your spouse doesn't know about. [14] X Research source It's never a good idea to steal someone else's photos. If possible, enlist the help of a friend your spouse doesn't know. If you have to, opt for no face shots. When you interact with your spouse under your fake profile, you can tell them that you're married and have to be discreet (which isn't even a lie)."

      "content": "Follow your spouse's profile with your fake profile. When your profile's set up and seems authentic enough, it's time to follow your spouse. Don't worry about sending a message at this stage—just get yourself on their radar. [15] X Research source You have to be patient in the beginning and establish your profile, otherwise, your spouse will likely assume it's a fake and ignore it or even block it. To make it even more believable, you might also follow a few of your spouse's friends that they don't interact with a lot, like old school buddies. Your spouse might infer that you're just someone from back then who they don't remember."

Don't be too over-the-top—you don't want to draw the attention of anyone else. A few well-placed compliments should do the trick. Make sure you \"like\" everything they post, no matter how mundane. Then, check to see if they're liking your (fake profile) posts as well. [16] X Research source This stage could last a few weeks, depending on how active your spouse is on social media. You don't want to push the envelope too quickly. You want them to be interested in you. Keep in mind that this isn't likely to work if your spouse is involved in an affair with someone they know. They might not take the bait if they're not pursuing random encounters."

If they're not responding to your comments to the extent you'd like, you might get them talking if you slip into their DMs. Be careful not to do this when you're both in the same house together, though—you don't want them to catch you! [17] X Research source You might want to enlist a friend to help you out with the chatting, especially if you're at home together a lot. That way, your fake profile can be available more often. Watch your spouse for changes in their behavior that indicate they're trying to keep this fake profile a secret, such as keeping their phone close to them or logging out of their social media as soon as you enter the room.

When you think you have enough evidence, it's time to have a sit-down talk with your spouse about what's been going on. Start by telling them that you know they've been unfaithful, then mention the profile you constructed. [19] X Research source Be prepared for them to be angry at you for setting them up. While it's certainly not illegal, it's not the most ethical way to catch someone cheating and they have the right to feel upset about it. They already know about the conversations they had with the fake profile, so you don't have to go into detail about that. But you might mention the suspicions that led you to create it in the first place. Present any evidence or other signs you noticed before you set up the profile to show that you had reason to believe they were cheating before you set up the profile to catch them."

[20] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. Cheating doesn't always signify the end of a relationship. If you both can get honest and talk about what was missing in your relationship and what you want to change, it can also become a new beginning. Don't expect, though, that you will immediately be able to trust your spouse again. Building trust back takes time, so be patient.
