      "title": "Read the Bible and the Catechism to learn about Catholicism.",
      "content": "Read the Bible and the Catechism to learn about Catholicism. Before you take the plunge, it’s important to understand what you’re getting into. The best place to start is the Catholic Church’s main literature—the Catechism and the Bible. Reading the Bible needs no introduction. The Catechism, though, is more or less the entire doctrine (beliefs) of the Church, and every baptism candidate reads it anyway. Best to start now! [1] X Research source If time isn't on your side, read Genesis and the Gospels. You'll get a good grasp on the creation story and the story of Jesus. What's more, when you do talk to a priest and express your interest, it'll be clear you've done your homework."

    {
      "title": "Pray to explore your own faith and belief.",
      "content": "Pray to explore your own faith and belief. Just because you're not a seasoned veteran of the Catholic church doesn't mean you can't pray . And it definitely doesn't mean God can't hear you! There’s no wrong way to pray—talk silently or out loud to God, or recite traditional prayers. Note how it feels. If it makes you calm and contemplative, that’s a good sign! Prayer is part of your “period of inquiry,” in which you decide whether or not baptism is right for you."

    {
      "title": "Attend a mass and inquire about baptism at the parish.",
      "content": "Attend a mass and inquire about baptism at the parish. Before you commit, it also helps to attend a few Catholic masses, to get a feel for the rituals and culture of the Church. Look up Catholic parishes near you, and attend a service —all are welcome, Catholic or not. It might be best to go with a friend, who can explain what’s happening. Then, if you enjoy the church, contact its parish office and request information on their baptismal process. [2] X Research source You’re not “locked in” to one church once you’ve been baptized there, but it’s good to get initiated into Catholicism in a setting you enjoy and feel comfortable in. Feel free to attend masses at several parishes to find the one that best suits you. Each parish is different, with a different community and even slightly different mass proceedings."

    {
      "title": "Apply for the parish’s RCIA program to get started.",
      "content": "Apply for the parish’s RCIA program to get started. RCIA stands for Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults , and is a guided program that leads baptism candidates through the entire process, offering classes, mentoring, community, and guidance along your journey to baptism. [3] X Research source When you call your parish, ask about its RCIA program, and how you might enroll. RCIA is often seasonal, culminating in baptism during the spring. Different programs run on different schedules, but you may need to wait for the next year’s RCIA program to enroll. Note that if you’re already baptized Christian, but not Catholic, you may not need to go through RCIA, and the whole process will probably be different than if you’re unbaptized. This varies by parish."

    {
      "title": "Chat with a priest about your background and intentions.",
      "content": "Chat with a priest about your background and intentions. Before you can enroll in RCIA, you’ll likely have an interview with a priest, deacon, or other important member in the parish. They’ll ask you about your background, your knowledge of Catholicism, and intentions surrounding getting baptized. If they think you’re ready, they’ll formally enroll you in RCIA, and start you on a “precatechumenate process,” in which you’ll attend mass and pray as you prepare for initiation into the church. [4] X Research source Otherwise, the priest will tell you where to start your journey of faith, offer helpful resources, and suggest you return once you’ve learned a little more. Don’t worry—you haven’t been turned down, you just have more time to learn! After, you and the others going into RCIA will attend a mass where you’ll announce your intentions through the Rite of Acceptance into the Order of Catechumens and the Rite of Welcoming."

    {
      "title": "Attend RCIA classes to learn about and deepen your faith.",
      "content": "Attend RCIA classes to learn about and deepen your faith. With your fellow candidates, you’ll learn the history of the Church, the beliefs and values of the Catholic Church, and the proper order of sacraments and the celebration of mass. During this stage, many classes have you attending mass for only part of the time, leaving before communion, as you may not receive Eucharist until you have entered the Church. [5] X Research source This stage is called the “catechumenate” stage, when you learn about the Church itself, what it stands for, and what it means to be Catholic. You’ll receive anointing, participate in prayers, and become involved with the community at large. Not to mention, your class will become closer and closer and do things on their own time."

      "title": "Complete the RCIA semester with a sponsor.",
      "content": "Complete the RCIA semester with a sponsor. Most RCIA classes take place over the course of one liturgical year. That way, you get to experience all the feasts, fastings, and holidays. In this time, you'll receive a sponsor to guide you and answer questions of faith—or, if you have one in mind, you can choose one to work with. [6] X Research source During this time, you may be asked to clarify your marriage status. If you are divorced but have not received an annulment, you’ll need to obtain one before becoming Catholic. If you are married outside the Catholic church, you may be asked to get \"remarried\" (or have your marriage \"blessed\"), which can often be done by appointment."

    {
      "title": "Begin the period of purification and enlightenment.",
      "content": "Begin the period of purification and enlightenment. Once the end of the liturgical cycle nears, you will be deemed an “elect.\" This is the part where you'll prepare for three public celebrations: the Rite of Election, the Call to Continuing Conversion, and the deal-clincher at the Easter Vigil. During this time, you’ll contemplate your faith and decide with your sponsor and peers if you’re ready for baptism. [7] X Research source This period often occurs during Lent, the liturgical season that precedes Easter. It often involves a retreat and a period of intense prayer, and the memorization of prayers like “The Apostles’ Creed.” During this process, elects will undergo “scrutiny,” which is a process of self-evaluation where you examine your past sins and come to understand them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Become baptized fully into the Catholic Church.",
      "content": "Become baptized fully into the Catholic Church. In most RCIA programs, you’ll be baptized during the Easter Vigil Mass, the crowning ceremony of the liturgical year. You’ll be anointed with holy water while your sponsor stands beside you, you’ll profess your faith, and all your past sins are washed away. After, you’re an official member of the Catholic Church, ready to receive other sacraments. RCIA will also prepare you for your first communion, first confession, and confirmation, which make you a “full” member of the Catholic Church and often also occur during or after the Vigil. There aren’t any special speeches you’ll have to give. All baptism—and any sacrament—asks of you is that you stand present to receive it with an honest and open heart."

      "title": "Begin the period of mystagogy to learn even more.",
      "content": "Begin the period of mystagogy to learn even more. Mystagogy is the period just after baptism where your reflect on your faith journey, learn even more about your faith, and grow closer to God . Formally, it ends around Pentecost, but in reality, it’s a life-long process also called “postbaptismal catechesis” by which you continually explore your faith through prayer and learning. [8] X Research source Some churches may continue to guide you for up to a year. You're still considered a newbie and may ask all the questions you need!"

      "title": "You don’t need to be baptized again, but can take RCIA.",
      "content": "You don’t need to be baptized again, but can take RCIA. Protocol for baptized Christians converting to Catholicism varies by diocese, but Catholic doctrine says that baptism is a one-and-done deal: if you’re already baptized Christian, there’s no need to do it all over again. Instead, you’ll perform a Catholic profession of faith in a ceremony much like a baptism, but not officially a baptism. [9] X Research source Your parish may still recommend going through RCIA in order to learn and encounter all that Catholicism means, but your education may be more relaxed. Ask your parish office for their individual protocol regarding already-baptized converts."
