      "content": "Know the depth of the frost line in your area. The frost line is the depth to which the ground freezes in winter, taken over an average of a number of years. Some building codes require that when you build a deck, the support posts be sunk to a depth below the frost line. Even if it isn't required, sinking the support posts to this depth will keep the deck from buckling when the ground expands and swells when the water in it freezes. [3] X Research source"

Your deck can either be free-standing or attached to the house. Although some building codes may be more relaxed on free-standing decks, most people find it more convenient to have their decks attached to the house. [5] X Research source If you build your deck onto the house, you'll want to know where the rim joists and wall studs are located so you can secure the deck's ledger board, the support beam that attaches it to the house, to either of them. The size of your deck will determine the number of footings and posts you'll need to support the joists and deck boards, as well as the size and spacing of the joists and the size of the deck boards. Joists can be spaced 12, 16 or 24 inches (30, 40 or 60 centimeters) apart, however a spacing of 24 inches is most common; common sizes for joists and deck boards are listed under \"Things You'll Need.\" The height at which you build your deck determines whether you need to include railings, posts and steps. You won't need them for a deck built just above the ground, but you will if it is higher than that. Making a preliminary sketch of what you have in mind will help you in lining up materials and construction advice."

If you plan to have the joists rest on this beam instead (a dropped beam), you'll only need to have marks across the top for reference. [8] X Research source Most building codes require the opposite beam to be twice or three times as thick as the interior joists, so as with the rim joists, you'll have to cut multiple beams and sandwich them side-by-side. (If the deck is to be a free-standing deck, the ledger board beam would also have to be sandwiched with one or two other beams for strength.)"

Measure the deck frame from the outside edge of one rim joist to the outside edge of the other and add the width of any skirting or length of any overhang to it. Cut the first two deck boards to this length, then cut off the length of any overhang from the board that will be laid next to the house. (Subsequent boards need not be cut to this length, but can be laid down first and cut flush with the first two boards later.) Set the first board against the house sheathing and the next board against it if wet and the width of a 16-penny nail apart from it if dry. Attach the boards to the joists with two nails or screws. Straighten the boards as you go with a flat bar. [14] X Research source If you're building a wide deck, you can cut multiple deck boards to span the distance between the rim joists, with the places where two boards meet falling in the middle of a joist. Stagger these joints between each row of decking to make the deck look nicer. Periodically measure the distance from the front of the deck to each end of the last board laid. They should be equal; if not, decrease the gaps between boards slightly on the longer side and increase them slightly on the shorter side until the distances are equal again. If the last deck board is wider than the space to lay it, either narrow it or use a narrower board of the same type of decking material. If the board is narrower than the space available, take a wider board and narrow it as necessary."

If the quotient is a whole number, use the quotient as the number of steps, with a rise of 7 inches (17.5 centimeters). If the quotient includes a fraction, round to the nearest whole number to get the number of steps and divide that number into the deck height to get the rise in inches. Divide the rise into 75 to get the approximate length for each step. [15] X Research source You'll need to have a stringer at either end of the staircase to attach the steps to and another stringer in the center if you have a wide or tall staircase. Lay the first stringer out with a framing square to find the rise and run, then transfer the marks to the other stringers. Cut out the step supports, then brace the stringers together and nail them to the deck's rim joist before securing them permanently with lag screws. Cut the steps to have a 3/4-inch (1.9-centimeter) overhang to either side of the stringer assembly to channel rain away from the stringers. Attach them to the stringers with screws or nails."

      "content": "Build and install deck railings, if necessary. If your deck is more than a step high, you'll want or need to have deck railings to prevent falls. Begin by installing the corner and stair posts, plumbing them and securing them first with glue, then with either lag screws or carriage bolts. The remaining pieces—top rails, bottom rails and spindles—may be attached individually or assembled into sections and then installed as units. [16] X Research source Measure the distance between posts to find the length of the rails and cut them to that length. Vertical spindles usually need to be spaced to no more than 4 inches (10 centimeters) apart and should be placed closer together if it will create even spacing over the entire deck. [17] X Research source They can be attached to the rails with nails or screws, while the rails themselves attach to the posts with angle screws. (Use wooden blocks to prop up the rail sections while screwing them in.) Cut the stair posts to the correct height and angle with the help of a framing square, then install the bottom stair rails and hand rails. Figure the length of the stair rails by dividing the stair rise by the run, multiplying by the deck rail length, squaring the result, adding the square of the deck rail length and take the square root of the result. Cut the spindles to the right length, angled for the slope of the rail and install as described above for the deck spindles."
