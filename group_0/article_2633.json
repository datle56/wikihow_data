      "content": "Pass him a note in the hall. Most everyone has a phone nowadays, so passing a note can seem a little out-of-date. The fact that note passing isn’t as common is what makes it fun and flirty.

Wait to pass a note in the hall or during lunch. The note can say anything you want. Short and sweet is flirtier than a sappy, long love letter, though.
