      "content": "Understand how muscle building works. When you exercise, the strain of lifting weights rips your muscle fibers. As soon as you stop working out your body goes into repair mode, starting a process known as “protein synthesis.” As your body rebuilds, it adds additional cells to prepare your body for further strain, and this is what makes your body bigger and stronger. [1] X Research source The inverse is also true—if you don’t work out, then your body spends less energy building new muscle cells. Thus, your muscles slowly become weaker without use."

      "content": "Rest at least two days before working out the same muscle group. Building muscle is essentially a healing process – after you lift your muscle fibers tear, and your body rebuilds them stronger than before. But if you interrupt this process by lifting the same weights multiple days in a row prevents your muscles from healing properly, which stunts growth and leads to injury."

It also gives you a mental and physical break that can help your keep your energy and enthusiasm up during the rest of the week’s workouts. Resting your joints, muscles, and ligaments helps you stay healthier in the long term. A light jog or bike ride is a great way to still get a “workout” in while still having a rest day. Don’t worry about “missing” the chance to get stronger on a rest day. All high-level training programs, from NFL athletes to Olympians, incorporate rest days. [2] X Research source"

The easiest way to do this is to dedicate certain days to certain muscle groups, like “Chest and Shoulders” one day and “Biceps and Back” the other. For example, you might plan on working out 5 days a week with a plan like this: Day 1: Chest, triceps, and abs Day 2: Shoulders and back Day 3: Biceps, chest, and abs. Day 4: Rest or light cardio Day 5: Chest, triceps Day 6: Biceps, back, and abs. Day 7: Rest or light cardio Reader Poll: We asked 590 wikiHow readers what type of exercise they enjoy the most during arm workouts, and 72% said weightlifting. [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Eat a source of protein with every meal when lifting. Protein synthesis requires protein, and the more your body has available to use the faster your muscles will grow after a workout. Many serious lifters and body builders drink protein shakes, after every workout to promote muscle growth.To make a protein shake, simply mix in 1-2 tablespoons of protein powder with water, fruit, yogurt, and ice in a blender. Or, add natural sources of protein to your diet: Breakfast: Eggs, peanut butter and toast, yogurt Lunch/Dinner: Chicken, fish, red meat, beans Snacks: Hummus, protein/power bars, peanut butter.

While a good trainer, trusted friend, or doctor can help fix specific issues, some things to focus on include: Keep your back straight. Focus on keeping your chest puffed up and your shoulder blades back, as if you are a superhero. Your lower back should rarely bend. Never fully extend your joints. Instead, push the lift until your joint is just slightly bent before returning to rest position. Stop when you feel pain. \"No pain, no gain\" is a myth. An exercise should be hard, but sharp pain in your muscles or joints means you are doing something wrong. [5] X Research source"

A good benchmark is to shoot for a weight that is difficult to move on the 8th, 9th, and 10th, reps. This means you are challenging yourself without risking injury. You should struggle a bit on the last few reps, but you should be able to push through it to lift the weight. [6] X Research source"

You need to do multiple reps in a row to build muscles, as this is what strains your muscles and promotes growth, aim for at least 10 reps of every exercise. More reps at a lower weight are great to build toned, lean muscle. Less reps at higher weights are great to build big muscles, but can be dangerous for beginning lifters.

Instead of trying to do 60 push-ups at once, which requires a large amount of strength and stamina, aim for 3 sets for 20 push-ups instead. Sets allow your muscles to quickly recover, allowing you to lift more weight in the second and third set than if you tried to do 30 reps at once. Taking too long, however, prevents your muscles from feeling challenged and truly growing. [8] X Research source Don’t take more than 30 seconds to 3 minutes between sets.

A compound lift is an exercise that uses multiple muscles at once, like bench-presses (chest, triceps, shoulders) or pull-ups (back, biceps, lats). Specific exercises, like biceps curls, target one muscle at a time.
