      "content": "Address situational issues. Deal with the cause for involuntary childlessness in order to fully acclimate to a life without children. If you want children but have an unwilling partner, the decision to not have children can put a great deal of stress on the relationship. It may be difficult to avoid withholding resentment toward your partner, and you will need to rebuild the relationship once you learn to cope with not having children. Work through relationship issues with the help of a couples therapist. Keep communication clear with your partner. Tell them that having kids is very important to you, and ask why they don't want kids. Then listen carefully. Try to find some middle ground: would they be okay with having kids in five years? What about deciding to wait, and to discuss it again a few years from now? Try to find a solution that can satisfy you both. If you are with the right partner, and you feel content with that relationship and you're both on the same boat, you are more likely to have an understanding of what kind of life you want to live together. This will make it easier to make a decision regarding children. In order to accept not having kids due to infertility, it is important that you not place blame on yourself or your partner. Take time to recover physically and emotionally from any medical treatments you and/or your partner may have endured and recognize that the stress from those treatments is likely complicating your ability to cope with not having children."
