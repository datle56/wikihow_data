      "content": "Ask your family about your own cultural heritage. Depending on who your parents are and where you live, you might be connected to several different cultures! All of these different cultures make up who you are and give you roots in your community as well as in the world. Understanding how your culture affects you helps you understand how other people's cultures might give them a different perspective on the world. [1] X Trustworthy Source Kansas University Center for Community Health and Development Community-based research center focused on supporting public health development and education Go to source Culture comes from all sorts of different facets of life—region, locality, state, country, religion, ethnicity, language, race, and others. If you want to dig into your own background, start a family tree using an online database of historical documents and records, such as Ancestry . While these services typically require a subscription, you can often get free access through your local library. Explore museums and talk to community leaders to get a better understanding of the heritage and culture in the area where you live."

[2] X Trustworthy Source Kansas University Center for Community Health and Development Community-based research center focused on supporting public health development and education Go to source It's cool to ask people you don't know too, but try to keep your questions in context.

[8] X Research source For example, if animal rights are important to you, you might check the PETA Beauty without Bunnies list to make sure you're using cruelty-free beauty products.
