      "content": "Stop what you’re doing. One of the best ways to calm down if you’re already feeling stressed is to stop interacting with the stressor, if possible. Sometimes, even taking a few seconds before you head back into the situation can be enough to help you cool down. Try counting to ten, or taking 3-5 deep breaths before you reply in a heated conversation or situation. Take a break. For example, if an argument with your spouse is getting heated, stop and excuse yourself for a moment by saying something like, “I’m feeling a little overwhelmed right now. I need to take a 15-minute break before we continue discussing this.” Go to a different place, focus on breathing deeply, and recite a calming mantra, such as “I can handle this calmly. I can do this.”"

When we’re stressed, sometimes our bodies interpret the stress as an attack and kick us into “fight or flight mode.” This stimulates the release of hormones like adrenaline, which constrict your blood vessels, make your breathing rapid and shallow, and boost your heart rate. [1] X Research source Over time, this panic response can become a habit for your brain in what’s known as “automatic reactivity.” [2] X Research source Slowing down and focusing on the individual physical responses you’re experiencing can help you learn to identify what it feels like when you’re stressed to the max. Studies also show that this conscious process of noticing what’s going on in your body can help retrain your brain’s automatic habits. [3] X Research source Notice each thing that is going on in your body but try to avoid judging it. For example, if you’re worried about doing well on a final exam that’s in just a few minutes, you might notice to yourself, “My face feels hot and flushed. My heart is beating very fast. My palms feel sweaty. I feel nauseated.” Try to keep your noticing these things as neutral as possible."

When you’re stressed, you may unconsciously tighten and tense your muscles, which can make you feel even more stressed and “wound up.” Using progressive muscle relaxation , or PMR, can help release that tension and get you feeling more calm and relaxed. PMR focuses on consciously tensing and then releasing muscles in groups. [8] X Research source There are several free guided PMR routines online. Berkeley has a script you can follow along with. [9] X Research source MIT has a free 11-minute audio guide to doing PMR. [10] X Research source Find a quiet, comfortable place if you can. If this is not possible, you can still do some PMR techniques. Loosen tight clothing if possible. Sit comfortably or lie down (although lying down may relax you so much that you fall asleep!). Breathe evenly as you do your PMR groups. Begin with the muscles in your face, as many people carry stress in their face, neck, and shoulder area. Start by opening your eyes as wide as they will go for 5 seconds, then release the tension. Squeeze your eyes shut tightly for 5 seconds, then release the tension. Give yourself 10 seconds to notice how these areas feel. Move to the next group. Purse your lips tightly for 5 seconds, then release. Smile as wide as you can for 5 seconds, then release. Again, let yourself enjoy the sensation of relaxation for 10 seconds before moving on. Continue to tense muscle groups for 5 seconds and then release the tension. Give yourself a 10-second relaxation break between groups. Progress through the rest of your muscle groups (if time allows): neck, shoulders, arms, chest, stomach, buttocks, thighs, lower legs, feet, and toes. If you don't have time for a full PMR release, try to do it with just your facial muscles. You can also try a quick hand massage , since we often carry a lot of tension in our hands."

However, if you are often feeling this stress, this suggests it is more than a temporary “bump” that’s causing it. Do you feel like stress is part of your identity or a “normal” part of your life? For example, perhaps you think, “My family is full of worriers. That’s just how we are” or “I just live a stressful life, that’s all.” This type of thinking can make it seem like there’s nothing you can do to manage your stress. Do you feel like your stress is others’ fault or responsibility? For example, you might blame the stress about a college essay on the teacher’s strict standards, rather than your procrastination.

You can’t change the past, but you can respond to the present and prepare for the future. Constantly rehashing something that happened in the past can be a sign of rumination, an unhealthy thinking habit where you repeat a “broken record loop” of negative ideas. This can cause anxiety and depression. [15] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source It is also unproductive because ruminating doesn’t teach you anything about the past experience or help you problem-solve for the future. Instead, if you catch yourself stressing about something that has already happened, take a moment to remind yourself that you cannot change the past. However, you can learn and grow from it, and you can use its lessons to do better in the future. For example, if you find yourself thinking, “Why do my partners always break up with me? I’m just a loser,” this is unhelpful and it could definitely cause you stress. Try thinking about your past in a more productive way. For example, you could examine your past relationships for trends, such as the type of person you generally date, your communication styles, or events that surrounded each breakup. You may find patterns that help you understand what’s going on and make new plans for future relationships.

However, we can get so wrapped up in anticipating the future that we stress out and forget to live in the present. This type of thinking isn’t helpful, but you can learn to change it. Remember: the future isn’t set. [16] X Research source A common type of worry about the future is “catastrophizing,” where you predict the worst possible scenario for any event, even minor ones. For example, if you’re feeling stressed about an upcoming exam, catastrophizing could look like this: “If I don’t make a good grade on that test, I’m going to fail the course. I could even fail the semester. If I fail the semester I will lose my scholarship and I won’t be able to go to college anymore. I’ll end up with no money and no job and I’ll have to live under a bridge in a box.” Obviously, this is an extreme example, but it illustrates the kind of thinking that can happen. One way to challenge this is to imagine the absolute worst thing that could actually happen. [17] X Research source For example, in the above scenario, the worst thing might be that you do indeed fail out of that college and have to move back in with mom and dad. Then, consider whether you could handle it. Chances are almost always yes. Finally, consider the real likelihood that this will occur. In this case, it’s pretty slim: a failed test does not equal failing a class, which does not equal failing out of college, etc. You can also challenge catastrophizing by stopping yourself at each “conclusion” and finding logical evidence and counterpoints for it. For example, if you fail the exam, you might fail the course -- or you might be able to retake the exam, or bring up your grade for extra credit."

In your mind, count to five seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth, for another five seconds. Repeat this breathing pattern until you feel comfortable with it. Think about something else. Get your mind off the stress by thinking about something that makes you happy, such as your kids or spouse (provided they’re not the cause of the current stress), or by concentrating on the things you have planned for the day. Visualize relaxing things, such as a deserted island or a country road. Close your eyes and try to picture even minor details about the imaginary place, and you can put yourself in that situation instead of the one you’re in. Get away from the cause of the stress . If you can physically escape the stress trigger, do so. Leave the room or pull off the road for a moment to put things in perspective. Acknowledge that anxiety is not always bad. Sometimes, anxiety or stress can be a clue that you’re considering a significant or even unhelpful decision. For example, you might feel stressed about selling all of your belongings, buying a school bus, and living a nomadic life in the desert.

      "content": "Choose your response. In general, you have two responses when you face stress: you can choose to change either the situation or your response to it. Even if you’re powerless to change the source of your stress, you have the power to choose how you’ll respond to it. You can choose to learn new techniques to respond in the moment. You can choose to refocus your thinking. Consider some questions when deciding your approach. Can you avoid it? You can sometimes avoid stressors, thereby changing the situation. For example, if you frequently find yourself stressed by your busy schedule, you can examine your agenda for things you could drop. You could also learn to say “no” to requests more frequently, or ask for help. Can you alter it? Some stressors can’t be avoided, but you can alter your approach to them and thus change the situation. For example, you and your romantic partner will have disagreements at some point; this is natural for all relationships, even if you’re the most loving couple in the world. However, these don’t have to be stressful if you alter your approach, such as seeking compromise or expressing your feelings directly instead of using passive aggression. Can you adapt to it? Sometimes you can change your approach or behaviors to reduce stress, even if you can’t change the situation. For example, if you frequently find yourself stressed by rush-hour traffic, you can’t change that: you have to get to work, and rush-hour traffic is a worldwide problem. However, you could alter your approach to this stressor by taking public transit to work, finding a different route home, or leaving a little earlier or later in the day. Can you accept it? Some things you simply cannot change. You cannot change or control others’ feelings, actions, or reactions. You can’t change the fact that it rained on your wedding day, or that your boss is a selfish jerk no matter how hard you try to be a good communicator.

You may get so wrapped up in needing to be “perfect” (which is both highly subjective and always unattainable) that you find yourself unable to actually do what you need to do because you’re worried it won’t turn out as you hope. Fortunately, you can learn some techniques to help you overcome procrastination and the stress it can cause. [19] X Research source Remind yourself that you cannot control outcomes, only actions. You might be so stressed about what your professor will think about your essay that you can’t face writing it. Remember that you can control what you do: you can do your best and write your best essay. The rest of it is out of your hands. Acknowledge that “perfection” is an unrealistic standard. No human can attain perfection and our ideas of what “perfect” means are highly variable anyway. Instead, aim for your personal best and avoid making assumptions about yourself based on outcomes. For example, a perfectionist might see a B+ on an essay as a “failure” because it is not a perfect grade. However, someone who is aiming for her personal best could reframe this: she knows she did the best she could and she can be proud of that effort, regardless of what the grade on the essay says. Watch out for “should” statements. These insidious thoughts can encourage you to beat yourself up over things that are out of your control. For example, you might have the thought, “A good student should never make mistakes.” However, that is an unrealistic standard that no one can meet. Instead, try a “can” statement: “I can perform to my best ability and honor my effort, even when I make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes in life.”"

It stands for: [25] X Research source R ecognize what is going on. Consciously notice and recognize whatever is going on right now, in this moment. This means acknowledging feelings or thoughts that seem negative as well as those that seem positive. For example, “I am feeling very angry and stressed right now.” A llow the experience to be there as it is. This means that you acknowledge whatever is going on in your mind and heart without judgment. It’s tempting to judge yourself for seemingly “negative” feelings or reactions or to try and avoid or repress those things. Instead, notice them and acknowledge even the unpleasant thoughts and feelings as valid parts of your experience. For example, “I feel so angry with my partner but also ashamed that I snapped at her.” I nvestigate with kindness. This crucial part involves showing yourself and others compassion as you investigate your present moment. Ask yourself what your thoughts and feelings reflect about your beliefs and needs right now. For example, if you are feeling angry with your partner and ashamed that you snapped at her, you might direct harsh judgment toward the both of you: “I’m a bad person for yelling at her. She makes me so mad.” Instead, try to approach both people with kindness: “I yelled at her, and I’m feeling ashamed by that because I love her. I made a mistake that I can acknowledge. My partner said things that made me angry, but I know she also loves me. We can work together to solve this issue.” N atural awareness arises from not over-personalizing the experience. This means extricating yourself from that tendency to generalize about yourself based on one experience, such as “I’m a bad person” or “I’m a loser.” Your feelings are part of your experience, but they are not you.
