For the purposes of this example, let's assume that the measurement you want to convert is in column A and you'd like to see the conversion results in column B (but really this method will work for any two columns). To label column A , click on cell A1 and type in the original unit (the one you'd like converted, e.g. inches, meters, or yards). This is also called the “from_unit.” For example: click on cell A1 and type “Inches”. In this example, we will convert 12 (number) inches (from_unit) to feet (to_unit). Excel’s convert function converts a “from unit,” into a “to-unit” (the unit you are converting the measurement to). Labeling your columns will help you organize your data."
