If your cat violently opposes her bath, and is relatively clean, you might want to reconsider. It could turn out to be a costly bath for you in terms of cuts, and a traumatic experience for your cat. Consider: The length of your cat's coat. Environment -- is your cat an indoor or outdoor cat? Self-grooming behavior. Does your cat already take care of grooming adequately. [2] X Research source"

Make sure to go slowly and to not spook your cat. Make sure to re-wet the towel when appropriate. Start with a small wash rag for the rear area. Use another towel when you're done with the rear area, as to not spread fecal matter. Pay special attention to the rear area, especially on kittens. This area is often cleaned by a mother cat, and if she’s not around, you’ll have to give your kitten extra care. Make sure you clean your kitty’s belly, although they won’t be happy with this. Make sure to clean her armpits and in between her toes. As you approach your cat’s head and face, move slowly and don’t be rough. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Decide if you want to use shampoo. This is up to you. Often times, shampooing cats is not necessary. You should also avoid using shampoo with kittens, unless they have fleas or the vet recommends it. If you do use shampoo, do so after you’ve already rubbed your cat down with the damp towel and wet her already. Fill a sink with water and put a little bit of shampoo in the water. Make sure that you don’t have many suds. Mix the water. Dip a fresh towel in the sink and dampen it with the shampoo water. Rub down your cat with the shampoo, beginning at her neck and moving toward her tail. Pay special attention to in between toes, under the belly and armpits, and her rear. Use a clean wash rag for extra dirty areas. Avoid contact with your cat’s eyes.

Wipe in the direction of her fur, the way she would lick herself. By following the grain of her fur you will make her feel more comfortable."

Even the most docile, sweet kitty can do serious damage when she is anxious and trying to get away from you. Trimming kitty's claws can reduce the blood-letting of not only her human, but of herself whenever her claw gets caught in something. Take this opportunity to reduce the damages done to furniture. It is extremely important that you are careful during this step ; as there are Blood Vessels running through the middle of each kitty's claw called the Quick . Cutting this part of the claw can cause excessive bleeding . (NB: Declawing is amputating the front part of a cat's toes and is highly-discouraged). Trimming kitty's claws will spare you from walking away from this bath with dozens of cuts."
