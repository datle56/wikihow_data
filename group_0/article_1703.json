      "content": "Leo’s intensity can contrast with Cancer’s tender-hearted instincts. True to their element, Leos are often ruled by fire, passion, and everything hot—especially when it comes to intimacy. As sensitive water signs, Cancers don’t share these same desires and goals in the bedroom, and prefer to take things one step at a time. Compatibility Tip: Before things get too hot and heavy, sit down together and look for a way to satisfy both of your desires. Figure out what your deal-breakers are, and see if there’s a way you both can meet each other’s needs without venturing too far from your respective comfort zones."

      "content": "Cancers value privacy and domesticity, while Leos value their social lives. Both Cancers and Leos are perfectly content spending time at home together, especially if the crab is showering the lion with love and attention. But while Cancer is happy to fill their schedule with this tender, private quality time, Leos often long for social time of their own. The ultimate extroverts of the zodiac, Leos feel most refreshed and content when spending time with others. Compatibility Tip: Make a weekly schedule that meets both of your social needs. Tuesday and Thursday night can be special date nights at home, while Friday and Saturday night is a chance for Leo to go out with friends."

      "content": "Leos and Cancers don’t usually see eye-to-eye. In any given topic or discussion, there’s a good chance that Cancer and Leo will both choose opposing sides. These different opinions definitely aren’t bad, but it can make it hard to have a productive, enriching conversation. Compatibility Tip: Try exploring topics that you don’t usually talk about! Even if you both disagree, it’s more fun to explore new horizons than it is to stick with the same sore topics."
