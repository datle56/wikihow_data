      "title": "He involves you in his life and wants to spend time with you.",
      "content": "He involves you in his life and wants to spend time with you. While an Aquarius tend to value his “alone” time, that’ll start to change when he falls in love. He’ll go out of his way to hang out with you, ask you to spend time with his close-knit inner circle of friends, and even invite you over to his home—which is significant because Aquarians are protective of their space. It means he’s invested in you! An Aquarius usually has a small group of close friends (rather than a large circle of casual ones). If he wants you to meet them, it’s because you’re an essential part of his life. Keep in mind that Aquarius guys are still independent by nature; if he ever does ask for a little alone time, let him have it. He’ll appreciate your understanding."

      "title": "He’s always happy to see you.",
      "content": "He’s always happy to see you. While Aquarians are outgoing and love to meet new people, they can also get bored and move on quickly. If your Aquarius guy is over the moon every time he sees you and only seems to get more eager every time you’re together, he’s definitely falling for you. The deeper his feelings are, the more consistent he’ll be with his affection. As an air sign, Aquarius can be erratic and inconsistent—especially at the beginning of a relationship. When he starts spending time with you regularly, he’s falling for you. Try to match your Aquarius guy’s energy and show him you’re interested without overwhelming him . Stay upbeat, so he knows that he makes you happy, too."

      "title": "He’s curious about you and wants to know your opinions.",
      "content": "He’s curious about you and wants to know your opinions. When an Aquarius is in love with you, he’ll spend hours talking to you about anything and everything—from politics to music.

When he asks you questions, engage with the conversation . Be ready to talk about anything and express your ideas freely. Don’t push yourself to be anything you’re not. Just be honest and open, and let him see all of your most unique qualities. Aquarius loves individuality, so he’s sure to fall for you. Aquarius longs for intellectual stimulation, which is why the easiest way to his heart is deep conversation and open-minded exchanges of ideas."

      "title": "He shares more about himself and lets his guard down with you.",
      "content": "He shares more about himself and lets his guard down with you. An Aquarius guy transforms when he falls in love; he’ll likely keep things casual and aloof when you’re just a friend, but those barriers disappear when things get serious. He’ll let himself be vulnerable and tell you about his hopes, dreams, and wildest ideas because he trusts you with them wholeheartedly. [1] X Research source Aquarius is ruled by Uranus, the planet of invention, which makes Aquarius an innovator and humanitarian. He wants to make the world a better place and share his progressive ideas with someone who can appreciate them. Don’t push him to reveal more than he’s ready for, or he might back off. Just listen and accept him for who he is; he’ll adore anyone who embraces his originality with an open mind."

      "title": "He doesn’t flirt with anyone but you.",
      "content": "He doesn’t flirt with anyone but you. Although clever Aquarius guys enjoy swapping flirty, teasing wordplay with people, they’re also loyal. Once an Aquarius realizes he’s falling for you, he’ll start flirting to get your attention. You’ll notice that he isn’t flirty around other people, but he really steps up the flirty banter and teasing comments around you. Reciprocate if you catch him flirting! Aquarius’s intellectual air sign nature makes him much more receptive to playful banter than physical seduction (at first, anyway). Flirt with an Aquarius guy by gently teasing him about how much you like him, sending clever texts, and discussing mutual passions."

Return the favor for your Aquarius and get him something he’ll enjoy. Aquarians like anything that stimulates them mentally, like books and tech gadgets. Alternatively, donate to a cause that’s important to him!"

An Aquarius guy in love might eventually try a little PDA. He’s not the type to kiss you passionately in front of others, but he might start holding your hand more! If you feel the same, give him the intimacy he’s craving when you’re alone. Be physically affectionate and show him his love is reciprocated. Once you have an intimate relationship, ask him about any sexual fantasies he wants to try. But don't feel pressured to do anything you're uncomfortable with!

      "content": "Some Aquarius guys can get overwhelmed by your feelings. If he feels like he’s being pressured to spend more time with you or commit faster than he’s ready for, Aquarius might back off. Aquarians are loyal partners but still independent and need time to themselves.

If he seems distant, give him a little space and focus on being his friend first and foremost. Aquarius likes to blend love and friendships, so tell him that you value his friendship and let him set a pace he’s comfortable with. Pace yourself when it comes to calls and texts, too. Don’t message him more than once until you get a reply."

      "content": "He might not feel like his emotions are reciprocated. Aquarius might act distant after realizing he’s in love if he doesn’t think you feel the same. Aquarian guys want to know that you’re as serious about him as he is about you, so if you’re closed-off emotionally or physically distant, he might just assume he isn’t wanted. Don’t be afraid to make the first move . If you spot signs that your Aquarius is in love, take the initiative and tell him how you feel. Aquarius guys actually like being chased! Be clear about your attraction, too. An Aquarius tends to get lost in thought instead of actually doing things, so it’s important to step up and show him that you’re physically interested in him."

      "content": "Aquarius is most compatible with fellow air signs and fire signs. Libra and Gemini , the air signs, are highly intelligent and best suited for keeping up with Aquarius mentally. Leo , Sagittarius , and Aries (the fire signs) bring out Aquarius’s passionate side. Sagittarius also shares Aquarius’s independent spirit, and Leo is opposite Aquarius on the zodiac wheel—so sparks fly between them! [2] X Research source Two Aquariuses are also compatible .

      "content": "An Aquarian is least compatible with water and earth signs. As water signs, Pisces , Cancer , and Scorpio are deeply emotional and sensitive, which can be a little exhausting for a logical Aquarius. And although earth signs Virgo , Capricorn , and Taurus are more down to earth, they also tend to have very traditional values—which often clashes with Aquarius, the visionary rebel of the zodiac. There’s still no need to worry if your Sun sign isn’t considered compatible with Aquarius . Astrology is about more than just Sun signs; if you compare your astrology charts , you’ll likely find a good match somewhere on it. Even if you don’t have many compatible signs, the most important part of any relationship is making an effort to understand and appreciate one another. So long as you do that, you’ll flourish as a couple!"
