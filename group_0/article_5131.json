[3] X Expert Source Jacqueline Hellyer Licensed Psychosexual Therapist Expert Interview. 15 October 2021. [4] X Research source Latex rubber is the most common condom material. These contraceptives are cheap and effective, but you'll need to use another type if you or your partner is allergic to latex. Lambskin is a natural latex alternative that is incredibly effective at preventing unwanted pregnancy. However, lambskin condoms do not prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. [5] X Research source Polyurethane condoms are stronger and thicker than latex condoms, meaning they’re more expensive. During use, the material heats up to your body temperature, making it feel like you’re not wearing anything. Tactylon condoms are stretchier than other varieties, helping them better conform to the shape of the penis."

      "content": "Some condoms come with pre-applied lubricant, also known as lube. This reduces unwanted friction during sex, making the experience more enjoyable for everyone and preventing the condom from tearing. You can also purchase lube separately. Water and silicone-based lubricants work with most types of condoms, but you should only use oil-based lubricants with polyurethane and tactylon condoms. For added protection, get condoms that come with spermicidal lubricant. The spermicide kills a large portion of the sperm following ejaculation. Be aware that spermicides can sometimes cause side effects like irritation, burning, and urinary infections."

Do not use female condoms and male condoms at the same time. You can insert female condoms up to 8 hours before intercourse. This makes them a great option for people who dislike interrupting foreplay to put a condom on."
