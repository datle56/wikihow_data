      "title": "Wash off all of the parts before you assemble them.",
      "content": "Wash off all of the parts before you assemble them. Soak all of the pieces in a bucket or sink full of warm water and soap. Use a sponge or brush to scrub the inside and outside of the funnel to remove any dust or dirt that may be on the surface. Clean the hoses, connectors, and valves with a sponge to remove dirt from them clean and rinse them off with water. Dry off all of the parts after you clean them. [1] X Research source All of the components need to be sanitized to keep out dust, dirt, bacteria, and other contaminants."

      "title": "Insert a large funnel into a length of 1 inch (2.5 cm) diameter tubing.",
      "content": "Insert a large funnel into a length of 1 inch (2.5 cm) diameter tubing. Use a length of plastic tubing that’s at least 3 feet (0.91 m) long so you can fit an entire can of beer into the beer bong. Slide the narrow end of the funnel into the opening of the tube. Push it as far into the tube as you can. [2] X Research source You can find plastic tubing and funnels at your local hardware, home improvement, and department stores, or online."

    {
      "title": "Slide a hose clamp onto the tubing over the funnel.",
      "content": "Slide a hose clamp onto the tubing over the funnel. A hose clamp looks like a thin metal ring with a screw on the side of it and is used to secure hoses and tubes so they’re airtight. Place a hose clamp on the plastic tubing and slide it down so it’s on top of the funnel inside of the tube. [3] X Research source It’s okay if the clamp fits loosely onto the tube. If the clamp is too tight to fit onto the tube, use a flathead screwdriver to open it up so it can slide onto the tube. You can find hose clamps at hardware stores, home improvement stores, and online."

    {
      "title": "Tighten the clamp over the funnel with a flathead screwdriver.",
      "content": "Tighten the clamp over the funnel with a flathead screwdriver. Hold the hose clamp flush against the bottom of the funnel connected to the plastic tube. Take a flathead screwdriver and turn the screw on the side of the clamp to tighten it. Continue to tighten it until the tube around the end of the funnel is secure and the funnel cannot slide out. [4] X Research source Give the funnel a gentle tug to make sure it’s secure in the tube."

    {
      "title": "Screw plastic hose-to-threaded connectors into the ball valve.",
      "content": "Screw plastic hose-to-threaded connectors into the ball valve. Take 2 plastic connectors with a 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm) diameter and align the threaded side with the opening of the ball valve. Attach a connector to each side of the ball valve by turning them clockwise until they’re tight. [5] X Research source You won’t be able to screw the connector all the way in, so make sure it’s tight and securely connected."

    {
      "title": "Slide a hose clamp onto the tube at the opposite end of the funnel.",
      "content": "Slide a hose clamp onto the tube at the opposite end of the funnel. Take another hose clamp and fit it onto the other end of the tubing so it will be in place to clamp over the connector. Leave it on the tubing so you can move it into place when you attach the valve. [6] X Research source Let the hose clamp hang loosely on the tubing so you can move it into position after you attach the funnel to the valve."

      "title": "Insert the funnel tubing onto the connector on the ball valve.",
      "content": "Insert the funnel tubing onto the connector on the ball valve. Slide the end of the funnel tube onto the ball valve by forcing it onto the connector. The tube should fit snugly but it won’t be fully secure. [7] X Research source Don’t screw the connector so tight into the ball valve that it’s difficult to remove for cleaning."

    {
      "title": "Tighten the hose clamp over the connector with a screwdriver.",
      "content": "Tighten the hose clamp over the connector with a screwdriver. Slide the hose clamp down the tube so it’s on tip of the connector. Then, take a flathead screwdriver and tighten the screw on the hose clamp until the tube is tight and secure over the connector. [8] X Research source Give the ball valve a good tug to make sure it’s attached securely."

      "title": "Attach a 4 in (10 cm) long tube to the other connector.",
      "content": "Attach a 4 in (10 cm) long tube to the other connector. Take a smaller length of 1 inch (2.5 cm) diameter tubing and slide it over the open connector on the ball valve. This will serve as a mouthpiece whenever you use the beer bong. [9] X Research source Don’t clamp the mouthpiece tubing so you can easily remove it to clean it."

      "title": "Use Y valves to connect more tubes to make a multi-person beer bong.",
      "content": "Use Y valves to connect more tubes to make a multi-person beer bong. Fit a Y valve over the bottom of the funnel and connect 2 tubes to it to form a 2 person beer bong. You can also connect a Y valve to those tubes and connect 4 total tubes to the funnel to form a multi-person beer bong! Use Y valves that will fit 1 inch (2.5 cm) diameter tubes. Connect ball valves to the ends of each tube so you can control the flow of liquid. You can find Y valves at hardware stores, home improvement stores, and online."

      "title": "Wipe off the mouthpiece and make sure the ball valve is shut off.",
      "content": "Wipe off the mouthpiece and make sure the ball valve is shut off. Check the switch on the ball valve and look for the “on” and “off” labels. Make sure the switch is in the “off” position. Use a clean cloth to wipe the inside and outside of the mouthpiece. [10] X Research source It’s always a good idea to clean off the mouthpiece of a beer bong before you use it, especially if someone else used it before you. If the switch isn’t labeled, test the beer bong by pouring a little bit of water into the funnel end. If the water flows through the valve, flip the switch so it’s off and pour out the water."

      "title": "Pour a beverage into the funnel slowly.",
      "content": "Pour a beverage into the funnel slowly. Hold the funnel at a slight angle and slowly pour in the beverage so the foam doesn’t build up in the tubing. Continue pouring until the tube is full and the liquid is in the funnel. Try not to overfill the funnel and have the liquid right at the edge or you could spill it. [11] X Research source A foamy liquid is sure to make your stomach hurt and could make you nauseated when you consume it. A little bit of foam is normal, wait a few moments until the foam subsides before you drink it."

      "title": "Raise the funnel overhead to allow it to flow.",
      "content": "Raise the funnel overhead to allow it to flow. Hold the funnel up over your head when you’re ready to use it. Elevating the funnel will allow the liquid to flow right through the tube and valve. [12] X Research source A beer bong uses gravity to help the liquid flow. Try to hold the funnel in a fixed position so the liquid doesn’t slosh around."

    {
      "title": "Put your mouth on the mouthpiece.",
      "content": "Put your mouth on the mouthpiece. Place your lips around the small mouthpiece tubing so it’s you create a seal with your mouth. Don’t allow space between your lips and the tube or it could cause air to mix with the liquid as it enters your mouth. [13] X Research source Mixing air into the liquid could build up pressure in your stomach, which could be painful or make you nauseated."

      "title": "Open the valve on the ball valve to release the beverage.",
      "content": "Open the valve on the ball valve to release the beverage. Take a deep breath and open the valve to start the flow of liquid. Relax your throat to allow gravity to force the liquid directly into your stomach. [14] X Research source When the beer bong is empty, close the valve and pull the mouthpiece out of your mouth. Consider high-fiving your friends around you to celebrate your victory!"
