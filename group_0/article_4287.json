      "title": "Place your choice of chicken into a large pot.",
      "content": "Place your choice of chicken into a large pot. If you'd like to boil a whole chicken, put it into a large stockpot that's at least 8 US quarts (7.6 L) in size. To boil pieces of chicken, put as many as you'd like to cook into a big pot so the pot is about 3/4 full. [1] X Research source If you're making chicken for several people, plan on serving a couple of pieces for each person. For example, plan on boiling 1 thigh and 1 drumstick for each person you want to serve. 1 whole chicken will generally serve 4 to 6 people. You can use boneless skinless chicken breasts or thighs to save time or boil bone-in chicken with the skin on for more flavor."

      "content": "Pour in enough cold water or stock to cover the chicken. The amount of liquid you need will depend on how much chicken you're boiling and the size of your pot. Although you can use water to boil the chicken, using vegetable or chicken stock will give your chicken a lot of flavor. [2] X Research source Boiling in apple juice or apple cider is another great way to add subtle flavor to the chicken."

      "title": "Put a handful of fresh herbs into the pot.",
      "content": "Put a handful of fresh herbs into the pot. Think about how you're going to be serving and seasoning your final dish. Then, rinse a few sprigs of fresh herbs that will complement the meal and add them directly to the pot without chopping them. You can add a handful of parsley, oregano, thyme, or bay, for every 3 or 4 pounds (1.4 or 1.8 kg) of chicken. [3] X Research source For example, if you're using the boiled chicken to make a cold chicken salad, add fresh tarragon to the pot. Use a combination of herbs to give the chicken a greater depth of flavor."

      "content": "Add a variety of vegetables to create a rich flavor. You can put in 2 or 3 vegetables for every 3 or 4 pounds (1.4 or 1.8 kg) of chicken. If you're using aromatic vegetables with a peel, chop them into wedges and add them to the pot along with other aromatic vegetables. Try using: [4] X Research source Garlic Onions Celery"

      "content": "Customize the flavor of the chicken by adding spices. You should season the liquid with plenty of salt to help the chicken become tender. If you're only boiling a few pieces of chicken, try using about 1 teaspoon (5 g) of salt. For a large stockpot full of liquid, use around 1 tablespoon (15 g) of salt. Play around with adding any of these unique spices for 3 to 4 pounds (1.4 to 1.8 kg) of chicken: 1 to 2 dried chilies 1 teaspoon (3 g) of whole peppercorns A 1 inch (2.5 cm) piece of fresh ginger 1 teaspoon (2 g) of cumin 1 teaspoon (2 g) of paprika"

      "content": "Boil a whole chicken for 80 to 90 minutes. Put the lid on the pot and turn the burner to high. When the liquid starts to boil and steam escapes from under the lid, remove the lid and turn the burner down to medium-high so the liquid boils gently. Cook the whole chicken until it reaches 165 °F (74 °C) with an instant-read meat thermometer. [5] X Research source Insert the thermometer into the thickest part of a thigh in order to get an accurate reading. Ensure that you don't touch the thermometer to a bone or the reading might be off."

When steam escapes from under the lid, carefully remove it and turn the burner down to medium-high. Then, boil boneless skinless chicken breasts for 15 to 20 minutes. If you're using bone-in breasts with the skin on, boil them for around 30 minutes. [6] X Research source The breasts are finished once they reach 165 °F (74 °C) with an instant-read meat thermometer."

      "content": "Boil chicken legs for 30 to 40 minutes. Put the lid on the pot and heat the liquid over high heat until it begins to boil. Then, remove the lid and reduce the burner to medium-high so the liquid bubbles gently. Since drumsticks contain bones and lots of muscle, you'll need to boil them for 30 to 40 minutes. [7] X Research source You can insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the chicken leg to see if the temperature has reached 165 °F (74 °C). Don't accidentally touch the thermometer to the bone or the reading will be inaccurate."

Then, take off the lid and turn the burner down to medium-high. If you're using thighs with bones, boil them for up to 45 minutes or boil boneless thighs for about 30 minutes. [8] X Research source The meat should either begin to fall away from the bone or it should reach 165 °F (74 °C) with an instant-read meat thermometer."

If you're trying to remove a whole boiled chicken, try lifting the bottom with a flat spatula and inserting a meat fork into the center of the chicken. Transfer the whole chicken or pieces to a serving platter or cutting board and enjoy the hot boiled chicken. [9] X Research source If you boiled the chicken with herbs or vegetables, discard them since they're probably too mushy to serve."

Take 2 forks and pull against the boiled chicken in opposite directions to shred the meat. [10] X Research source If you'd like to shred a lot of boneless chicken, put the meat into the bowl of a stand mixer. Use the beater attachment and turn on the machine to low. The beaters will gently pull the meat apart."
