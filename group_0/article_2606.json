      "content": "Put effort into basic grooming and your daily appearance. You don’t have to go all-out every day, but try to avoid leaving the house with wet hair, sweat pants, or mismatched socks!

      "content": "Wear clothes that fit well and accentuate your best physical traits. Baggy clothes can look cool, but fitted clothes that show off your best features tend to get more attention and can also make you look more polished. That doesn't mean you have to wear tight jeans, short skirts, and low-cut tops every day, though! Instead, go with clothes that play up your best features. [3] X Research source For example, if your deep blue eyes are your favorite physical trait, wear blue shirts and jackets that accentuate your eye color even more. If you’re proud of your toned arms, rock a tank top or fitted T-shirt to show them off!"

      "content": "Choose clothing that reflects how you want to be desired. If you're looking for a new relationship and you want to appear desirable to potential dates, tailor your clothing choices to that specific scenario. If you're trying to nail an awesome new job or asking for a raise, wear something that makes sense for those expectations. [4] X Research source For example, if you're looking for romance, you might wear something that shows off your body, like skinny jeans or a knit dress. Or you might wear a bright or eye-catching color, like red, to get noticed more quickly! If you're going to a job interview, you want to be desired for your professionalism and skills. You might wear a nice blazer, collared shirt, and dress pants. If you're trying to make a new friend, wear styles or brands you've seen them wear in the past. Having something in common can help you start a conversation or give you something to chat about!"

Studies show that simply smiling in a genuine way can draw people to you like a magnet. The bigger the smile, the more attractive a person tends to look to others! [5] X Research source If you want to look desirable in the dating world, skip the aloof act and try smiling directly at anyone who interests you.

      "content": "Maintain good posture to look your best in any situation. Standing up straight with your shoulders back projects two highly desirable traits: confidence and good physical health. Don't slump your back or shoulders while you’re standing or sitting. Stand tall, angle your chin up, and avoid dropping your chin to your chest. [8] X Research source Looking confident will impress potential romantic partners, friends, and employers alike. Consider consulting a physical therapist if you find it hard to change your posture on your own."

      "content": "Act confident whether you feel that way or not. Stand up straight, look people in the eye when you talk to them, and don't be afraid to start conversations! Even if you don’t feel all that confident on the inside, do your best to project confidence and other people will perceive you that way. Try to avoid being self-deprecating when you’re chatting with others. [9] X Research source You might walk up to a cute guy, smile, and say, “Hi! So you caught my eye from across the room and I couldn’t help but come over and introduce myself.” If you're trying to make a new friend, you could say, \"I just had to walk over and tell you how awesome your outfit looks. I'm really into fashion and your look is so stylish! Who's your favorite designer?\" Keep in mind there's a fine line between appearing confident and seeming arrogant. Try to avoid bragging and over-exaggerating your importance. Reader Poll: We asked 1015 wikiHow readers about what body language they find irresistible, and only 6% said that they're attracted to people who touch their hair . [Take Poll] So while getting touchy-feely too soon may not be the best strategy, you can still convey confidence with solid eye contact and a warm smile."

      "content": "Ask questions and become a great conversationalist. People love to engage, and asking someone thoughtful questions about their life and opinions tends to impress them. It can also make you seem more interesting and pleasant to be around! Stick with open-ended questions and stay away from simple \"yes\" or \"no\" inquiries. Keep the conversation light and avoid prying or overly personal questions. [10] X Research source If you're chatting with someone you're interested in dating, you might ask them questions like, \"What was it like growing up in such a big city?\" or \"What are your favorite things to do during the weekend?\" Use their answers to keep the conversation going! If you're at a job interview, be sure to ask questions that are work-related to show how interested you are in the job. For example, you might ask, \"What is the company culture like here?\" or \"What tasks would I be responsible for each day?\" If you're asked serious questions at a job interview, reply in a tone that matches the questions. You don't want to seem flippant about important questions or serious topics."

Try to see the positive side of things in all situations. Avoid deeply negative conversation topics and try to keep things light in most situations. [12] X Research source Don't gossip or talk badly about others, which can come off as quite unattractive. If you're chatting with a cute guy, don't bring up something depressing you read in the news earlier. Talk about something interesting that you learned recently or tell a funny story. Avoid bringing up controversial topics like religion and politics in a job interview or work setting. You should also change your tone to match the seriousness of questions you're asked at a job interview, but maintain a positive attitude during the conversation."

If you see someone struggling and you’re in a position to help them out, do it! Be willing to truly listen to people when they talk to you about their problems, and offer your support any way you can. [13] X Research source For example, if you see the new girl at school struggling to find her classes, offer to help her out and show her around. You just might make a new friend! If your crush seems upset and it's appropriate for you to do so, consider pulling him off to the side and asking him if he's okay. If he replies with \"I'm fine,\" you can just say, \"Okay, you just seem a little upset. I'm available if you ever need someone to talk to.\""
