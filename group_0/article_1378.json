      "content": "Narrow down your options based on your skill set. Game shows are most often centered around a particular skill. Shows like \"Jeopardy!\" and “Who Wants to be a Millionaire?”, for instance, requires contestants to recall obscure facts, while \"Wheel of Fortune\" tests their ability to solve timed word puzzles. Auditioning for a show that plays to your strengths will increase your chances of walking away a winner. [1] X Research source To figure out what your strong suits are, consider what types of normal games you tend to dominate. If you always beat your friends at Trivial Pursuit, you may be best suited for a game show that tests your trivia skills. If you’re more the athletic type, you’ll be pleased to know that there are also game shows that challenge contestants’ physical abilities, such as “Wipeout” and “Minute to Win It.” [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Determine what sort of prizes you want to win. Game shows typically reward winning contestants with either cash or material prizes, such as new cars, household appliances, or vacation packages. Some shows, like “The Price is Right,” offer a combination of both. Having a specific idea in mind of what you hope to win can help you narrow down which show to go on. [3] X Research source Keep in mind that in the U.S., you’ll be expected to pay taxes on any prizes you win. If you think paying the tax on a high-value item might be hard on you financially, you’ll be better off trying out for a show where cash is the main prize. [4] X Research source International contestants on U.S. game shows may be exempt from paying taxes on prize items, depending on the laws of their home country."

      "title": "Factor in any personal reasons you have for picking a particular show.",
      "content": "Factor in any personal reasons you have for picking a particular show. Attractive prize packages aren’t the only reason to go on a game show. It could be that you’re a lifelong fan of the host, or that you have a relative who once appeared on the same show and you want to continue the family legacy. These or other considerations could end up factoring into your decision. Avid cosplayers, shameless show-offs, and those with a flair for the theatrical might enjoy appearing on “Let’s Make a Deal,” where it’s customary for contestants and audience members to wear elaborate costumes. Becoming a contestant on “Jeopardy!” can give you the chance to prove your intellectual prowess by going head-to-head with other quick thinkers."

      "content": "Keep an eye out for shows that are shot close to you. Unless you’re on vacation or taking time off from work, your game show experience will probably last no longer than an afternoon. Selecting a show that holds tapings in your area or a nearby city will cut down considerably on the time and expense of traveling, which will be especially helpful if you don’t end up winning. [5] X Research source The majority of the big-name game shows are shot in Los Angeles, California, including “Jeopardy!”, “Wheel of Fortune,” “Let’s Make a Deal,” “The Price is Right,” and “Family Feud.” “The Price is Right,” “Wheel of Fortune,” and other shows also hold mobile auditions from time to time. If you catch wind that auditions for one of your favorite shows are coming to your area, find a way to be there."

      "title": "Check to see whether you meet the show’s eligibility requirements.",
      "content": "Check to see whether you meet the show’s eligibility requirements. Some game shows only ask that contestants be 18 years old and not have appeared on another game show in the past year. Other programs have more rigorous standards, such as a minimum age limit of 21 or a refusal to contestants who've appeared on more than 2 shows in the past 5-10 years. You can find out more about a specific game show’s eligibility requirements by reading through the Rules or Frequently Asked Questions section on the show’s official website. [6] X Research source Under no circumstances are you allowed to be affiliated with the show's production company, parent or syndication network, or any of its sponsors or advertisers. [7] X Research source Being a current employee of any of the organizations connected to the show, or being a friend or family member of a current employee, may also disqualify you from appearing."

Visit the website of the game show or the network that carries it and look for a link reading “Become a Contestant” or something similar. There, you’ll find a complete list of the show’s eligibility requirements, as well as an application form to appear on the show as a contestant. This form will ask you for you name, home address, age, and any other information needed to confirm that you meet the show’s eligibility requirements. [8] X Research source Some networks also run a short broadcast segment at the end of the show featuring a telephone number or mailing address that you can contact to apply as a contestant."

      "content": "Acquire tickets to shows that select contestants from the audience. In many network game shows such as \"The Price is Right\" and \"Let's Make a Deal,\" the host chooses contestants from the studio audiences. This means that if you hope to appear on the show, you’ll first need to be in the audience. You can reserve a free ticket online, or pick one up from a promotional vendor in the city where the show is filmed. [9] X Research source Once you manage to score a seat in the audience, being chosen is often simply a matter of luck."

      "content": "Complete an online qualifying test if you’re trying out for “Jeopardy!” “Jeopardy!” is one of the more difficult game shows to make it onto. First, you must create a MyJeopardy! account on the show’s website and fill out an application to appear on the show as a contestant. After that, you’ll be given a time and date to sit for an intensive 50-question online test. You’ll only have one shot to take the test, so make sure you don’t miss your window. [10] X Research source Jeopardy!’s producers don’t publish test results or give clues as to what constitutes a passing score. If you pass, your application will be forwarded to the show’s casting department, and you’ll receive a notification sometime later via email if you’re selected for a formal audition. You’ll have the best chance of passing your test if you possess a general knowledge of a wide range of topics. It’s recommended that you take advantage of the many free practice tests offered on the Jeopardy! website to prepare yourself for the real deal. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Familiarize yourself with the format of the show. If you haven’t already, take some time to study the basic structure and rules of the show you want to try out for. Having a working knowledge of how the game is played will make you more likely to emerge victorious. It will also allow you to focus on the task at hand without having to stop and think about what you’re doing. [12] X Research source For example, “Mental Samurai” is a hybrid trivia-physical challenge show that gives contestants 5 minutes to answer a dozen increasingly-difficult questions while being rotated 360-degrees at high speeds in a specially-designed capsule. Newer game shows sometimes put out open calls for contestants for their first broadcasts. In this case, it may be impossible to acquaint yourself with the rules or put together a sound strategy before your appearance."

      "title": "Make it through one or more rounds of auditions.",
      "content": "Make it through one or more rounds of auditions. Game shows often use auditions or interviews to identify potential contestants who have what they’re looking for. For competitive shows, your audition may take the form of a short test or mock round of gameplay. In other cases, you may simply be asked a few questions designed to make you think on your feet. Do your best to be ready for whatever the show’s producers throw at you. Many game shows that choose their contestants from the audience “at random” actually conduct brief interviews with each member of the audience prior to taping. Auditions usually take place well before taping begins, and may be held somewhere other than where the show is taped. You’ll learn more about the audition process if and when you receive a callback for your contestant application."

Ratings are a game show's bread and butter, and producers are always looking for the most interesting, entertaining, or outlandish contestants. Whether you sport a funny costume, sing and dance in the line to get into the venue, or tell jokes that crack up the show's crew and audience members, being as entertaining as possible will help you make more of an impression on the people in charge of selecting participants. [13] X Research source Think on your feet and do your best to offer witty, humorous, or amusing responses during your audition. If you can catch your interviewer off guard, you're as good as in."

If your application is approved and you pass your audition, you’ll have the chance to be featured as a contestant on your show of choice. The time between the final phase of your audition and your televised appearance could be anywhere from a few weeks to over a year, depending on the show's popularity and the number of other people who qualify. [14] X Research source You’re not guaranteed a callback, even if you successfully make it through your audition. It’s not uncommon for game shows to recruit more contestants than they actually use in case of casting disputes, scheduling conflicts, or cancellations. Be sure to bring a book with you on the day of your taping. You could end up waiting 8-10 hours to be called onto set."
