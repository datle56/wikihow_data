      "title": "Don’t smoke in your house.",
      "content": "Don’t smoke in your house. The smell of smoke will give you away, and your parents will catch you. You might be able to mask the odor with air-fresheners, but this is only a temporary fix, and the smell will linger. Also, smoking in the vicinity of your parents will increase the chance of them catching you. [1] X Research source If someone else in the household smokes, then smoking in the house is less risky. There is still the danger that your parents will see you smoking or find your cigarettes. Don’t keep your cigarettes or other smoking supplies in the house; your parents may discover them. Hide them outside or give them to a friend to hold."

      "title": "Stand by an open window if you do decide to smoke in the house.",
      "content": "Stand by an open window if you do decide to smoke in the house. Have a fan pointed out the window to blow the smoke out of the house. Use activated charcoal, available at hardware or pet stores, to absorb any smell of smoke that remains within the house. Air-filters will also help to prevent the smoky odor from spreading through the house. Burning a citronella or other scented candle may mask the smell, but your parents might also be suspicious that you are trying to hide an odor, especially if you don’t normally burn candles. [2] X Research source Make sure you collect the ashes and then dispose of them, preferably down the toilet or in a trash can away from your house. Use a mug or other ash tray to catch the ashes to keep them from falling to the floor or getting on your clothes. Make sure to sweep or vacuum up any errant ashes that do get on the floor or furniture."

      "title": "Never smoke on school-grounds.",
      "content": "Never smoke on school-grounds. Schools are usually drug-free zones, which means the penalty for smoking is greater than in other places. Also, if a teacher catches you smoking, your parents will almost certainly be informed."

      "title": "Choose someplace private to smoke.",
      "content": "Choose someplace private to smoke. Even if you are nowhere near your house, smoking in public, particularly if you are under 18, is not a good idea. There is the chance that someone you know will see you, and your parents will find out. If you have a friend who is allowed to smoke, go to their house. Parks that are not visible from the street, or the rear of stores are also good places to smoke out of sight. Just make sure that smoking is not prohibited in these areas."

      "content": "Wear an old jacket or sweatshirt while you smoke. Then, before you return home, take off the jacket or sweatshirt and hide it. The outer layers will absorb most of the cigarette smell, and will also protect your clothes from falling ash."

      "content": "Smoke into a paper towel tube. Take the tube from an empty paper towel roll, and place several dryer sheets at the end. As you smoke, exhale through the tube. The dryer sheets help to prevent the smoke from dispersing and clinging to your clothes and hair. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Bring extra clothes if you don't have time to change at home.",
      "content": "Bring extra clothes if you don't have time to change at home. When you are done smoking, completely change into the fresh, clean clothes. Hide the dirty clothes until you have the opportunity to launder them. Make sure that your spare clothes are in a completely sealed bag. If you don't have a bag, make sure you place your extra clothes a good distance away from where you are smoking. If the smoke gets onto the spare clothes, they won't do you much good."

      "title": "Wash dirty clothes.",
      "content": "Wash dirty clothes. If your clothes smell of smoke, you will need to either discard them or find a way to remove the smell. Body sprays and air-fresheners will only temporarily mask the scent; your clothing will need to be washed. If your clothes smell strongly of smoke, place them in a large bag (preferably a large zippered bag) and add at least ½ cup of baking soda. Shake the bag and then seal it as tightly as possible. Let the clothes sit overnight, and the baking soda will absorb the odors. Then, shake the clothes and run them through the washing machine. [4] X Research source Pre-soaking your clothes in vinegar also helps to remove the smell of smoke. Fill a sink with warm water, and then add 1 cup of vinegar. Let the clothes soak for 30-60 minutes, and then wash them as usual. If you are using these special laundry techniques, make sure your parents don’t see you. They may be suspicious that you are trying to cover up incriminating smells."

If your hair is smelling strongly of smoke, mix a few tablespoons of apple cider vinegar with a gentle shampoo and wash your hair thoroughly. Vinegar is great at cleaning and deodorizing, and the apple-cider vinegar can actually make your hair healthier. [7] X Research source You can buy apple cider vinegar at most grocery stores."

      "content": "Use a dryer sheet if you are desperate. If smoke got into your hair, or onto your body, and you don’t have time to shower, rub a dryer sheet over your head and body. The dryer sheet will absorb at least some of the odors. [8] X Research source You can also spray perfumes or body mists onto yourself, but they will only cover up the smell. Your parents may still be able to smell the smoke and know you are trying to mask the scent."

      "content": "Drink water before you smoke. Dry mouths tend to hold more odors, so have some water or another beverage before you smoke.

This will also help to remove the cigarette taste from your mouth. Smoking also causes you to be at a much higher risk for mouth disease, so adequate oral hygiene is a good idea all around.
