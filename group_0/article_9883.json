      "content": "Sauté onions with peppers for 3 minutes if you'd like veggies in the omelet. Put 1/8 cup (20 g) of onions and 1/8 cup (20 g) of bell pepper into the preheated skillet and stir them occasionally as they cook. The vegetables should soften a little. [2] X Research source If you prefer, you can leave out the veggies. Chop the vegetables any size you like and substitute any of the veggies. For example, try shallots or mushrooms instead of onions and peppers. For a Mexican egg white omelet, substitute a small jalapeño for the bell pepper and add 1 minced garlic clove to the onions. Once you've made the omelet, serve it with diced avocado , fresh cilantro , and crumbled cotija cheese."

      "content": "Cook the whites for 2 to 3 minutes or until they're set and no longer runny. To help the omelet cook, take a silicone spatula and gently run it along the sides of the omelet. Tilt the skillet a little so any liquid egg whites will run to the gap you made and cook. [6] X Research source Don't worry if you accidentally tear the omelet. Since you'll be filling and folding it, you probably won't be able to see the tear when you serve it."

Then, stir in 1 cup (30 g) of fresh baby spinach and 1 cup (200 g) of cherry tomatoes. Cook the vegetables until the garlic becomes fragrant and the spinach wilts. Then, transfer the mixture to a bowl and set it aside. [10] X Research source Feel free to substitute any of your favorite vegetables. Try sliced mushrooms, diced bell pepper , or chopped onion , for instance. For an herbal omelet, instead of using spinach and tomatoes, add 1/4 cup (5 g) of freshly chopped basil , 2 tablespoons (2 g) of freshly chopped parsley , and 2 teaspoons (0.5 g) of freshly chopped oregano. You will only need to chop them and sprinkle on top of your eggs. If you want to use dried herbs, use 1/2 of the amount.}} Other delicious condiments that go well with eggs and give them umami taste are kimchi, furikake, sriracha, or hot sauce."
