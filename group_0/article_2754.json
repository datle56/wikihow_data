If you do things to intentionally annoy others, or if you do whatever you want without keeping the feelings of others in mind, people may view you as immature. Trying to remember the needs and wants of other people around you will help you cultivate a reputation as a mature and respectful individual. Being respectful of others doesn’t mean you have to let them walk all over you. It does mean that you need to listen to others and treat them the way you’d like to be treated. If the other person is rude or unkind to you, don’t respond with unkindness of your own. Show that you’re the bigger person by walking away. [1] X Research source"

Keep the future in mind and let it inform the choices you are making about your life right now. Once you have set goals that are clear, actionable, and measurable, take action to work towards them. [2] X Research source Setting goals can seem overwhelming, but don’t worry! It just takes a little time and planning. Career & Life Coach Dawn Smith-Camacho suggests that you start by figuring out what really matters to you—what do you value, and what do you want to do next in your life? From there, you can figure out the steps you need to take to get where you want to be. [3] X Expert Source Dawn Smith-Camacho Career & Life Coach Expert Interview. 13 May 2020. First you need to think about a few categories: Who, What, When, Where, How, and Why. Who will be involved in achieving your goals? Obviously, you are the primary person here. However, a tutor, a volunteer coordinator, or a counselor may also be involved. What do you want to achieve? It’s important to be as specific as possible in this step. “Prepare for college” is way too big. You’ll never get started on a huge vague goal like that. Instead, choose a few specifics that will help you achieve that bigger goal, like “Do a volunteer activity” and “Participate in an extracurricular activity.” When do specific parts of your plan have to be done? Knowing this will help keep you on track. For example, if you want to volunteer, you need to know if there’s a deadline to apply, when the activities are, and when you’ll be able to do them. Where will you be working on achieving this goal? For the volunteering example, you might choose to work at an animal shelter. How will you achieve each stage of your goal? For example, what is the process for contacting the shelter to volunteer? How will you get to the animal shelter? How will you balance your volunteering with your other responsibilities? You have to think about answers to these types of questions. Why do you want to achieve this goal? This is probably the most important part, believe it or not. You’re more likely to achieve a goal when it’s meaningful to you and you can see how it fits in the “big picture.” Figure out why this goal is important. For example, “I want to volunteer at the animal shelter so that I can make my resume more attractive for pre-vet college programs.”"

Understand that silliness usually isn’t appropriate in formal situations, such as school, church, at work, and especially at funerals. You’re expected to be paying attention, not pranking people. Being silly in these situations will usually communicate immaturity. However, informal situations like hanging out with your friends, or even time with your family, can be a great time to get silly. It can even help you bond with each other. Establish some parameters for when it is okay and when it is not okay to play a joke or be silly. Don’t use mean-spirited or belittling humor or pranks."

Instead, look at it as an opportunity for you to learn about something (or someone) new and different. [11] X Research source If someone has a different belief or habit than you do, don’t judge it immediately. Instead, ask open questions, such as “Could you tell me more about this?” or “Why do you do that?” Try to listen more than you talk, at least at first. Don’t interrupt people or say “But I think---” Let them talk. You’ll be surprised at what you learn. Ask for clarification. If someone says or does something that doesn’t seem right, ask for clarification before you make a snap judgement. For example, if you think someone just insulted your beliefs, take a deep breath and then say something like, “I heard you say _______. Is that what you meant?” If the other person says they didn’t mean it that way, accept it. Don’t expect the worst from people. Go into situations expecting that everyone else is human, just like you.

It’s more mature to admit when you’re feeling insecure or vulnerable. Everyone has moments when they don’t feel confident. That’s totally normal. Express your feelings clearly.

You are an agent in your own life, and your words and actions have consequences both for yourself and others. Own up when you make mistakes. Recognize that you can’t control what anyone else does, but you can control what you do. Accept responsibility when things go wrong. For example, if you do badly on an essay, don’t blame it on the teacher. Think about what actions you took to get you to that result. What can you do better next time? Focus less on whether something is fair. Things will not always be fair in life. Sometimes, you may deserve something that you don’t get. Mature people will not allow unfairness to stand in the way of their accomplishments. Keep your commitments. Don’t be a flake or unreliable. If you say you’re going to do something, do it.

Assertiveness isn’t the same as cockiness, arrogance or aggression. Assertive individuals express their own feelings and needs clearly, and they listen when others do the same.

Learn to stand up for yourself without being arrogant or aggressive, and you’ll definitely feel more mature. Here are some ways to communicate assertively: [34] X Research source Use “I”-statements. “You”-statements make other people feel blamed and shuts them down. Keeping the focus on what you’re feeling and experiencing keeps the way open for productive, mature communication. For example, instead of telling your parents “You never listen to me!” try using an “I”-statement like “I feel like my perspective hasn’t been heard.” When you say you “feel” a certain way, the other person is more likely to want to know why. Recognize others’ needs too. Life isn’t all about you. It’s great to communicate your feelings and needs clearly, but remember to also ask others about theirs. Being able to put others first is a true sign of maturity. Don’t jump to conclusions. If you aren’t sure what happened with someone, ask! Don’t prejudge—remember, you don’t have all the information. For example, if your friend forgot that you were supposed to go shopping together, don’t assume that it’s because they don't care or is a terrible person. Instead, use an “I”-statement and follow it up with an invitation for them to express their feelings: “I felt really disappointed when you couldn’t make it shopping.

      "content": "Be honest, but don’t be rude. Telling the truth with compassion is a really difficult skill to master, but thinking about whether you would want someone to say something to you can help you figure out what to say. In Buddhism, there’s a saying: “If you propose to speak, always ask yourself: is it true, is it necessary, is it kind.” Consider it before speaking. Those around you will appreciate your honesty, and your compassion will show that you truly care about others. [39] X Research source For example, if a friend asks you if her dress makes her look fat, consider what would be most helpful. Beauty is very subjective, so offering an opinion on her looks isn’t likely to be helpful. However, telling your friend that you love her just the way she is could be the confidence boost she needs. If you really think your friend’s outfit is not attractive, there are tactful ways to say this if you think it will be helpful. For example, “You know, I like the red dress better than this one” doesn’t judge your friend’s body—nobody needs that—but it does answer her question of whether she looks her best. Behavioral scientists suggest that some types of dishonesty are actually “pro-social,” like white lies you tell to help others avoid embarrassment or hurt. It’s up to you to decide whether this is something you want to do. Whatever you decide, choose to be kind in doing it."

If your culture has a different way to greet others, use that form in an appropriate and polite way. When you meet someone new, make a good effort to remember the person's name by repeating it: “Nice to meet you, Wendy.” Good manners communicate that you respect the other person, which is the behavior of a mature person. [40] X Research source Throughout any conversation, listen carefully and maintain eye contact. Don’t stare at the other person, though. Use the 50/70 rule: make eye contact for 50% of the time when you’re talking, and 70% of the time while the other person is talking.

Fidgeting is a sign that you lack confidence. Keep your hands open and relaxed. Don't sit there thinking about places you'd rather be. Most people are very good at noticing when you don’t care about an interaction, and it will hurt their feelings. Don't talk on your cell phone or text people while you should be paying attention to the person in front of you. This communicates disrespect. Anderson says that when you’re “In a neutral setting, being the first one to extend your hand shows confidence. If you are visiting someone’s office or on their turf, it is polite for you to wait for them to offer their hand. It is also proper etiquette for the person with higher authority to extend their hand first.” [42] X Expert Source Sheila A.

      "content": "Have good online etiquette. Using good online etiquette shows that you respect your friends, family and other people that are hanging out with you online. It’s a sign of maturity. Keep in mind that a lot of what you say online can also be seen by people like potential employers, teachers, and others, so don’t say things that would embarrass or hurt you. Avoid strong or offensive language. Don’t overuse exclamation points. Remember that you aren’t there in person to clarify your point, so make sure not to overwhelm your audience. Use your shift key. Capitalize proper nouns and the beginnings of sentences instead of writing in all lower-case letters. Avoid using non-standard cApitaliZaTion. It makes your writing much harder to read. Avoid using ALL CAPITAL LETTERS. This is the internet equivalent of shouting. This may be okay if you’re posting a tweet about how your hockey team just won the championship, but it’s not a good idea in daily emails and social media posts. When sending an email, etiquette coach Tami Claytor says to write your emails like a formal written letter. Include greetings, have a proper closing, and make sure your spelling and grammar are correct. [43] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 30 September 2020. Proofread before you send an e-mail or make a social media post to make sure you didn't make a mistake. Use complete sentences, and be sure to add proper punctuation at the end of each sentence. Go easy on abbreviations, slang and emoticons. It's okay to use these in a casual text to a friend, but don't use them in an e-mail to your teacher, or in another situation where you want to look mature. Remember the golden rule online, just like the golden rule in real life. Treat others the way you want to be treated. If you want someone to be nice to you, be nice to them too. Don’t troll or insult them. If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all."

If you think that’s the case, ask for clarification: “I heard you say that you didn’t like my essay. Could you tell me some more specifics so I can do better next time?” Sometimes, the criticism says much more about the person giving it than it does about you. If the criticism seems unfair or hurtful, remember that the other person may just be trying to make him or herself feel better by tearing you down.
