Breathing exercises are like a superpower—in 10 seconds, you can reduce your body’s stress response, meaning less angry feelings for you. When you’re angry in the moment, try this quick breathing exercise and repeat the steps until you feel calmer: [2] X Research source First, release your breath from your mouth. Next, breathe in through your nose—as you go, count to “4 Mississippi” (1 Mississippi, 2 Mississippi…). Now, hold your breath for another 4-second count. Finally, slowly exhale (again, through your mouth) as you count to “4 Mississippi” again."

      "content": "Manage your expectations of other people. The truth is, no one in your life is perfect, and some people just won’t be your cup of tea. Can this be annoying—or at times disappointing? Yes. But internalize this fact, and you’ll find it much easier to cut others some slack (and free yourself from angry feelings). When you catch yourself getting annoyed, try reminding yourself: [3] X Research source I can’t control others’ actions, just my own. It’s not my job to hold this person to a certain standard. Part of caring and supporting someone else is accepting them for who they are—and not punishing them for failing to be who I want them to be."

      "content": "Remind yourself that getting annoyed doesn’t serve your interests. The truth is, being annoyed doesn’t feel good. At times, it might even cause us to do things we wish we wouldn’t or distract us from things we’d like to do. Remind yourself that by reining in your irritation, you’re actually doing yourself a solid. Try saying to yourself: [4] X Research source I deserve to feel in control of my emotions. I get to choose how I react to this. I know getting angry will make me feel worse, and I don’t want that. So I’m choosing not to indulge this feeling."

      "content": "Put yourself in the other person's shoes. So often, the things that annoy us about other people are totally unintentional. Maybe they had a bad day, maybe their mind is on something else. Either way, try to imagine the other person’s perspective, and be as generous as possible. This can help you cool off—while mulling over potential bad intentions will just fire you up more. Say your roommate is blaring music. Instead of assuming the worst, think: “Maybe they don't know that I'm home. I'll shoot them a text instead of getting angry!” Or, maybe your sister is chewing super loudly—annoying! Take a second to remember: she does a lot for me and doesn’t do it on purpose. The least I can do is cut her some slack!"

When you're angry, maybe the last thing you want to think is, “ This really not that big of deal .” But sometimes, connecting with what’s really important can be a huge help. Try to remember everything you feel grateful for—maybe it’s your job, your family, or your sweet pup. This kid kicking your airplane seat, at the end of the day, isn’t all that important! [5] X Expert Source Nicolette Tura, MA Empowerment Coach Expert Interview. 23 January 2020. One helpful way to maintain a healthy perspective is to remind yourself that feelings like this always pass. You’re angry now, but you won’t be forever. So in that way, this feeling might not be as powerful as it seems!"

Oftentimes though, people might regret those reactions later on, and they don’t always have the desired effect. Psychologists say that it’s a myth that “letting all your anger out” helps you and those around you—so remind yourself that by working to control your annoyance, you’re doing yourself (and others) a service.

      "content": "Monitor to your body language if you want to hide your annoyance. When someone’s gotten under your skin, your goal might be to hide that fact. If that’s the case for you, try to project friendly body language. Sporting crossed arms, a low brow, thin lips, and flared nostrils? In that case, the other person can probably sense that you’re upset. Try out these tips to come off cool as a cucumber: [7] X Research source Try using approachable body language (turn towards the other person and relax your arms). Relax your facial muscles and make eye contact with the person you’re speaking with. If this sounds tough, try practicing in the mirror first. That way, you’ll know how best to keep your composure on the outside, even when you’re annoyed on the inside!"

[11] X Research source Stick to the daily recommended coffee limit (max 4 cups) and pay attention to how you feel, too. If you feel stressed at just 2 cups, then drink less than that. Limit alcohol use if you’re looking to feel less angry overall. If this feels daunting, start small—cutting down just a little could help, giving you more motivation to drink less."
