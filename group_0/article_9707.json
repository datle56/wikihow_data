      "content": "Unplug the power cable from the power supply and turn it off. Not all power supply units have a power switch, but it is generally on the back. Also, be sure you are not grounded so that the remaining voltage doesn't flow through you to the ground. To avoid receiving an electric shock from the power supply unit, wear shoes with rubber soles and avoid touching anything metal while handling the electronic components."

      "title": "Discharge the power supply.",
      "content": "Discharge the power supply. To do so, simply let the power supply sit unconnected and unplugged for a few days. Warning: Some people suggest attaching a 10-ohm resistor between a black and red wire (from the power cables on the output side); however, this is only guaranteed to drain the low voltage capacitors on the output - which really aren't dangerous. It could also leave the high-voltage capacitors charged, resulting in a potentially dangerous—or even lethal—situation. Warning: If you suspect the power supply is damaged, do not use it! If it is damaged, the protection circuitry may not work. Normally, a protection circuit will slowly discharge the high-voltage capacitors, but if the supply were connected to 240V while set at 120V (for example), the protection circuits would probably be destroyed. If so, the power supply might not shut down when it is overloaded or when it begins to fail."

      "content": "Open up the power supply unit. Remove the screws connecting the top and the bottom of the PSU case. Then, carefully remove the case. Warning: Be very careful around the black capacitor caps and all the wires leading to them. They may discharge a strong electric current. Warning: This will certainly void any warranty you may have on the power supply unit. Warning: Do not remove the circuit board unless necessary. The traces and solder on the underside could still discharge high voltage if you didn't let the PSU sit long enough. If you must remove it, use a multimeter to check for voltage on the pins of the largest capacitors. When you replace the board, make sure that the plastic sheet goes back under the board. Only power supply technicians should attempt this. Warning: Anything above 30 milliamps/volts can kill you or, at the very least, give you a painful shock. Ensure you remove the power cord before the conversion and discharge the capacitors by letting it rest for a few days. If in doubt, use a multimeter to check the voltage."

Use a permanent marker to mark where all the parts are going to go on the side of the power supply unit that doesn't have any vents, fans, or other components. Mark where you want to put each binding post and what voltage it corresponds to. Also, mark where you want to place the LEDs, the switch, and any additional components you want to use. To get more room, mount the fan outside the PSU case or remove it. You can also attach more fans if you are using a high-wattage power supply. If you don't have enough room inside the power supply, you can mount all the components to a separate board outside the power supply unit."

This acts as a load, which the power supply unit needs to function properly. The power resistor will give off a lot of heat and should be mounted on the metal wall for proper cooling (or a heat sink mount). Make sure it doesn't short-circuit anything. You can also consider using a lighted 12v switch, which will act as the load necessary to turn on the power supply. If you aren't afraid of some soldering, you can replace the 10w power resistor with the cooling fan that was originally inside the PSU. Be careful with the polarity, though - match the red and black wires to each other."

The PSU will be controlled by the rear switch, if there is one. You also don't need an LED; just ignore the gray wire. Cut it short and insulate it from the rest."

You can solder the wires directly to resistors and the anodes and cathodes of the LEDs. Cover the wires with heat shrink tubes. You can cover the resistors with heat shrink tubes, too.

Then, solder them all together and solder them to the +3.3V binding post. Make sure the wires are covered with heat shrink tubing. Note that some power supplies may have a gray or brown wire representing \"power good\"/\"power ok\". Most PSUs have a smaller orange wire used for sensing— 3.3V—usually paired at the connector to another orange wire. Make sure this wire is connected to the other orange wires. Otherwise, your lab power supply won't stay on.) This wire should be connected to either an orange wire (+3.3V) or a red wire (+5V) for the power supply to function. When in doubt, try the lower voltage first (+3.3V). Some newer power supplies will have \"voltage sense\" wires that need to be connected to the actual voltage wires for proper operation. If you have two or fewer orange wires, you should also have a brown wire that must be connected to the orange."

Then, solder them all together and solder them to the +3.3V bind post. Make sure the wires are covered with heat shrink tubing. Check for loose connections by gently tugging on them. Inspect for bare wires and cover them to prevent a short circuit. If you don't feel like soldering nine wires together to a binding post (as is the case with the ground wires), you can snip them at the PCB. 1-3 wires should be fine. This includes cutting any wires that you don't ever plan on using."
