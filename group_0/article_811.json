      "content": "Begin an order on Instacart. For an order with a special request to be placed, it will only work with at least one regular item (that's in the database already) to be placed into your cart prior to adding this item.It's easiest if you begin your order by adding other items before you place any special request items into it. The app won't accept additions between the time you check out and the time your Shopper starts shopping, so if you place an order with a special request and then go back and try to add additional items (like the app said you could), you may see a message saying \"Your item total is less than $10.\" even though it may not be."

      "content": "Search for the special request. Either use the search box at the top of the Instacart Home page for the store, or use the search box at the top of the Search tab. Either one will work. Type your item name and see if a product matches, just in case."

    {
      "title": "Fill in the optional boxes, if you can.",
      "content": "Fill in the optional boxes, if you can. Select the portion of the store where the item can be found - if you are fairly certain that you know. This is a drop-down selection box and is completely optional. If you don't know, most places give you an \"I don't know its department\" choice, or you can press Cancel instead. Add in any additional instructions. Additional instructions might be to \"check expiration date\" or something similar - anything that the Shopper might need to keep in mind when they pick the item. Don't try to mention the aisle number. Instacart Shoppers don't get aisle numbers in their list, and unless two items can be confused, don't mention the aisle number in this field. This is more along the lines of a reminder to check for certain issues - even though Shoppers are trained to check for certain things already. You could even mention to your Shopper that they might want to ask the Deli/Butcher/etc. for the item or something that the Shopper wouldn't expect to do. Add a photo of the item, if necessary. Take a photo of the exact product you are looking for and send it to your Shopper. Make sure to clearly capture the product's name, size, colors and general shape of the container. This is also an optional field. Don't use copyrighted images from other sites - search sites included. These images are intellectual property of someone else, and Instacart will re-use them if necessary if they find it necessary to add the item to the database once found. Only use images you yourself took (such as a photo where you held the product in your hand - or the product inside it's product packaging - front side facing the camera)."
