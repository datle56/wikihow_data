[2] X Research source Shallow foundations are built on level ground and hard surfaces. [3] X Research source Shallow foundations are no more than 3 feet (0.91 m) (91.44 cm) deep and are used primarily for smaller, simpler projects like holding patio furniture, a fountain, or an air conditioning unit. Deep foundations are used for more complex projects. [4] X Research source Deep foundations are also used when soil conditions are poor or when building a structure on a hill. Deep foundations are more than 3 feet (0.91 m) (91.44 cm) deep and can have varying depths throughout. This type of foundation is suited for a shed or a detached garage."

Soak it with a hose at least twice daily, three times if it is very hot outside. [12] X Research source Cover the pad if it looks like rain. Rain can cause depressions in the concrete and cause your foundation to be uneven."
