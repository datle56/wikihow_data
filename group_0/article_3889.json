      "content": "Understand magnesium absorption. As important as magnesium is, it can sometimes be difficult for our bodies to get enough. This is mainly because many people just don't take it in in their diets. But there are also other factors that can get in the way of absorption, such as: [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Too much (or not enough) calcium [5] X Research source Medical causes such as diabetes, Crohn's disease, or alcoholism Medical drugs that block absorption Another reason that many people, Americans especially, lack magnesium, is that our soil is virtually depleted of magnesium. This causes a significant decrease in our subsequent crops. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

      "title": "Determine how much magnesium you should be consuming.",
      "content": "Determine how much magnesium you should be consuming. This amount varies based on age, gender, and other factors. In general, adult males should not consume more than 420 mg a day and females should not go over 320 mg. [7] X Research source It's a good idea to talk to your doctor about how much magnesium you should consume, especially if you think you might be deficient. Make sure to check your multivitamin for magnesium to ensure you are not over-consuming with a multi-vitamin along with a magnesium supplement. The same is true of calcium, as this is usually also found in magnesium supplements. Make sure to mention any chronic medical conditions. Conditions such as gluten-sensitive enteropathy and Crohn's disease interfere with magnesium absorption. They may also cause magnesium loss through diarrhea. Be aware of the effects of aging. The body's ability to absorb magnesium decreases as we age. The excretion of magnesium also increases. Studies have also found that as we get older, our diet tends to include less magnesium. Older adults are also more likely to take medications that interact with magnesium. Always talk to your doctor before giving magnesium supplements to children."

      "content": "Look for signs that you are not getting enough magnesium. If your lack of magnesium is only a short term condition, you most likely won't see any symptoms. But, if you consistently do not get enough magnesium, you may begin to show symptoms. These include: [8] X Research source Nausea Vomiting Loss of appetite Fatigue Muscle spasms and cramps If your magnesium deficiency is severe, you may experience tingling or numbness. Seizures, a skipping heartbeat, and even personality changes can also occur. If you are experiencing any of these problems on an ongoing basis, see a health professional."

You should consider managing your diet before you start taking supplements. Foods that are rich in magnesium include: [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Nuts like almonds and Brazil nuts Seeds like pumpkin and sunflower seeds Soy products like tofu Fish like halibut and tuna Dark, leafy greens like spinach, kale and Swiss chard Bananas Chocolate and cocoa powder Many spices such as coriander, cumin, and sage [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a magnesium supplement. If you decide to take a supplement, select one that contains a form of magnesium that is easily absorbed. Supplements to look for include those that contain any of these: [11] X Research source Magnesium aspartate. This form of magnesium is chelated (attached) to aspartic acid. Aspartic acid is an amino acid that is common in protein-rich foods that makes the magnesium easier to absorb. [12] X Research source Magnesium citrate. This comes from the magnesium salt of citric acid. The magnesium concentration is relatively low, but it is easily absorbed. It has a mild laxative effect. [13] X Research source Magnesium lactate. This is a moderately concentrated form of magnesium commonly used for treating digestive issues. It should not be taken by anyone with kidney problems. [14] X Research source Magnesium chloride. Another easily absorbed form of magnesium, this type also aids kidney function and metabolism.

You should avoid taking mineral supplements at the same time that you take your magnesium supplement. [20] X Research source In particular, either an excess or a shortage of calcium in your body can make it harder to absorb magnesium. While taking magnesium supplements, avoid excess calcium. At the same time, don't forgo calcium entirely, as this can hinder magnesium absorption. Studies have also found that magnesium and potassium levels appear to be related. The nature of this relationship is not yet clearly understood. Even so, you should not dramatically increase or abstain from potassium while trying to increase your magnesium levels.

      "content": "Take magnesium throughout the day. Rather than taking your magnesium as one dose, take smaller amounts throughout the day, with your meals and a full glass of water. Your body will be better able to process it in this way. Some suggest taking your magnesium supplement on an empty stomach if you are having problems with absorption. Sometimes the minerals in the food in your stomach can interfere with your body's ability to absorb magnesium. But, this sometimes causes an upset stomach. In fact, the Mayo Clinic suggests taking magnesium only with meals. Taking it on an empty stomach may cause diarrhea.

      "content": "Watch what you eat. Like minerals, there are some foods that may keep your body from properly absorbing magnesium. Avoid eating these foods around the same time of day that you take your magnesium supplements: [26] X Research source Foods that are very high in fiber and phytic acid. These include bran products or whole grain items like brown rice, barley, or whole wheat bread. Foods that are high in oxalic acid (oxalate). These include coffee, tea, chocolate, leafy greens, and nuts. [27] X Research source Steaming or boiling foods high in oxalate may remove some of it. Consider cooked spinach instead of a spinach salad. Soaking beans and some grains before you cook them may also help."
