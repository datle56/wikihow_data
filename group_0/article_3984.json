Ask yourself why you might be feeling this way, and write your feelings down in a journal to help you address them. [3] X Research source With that being said, it’s possible to dwell on negative feelings and worsen your mood. To avoid this, consider setting a “sadness limit” for yourself.

[5] X Research source Remember, other people can’t read your mind. Think of how you want your loved ones to show up for you on your special day, and give them enough time to make it happen. For example, if you want to go on a road-trip with your besties, mention it a few months in advance and start planning. If you want a romantic dinner with your partner, ask them to book a reservation at least 2 weeks beforehand."
