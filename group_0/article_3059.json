      "content": "Practice good manners. Whether it is your best friend, your classmate, a teacher, a janitor, or any other school worker, everyone should be treated nicely. Because you are the class president, you have to set an example on how to interact with people so that everyone else will do the same. [1] X Expert Source Ashley Pritchard, MA Academic & School Counselor Expert Interview. 4 November 2019. Let others speak before you speak. Interrupting someone when they haven't finished their thought is extremely rude and shows disrespect to the other person. If it happens by accident, apologize for the incident and let them continue so they can finish what they were saying. Stop what you're doing and acknowledge whoever addresses you right away. Don't keep people waiting to try to get your attention, address them quickly so they can see that you want to listen to what they have to say. If you wait too long to address them, they might think you don't have time to listen to them. Be equally as nice to those that might not be as nice to you. This might sound difficult to do because your instinct might be to be mean back. You are showing great maturity and setting an example to anyone that sees you interact in a positive manner even if you struggle to do it. Respond politely even if someone talks to you in a rude tone, because this can affect your relationship with others. Sometimes people have a bad day or might not be feeling well. Others may not know how to talk to people. As the saying goes, “Kill them with kindness” and be extra nice to them. That can help change their attitude in some situations. Treat everyone you talk to exactly how you want to be treated. That's something that everyone should be doing, but as a leader, this is important for you. Your classmates want to make sure you are listening to what they have to say, so pay attention. Even if what they are saying is not interesting to you, just smile and ask questions to stay engaged in the conversation."

      "content": "Use positive body language to help you communicate better. When interacting with your fellow classmates, positive body language can help you show that you care without having to verbally say it. There are several simple actions that you can do in different situations. Make eye contact when speaking to others. Whether it is at the podium during a speech, or when you are having a conversation by the lockers, eye contact is important. It establishes a connection of understanding between people as well as emphasizes what is being said. Smile genuinely when greeting others or when having a casual conversation. A smile sets a relaxed tone and will make people feel at ease around you. Walk with purpose when getting from one place to another. Don't slouch and walk with your back straight. By doing this you are showing that you take your responsibilities as class president seriously and that you are ready to take on any challenge that arises."

      "content": "Demonstrate small acts of kindness. It is as important as being respectful. Showing kindness does not have to be anything extravagant. Even the smallest gesture of kindness makes a difference. Greet people when you pass by them in the hallways. Saying 'Good Morning' or 'Good Afternoon' is a great way to establish a positive connection with people. Greetings can also really make a difference in people's days if they are not going too well. Open the door for others when there are people walking behind you.This small gesture shows good manners and is very appreciated. Help students carry their belongings if they have too much stuff on their hands. By doing this you are preventing any possible disaster of students tripping, papers falling everywhere, or projects breaking. Show appreciation to cafeteria workers by saying 'thank you'. It is so easy to forget to do this when you're busy talking to your friends, but doing this is important so everyone else can say it as well."

      "content": "Plan specific days to show gratitude. School faculty, staff, and volunteers do a lot for students. Unfortunately, more often than not, their effort is not appreciated enough. Take the initiative to show appreciation through different activities where many students can get involved. Get students to assist you in writing thank you letters to all faculty and staff. Writing thank you letters is a great way to involve a lot of your classmates and teachers will appreciate getting unique letters from different students. Help organize a potluck for faculty and staff where the students brings all the food. A potluck can be a great bonding experience between teachers and students. Pick a day to have sweets and treats delivered to teachers in their classrooms.

      "content": "Appreciate your parents too. Everyone's parents do so much to get them to school prepared and ready to learn. There are several ways that you can help students show gratitude to their parents for everything they do for their children. Set up a station during lunch time with arts and crafts for students to use in order to create unique letters to give to their parents when they get home. Doing this will help students get creative and will allow them to have fun while showing gratitude. Suggest to the music department that creating a song specifically for saying thank you to your parents would be a good idea. The song could be showcased by the student choir, during a talent showcase, or individual students could learn it and sing it to their parents in the comfort of their home."

But meeting as many people that you are representing as class president is important! Spend your time wisely during the day so you can meet different people during different activities. [2] X Research source Start up a conversation with someone between classes. Even if you just stop by someone's locker to ask how their day is going, it will help students understand that you are a friendly person. Sit with someone new each day during lunch time. Look around the cafeteria to see if anyone is sitting alone and join them for lunch. This is your chance to approach students that are loners and get to know what kind of issues they want you to deal with. Partner up with different classmates for projects in class. It is easy to stick with your friend for projects, but pairing up with different people can be rewarding because you will get to know them better while working together."

Recall parts of past conversations so classmates can see you pay attention to them."

It is easier for classmates to open up to you if you have fun with them away from the classroom. Plan gatherings at the mall to shop together. There are so many stores and activities at a mall, so it is the perfect place to interact with your fellow classmates and learn more about them in a casual setting. Get together to watch movies at the movie theatre as a large group.There won't be much talking done during the movie, but the discussion after will help everyone get familiar with each other. This will open up the way for more serious dialogue at school in the future. Organize a day in the park with everyone to play outdoors. You can play different games or even enjoy a picnic together.

By calming everyone down and diffusing the situation, students will be able to relax and explain what exactly happened. Ask a teacher or staff for assistance if the situation is too big to handle on your own. Sometimes having an adult present is the only way that students will behave, so asking for help should always come to mind in difficult situations. Encourage students to report any injustices to you or to school officials. If someone tells you about a specific situation, let a school counselor know so they can approach the student professionally."

Many students do not want to openly admit they have problems. It is your job to try and identify these issues. Let students know that you are available to talk with them whenever they need to. Tell students your locker number so they can leave anonymous notes with the issues that bother them. You will still receive the messages you need to see, but students will be able to avoid the confrontation that they might not want to face. Guide students who are actively voicing their issues to help others students voice their own problems as well."

Hand out “comments” cards to students so they can let you know what area you need to improve on as their class leader.
