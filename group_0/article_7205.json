The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Part the dog's fur so you can see the skin clearly. Focus your attention on any areas that the dog was itching, as well as on commonly infected regions, such as the head, ears, and forelegs. To reduce the risk of spreading the possible infection, you also need to wash your hands after handling any animal you suspect has ringworm. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Watch any affected areas for a few days. If you see areas that appear to be infected or irritated keep an eye on them. You may be unsure if ringworm is the culprit immediately, so continue to observe the situation and see how the dog's condition develops. It can be wise to isolate the dog whilst you make up your mind. Keep him or her away from other pets and in one room with minimal soft furnishings. This will allow you to more easily vacuum the room and reduce the risk of contamination. If it turns out the dog does have ringworm, then restricting his access to other pets makes a big difference to reducing the spread and risk of infection to others. Be on the lookout for anything resembling insect bights or a more generalized rash that does not develop a circular shape. These would be indications of an alternative diagnosis--such as an allergic reaction--that would require a very different course of treatment. Ringworm infections are often the result of weakened immune systems, while generalized rashes can be caused in part by over-active immune systems."

The lamp is switched on and the bulbs allowed to warm for 10 minutes. In a dark room, the animal is examined by shining the Woods Lamp onto the suspect areas and examining the response via the magnifying lens. [8] X Research source Certain species of ringworm glow a fluorescent apple green in the presence of ultraviolet light. If this happens then ringworm is present. Your veterinarian may then wish to double check his or her findings by sending a sample away to a lab for species identification. Be aware that only about 50% of ringworm species fluoresce in this way. So, in other words, a negative on the Wood's Lamp does NOT mean the animal is clear. This is a useful way to get a quick positive, but not a conclusive negative."

Another way to get a quick result is for the veterinarian to pluck hairs from the edge of the affected area and examine them under the microscope.

      "content": "Understand that your vet will do a fungal culture if all else fails. A fungal culture will give you a definitive answer. To do this the veterinarian uses a sterile brush (such as a sterilized tooth brush) and rubs it over the affected area. The head of the brush is then pressed against a fungal culture medium, the medium container is then sealed, and set aside to see if fungus grows. [10] X Research source Many vets use an \"in house\" test where the fungal culture medium changes color if fungus grows. This gives a clear indication that ringworm is present. It takes an average of 4 - 5 days for the fungus to grow and cause a color change, although the test is not considered negative until a full 2 weeks have passed with a color change."

In the early stages of infection, there is little to see other than a patch of hair loss. This is because the fungus grows down the hair shaft, the body then rejects that hair as damaged and it falls out. [13] X Research source The skin irritation can result in itching, but even without evident rubbing the condition can contribute to hair loss in the affected region."

      "title": "Learn how a dog can get ringworm.",
      "content": "Learn how a dog can get ringworm. One of the primary factors that contributes to infection is immune health of the animal. Ringworm in dogs is most common in puppies and older animals, though it can also affect animals with suppressed immune systems. Dogs under stress or taking certain medications can thus be especially vulnerable. This is because the immune system keeps the flora and fauna that are normal inhabitants of the skin in check. However, if the immune system is not fighting fit, the fungus can grow unchecked and a full on infection develops. While the fungi that cause ringworm are common, contact with an especially heavy concentration of spores can increase the likelihood of infection. Heavy concentrations are really only found on other infected animals. If your dog is healthy but gets ringworm, it is probably because it was around another animal that had the disease. Ringworm is highly infectious and the infected hairs that are shed are a major source of infection for people or other pets. In order to prevent the spread of the disease, sequester infected pets and clean up all fur from the infected pet before allowing other animals in the area."
