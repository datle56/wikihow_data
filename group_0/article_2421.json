      "content": "Look for russets that are 5-10 oz (142-284 g) for even cooking. If you plan on cooking multiple potatoes at once, look for potatoes that are about the same size so they finish at the same time. Smaller potatoes will cook in less time, and larger ones may need a few extra minutes. [1] X Research source Try microwaving sweet potatoes for a different flavor, or Yukon Gold potatoes for a denser, creamier texture. Russet potatoes (Idaho or baking potatoes) are great for baking because of their thick skin and starchiness (more starch means a fluffier texture)."

    {
      "title": "Scrub the potato",
      "content": "Scrub the potato under lukewarm water to get rid of dirt and grime. Make sure the water is close to the temperature of the potato—a temperature differential can actually help bacteria enter your food. Rub away dirt or debris with your hands or a clean vegetable brush and pat the potato dry with a paper towel. [2] X Research source If your potato has small sprouts or green spots, it’s still edible—peel or chop them off, making sure you go deep enough to remove the entire sprout. [3] X Research source If the sprouts are huge or the entire potato is green, throw it away and grab a fresher one."

      "title": "Pierce the skin 3-4 times on each side to vent the potato.",
      "content": "Pierce the skin 3-4 times on each side to vent the potato. This step is very important—the holes allow steam to escape and prevent the potato from exploding (which will make a mess in your microwave and ruin your dinner!). [4] X Research source Alternatively, cut a wedge 1 in (2.5 cm) deep and ⅛ in (3.2 mm) deep down the long side of the potato. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Brush the skin with olive oil and season with salt and pepper for flavor.",
      "content": "Brush the skin with olive oil and season with salt and pepper for flavor. If you prefer a bolder flavor on your potato skin, try substituting butter or bacon grease for olive oil. Feel free to add other seasonings you like besides salt and pepper, too. Try garlic powder for a savory tang, or za’atar for a Mediterranean spin. [6] X Research source Adding olive oil (or any other oil or fat) helps crisp up the potato skin while it cooks."

      "content": "Use metal-free glass or ceramic plates to avoid melting or sparking. [7] X Research source If your microwave tends to dry out produce, cover the potato with a microwave safe lid to hold in steam. If you don’t have a lid, try placing the potato in a microwave safe bowl with a plate on top. [8] X Research source Try wrapping the potato in a clean paper towel for a similar but less moisture-trapping effect."

      "title": "Use your microwave’s highest power for the most even cooking.",
      "content": "Use your microwave’s highest power for the most even cooking. [9] X Research source If your microwave is 1,000 watts or higher, start with 5-6 minutes. If it’s 900 watts or lower, start with about 8:30 (more watts means less cooking time). [10] X Research source If you’re microwaving multiple potatoes at once, increase the time: [11] X Research source 2-3 potatoes: Start with 7-8 minutes (10-12 minutes total) 4-5 potatoes: Start with 10-12 minutes (14-18 minutes total) If your microwave doesn’t have a rotating carousel, pause it twice during cooking time and turn the potato a half turn each time. Sweet potatoes or Yukon Golds may take a few minutes less than russet potatoes in most microwaves."

      "content": "Use tongs or an oven mitt to flip the potato so it cooks through evenly. The remaining cooking time depends on the exact size of the potato and the power of your microwave. If the potato feels fairly soft when you flip it, try 1-2 minute bursts until it’s fully done. If it’s still firm, go for 3 or more minutes then check it again. [12] X Research source If you’re microwaving 2-3 potatoes , they’ll probably need another 3-5 minutes or so. If you’re microwaving 4-5 potatoes , give them another 4-8 minutes. Remember, larger potatoes will take more time than smaller ones."

If it glides through fairly easily, the potato is done (it’s OK if the center is slightly firmer than the outsides). Alternatively, stick the potato with a food thermometer . If the temperature is about 210 °F (99 °C), it’s ready to eat! [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Bake your finished potatoes at 375 °F (191 °C) for 10-15 minutes. Preheat the oven while your potatoes are microwaving if you want extra delicious, crispy skin. When they’re done microwaving, put them on a baking tray and slide them in the oven until the skin gets nice and crispy. [14] X Research source Microwaves cook the insides to perfection, but don’t always deliver on the crispy skin. The oven can fix this (and still take less time than regular baking!). This step is optional. If you’re running low on time or don’t mind a slightly softer skin, feel free to skip it."

      "title": "Set the potato aside so it can cool down to a safe handling temperature.",
      "content": "Set the potato aside so it can cool down to a safe handling temperature. This also gives the center another moment to cook in the trapped heat inside the potato. Wear oven mitts to remove the hot plate from the microwave. [15] X Research source Wrap the potato in tin foil to keep it warm for a long time. This is a great option if you're eating on the go or saving it for someone who’s running late. If you’re in a rush, cut open the potato immediately after the microwave stops and add your toppings. Then, microwave for another 30 to 60 seconds."

Keep it simple and classic with a pat of butter and some salt, or go deluxe with sour cream, shredded cheese, green onions, chives, or bacon bits. [16] X Research source If you’re craving some melty, cheesy goodness, sprinkle some shredded cheese on top of the potato and microwave it again for about a minute. Try microwaving a slice or 2 of bacon while your potato rests to make crumbly bacon bits. If you want a hearty meal from your potato, try scrambling some eggs or making chili con carne to put on top."
