Check the packages of foods you’re preparing to about serving sizes and follow the guidelines. Unless you intend to make a lot of food so that there will be leftovers, try to follow basic serving size guidelines. One serving of meat or fish is approximately 3 ounces.

The Mayo Clinic names eggs, milk, peanuts, shellfish, tree nuts, soy and fish as some of the most common food allergens. [7] X Research source Wheat is another big one. Common food intolerances are lactose (which is in milk products), MSG and gluten (which is in bread, pasta, and many wheat products).

When fruit and vegetables aren’t in season, buy canned or frozen varieties, which are generally cheaper while still offering great nutritional benefits. Along with your local grocery stores’ produce section, also check out any farmer’s markets in your area for even more options and organic produce at a low price."

For instance, if you work 8 or more hours per day, you’re going to have less time available for preparing meals. Plan meals that are faster and easier to prepare. Invest in a crock pot. You do a quick prep the night before, toss everything in the crock pot the next morning, turn it on and you're done! When you arrive back home later that evening, your meal will be waiting for you. Cook large batches and freeze portions for later meals. Use canned items, like beans, for a quicker meal prep. No hours of soaking required. [14] X Research source When you're short on time, use frozen vegetables instead of fresh. Frozen veggies are still nutritious, and you'll save tons of prep time.
