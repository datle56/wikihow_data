      "content": "A talkative Gemini guy will enjoy sharing details about his life. Get to know him by asking thoughtful questions about his hobbies and family, and respond to his texts to show you're listening. Start with easy questions and get more personal as you grow comfortable with each other. He'll see how much you care when you show interest in his life. \"What's your favorite thing to do for fun, and why?\" \"Where in the world would you travel if money wasn't an issue, and what would you do there?\" \"What's your favorite memory of your family?\""

      "title": "Geminis are smart and need a partner who can stimulate their minds.",
      "content": "Geminis are smart and need a partner who can stimulate their minds. Match his intelligence by bringing up thought-provoking topics such as politics and current events or anything you're passionate about, including books, movies, and art. Your Gemini guy loves a challenge, so share your thoughts and inspire him with new perspectives. He'll love finding an intellectual equal in you! [1] X Research source Also, wow him with your creativity and playfulness with words. \"Have you seen this article yet? I'd love to know your thoughts!\" \"I have SO many thoughts about this book I'm reading. Have you heard of it?\""

      "content": "Indulge his witty sense of humor by sending him funny texts and memes. Every Gemini has an inner child, so he'll take any opportunity to laugh and have a good time. Send a joke out of the blue, or respond to his texts with a goofy GIF instead of words. Make sure to appreciate the jokes that he sends you, too. \"I'm not a professional photographer, but I can picture us together. 😘\" \"Just saw this meme and immediately thought of you! 🤣\" \"That story was hilarious. My ribs won't stop aching! …Tell it again. 😆\""

      "title": "Geminis value their social lives, so tell him about yours.",
      "content": "Geminis value their social lives, so tell him about yours. Bring up your friends, family, and your hobbies regularly. If you're comfortable with it, you can even offer to introduce him to your friends—which he'll love, since he always wants to meet new people. When he sees how popular you are, he'll want to be with you that much more. If he asks what you do for fun, you could say, \"A bunch of friends and I do a weekly game night. It's the best!\" When ending a text conversation, you could say, \"I've got to run! Grabbing drinks with a few buddies. Shall we continue this later? 😊\" Try including him in the fun. \"The fair is in town! Wanna check it out with me? I'm meeting up with some friends, and I'd love it if you came too. 😘\""

      "content": "He wants a partner whose passion motivates him in turn. Discuss your plans for the future with your Gemini, whether it's related to your career or some other dream that you're working hard to achieve. Geminis are insanely attracted to people who take charge of their lives and chase their goals with confidence. [2] X Research source \"It's my dream to make a full-time business out of my blog, and I've been making lots of progress lately!\" \"I graduated college a few years ago, but I plan to go back and get my master's in psychology!\" \"Hey, do you prefer this or that?\" Geminis are dual minded about things. So, showing them both sides of a situation could be a very entertaining conversation for a Gemini."

      "title": "Give his curious Gemini mind a reason to think about you constantly.",
      "content": "Give his curious Gemini mind a reason to think about you constantly. Hold back some details when you're texting him and let him get to know you gradually rather than all at once. That way, you always have something new to talk about. Geminis can get bored easily, but he'll keep coming back for more when he knows there's more to learn about you. [3] X Research source Be a bit vague when answering personal questions. \"Oh, I'm from a small town in California. I bet you haven't heard of it!\" Hint that you could talk more face-to-face. \"That's a long story—probably best if I tell you in person rather than over text! You'll have to remind me next time we hang out. 😉\""

      "content": "Flirting is Gemini's second language, so he'll love it when you tease him. Odds are he's probably flirting with you already—and if he isn't, he will once he picks up on your flirty vibe. Text him a flirty pick-up line or a teasing comeback to use when he flirts first. He'll love exchanging playful banter with you, so try witty flirts rather than something more obviously emotional. \"You remind me of my next boyfriend! 😉\" \"Hey, handsome. Did you miss me?\" \"Remember the last time we texted? I'm still wearing the smile you gave me. 😊\""

      "content": "A Gemini's youthful energy responds well to an optimistic partner. Save heavy topics for when you see him in person and use texting to brighten your Gemini's day. Send him little \"good morning\" or \"thinking of you\" texts, and generally stick to lighthearted topics. Make him feel happy and comfortable when he talks to you, and he'll never get tired of your company! \"Hey, there, handsome! Hope you have a great day. 💋\" \"I can't help but smile whenever your name pops up on my phone screen. 😍\" \"Good morning! ☀️ I just woke up, and you're already on my mind.\""

      "content": "Geminis can be a bit moody so try to match his energy. Their mood shifts do not make them unreliable people; rather, it just means the easiest way to communicate with them is by being aware of how they're feeling. Be patient and accepting when he's having a gloomy day, and mirror his upbeat attitude when it returns. \"It's okay to have bad days! Treat yourself to some comfort food and text me anytime. 😊\" \"Hey, give it some time. You'll figure everything out!\" \"I'm glad you're feeling better today! I've been saving some funny videos to show you.\" Reader Poll: We asked 143 wikiHow readers, and 48% agreed that the approach they find most helpful for supporting someone over text is offering a listening ear .

      "content": "Your Gemini avoids routine at all costs, so try new things with him. Suggest a spur-of-the-moment activity for you to do together, and get on board with his adventurous whims when you can. There will probably be times when he'll suddenly ask you to hang out, and you'll have plans. However, if you have the availability, take him up on each spontaneous offer. \"I know we've got a date next weekend, but I don't want to wait! Meet me at the park in 30. 😄\" \"Thank you for the surprise invite! It made my day. Happy to be your lunch date anytime! 😘\""

      "content": "Geminis value their independence and like it when partners do the same. Show him that a relationship with you won't stifle him or make him feel tied down. Allow some time to pass between your texts with him. You don't have to leave a text unanswered, but you also don't have to answer right away. Just live your life, text him when you can, and let him do the same. \"Hey! Got caught up with work. What's up? 😊\" \"Sorry to leave you hanging! I was grabbing coffee with friends. This place makes a mean latte! 🤤\" Double-texting is a common mistake, but it'll make a Gemini guy feel smothered. Send him one text and wait for him to respond before sending another!"

      "content": "Geminis are impatient, so be upfront about your feelings. Being mysterious will catch his attention, but hiding how you feel will make him think you're not interested. Keep things casual when you tell him; let him know there's no pressure, but you like him a lot, and you'd be interested in spending more time together. \"So, I have a problem. I can't stop thinking about you! 😳\" \"Talking to you is so much fun. I really like you!\" \"I have a confession: I think you're cute!\""

Geminis love a little risk and adventure, so odds are he'll happily agree to a date with someone who puts themselves out there. \"I need a plus-one for dinner this weekend. Are you interested? 😘\" \"It's been great getting to know you over text. What do you say to a coffee date so we can chat in person?\""
