      "content": "Gemini men seem to be magnetically attracted to Pisces women. A Gemini is a social butterfly who wants to meet and talk to everyone he sees—and you are no exception.

      "content": "Gemini men are naturally attracted to soft, feminine beauty. As an emotional Water sign, you already love soft, flowy feminine clothes, so this is a point in your favor. Just try to keep it on the conservative side—Gemini guys tend to be pretty traditional and he might not like it if you're showing a lot of skin. If you're going out on a date, you might wear a long, flowing skirt with light, strappy sandals and a light wrap sweater in a pastel color. For a more casual outing, try leggings or capri pants along with a loose, flowy blouse."

      "content": "A Twin will be fascinated by your fantastic inner world. Ruled by Neptune, the planet of dreams, Pisces women are the dreamers of the zodiac—completely foreign ground for the typically practical Gemini. But at the same time, he also loves all things new, so your imaginative dream world will always draw him in. As a Water sign, you tend to be focused more on intuition and emotion. But he's an Air sign, ruled by logic and reason, and he doesn't tend to think about emotion too much. For him, this lends a certain magic and mystery to your ideas. A Gemini takes pride in the breadth of his knowledge, so you're unlikely to mention anything that he doesn't know a little bit about. Your fanciful take on things will intrigue him all the more. Reader Poll: We asked 698 wikiHow readers if they think Geminis are generally attracted to people who are curious, and 50% of them said yes.

      "content": "Your signs make excellent friends but have a lower romantic compatibility. Gemini guys are slow to commit anyway, so take a step back.

[1] X Research source When you're friends, you can focus on the things you have in common and also learn where you'll need to compromise if you want a romantic relationship to work.

[2] X Research source What he needs is someone who will actively and attentively listen. As a Pisces, you have a natural ability to listen closely and understand, which he'll adore.

Snare a Gemini by asking him questions that appeal to his dual-minded nature, like \"Do you prefer this or that?\" Whether you ask about pizza toppings or travel destinations, a Gemini will dive into the conversation."

      "content": "The Twin loves to figure something out before anyone else. Pisces ladies tend to love romance, so you'd probably enjoy a romantic comedy more—but you also love art that enables you to escape reality for a while. He'll love the thrill of solving the puzzle and adore you for introducing him to something new. Be forewarned that Geminis tend to be the kind of guys who do their thinking and reasoning aloud—meaning, it's usually better if you catch that flick at home than in a crowded theater where you might disturb others."

      "content": "Geminis don't like to be tied down.

[4] X Research source He'll see that you respect his freedom if you aren't texting him constantly to check in or find out what he's doing. Even asking when he'll be back can seem too controlling to a Gemini (who likely couldn't tell you anyway)."

And as an introverted, emotional Pisces, you're great at keeping secrets, so you're the perfect woman to pull this off. Most people associate surprise parties with birthdays, but you don't have to wait for that. Pulling together a little surprise for no reason at all is even more unexpected and really shows that you care."
