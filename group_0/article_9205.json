      "content": "Determine whether or not your computers have Ethernet ports. Ethernet ports resemble large, rectangular ports which usually have a three-box icon next to them. You'll usually find Ethernet ports on one side of your computer's housing (laptop) or on the back of the tower (desktop). On iMac computers, the Ethernet port is found on the back of the monitor."

      "content": "Buy an Ethernet adapter if necessary. If your computer doesn't have an Ethernet port, you'll need to buy a USB Ethernet adapter for your computer. You can find these online (e.g., Amazon) and in tech stores (e.g., Best Buy). If you have a Mac, check your USB ports as well. You might have only USB-C ports (e.g., oval ports instead of rectangular ports) meaning that you'll either need an Ethernet to USB-C adapter or a USB to USB-C adapter as well."

      "content": "Check to see if you have a crossover Ethernet cable. While most Ethernet ports support both conventional Ethernet cables and crossover Ethernet cables, you can avoid potential errors by using a crossover Ethernet cable. To determine whether or not you have a crossover cable, view the colored wires at the end of each side of the cable: [1] X Research source If the colors are differently ordered on one end, you have a crossover cable. If the colors are the same for both ends from left to right, you have a conventional cable. You can still use this cable for most computers, but if you're connecting older computers to each other, consider buying a crossover cable if you run into issues."
