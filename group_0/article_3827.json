You can also use the tool to create shapes and illustrations. Start by opening your image (or creating a new drawing) in GIMP. To open an image, go to File > Open… and select your image.

The lines between points can be straight or curved. If you're selecting an object, your goal is to place points around the entire perimeter of the object to surround it with line segments."

Move the mouse to the location where you'd like to place the next point, and then click and drag the cursor left (to curve the line right) or right (to curve the line left). [6] X Research source You can drag the curve in any direction you'd like to properly wrap around an object or create a line that curves in the desired direction. The curve will always in the opposite direction that you drag. When you release the mouse button, you'll have a new point with a yellow directional line indicating the direction of the curve. At each end of the directional line, you'll see squares—these squares are called handles. You can move each of the handles to precisely shape the curve.

You can undo a point you've placed by mistake by pressing Ctrl + Z (PC) or Command + Z (Mac). [8] X Research source While you're adding points, you'll see a small + at the cursor's top-right corner.

To use a paint tool for your line, such as the pencil or paintbrush, select Stroke with a paint tool , then choose your tool. The Stroke Path tool will use the current size and shape of the tool you select, so you might want to close the window and choose your preferences before applying the stroke line.

Both Design and Edit modes allow you to make the most changes to the path, but each of these two modes have different features.
