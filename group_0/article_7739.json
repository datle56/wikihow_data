      "title": "Commercial electrical contact cleaners",
      "content": "Commercial electrical contact cleaners According to Stoescu, many manufacturers make cleaners specifically for removing dust, dirt, and grime from electrical contacts. These cleaners typically contain solvents, like isopropyl alcohol, that are safe to use on a wide variety of electrical contacts, like car wiring and circuit boards. Common brands include CRC QD Electronic Cleaner and WD-40 Contact Cleaner , says Stoescu. Most cleaners are aerosol-based, so they’re quick and easy to spray. Commercial cleaners are either solvent or water-based: Solvent-based cleaners are better at removing tough debris, but are often flammable. So, do not use them near flames, sparks, or heat sources. Water-based cleaners are usually gentler on grime and take longer to dry, but are less hazardous to use. Note : Don’t use other commercial cleaners in place of contact cleaners, such as brake cleaner. These products can potentially damage the contact."

      "content": "Turn off the power to the electrical contact and put on safety gear. To reduce the risk of electrical shock, shut off power to the contact you’re cleaning and unplug it from the power source, if possible. Then, put on a pair of cleaning gloves and goggles to protect your skin and eyes from the cleaning solutions. [12] X Research source If you’re cleaning a contact on your car’s electrical harness, turn off the engine and disconnect the battery . [13] X Research source If you’re cleaning a contact connected to your home’s electrical system, turn off the power at your circuit breaker. Make sure to work in a well-ventilated area, too. This helps air out the cleaner as you’re using it so you don’t breathe it in."

It’s important to regularly clean electrical contacts in your car, devices, appliances, and other machines so they work properly and keep you safe from electrical hazards. Keeping the contacts clean also helps extend their life. Some common signs that contacts are in need of a clean include: [22] X Research source Decreased functionality : You might notice that your device or machine isn’t connecting properly or working as it should. For example, you might have problems with one of your car’s sensors or be unable to use your TV remote. Dust and debris buildup : When you inspect a contact, you may see a lot of dirt, dust, grime, and other debris on the surface. Buildup can lead to loss of functionality. Corrosion : Moisture and age can cause electrical contacts to develop corrosion, which looks like white, blue, or green buildup. Like dirt buildup, corrosion can cause items to stop working. Oxidation : Metal tends to oxidize over time, which can cause rust or discoloration to form on the contact. Oxidation can also cause your item to not work properly. Wear and tear : General signs of wear and tear, like scratches, dings, and fading, indicate the contact is aging, so it’s a good idea to clean it so it keeps working well."
