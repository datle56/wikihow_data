      "content": "Get your rubbing alcohol. Rubbing alcohol is a solution of isopropyl alcohol and distilled water. It is commonly sold at most big box stores, grocery stores, and hardware stores. Rubbing alcohol typically comes as 60% to 90% isopropyl alcohol and distilled water solution. Depending on what you’re cleaning, you may want a higher or lower percentage. Sometimes rubbing alcohol will come as an ethanol and distilled water solution. For the purposes of cleaning, they are interchangeable. In addition to cleaning, rubbing alcohol has disinfectant properties and may kill bacteria or viruses."

      "content": "Buy materials to use when cleaning with rubbing alcohol. After you get your rubbing alcohol, you’ll need to secure materials to use to help you clean. Ultimately, you’ll be able to use a variety of cotton or other fabric products to aid in your cleaning. For surfaces that may scratch easily, consider microfiber rags. Such surfaces include plastic (like keyboards or mice), other computer accessories, or car components. For surfaces that are hard to access, you’ll want to consider cotton swabs. Such surfaces include groves in plastic or metal auto parts. For surfaces in which you need a somewhat abrasive aid, use regular cotton rags or clothes. Whenever possible, use clean white rags to lessen the chance of color transfer. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Confirm that the material you’ll be cleaning won’t be damaged by rubbing alcohol. Before you begin the process of cleaning with rubbing alcohol, you need to make sure that the surface or material won’t be damaged by it. This is important, since rubbing alcohol can damage certain surfaces. Read any care tag or directions that comes with whatever you’re cleaning. Make sure you’ve read care instructions on consumer electronics like LCD or LED screens. You should, particularly, avoid cleaning smartphone or tablet screens with rubbing alcohol. This could remove the fine, slick, coating that enables your touchscreen to work smoothly. Be careful when using alcohol on delicate and aged fabrics or finished wood. Rubbing alcohol may remove lacquer or finish from wood. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean the surface of the material.",
      "content": "Clean the surface of the material. Before you clean the material with alcohol, you need to prepare it by wiping it down with water first. Wiping it down and removing dirt and grime is important, as any residual dirt could hinder the cleaning process and/or damage the material. Take a clean rag. Depending on whether the surface is delicate or not, you'll need to choose between a regular cotton rag or a microfiber rag. Dampen the rag. Wipe the material down gently and slowly. Allow the material to dry. Consider blowing or using a cool blow dryer to blow away dust or residual fibers left from a rag. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Dampen your cleaning aid with rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Dampen your cleaning aid with rubbing alcohol. Your first step in using rubbing alcohol to clean will be to dampen whatever cleaning aid you’re using. Dampening is important, as you don’t’ want a lot of extra alcohol left on the surface of whatever it is you are cleaning. If you’re cleaning with a cotton swab or a rag, firmly put it over the top of the bottle of rubbing alcohol and turn the bottle over. Allow the alcohol to penetrate the swab or rag for a couple seconds. If the alcohol starts to drip on the floor or onto your hand, you’ve applied too much. Make sure you're in an well-ventilated, as alcohol evaporates quickly. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Perform a test cleaning. While some materials are more vulnerable to alcohol than others, you should still do a test cleaning on whatever you’re cleaning. By doing a test cleaning, you’ll make sure that you don’t completely ruin what you’re cleaning. Pick a spot that is not normally visible on the material of what you will be cleaning. Take a cotton swab, dampen it with alcohol, and clean a 1-inch by 1-inch area. Let the area dry. Wait several hours to see if the color fades or the material has been damaged in any way.

Now that you’ve dampened your cleaning aid, take it and apply it to the surface of whatever you’re cleaning. When applying the cleaning aid with rubbing alcohol, make sure to: Move the cleaning aid gently across the surface of whatever you’re cleaning. Swipe the cleaning aid in a back and forth pattern so you get good cleaning coverage. Observe to make sure that you’re not leaving pools of alcohol behind you as you clean. If you are, take a clean, dry, white rag and sop up any excess. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Find a well-ventilated area.",
      "content": "Find a well-ventilated area. You should always use rubbing alcohol in a well-ventilated area. This is because rubbing alcohol can evaporate quickly and its fumes are flammable. As a result, make sure that wherever you are, it is well-ventilated. If you’re in a garage or workshop, make sure to leave the garage door or workshop door open. If there are any windows, open them. If you’re inside, make sure the air conditioner is running, you’ve got a fan on, and interior doors are open. This will maximize air flow. Cleaning outdoors might work best. If you notice yourself getting light-headed, move to a better ventilated area immediately. [7] X Research source"
