      "title": "Push 2 strands of dry spaghetti into 1 marshmallow.",
      "content": "Push 2 strands of dry spaghetti into 1 marshmallow. Line up the 2 spaghetti strands. Push them evenly into the top round side of the marshmallow. Use full-size marshmallows rather than the miniature kind. Using 2 strands of spaghetti instead of just 1 will strengthen your tower and help it to eventually stand upright. Push the spaghetti far enough into the marshmallows so that it feels stable, but not far enough to come through the opposite side. Around halfway will do. Make sure to center the spaghetti. If you put too much weight on one side, the marshmallow will probably tip over."

[1] X Research source It might be tricky to push these next spaghetti strands into the same marshmallow. Do it carefully, and try to add the strands just next to where the first strands were pushed in."

      "content": "Push 2 strands of spaghetti into each new marshmallow. Create 2 more right angles. Make sure that the strands are lined up well, and are as close to 90° as possible. This will ensure that your tower is sturdy. [3] X Research source Your square so far will look like a rigid “U” shape."

Get creative, and see how tall and stable you can make a tower with only 1 marshmallow."
