    {
      "title": "Handwrite the address in blue or black ink.",
      "content": "Handwrite the address in blue or black ink. Handwriting is more personal and preferred for graduation announcements. Make sure you use a pen that won't smear easily, especially if it gets wet. Cursive writing is preferred to print. However, you want to make sure the writing is legible so the postal workers will be able to deliver it. Generally, the address should be written in the center of the back of the envelope (the solid side, not the side with the flap). Make sure to leave space for the stamp in the upper-right-hand corner."

    {
      "title": "Use full names and formal titles for recipients' names.",
      "content": "Use full names and formal titles for recipients' names. On the mailing envelope, write out the full first and last name of the recipient along with the appropriate title (Mr., Ms., Mrs., Dr., etc.). If you're mailing an announcement to a married couple, include a title and the first and last name for each of them. If the two people have different titles, write the names in the same order as the titles. For example, if you were sending an announcement to Dr. John Gray and Mr. Kevin Gray, you would address them as \"Dr. and Mr. John and Kevin Gray.\" If you're sending an announcement to two people who live together but are not married to each other, list their names separately. For example: \"Ms. Mary Mack and Mr. Louis Lutz.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Include the full mailing address without abbreviations.",
      "content": "Include the full mailing address without abbreviations. On the line below the names, write out the street address. Do not abbreviate words such as \"street\" or \"avenue.\" Move down to the next line, and write the city, state, and ZIP code. Typically, you don't want to abbreviate the name of the state either. However, using postal abbreviations is acceptable. If this line gets too long, you can write the ZIP code below the line with the city and state. Typically, the ZIP code is written further over to the right, so that the last number lines up with the end of the line above it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put the return address on the flap.",
      "content": "Put the return address on the flap. With most cards and letters, the return address goes in the top-left-hand corner of the back of the envelope. However, with graduation announcements and other formal mailings, the return address goes on the flap of the envelope. You may want to try this out in pencil before you commit to make sure there's enough space for you to write your full address. You can use abbreviations for the return address, and it may be necessary for you to have enough room. If there isn't enough space for you to fit your return address on the flap of the envelope, buy pre-printed address labels and use those instead. You may be able to find labels with a graduation theme."

    {
      "title": "Write the recipient's first name on the back of the inner envelope.",
      "content": "Write the recipient's first name on the back of the inner envelope. The inner envelope is more informal than the outer envelope. Here, write what you would call the recipient if you were addressing them in person. If the recipient is a relative, it's appropriate to use a familial title, or to combine a familial title with a name. For example, you might address the inner envelope simply to \"grandma,\" but you could also use \"Aunt Sue\" or \"Aunt Sarah and Uncle Bob.\""

    {
      "title": "Insert the announcement and anything else you want to include.",
      "content": "Insert the announcement and anything else you want to include. Apart from the announcement itself, some graduates like to include an invitation to the graduation ceremony itself or to their own graduation party along with the announcement. You may also want to include glitter or confetti to announce the festive occasion. Some graduation announcements come with name cards. You can include these in the announcement if you want. The vendor will have instructions on how to assemble the announcement package appropriately. Place your announcement in the inner envelope fold-first. Include any additional inserts inside the announcement itself. The front of the announcement should be facing the envelope flap. If you want people to attend your graduation, make sure to include as much detail as possible in your announcement, like the location, time, and date.

    {
      "title": "Slip the inner envelope into the outer envelope.",
      "content": "Slip the inner envelope into the outer envelope. The inner envelope does not have adhesive and shouldn't be sealed. If you bought seals for your envelopes, they are for use with the outer envelope. The inside envelope should face towards the back of the outer envelope. Seal the outer envelope to close the entire announcement. If you bought seals, attach one to the tip of the flap to hold the outer envelope closed. If you didn't buy seals, lightly moisten the edge of the outer envelope to seal it closed."

      "title": "Affix a USPS First Class stamp to each of your mailing envelopes.",
      "content": "Affix a USPS First Class stamp to each of your mailing envelopes. You can use any stamp design available through the USPS. However, in honor of this special occasion, you may want to create custom stamps. Several vendors print custom stamps that are accepted by the USPS. Prices vary depending on how many stamps you get and the complexity of the design you choose. [3] X Research source Unless you happen to be mailing an announcement to an international address, you should only need one stamp. If mailing to an international address, you might want to put the whole thing in another envelope for mailing."

    {
      "title": "Send announcements that include invitations before the ceremony.",
      "content": "Send announcements that include invitations before the ceremony. If you've included an invitation to the ceremony itself, or to your own graduation party, mail those announcements out to recipients at least 2 weeks to 3 weeks before the date of the ceremony. Provide extra time if your guests will have to travel a longer distance. [4] X Research source Traditionally, you would send invitations separately from your announcements. However, if you want to send them all at once, it's appropriate to do so."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait until after the ceremony to send announcements without invitations.",
      "content": "Wait until after the ceremony to send announcements without invitations. A graduation announcement tells the recipient that you have graduated, not that you're going to graduate soon. For this reason, if no invitation to the ceremony or a party is included, it's best to send your announcements out after the ceremony. [5] X Research source Try to send your announcements within a week after the ceremony. Avoid sending them out more than 6 weeks after the ceremony. If you're planning an extended vacation after graduation, go ahead and mail out your announcements a day or two before the ceremony."
