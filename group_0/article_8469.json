      "title": "Lift the hair away from the brush with a rat tail comb.",
      "content": "Lift the hair away from the brush with a rat tail comb. Over time, hair tends to get wrapped around the barrel of the brush. Slide the point of a rat tail comb between the barrel and the matted hair. Try to push the comb under all of the hair that covers the length of the barrel and then gently lift the comb upward to loosen the hair. [1] X Research source If you don’t have a rat tail comb, use a pen instead."

      "title": "Cut the lifted hair with a pair of scissors.",
      "content": "Cut the lifted hair with a pair of scissors. This breaks up the matted hair and makes it easier to pull away from the hairbrush. Use scissors to cut the hair in a straight line from the bottom of the barrel to the top. [2] X Research source If the bristles on your brush are close together, use a narrow pair of scissors, such as nail scissors. Take care not to cut any of the bristles."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rotate the brush 180° and repeat the lifting and cutting process.",
      "content": "Rotate the brush 180° and repeat the lifting and cutting process. This makes it easier to pull the hair off the brush and reduces the strain on the bristles, especially if they have little rubber balls on the end. Turn the brush over, pull the hair away from the brush again with a rat tail comb, and then cut it with scissors. [3] X Research source If you don’t have much hair on your brush, you can skip this step."

    {
      "title": "Pull the hair off the brush.",
      "content": "Pull the hair off the brush. Gently tug the strands of hair away from the bristle. Try not to pull on the bristles, as this can misshape them and damage their ends. Keep pulling the strands until the brush is completely clean. [4] X Research source Throw the old hair into the trash, as it can block your pipes if it goes down the sink."

      "title": "Mix water, shampoo, and baking soda in a small bowl.",
      "content": "Mix water, shampoo, and baking soda in a small bowl. Measure 1 cup (240 mL) of water, 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of shampoo, and 1 tsp of baking soda (6 grams) in a small bowl. Stir the mixture until the water, shampoo, and baking soda are fully combined. [5] X Research source Alternatively, you can soak it in warm water with 2 to 3 pumps of shampoo.

Clean between the bristles, the handle, and the bristles to completely sanitize your brush. [7] X Research source Use a clean toothbrush for this task and then throw it away after."

    {
      "title": "Rinse the brush in cold water.",
      "content": "Rinse the brush in cold water. Briefly place the brush under a cold tap or quickly dip it into a bowl of water. This rinses off the baking soda solution. Shake the brush to remove the excess water. [8] X Research source Avoid soaking your brush in water as this can cause mildew to grow."

      "content": "Mix hot water and tea tree oil in a bowl. Measure 0.5 cups (120 mL) of hot tap water and 5 drops of tea tree essential oil into a small bowl. [10] X Research source This method works well for wooden brushes as it uses limited water. Purchase tea tree oil from a pharmacy, supermarket, or a natural health store."

If you notice any drips of water running down the base of the barrel, shake them off, as sitting water can damage the wooden surface of the brush.
