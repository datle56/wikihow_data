      "title": "Warm up the olive oil.",
      "content": "Warm up the olive oil. Olive oil helps soften the wax in your ears, making it easier to drain on its own. Before putting any of the oil into your ears, however, you should warm it roughly to body temperature—98.6°F (37°C). This is the temperature of your inner ear, and the oil will be more comfortable at a comparable temperature. You should warm two to three tablespoons of pure olive oil. Ensure you don’t overheat the oil since this can cause damage to your eardrum."

      "title": "Add essential oils if you wish.",
      "content": "Add essential oils if you wish. Blockages can also trap bacteria, which can lead to infection of the ear. Some people choose to add essential oils with antibacterial properties to help with excess bacteria that may be present due to the blockage. However, the olive oil alone has shown to be effective in simply helping to break up the blockage. Make sure to test a drop or two of the oil on your skin to check for irritation before adding it to your ears. Add about four drops to the warmed olive oil. Some essential oil options include: Garlic oil [1] X Research source Tsao, S-M., Yin, M-C., In-vitro antimicrobial activity of four diallyl sulphides occurring naturally in garlic and Chinese leek oils. J Med Microbiol. 50:646-649, 2001.

      "content": "Collect some of the mix with an eyedropper. Once you’ve mixed the olive oil and any essential oils you’ve chosen, pick up some of the solution with an eyedropper. This will help you deliver the correct amount of the solution, and it’s much easier than trying to pour olive oil into your ear."

      "content": "Squeeze two drops of the solution into your ear. Rather than filling your ear with the oil, you can apply just a few drops, which will soak into the wax. Keep your head titled to stop the oil from escaping for five to ten minutes. You can keep a tissue next to your ear to catch any remaining oil that drips out when you straighten your head—if any."

      "title": "Repeat the process two to three times a day.",
      "content": "Repeat the process two to three times a day. Using the olive oil isn’t likely to work in a single application. You should try to repeat the process two to three times each day for approximately three to five days. [5] X Research source This should be sufficient time to help dissolve and break up the blockage."

      "title": "Consider irrigating your ear.",
      "content": "Consider irrigating your ear. Though the olive oil may have softened the blockage, some cases require more to actually dislodge it. You can irrigate the affected ear as an additional step if necessary. Use a rubber-bulb syringe (such as those used for babies), tilt your head, and gently squirt warmed water into the canal of the affected ear. Be very gentle since you can damage your eardrum if you squirt the water with too much pressure. You can pull your ear both up and backward to help straighten the ear canal for best results. Your doctor can also irrigate your ear. He or she will have a safer method with tools using an exact pressure of water to avoid damaging your ear."

      "title": "Take an over-the-counter (OTC) product.",
      "content": "Take an over-the-counter (OTC) product. A variety of different OTC products are available to help relieve ear pressure depending on the specific cause. Common options include: Antihistamines - If your ear pressure is due to congestion from seasonal or environmental allergies, then you can take an antihistamine to help reduce symptoms. Decongestants - If the pressure is from congestion due to a cold or the flu, then a cold and flu medicine with a decongestant will help to relieve the symptoms causing the pressure. Cerumenolytics - These products essentially act the same way as olive oil to help soften the blockage if earwax is the cause of the pressure."
