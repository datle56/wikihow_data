      "title": "Put on a safety mask before using Plasti Dip spray.",
      "content": "Put on a safety mask before using Plasti Dip spray. Whenever you work with a sprayable substance, set up your workspace in a clean, well-ventilated area. After slipping on a safety mask or other specialized gas mask, check that your mouth and nose are fully covered and protected. Since you’re working with a sprayable product, you don’t want to accidentally inhale any rubber coating. [1] X Research source While you don’t have to wear gloves, you can slip some on as a safety precaution."

      "title": "Mask smaller areas with pieces of painter’s tape.",
      "content": "Mask smaller areas with pieces of painter’s tape. Cut or rip away several sections of painter’s tape, then arrange these pieces in a square or rectangular shape around a surface you’d like to protect and recolor. If you’re painting a larger surface, like the hood of a car, tape drop cloths or plastic sheeting around the designated area. [2] X Research source For instance, if you’re repainting the silver emblem on the side of your car, place strips of tape a few inches or centimeters away from each side of the emblem. Next, cover the nearby car doors and windows by taping sheeting and/or drop cloths into place. If you’re painting over a large surface, don’t worry about masking off specific areas."

      "title": "Shake the Plasti Dip can firmly for 60 seconds.",
      "content": "Shake the Plasti Dip can firmly for 60 seconds. Hold the can in 1 hand and move it in a rapid up and down motion. Once you hear the can rattling, start counting to 60. If you don’t shake the can before spraying the Plasti Dip, you might end up with a lumpy, inconsistent application. [3] X Research source Ideally, try shaking your can throughout the painting process, like between different coats. This will keep your Plasti Dip smooth."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep the can a short distance away from the surface.",
      "content": "Keep the can a short distance away from the surface. Hold the Plasti Dip 6 to 10 in (15 to 25 cm) away from the surface, then press along the top of the can to release the rubber coating. Work in slow, overlapping, horizontal strokes that cover the entire surface that you’re trying to cover. Don’t worry if the surface’s original color is still visible, as this first coat helps the Plasti Dip bond to the metal. [4] X Research source When you hold the can at a distance, you get a more consistent spray along the surface."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait 30 minutes after spraying on 1 full coat.",
      "content": "Wait 30 minutes after spraying on 1 full coat. Allow the rubber coating to harden and stick to the desired surface. Don’t touch or spray on any more coating until at least a half hour has passed, or the Plasti Dip might not seal correctly. [5] X Research source Always wait 30 minutes between each layer of Plasti Dip, even if it’s the second or third coat."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spray on 2-3 more coats of Plasti-Dip onto the surface.",
      "content": "Spray on 2-3 more coats of Plasti-Dip onto the surface. Continue spraying the rubber coating in slow, horizontal movements. Try to overlap each stroke of Plasti-Dip, so the color looks vibrant and consistent. After you apply each new layer, wait at least 30 minutes before adding another coat. [6] X Research source Since Plasti Dip application requires a lot of waiting, consider working on something else in the meantime."

      "title": "Let the finished product dry for at least 4 hours.",
      "content": "Let the finished product dry for at least 4 hours. Don’t display your new project right away. Instead, set a timer for 4 hours, so the Plasti Dip can seal completely. If you don’t plan on using the item right away, feel free to air-dry it overnight. [7] X Research source If you don’t like the way your Plasti Dip coating looks, you can always remove it."

      "title": "Remove any existing rubber coating.",
      "content": "Remove any existing rubber coating. If you’re resealing a smaller item, like the handles on a set of pliers, first use a utility knife to slice and peel any existing rubber off of the object. Once you’ve completely cleared off the surface, wash and dry the item ahead of time. [9] X Research source You don’t want dirt and other particles sticking to your new layer of rubber coating. If you want to be extra cautious, consider slipping on some work gloves."

      "content": "Mix the Plasti Dip in the can to make it smooth. Take a long item, like paint stirrer, and place it into the can of Plasti Dip. Swirl the item around slowly so the rubber product has a smooth and consistent texture. Keep mixing the Plasti Dip for at least 30 seconds, or until the substance looks completely smooth. [10] X Research source Don’t stir too quickly, or the product could slosh out of the can."

Count to 5 as you lower 1 in (2.5 cm) of the item into the rubber coating. Continue counting to 5 and lowering the item by 1 in (2.5 cm) until you’ve successfully submerged and coated the desired amount of surface. [12] X Research source This gradual process helps ensure a smooth Plasti Dip application on any item. This might not take very long if you’re coating a small object."

      "title": "Remove the item slowly from the can.",
      "content": "Remove the item slowly from the can. Don’t leave the item in the coating for an extended period of time; instead, gradually pull it out of the can. Once again, count to 5 in your head while removing a 1 in (2.5 cm) section from the rubber mixture. Continue pulling on the end of the wire until the object is completely out of the can. [13] X Research source The dipping and removing processes should take the same amount of time to complete."

      "content": "Wait 30 minutes for the Plasti Dip to dry completely. Twist the loose end of wire along a thin railing or some other space with lots of open air. Leave the newly coated item alone for 30 minutes, so the rubber product can seal and adhere properly. Whenever you add a new coat of Plasti Dip, always let the item dry. [14] X Research source If you’re working outside, consider tying your item to the handle of a walk-behind lawnmower."

      "content": "Apply 2-3 coats to finish coating your project. After the initial coat of Plasti Dip dries, submerge your item back into the can of coating. Repeat the same process as you did before, and use gradual motions to lower and raise your object in the rubber coating. After each new coat, use the wire to hang up your item in an open area so it can dry completely. [15] X Research source Since the dipping method is used for smaller objects, you don’t need to worry as much about the drying time between coats."

Give the rubber coating time to seal to the object’s surface, so the paint job will last longer. Keep in mind that if you’re coating both sides of an item, you might need to let the 1 side of the item dry before flipping and painting over the opposite edge.
