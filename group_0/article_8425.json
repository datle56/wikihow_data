      "title": "Close the oven door.",
      "content": "Close the oven door. You may need to leave the oven cleaner to soak for as long as four hours. Close the door of the oven to prevent fumes from escaping. Do not use or turn on the oven during this time. Fumes may still escape the oven. You should make sure that the room has plenty of ventilation by opening room doors and windows.

      "title": "Mix baking soda and water.",
      "content": "Mix baking soda and water. To make a paste, mix about ½ cup of baking soda with two or three tablespoons of water. You want to have a thick but smooth paste that you can easily spread on the bottom of the oven. [6] X Research source If the solution is too thick, you can add more water. If it is too runny, you can add more baking soda. Double or triple the recipe based on how much cleaning solution you need for your oven."

      "title": "Spread the paste around the oven.",
      "content": "Spread the paste around the oven. Use a sponge to evenly coat the bottom and sides of the oven with the baking soda paste. Make sure that all stains and encrusted areas are covered with the paste. You can also clean the inside of the oven window with this mixture. Open the oven door so that it is flat, and spread out the paste on top of the window."

      "title": "Spray vinegar on the paste.",
      "content": "Spray vinegar on the paste. Put distilled white vinegar in a spray bottle, and spray it over the baking soda paste. It will start to fizz. This process will help break down grease and stains caked onto the bottom of the oven. You can also do this step after the baking soda has sat for a few hours. This helps remove any remaining baking soda."

      "content": "Wipe up paste with a damp cloth. Use a warm, damp cloth to wipe up the baking soda. [8] X Research source Most of the crust or stains should wipe up easily, but you may need to scrub to get harder stains out. If the bottom of your oven is very dirty, you may need to rinse out the sponge and wipe everything down again. Do this as needed until the oven is clean. [9] X Research source If there are still crusted-on stains in hard to reach places, you can use a spatula to scrub them off. A pumice stick is also a good option.
