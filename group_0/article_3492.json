    {
      "title": "Believe that there is one God, the Father.",
      "content": "Believe that there is one God, the Father. The first commandment in the Bible states that “You shall have no other gods before me.” Christianity is a monotheistic religion, which means that you can only worship one God, the Father. God is the Father of Jesus, and according to the Bible, He created the universe and preserves all things. [1] X Research source The Bible explains that God appears in many forms and has power beyond what any human could understand. Believing in the power of a singular God’s is one of the most important parts of Christianity."

      "title": "Recognize Jesus as the Son of God, sent to save humanity from original sin.",
      "content": "Recognize Jesus as the Son of God, sent to save humanity from original sin. Read the story of the original sin, which is the first story in the Book of Genesis, and then read the many stories of the life of Jesus in the Gospels. According to these accounts, God sent his only Son, Jesus, to the world so that he could suffer and die on the cross to absolve humanity of original sin. [2] X Research source The general plot of this story is that Adam and Eve succumb to temptation and commit “original sin” in the Garden of Eden, which guarantees that all humans will be born having sinned. This means that they would not have been able to get into heaven without Jesus’ death and acceptance into heaven. The Book of Romans states that “God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\""

      "title": "Acknowledge the Holy Trinity as the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.",
      "content": "Acknowledge the Holy Trinity as the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Know that in the Bible, God is made of 3 parts, including the human form of Jesus, and the metaphysical form of the Holy Spirit, which are considered the Holy Trinity. Like a triangle, which must have 3 sides to exist, God is all 3 parts of the Trinity at once, and he uses the various “sides” of Himself to accomplish His goals. [3] X Research source The Book of John explains that “For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.” In this quote, Jesus is considered “the Word” because he came to Earth to spread the word of God."

      "title": "Conclude that there is life after earthly death.",
      "content": "Conclude that there is life after earthly death. When a Christian person dies on Earth, they are welcomed into Heaven for an eternal afterlife at the hand of God. Read about this in Romans, which states \"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" While no one is sure what this afterlife looks like, recognize that spiritual experiences on Earth can help you understand it more. [4] X Research source If you have questions about the afterlife, talk to a pastor or spiritual guide about your concerns or thoughts. This can help you lead a life that will ensure your acceptance into Heaven."

      "title": "Trust that your beliefs will lead to a strong relationship with God.",
      "content": "Trust that your beliefs will lead to a strong relationship with God. Be confident that your belief in Jesus as the Son of God guarantees that you can have a personal relationship with God. Know that God accepts and forgives you because you believe that Jesus suffered and died on the cross for your salvation. [5] X Research source This concept is known as the “justification of faith,” and serves as the foundation for a positive relationship with God that allows for personal growth and understanding. In Proverbs, the Bible states that followers should “Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding.” This encourages Christians to believe that their relationship with God is strong and that He will guide them, even if they don’t understand His power."

      "title": "Study the Bible",
      "content": "Study the Bible with a focus on the Gospels. Read the Bible in parts, and take time to understand the stories, symbolism, and implications of each section. Pay special attention to the Gospels, which tell the story of Jesus’ life and death and teach Christians how to act in his likeness. For Christians, it's important to acknowledge that the Bible has been inspired by God’s word, and says exactly what He wants it to say. [6] X Research source The Gospels, which were written by the Apostles of Jesus, tell the story of his life and death from each of their accounts. Many people read the Books of Matthew and John first to get a general sense of the stories of Jesus’ life and his teachings. If you’re having trouble deciding which parts of the Bible to read, talk to your pastor or spiritual guide to get recommendations on where to start. Keep in mind that all parts of the Bible are important, but some sections are more accessible for new Christians."

      "title": "Repent by changing your behaviors to accept God into your life.",
      "content": "Repent by changing your behaviors to accept God into your life. Repenting is simply the act of “turning away” from your old life and wrongdoings, and starting a new life that’s led by God. Figure out what it means in your mind to honor and live according to Jesus’ teachings, and do your best to live up to these standards every day. [7] X Research source Repenting may sound scary, but it’s simply the act of beginning your new life with your faith and beliefs in mind."

    {
      "title": "Confess your sins",
      "content": "Confess your sins to God to begin the process of salvation. When you first become a Christian, the Bible states that you should pronounce your previous sins. Do this by scheduling a meeting with a pastor or spiritual guide, or hold a meeting with a small group of Christians who you trust. At the meeting, talk honestly about how you have done wrong in the past, and try to make amends as much as possible. [8] X Research source Some forms of Christianity, like Catholicism, require that you meet privately with a priest in a confessional to discuss your sins and receive a penance to make amends. This is a formal event to be completed during your acceptance into the Church, and you can ask your priest for more information about when and how you will do it."

    {
      "title": "Get baptized",
      "content": "Get baptized after you have accepted Jesus into your life. Once you have studied the Bible, repented, and confessed your sins, you are “baptized” by being submerged in a body of water for a short moment. Before your baptism, consider how this symbolizes your connection with Jesus and represents your acceptance into a singular body of believers. At your baptism, profess your faith and follow the pastor or spiritual leader’s directions for the ceremony. [9] X Research source In the Book of Matthew, the Bible states that Jesus commands his followers to “Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.”"

      "title": "Communicate with God through prayer.",
      "content": "Communicate with God through prayer . Set aside time each day to speak directly to God out loud or through your thoughts. Thank Him for his love and guidance, tell Him about your struggles, triumphs, and worries, and ask Him for continued strength. Most people choose to do this in a quiet space, like their bedroom in the morning or evening. You might opt to visit a chapel or other quiet place to pray. [10] X Research source Your prayers can be as short or long as you’d like. Remember that your relationship with God is within your control. For instance, if you’ve had a good day, you could say something like “Holy Father, today was a wonderful day, and I’m so thankful for your blessings. Through the church, I was able to volunteer at a homeless shelter, and I also made a new friend at school. Thank you again for your guidance, and I hope tomorrow is just as good. Amen.” If you’ve had a hard day, you can pray by saying something like, “Holy Father, I’ve been struggling lately with my decision to switch careers. I’m worried that I’ve made the wrong decision since I haven’t had any job offers yet. Please give me the strength to continue on my path, and help me to realize my purpose in life. Amen.”"

      "title": "Act and speak with Jesus’ teachings in mind.",
      "content": "Act and speak with Jesus’ teachings in mind. Once you’ve read about Jesus’ life on Earth, make a conscious effort to “act in his image,” which means to live in the way He would want you to. Try to be calm, patient, kind, and thoughtful toward yourself and others every day. In general, aim to treat others as you would want to be treated, which is known as the “Golden Rule.” [11] X Research source If you find yourself struggling with this, you might find it helpful to stop and ask yourself “What would Jesus do?” in a particularly difficult situation. For example, one way that you could act in Jesus’ image is by volunteering your time to help out in your community. Jesus exhibited how helping others who are struggling will strengthen your relationship with God."

      "title": "Join a church of people who have the same beliefs and morals.",
      "content": "Join a church of people who have the same beliefs and morals. Many people find it helpful to belong to a church that has a weekly worship schedule where they can learn more about Jesus’ teachings an pray in a group. Visit a few different churches, and attend local Bible studies to find a group of people who make you feel comfortable and welcomed. [12] X Research source If you want to find a church near you, try searching the name of the denomination online and the words “near me.” Visit the church’s official website to learn more about what they believe, and attend a service to see if you feel comfortable."

      "title": "Talk to others about your positive relationship with God.",
      "content": "Talk to others about your positive relationship with God. Share your relationship with God and its positive effects with people who are important to you. Talking about your religious experience is an important aspect of Christianity because followers are encouraged to spread the Word of God as much as possible. [13] X Research source While it’s good to share your experiences, remember to respect other people’s boundaries and wishes. If they aren’t interested in Christianity, tell them that you understand and change the subject."

      "content": "Resist the temptation to sin by relying on your faith. When you find yourself in a situation that may lead to sin, turn to your faith to guide you. Ask yourself what Jesus taught, and remove yourself from situations that might cause you to sin. If you do sin, accept what you did, and take time to confess your wrongdoing to God and ask for forgiveness. [14] X Research source Throughout your life as a Christian, you will learn to accept that you will sin. The most important part is how you handle it, accepting that you did wrong, and aiming to do better. Remember that God’s forgiveness is eternal as long as you truly are sorry."
