Rest your left middle finger on L2 and your right middle finger on R2, and put your left thumb on L3 and your right thumb on R3—just like you would with a standard grip. Then, put your left index finger on the directional buttons (D-pad), and your right index finger on the right face buttons (triangle, square, X, and O on Playstation or Y, X, A, and B on Xbox).

      "content": "Single claw Some people only use claw grip with their right or left hand—it mostly depends on the actions you need to control in the game you’re playing. For instance, if you frequently need to work the D-pad and the left controller at the same time, you might use a claw grip with your left hand and keep your right hand in a standard grip."

      "content": "Adjustments If you need to, change up how you do claw grip to make it more comfortable. For instance, you might adjust the position of your palm or the rotation of your wrist. You may find it easier to rest your right finger on the leftmost face button (square on PS or X on Xbox), rather than the top button—your hand will be in a more relaxed position. Support the weight of the controller with your ring and pinky fingers."

      "content": "You don’t have to release the joystick to press the face buttons. With a standard controller grip, if you need to use the D-pad or the right face buttons, you have to let go of the joystick, quickly press the button you need, then return to the joystick. Claw grip makes it so you never have to let go of the joysticks, which can give you an edge in fast-paced, competitive games. [2] X Research source Since you don’t have to shift your fingers off the joysticks, you may notice you have a faster response response time and improved accuracy."

      "content": "It makes complicated gameplay easier. Because you don’t have to let go of the joystick to press the face buttons, if you can master claw grip you’ll be able to seamlessly string together complicated sequences. This is especially beneficial if you’re playing an action game where you need to execute moves in rapid succession, like rotating the camera, sprinting, dodging, rolling, attacking, and switching weapons. [3] X Research source Games where claw grip is popular include Fortnite , Call of Duty , Dark Souls , Apex Legends , and Monster Hunter World ."

      "content": "You may notice improved aiming. If you’re having to let go of the joystick every time you want to pick up an object, switch weapons, or dodge, it might be hard to stay locked onto a target. But with claw grip, you don’t have to release the joystick, so you may find that your aiming improves. Some people find that it’s easier to make minute movements on the joystick with claw grip, improving their aiming even more. However, others find the angle of their thumb gives them a little less control in claw."

      "content": "You can use claw grip with any controller. Some competitive gamers use special accessories like paddles or custom grips to make their gameplay easier. But these are usually designed for a specific type of controller. If you change consoles or buy a different style controller, you’ll have to buy new accessories—but you can easily adapt claw grip to different controllers, with no need to buy anything extra."

      "content": "Your hands might get fatigued more quickly. The extra strain on your hands can take a toll, causing your fingers to get tired while you play.

      "content": "It takes some getting used to. Whether you’re just starting out as a gamer or you’ve been playing for years, claw grip can feel uncomfortable at first. Most people who use it say this will get better over time if you practice consistently—although if it’s causing you real pain or discomfort, you should switch back to a standard grip."

      "content": "Practice consistently to develop muscle memory. The more you use claw grip, the more natural it will feel, so keep practicing. It’s a good idea to play in low-stakes sessions while you’re adjusting—like single-player mode or on a private server. That way, you won’t be an easy target if your reaction time isn’t as fast as usual for a while."

Make the most of this by going into your game settings and customizing which buttons control which actions. For instance, if you want to be able to dodge quickly, you might bind that action to the button where your index finger is resting."

      "content": "Use controller accessories to make claw grip more comfortable. You can find a variety of accessories to make gaming easier and more fun. For instance, thumb grips fit over your joysticks—they create a bigger, textured surface that makes it more comfortable to work the joystick. You can also get rubberized handle grips to give yourself a better hold on the controller—if you feel like the controller is secure in your hand, you might not have to grip it as tightly, so you’ll have less hand strain."

      "content": "Switch to paddles if claw grip is too painful. Some third-party controllers have paddles, also known as back buttons—4 or more buttons on the very back of the controller. If you have a controller with paddles , you can map the actions normally assigned to the D-pad or face buttons to the paddles. Then, you control those with your middle and ring fingers, leaving your thumbs and index fingers in standard position. [6] X Research source If getting used to claw grip is too difficult, paddle controllers are a great alternative."

      "content": "Larger controllers tend to be better for claw grip. Generally, the best controllers for claw grip are considered to be PS5 and Xbox controllers. PS4 controllers are a little small for claw grip, but some players do still use them. You can use claws on a Switch, but the smaller buttons make it difficult—it’s probably easier to stick to standard grip."

      "content": "Maintain good, relaxed posture while you’re gaming. While you’re gaming keep your elbows and wrists in a comfortable position to avoid strain. Sit upright with your shoulders back but relaxed, and try to keep your elbows at about a 90° angle—avoid hunching over the controller. [9] X Research source Don’t press your elbows down into your armrests. This can compress your nerves, which can lead to decreased game performance, pain, and injury. Keep a relaxed grip on the controller to avoid straining your hands. Adjust your grip as needed to find the position that's comfortable for you."

      "content": "Stretch after you’re finished gaming. Stretching after a gaming session can help reduce your risk of injury. (However, some gamers find that stretching before or during a game can slow your reaction time, so it may be better to wait until you’re finished.) Popular stretches include: Prayer position stretch: Place your palms together in front of your chest like you’re praying. Then, slowly lower your hands, deepening the stretch in your wrists and forearms. Hold for about 30 seconds. [10] X Research source Reverse prayer stretch: Press the backs of your hands together with your fingers down and your hands in front of your chest—like an upside-down and backwards prayer position. Lift your hands to deepen the stretch, and hold for 30 seconds. [11] X Research source Hand and wrist stretch: Hold your arm straight out in front of you with your palm up. Grab your fingertips with your other hand and gently pull your fingers back toward you until you feel a stretch. Hold for about 30 seconds. Then, repeat with your palm facing down. [12] X Research source Thumb adductor stretch: Hold your hand up with your palm away from you. Use your other hand to gently pull your thumb backward for 30 seconds. [13] X Research source"
