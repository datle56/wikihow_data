So, when you need a pick-me-up, ask someone you feel comfortable with if you can have a hug. After that, spend some time with them (if you have time to spare); being around people you love and trust can also do wonders for your mood.

Want to be with a friend but can’t see them in person? That’s okay. Call or text them instead, and ask if you can talk. Try making plans with your friends to do something fun another day if nobody’s free at the moment. That way, you’ll have something to look forward to."

Try aromatherapy (inhaling or topically applying essential oils) to cheer yourself up. Studies have found that lemon essential oil , in particular, elevates mood, while lavender oil can reduce stress and anxiety. Researchers are uncertain about what makes essential oils and aromatherapy effective. But, they believe that receptors in your nose stimulate parts of your brain that control emotions and memories. If you plan to apply essential oils topically, do a patch test first on a small area of skin to ensure you won’t have an allergic reaction. Keep in mind that some essential oils (like lavender) aren’t safe to ingest. Always check to see if there’s a recommended way to use your oil of choice."
