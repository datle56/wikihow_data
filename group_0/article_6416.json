      "content": "Get in the Sukkot mindset. Sukkot is a joyous holiday and a time of great celebration for all Jews! In fact, Sukkot is so closely associated with happy emotions that traditional sources often call it Z'man Simchateinu (Hebrew:\"the Season of our Rejoicing\"). For the seven days of Sukkot, Jews are encouraged to celebrate God's role in their lives and rejoice in the good fortune of the past year. Sukkot should a happy time spent with your friends and family, so be ready to let go of any negative thoughts or feelings in preparation for the holiday. Aim to be upbeat, positive, and thankful to God for the entire week."

      "content": "Build a Sukkah. As noted above, one of the most memorable, remarkable traditions of Sukkot is the building of a Sukkah. This lightly-constructed booth can be made from many different types of materials as long as it is able to stand up to the wind. [1] X Research source The roof of the Sukkah is traditionally made from leaves, branches, and other plant matter. Sukkah are usually decorated on the inside with drawings and religious symbols. For more information on building a Sukkah, see the appropriate section below. In the book of Leviticus, Jews are instructed to dwell in the Sukkah for all seven days of the Sukkot holiday. In a modern context, most take this to mean centering family gatherings around the sukkah and eating meals inside it, though some devout Jews will even sleep in it."

      "content": "Avoid work for the first two days of Sukkot. Though the Sukkot holiday lasts for about 7 to 8 days, the first two days of the holiday are especially blessed. On these days, much like on Shabbat, most forms of work are to be avoided as a show of reverence to God. Specifically, all activities normally forbidden on Shabbat are also forbidden on the first two days of Sukkot with the exception of cooking, baking, transferring fire, and carrying things around. [2] X Research source During this time, people observing the holiday are encouraged to spend time praying and celebrating with their families. The following five days are Chol Hamoed (Hebrew: \"intermediate days\"), during which work is permitted. [3] X Trustworthy Source Chabad.org Online resource for information related to Chabad-Lubavitch and Jewish culture Go to source Note, however, that if Shabbat falls during the intermediate days, it must be observed as normal. Many common activities, like writing, sewing, cooking, braiding hair, and even watering plants are traditionally forbidden on Shabbat.

However, traditionally, on every day of Sukkot after the morning prayer, the complete Hallel (Hebrew: \"praise\") prayer. This prayer is the verbatim text of Psalms 113-118.

      "content": "Wave the lulav and etrog. Besides building and dwelling in a Sukkah, this is the most important holiday tradition for Sukkot. On the first day of Sukkot, the observers of the holiday ritually wave a collection of branches, including the lulav and the etrog in all directions. A lulav is a bouquet made from a single palm leaf, two willow branches and three myrtle branches, held together by woven leaves. An etrog is a citron, a lemon-like fruit grown in Israel. The etrog must have the stigma stem to make it kosher. To perform the ritual, hold the lulav in your right hand and the etrog in your left, say a Bracha blessing over them, then shake them in the six directions: north, south, east, west, up, and down, symbolizing God's presence everywhere. [7] X Research source Note that different religious commentators give different instructions for the order of directions the lulav and etrog should be shaken in.

      "content": "Enjoy plenty of other Sukkot traditions. Building the Sukkah and performing the branch-waving ritual are undoubtedly the two most important, well-known Sukkot traditions, but they're far from the only ones. Sukkot is a holiday with many traditions - too many to list here. These often vary from family to family and locale to locale, so feel free to research the Sukkot traditions of the world as you're planning your holiday. Below are just a few ideas you might want to consider for your Sukkot celebration: Spend time eating meals and camping out in the Sukkah. Tell stories from scripture, especially those from the 40 years the Israelites spent in the desert. Participate in Sukkah song and dance - many religious songs are made just for Sukkot.

      "title": "Use walls that can stand up to the wind.",
      "content": "Use walls that can stand up to the wind. The sukkah, which is the definitive Sukkot tradition, is quite simple to build. The four-sided booth must have at least three walls, while the fourth wall can be used as a door. One of the walls can be low or removable to allow passage into and out of the Sukkah. The material used to build the sukkah can vary, but because the Sukkah will only remain standing for seven days, a light material probably makes most sense. The only traditional requirements for the walls are that they be able to stand up in the wind. With this definition, even canvas stretched across a hard frame is suitable. In terms of size, you'll want your walls at least far enough apart that you'll have room to eat in the Sukkah. Depending on the size of your family, this can cause the size of your sukkah to vary greatly."

      "content": "Add a roof made from plant matter. Traditionally, the roofs of sukkah are made from plant matter, like branches, leaves, twigs, and so on. These materials can be purchased or taken from nature. [10] X Research source According to tradition, the roof of a sukkah should be thick enough to provide shade and shelter during the day, but you should still be able to see stars through it at night. [11] X Research source Making a roof from plant material is a way of giving remembrance to the Israelites who wandered in the desert for 40 years after leaving Egypt. During their travels, they had to live in temporary dwellings similar to the sukkah, using whatever materials were available to them for shelter."

      "content": "Decorate your sukkah. Decorating the sukkah is seen as a commendable show of Sukkot observance. Traditional decorations include harvest vegetables: Corn, pumpkins, and squash hung from the ceiling and beams or placed in corners. Other decorations include but are not limited to: paper chains, pipecleaner constructions, religious pictures or drawings, wax paper stained glass, or anything else that you or your children feel like creating. Children usually love to help decorate the sukkah. Giving your children a chance to draw on the walls of the sukkah and gather vegetables for display is a great way to get them involved in the holiday from an early age."

      "content": "Read the Torah to find the sources of Sukkot traditions. Though Sukkot has its origins as an ancient agricultural harvest festival, the modern religious version of the festival is derived from the Hebrew scriptures. According to the Torah, God spoke to Moses while he was leading the Israelites through the desert and instructed him on the proper traditions of the Sukkot holiday. Reading this original account of the source of Sukkot traditions can help imbue the holiday with divine meaning, especially for someone who's a new practitioner. Most of the scriptural description of Sukkot comes in the book of Leviticus. Specifically, Leviticus 23:33-43 offer an account of the meeting between God and Moses during which the Sukkot holiday is discussed. [12] X Research source"

However, entire Jewish communities are also encouraged to come together in celebration of Sukkot at synagogue services. At traditional morning Sukkot services, the congregation joins in Amidah prayer, followed by Hallel as would normally occur for Sukkot. After this, the congregation recites special Hoshana Rabbah psalms asking for God's forgiveness.

Much has been written about Sukkot over the years by rabbis, religious scholars, and even laypeople. Many essays and opinion pieces centered on Sukkot have even been produced in the modern era. Most modern Sukkot commentary will be relatively easy-to-read and approachable compared to older writings, so feel free to look up Sukkot Essays at www.chabad.org. The subjects of modern Sukkot writings are highly diverse. Some offer new perspectives on the meanings of old traditions, others relate the meaningful personal experiences of the authors, and still others give firsthand instructions for making the best of the holiday.
