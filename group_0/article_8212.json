Remove shampoo and conditioner from your shower, take your toothpaste and toothbrush off the sink, and clear off anything else that would prevent you from properly cleaning the surfaces in your bathroom. If you find something that doesn’t belong in the bathroom, put it in its proper location. [1] X Research source Move any side tables or movable storage cabinets so you can clean under them, as well. Remember, the floor counts as a surface, so move any trash cans and bathmats, too."

      "content": "Launder towels, washcloths, and rugs. Gather any dirty towels, washcloths, and machine-washable bathmats, and launder them according to their care label; usually, towels should be washed on a cold, delicate cycle to keep them nice and fluffy. [2] X Research source This way, they’ll be washed while you’re working on the bathroom, so they’ll be nice and clean when you get done. Wipe down in-tub bathmats with some soap and water and set them aside to air dry while you work."

      "content": "Dust and vacuum from top to bottom. Using a duster or microfiber cloth, begin dusting all surfaces from the top of your bathroom down. This includes your light fixtures, windows and blinds, countertops, the outside of your toilet, and the baseboards. Vacuum any bathmats or rugs to remove excess dust and debris.

      "title": "Apply glass cleaner to glass, mirrors, and faucets.",
      "content": "Apply glass cleaner to glass, mirrors, and faucets. Lightly mist any mirrors, glass surfaces, and faucets with a glass cleaner. Then, wipe them down with a microfiber cloth or another lint-free material, like an old T-shirt. Flip the cloth to the other side to buff the surface to a dry shine. Use a small scrub brush to clean the crevices of your faucets and other fixtures. [4] X Research source A 50:50 mixture of vinegar and water also works well to clean glass and other surfaces. Alternatively, use a squeegee on glass surfaces to keep them streak-free . Wear rubber gloves while you're cleaning to keep your hands from drying out if you're using harsh products. If your mirror is particularly cloudy, cleaning expert Filip Boksa says, “The easiest way to clean a cloudy mirror is to fill a spray-bottle with white vinegar and apply it to the glass. Wipe off the vinegar with a lint-free rag for a perfect finish. Be careful not to spray vinegar onto the wooden frame if present.”"

      "content": "Scrub the sink and counters. Use a small amount of all-purpose cleaner to scrub all the soap scum and toothpaste from your sink and counters, rinsing your sponge thoroughly as you go along. An old toothbrush or cotton swab can be handy for cleaning the gunk out from between the tap and handles of your sink. Now is also the time to clean any countertop items, like soap dispensers, toilet paper holders, and toothbrush holders. [5] X Research source Wipe off the fronts and tops of cabinets and drawers, as well, using hot, soapy water. If you’re worried about germs on these surfaces, add a bit of bleach to your soapy water. Clean your counters before your sink, as you may knock dirt and debris into the sink as you work. If your sink is ceramic, cleaning expert Susan Stocker suggests using baking soda to clean it: “Make sure you get it mixed with enough water to make a paste or it’s not going to work—it requires the power of scrubbing just as much as it requires the power of baking soda. [Baking soda] has just the right amount of abrasive power to lift and remove dirt and grease, but it is not going to remove stubborn stains.”"

Apply a soap scum remover to your tub following the product’s instructions, and use a scrub brush to clean the surface, working from the outer rim of the tub down to the drain. Rinse everything well to remove any remaining dirt or cleaning product residue. [6] X Research source If you have hard water or your tub is prone to lime or rust stains, opt for a calcium, lime, and rust remover . Never use abrasive cleaners, scrub pads, or steel wool on porcelain fixtures, as they will quickly dull the finish."

      "title": "Clean the outside of the toilet.",
      "content": "Clean the outside of the toilet. Soak a cloth in a disinfectant cleaner and wipe all around the outside of the toilet, starting with the flush handle and working your way down. Work from the least dirty to the dirtiest parts of the toilet so you don’t recontaminate anything. Thoroughly wash and rinse all exterior surfaces of the toilet, including the underside and flared base, the top and underside of the seat and lid, and the hinges and their mounting area. [7] X Research source Do not clean the sink or any other surfaces with the same rag or paper towel you used to clean the toilet. This can spread leftover disease-causing germs to your sink. To prevent this, keep a specific rag that you only use to clean the toilet. If you use paper towels to clean the toilet (or any other surface), throw them away rather than flushing them."

Squirt some toilet cleaner (or sprinkle some baking soda) inside the rim and bowl of your toilet and scrub it with a toilet brush to remove any stains . Then, flush the toilet to remove any remaining dirt and cleaning residue. [8] X Research source If the toilet is particularly dirty or stained, allow the cleaner to soak for at least half an hour before scrubbing. If you have hard water stains in the toilet bowl, dip a pumice stone in water and scrub the stains gently to remove them. For large, tough stains, cleaning expert Eduardo Peralta says, “Apply [an acidic toilet bowl cleaner] to the entire bowl of the toilet and let sit for about 10 minutes, then scrub [with a toilet brush] and flush to rinse. Apply bleach spray to the entire toilet bowl, let sit for 5 minutes, then use pumice to give it a good hard scrub. A magic eraser may be used as well to brighten the area.”"

Sweep up all the dust and debris from the floor, then mop the floor using hot, soapy water mixed with a little bit of bleach. Be sure to get along the sides of your toilet bowl where it’s anchored to the floor, as this area is notoriously dirty. When you’re done, rinse the floor with clean water to remove slippery soap residue. [9] X Research source When using bleach, Peralta says, “Always use protective eyewear, gloves, and [a] mask. I highly recommend opening windows, and never mix bleach with anything other than water, as this may cause chemical burns and dangerous fumes.”"

The next day, remove the bag, scrub the water holes with an old toothbrush to remove any remaining build-up, then run water through the showerhead.
