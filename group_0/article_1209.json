      "content": "Ambivalence is feeling a mix of positive and negative emotions toward someone. In supportive and healthy relationships, the positives usually outweigh the negatives, while relationships with a lot of conflicts tend to have many more negatives than positives. However, a person in an ambivalent relationship is stuck somewhere in the middle, and they usually can’t describe their relationship as overwhelmingly good or bad. The phrase “love-hate relationship” is often a good way to describe an ambivalent relationship. [1] X Research source Ambivalence is harmful when it causes a person to feel extremely stressed or puts them in an abusive situation. Ambivalence can cause a person’s stress levels to rise and negatively affect their physical and mental health. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Some levels of ambivalence may be considered healthy. For example, uncertainty due to ambivalence leaves room for negotiation and more careful thought. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Between family members",
      "content": "Between family members Ambivalence often appears more within close relationships, such as between parents and children or siblings. The close bond and sense of commitment a person might feel towards their family can be placed at odds with any negative emotions they might feel due to conflicts or differences of opinion. As a result, they may feel torn between positive and negative emotions when dealing with a certain family member. For example, siblings often have an ambivalent relationship. Since they’re family, oftentimes they must share a space while growing up and constantly be near one another, but they may get into fights a lot. Or, a child may still love their parent, but perhaps differences in opinion and frequent conflicts cause them to feel ambivalent toward their parent."

      "content": "Between romantic partners Even couples who’ve been married for years can still face doubt and ambivalence in their relationship. For some, their sense of commitment and love towards their partner may be at odds with other negative feelings, and some people who feel ambivalent toward their partner struggle with deciding whether or not to break off their relationship. Others may not even notice or purposefully ignore these ambivalent feelings in order to preserve their relationship. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For someone who is ambivalent toward their partner, lots of conflicting emotions can be at play, such as trust and distrust, excitement and anxiety, and fondness and anger. For instance, they may feel excited at the prospect of being with their partner but may also fear committing to a long-term relationship. Or, they may want comfort from their partner but are unwilling to share any personal or intimate details that could make them appear vulnerable."

Their feelings toward their friend may change by the day—sometimes they’re great to be around, but other times being with them can be draining and frustrating. For example, a person might enjoy their friend’s company, but they might dread hanging out with them because they know that their friend only likes to gossip and complain."

      "content": "Between acquaintances Coworkers, school peers, neighbors, and any other acquaintances a person might have can also be the target of one’s ambivalent feelings. In some cases, someone might develop ambivalent feelings because they lack a close relationship with the other person and simply don’t spend enough time with them to determine whether their feelings are more positive or negative. [5] X Research source Although, this lack of a close bond can also cause ambivalence to turn to outright displeasure more easily between acquaintances than between family members or friends. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Having a “frenemy” (friend-enemy) is an example of an ambivalent relationship. This is someone who will help a person one day and then gossip behind their back the next."

A person with this type of attachment style may feel a lot of fear and anxiety when they think about if their partner truly loves them or not. These conflicting emotions oftentimes manifest in them regarding others with ambivalence.

They may try to reason with themselves and find the positives in their relationship even though there might still be negative aspects that are affecting them. These conflicting emotions are what may cause them to ultimately feel ambivalent toward the other person. [8] X Research source For example, a person may choose to put up with their partner’s lack of communication rather than address it so they don’t risk their partner breaking up with them over the issue."

To help free yourself from ambivalence in your relationship, make an effort to stop overthinking and just go with what your emotions are telling you. When you notice yourself getting caught up in your thoughts, challenge them by asking yourself, “Is there a logical reason why I should be worrying about this?” Be more mindful of your thoughts and actions to help stop overthinking. Self-reflect on what you say and do and check in with your feelings from time to time."

While not every single problem may be fixed by this, it can help you start moving your relationship more toward the positive side.

Use “I” language when talking about your feelings to avoid placing blame on the other person.
