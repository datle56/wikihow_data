      "title": "Select a relatively young ball.",
      "content": "Select a relatively young ball. Aerodynamics play a crucial role in swing bowls, and the longer a ball has been in use, the more its surface changes over time. Balls that have been in use for 20 years or more tend to effect a “reverse swing,” which means that the technique used to pitch a natural outswinger may result in an inswinger instead.

      "title": "Choose one side of the ball to polish.",
      "content": "Choose one side of the ball to polish. The primary seam of a cricket ball runs along the ball’s center, creating two halves. Polishing one half will decrease air resistance on that side, causing the ball to swing in the direction of its other, rougher side when thrown. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Angle the seam toward the slips. Rather than keeping the primary seam vertical, it should be angled slightly away from the batter."

      "title": "Hold the ball with the polished side facing the batsman, or their “leg side.”",
      "content": "Hold the ball with the polished side facing the batsman, or their “leg side.” The aim of the out swing is to force the batsman to strike the ball away from his body, on his “off side.” Since the ball will swing in the direction of its rough side, grip the ball with the rough half facing the batsman’s off side.

      "content": "Aim the seam at your first or second slip fielder. [7] X Research source The ball will swing wherever you aim the seam, so angling the seam away from the batsman, at a 15-20º toward the slips, will send the ball towards them instead of directly at the batsman.

      "title": "Release the ball.",
      "content": "Release the ball. Pitch it while your bowling arm is still high. When you release the ball, angle your wrist down and across the ball toward the slips. Follow through by bringing your bowling arm down across your body so that your fingers touch your other armpit."
