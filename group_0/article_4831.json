Note that you can change the appearance of the wooden door based on which wood you use. You could therefore have an oak door, spruce door, birch door, or a jungle wood door. [3] X Research source Also note that any door types other than oak and iron only exist from 1.8 and onwards."

If you're worried about mobs, however, only place the pressure plate on the inside of the door to keep mobs out. Wooden doors can also open and shut easily by right-clicking the door."

Use this knowledge to keep mobs and other griefers out of your private space. Make a redstone pattern to your door and use a lever to open it. Place a pressure plate on the inside hinge of your iron door to open. Before the village and pillage update of Minecraft, villagers would breed independently based on the number of doors in the village. [4] X Research source The villagers would breed if the population happened to be 35% or less than the number of valid doors. Villager breeding also depended on the willingness of the villagers. A player could manipulate it by giving specific amounts of food to the villagers. [5] X Research source"
