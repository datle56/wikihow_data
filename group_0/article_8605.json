      "title": "Dust and vacuum the entire chair.",
      "content": "Dust and vacuum the entire chair. Pick up and dispose of as much loose debris as possible, then dust the chair’s entire surface, from the top to the wheels to remove as much dust and debris as possible. Use a vacuum with an upholstery attachment and crevice tool to remove stubborn hair, lint, and other debris. If you don’t have a crevice tool, a can of compressed air can remove debris from hard-to-reach spaces. [1] X Research source An upholstery attachment brush is soft enough that it won’t scratch leather and vinyl upholstery. Make sure the suction isn’t too strong, as this could damage leather upholstery."

      "content": "Wipe the chair with a cleaner appropriate for its material. Check the care tag on your chair to determine which cleaning solution to use. [2] X Research source In most cases, a solution of warm water and a few drops of dish soap will do. Simply fill a spray bottle or dip a clean cloth in the mixture and dab—don’t rub—it onto the chair’s upholstery. Use enough to coat the surface but do not completely saturate the material. If the care label has an S, use a dry cleaning solvent instead. Any product containing water could damage the upholstery. Follow the instructions on the product’s label to apply it properly. If the label has a W, use a water-based solvent, like the water and dish soap combo mentioned above. If it has an SW or S/W, either type of solution can be used. If the label has an X, it can only be cleaned by a professional. If it has a C, it requires an enzyme detergent. No matter the solution you use, test it in an inconspicuous area first to make sure it won’t damage the chair."

      "title": "Wipe the chair’s arms and legs with a damp cloth.",
      "content": "Wipe the chair’s arms and legs with a damp cloth. Since these parts are usually plastic or metal, they’re much easier to clean than the chair’s upholstery. Wiping them with a damp cloth will usually be enough to clean them. If the spill is a bit more tenacious, use a mild solution of water and dish soap. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Rinse and dry the chair.",
      "content": "Rinse and dry the chair. If it’s safe to use water on the chair, dampen another cloth with clean water and wipe away any soap residue. Then, use another clean, dry cloth to dry the arms, legs, and seat covers. Allow the chair’s upholstery to air dry in a well-ventilated area or use a hair dryer to speed up the process. [4] X Research source If you used a dry-cleaning agent, follow the product’s instructions to determine if you should rinse it."

      "title": "Remove the wheels to clean them.",
      "content": "Remove the wheels to clean them. Some desk chair wheels pop right off, while others need to be unscrewed. Once you’ve removed them, use a butter knife to scrape off large debris, like dried food or pebbles, that might be stuck in the wheels and hindering the chair’s movement. Then, wipe the wheels down with a damp, soapy cloth to remove stubborn dirt. Dry them with a paper towel before reattaching them to the chair. [5] X Research source If there are hairs stuck in the wheels, cut them with scissors, then use tweezers to remove them. If you need to clean between the wheel and the cover, use a cotton swab moistened with water to clean along the crack. Make sure the wheels dry completely. Otherwise, the moisture will prevent the chair from rolling smoothly."

      "title": "Remove stains with rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Remove stains with rubbing alcohol. Dampen a cotton ball or cloth with a few drops of rubbing alcohol. Test the alcohol on a small, inconspicuous area, like the underside, to make sure it doesn’t damage the fabric. If it doesn’t, go ahead and dab the alcohol onto the stain. Remove any residue with a damp cloth and allow the chair to air dry. [6] X Research source Don’t use rubbing alcohol on acrylic fabric upholstery, as it may damage the fibers or fade the dye. Rubbing alcohol only has a small amount of water, and you may be able to use it on S-coded upholstery. Just be sure to test it first. If the alcohol doesn’t work, try applying an enzyme-based stain remover according to its instructions. Again, test an inconspicuous area first. Cleaning specialist Elias Weston says it’s also possible to remove stains with a steam cleaner: “If you’re going to be steam cleaning upholstery, make sure your steam cleaner has a smaller fabric attachment. Floor steam cleaners can be large, bulky, and aren’t designed to clean smaller pieces of furniture and upholstery. Prepare the steam cleaner according to the model’s instructions by pouring water and soap into the machine, and begin steam cleaning.”"

      "title": "Some chair materials require special cleaning methods.",
      "content": "Some chair materials require special cleaning methods. Desk chairs made of specialty materials like leather, mesh, or wood may not be able to handle the same cleaning methods and products as regular cloth chairs. Be sure to check your chair’s care label for specific instructions. [7] X Research source Here are some general rules for cleaning different specialty fabrics: Leather (genuine or synthetic): Use leather cleaner to clean the upholstery and apply a leather conditioner to keep it supple. Do not dry leather in the sun, as this can damage the material. Wood: Don’t let water or liquid sit on the wood’s surface for too long, as this could warp the wood. To keep wooden accents looking their best, apply a wood polish , then wipe them clean. Note that many disinfectants are not suitable for wood. Polyurethane: Do not oversaturate polyurethane upholstery with water or cleaning solution, as this can damage the finish and texture. Mesh or net: Use a gentle setting when vacuuming mesh or net to avoid damaging the material. Do not rub the material too harshly, or it could tear. Metal: Apply mineral oil or WD-40 to any metal parts that move to prevent rusting. Plastic: Avoid cleaning plastic parts with bleach, as this can damage the material and break the plastic down over time."

      "content": "Regular cleaning should take no more than 15 minutes. This includes dusting the chair and giving it a quick vacuum to pick up any stubborn debris. If your chair is stained or particularly dirty, a deep clean may take closer to 30 minutes, especially if you want to remove and clean the wheels, as well."

      "title": "Clean up spills as soon as they happen.",
      "content": "Clean up spills as soon as they happen. Cleaning messes as soon as possible can help prevent stains from setting into your office chair. Use a paper towel to grab as much solid debris as possible and discard it in the trash. Blot up spilled liquids with a damp cloth. Wring it out over a sink or container and keep blotting until the spill is gone. [8] X Research source If the chair has fabric upholstery, don’t rub as you clean; this could set the mess deeper into the fabric and cause a stain."

      "content": "Vacuum your desk chair weekly. Cleaning your chair regularly can help prevent stains from setting in so you won’t have to do a deep clean later on. Every week, try to make time to vacuum up any dirt, crumbs, or other debris to keep your desk chair looking good as new. Remember to wipe down the arms and legs with a damp cloth, as well. [9] X Research source It’s also a good idea to disinfect your chair if you or anyone around you has been sick."

      "title": "Avoid eating or drinking at your desk.",
      "content": "Avoid eating or drinking at your desk. Accidents can always happen, but one of the easiest ways to keep your office chair clean is to avoid eating or drinking around it. If possible, eat your lunch somewhere else, and be prepared with napkins and wet wipes if you have any snacks while working. If you must eat at your desk, consider using a protectant spray that will help cloth repel spills."
