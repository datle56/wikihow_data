      "content": "Write down the total number of yards you need to convert. You can always do this calculation in your head, but write it out this first time to solidify everything in your mind. For this example, say you need to convert 10 yards into feet. [1] X Research source This technique is best for whole yards without any fractions or decimals."

      "content": "Multiply the total number of yards by 3. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, all you have to do is multiply! For example, to convert 10 yards to feet, multiply 10 by 3 to get your answer. [2] X Research source 10 x 3 = 30. There are 30 feet in 10 yards. If you’re working with large numbers, it’s perfectly fine to use a calculator to figure out the answer."

      "content": "Divide the number of feet by 3 to convert to yards. If you have a measurement in feet and you need to know the equivalent in yards, all you have to do is divide the number of feet by 3. For example, if you need to convert 15 feet into yards, divide 15 by 3 to calculate the answer. 15 divided by 3 = 5 15 feet = 5 yards"

      "content": "Divide the numerator by the denominator to convert a fraction to a decimal. When you convert a whole number from yards to feet, all you have to do is multiply by 3, which is pretty easy! But multiplying with fractions is a little harder, even with a calculator. Converting a fraction to a decimal can make multiplying by 3 a lot easier. To do this, divide the numerator by the denominator. [3] X Research source In a fraction, the line that separates the top number (the numerator) from the bottom number (the denominator) actually means \"divided by.\" In this example, the fraction is 1/3, so use your calculator to divide 1 by 3 1 divided by 3 = 0.33 That means 5 1/3 yards = 5.33 yards"

Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, all you have to do is multiply the number of yards in decimal format by 3 to convert the yards into feet. Since you want to convert 5.33 yards into feet, the math problem you need to solve is 5.33 x 3. [4] X Research source 5 1/3 yards = 5.33 yards 5.33 (yards) x 3 (feet) = 15.99 feet Round the decimal up to the nearest whole number 15.99 feet = 16 feet"

      "content": "Revert the decimal answer back to a fraction to express the answer. When you multiply with decimals, you're probably going to end up with a decimal answer. It's usually preferable to convert your decimal answer back to fraction form since you were working with fractions originally. For example, let's say you need to convert 5 1/4 yards to feet. The complete process: Convert the original fraction to a decimal: 1 divided by 4 = 0.25 The total number of yards you need to convert = 5.25 5.25 (yards) x 3 (feet) = 15.75 feet Convert the decimal back to a fraction: 0.75 = 3/4 The final answer in fraction format = 15 3/4 feet"
