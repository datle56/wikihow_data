      "content": "Observe. Badassery is a state of mind. That guy who's a badass would still be a badass even if he's wearing a polka-dotted tutu. Maybe not quite as intimidating, but still a badass. That's because being a badass is a state of mind, like achieving nirvana, except a lot more daring. Watch a Clint Eastwood movie to get a sense of how to carry yourself in order to be tough and intimidating. Adopt the mannerisms that you think work for you and imagine other mannerisms that you might dream up on your own. Read about other famous badasses. They include, but are not necessarily limited to: Sun Tzu and Genghis Khan, for being Apollonian badasses in times of war; Winston Churchill and Orson Welles, for smoking more cigars than Fidel and Raul combined; Daniel Day Lewis and Jeff Bridges, for wearing tweed and sweatpants with the best of them; and Daryl Dixon the leather jacket zombie fighter."

      "content": "Always be confident. [1] X Expert Source Kirin Dejonckheere Certified Life Coach Expert Interview. 09 October 2024. This is 95% of the battle. Badasses do what they do with complete self-assurance and zero timidity. If you can pull this off, you’ll be viewed as badass faster than a black hole can turn in on itself. Walk with a confident step by keeping your head up, your shoulders straight (pretend that you have a long, flowing cape behind you if you need to) and by walking slower and shorter with each step. Put most of your weight into each step. Be outcome-independent. What does outcome-independence mean? It means that whatever the outcome, you're okay with it. [2] X Research source Your confidence allows you to treat one woman's rejection and another woman's approval with the same attitude: acceptance. That's badass."

      "content": "Be brave. Badasses are brave people. Most people associate a certain fearlessness with being a badass, whether its standing up for yourself or others, or staring down a potentially dangerous situation with a calm quietude. Work on overcoming your fears and don't be shy about defending what you believe in. Push yourself out of your comfort zone and become adaptable to stressful situations. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Let your actions speak louder than your words.",
      "content": "Let your actions speak louder than your words. An original badass will let his actions carry the full meaning of his intent. Badasses don't care much about words because talk is cheap. Anyone can say they're skilled in extra-planetary travel, but not everyone can jump back to Earth from 128,000 feet (39,014.4 m) in space. One isn't badass, the other is."

      "title": "Obliterate your obstacles.",
      "content": "Obliterate your obstacles. Don't let anything stand in your way of being a badass. One of the most exhilarating and frightening things about becoming badass is removing the things from your life that stand in the way. It may not happen overnight, but it will happen if you have a badass state of mind. For example, if you are shy, work on it by developing some conversational material (across different subjects and with plenty of anecdotes) that will ensure that you master your end of the conversation. A true badass will never run out of things to say but will rarely want to speak. Find ingenious fixes to hard problems. So you're stuck between a rock and a hard place. A badass will blast away the rock from within, not with explosives, but with the kinetic energy of grass stalks. (That's figurative, of course.) A badass gets himself out of problems in the cleverest of ways and with the greatest of ease. Plan ahead. A badass will find a good balance between being spontaneous and planning ahead. The fairer sex is an opportunity to wing it; convincing Congress to adopt legislation that would make it easier for you to drive monster trucks in your back yard is not. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Own your style. A true badass will wear what he or she wants regardless of current trends. The key is to master a style that enhances your confidence. Looking your best will do wonders for your image and feelings about your place in your world. Some people associate a certain style of clothing with badasses–boots, leather, denim–but that doesn't have to be you. You can be a badass in a Hawaiian shirt and sandals provided you can convey the badass attitude. Try to have some style quirk that you can bad-assly call your own. Maybe you like wearing vests with pockets; maybe you exclusively wear denim, even to funerals. Whatever it is, commit to it confidently. A style quirk becomes legendary when rocked by a badass."

      "content": "Wear sunglasses. Sunglasses are the epitome of badass. It doesn't matter much what you wear, but as long as you wear your sunglasses, you'll be significantly more badass. That's because sunglasses shield you from close scrutiny and project an air of confidence, even if it's not fully developed."

It is being who you are, and being willing to fight for that. If you start hanging out with people who want to push you too far, agreeing is just submitting to peer pressure like anybody else would.

      "content": "Avoid un-badass things at all costs. You probably have a pretty good idea of what's not very badass. Here's a reminder: Attempting to Impress people. A real badass doesn't try to fit in with anything in any group. Try to think as little as you can about what people think of you, while holding a respectful attitude."

      "title": "Break the rules in small but meaningful ways.",
      "content": "Break the rules in small but meaningful ways. What separates the badass from the rest of the pack is their maverick nature; a badass is the lone wolf who gets expelled from the pack for being too awesome, and who succeeds even more in the face of failure. Badasses do only what they choose to do. Ask yourself what actions you've been lulled into doing mindlessly, and rethink why and how you do it. You might end up sticking to your current course, but at least it's one you chose. Then do it more confidently than before."

      "title": "Don't look for a fight but be prepared to spar.",
      "content": "Don't look for a fight but be prepared to spar. A badass doesn't go out sniffing for altercation, but he's unafraid to lay people out when there's no other option or when respect is seriously challenged. In order to get fit enough to fit should the occasion warrant it, try: Boxing. Boxing is really badass. It's mortal against mortal, mano a mano, in a fight with nothing more than gloves and two giant pairs of cojones. Boxing is grueling, gritty, and grotesque; very appropriate for the burgeoning badass. Wrestling. Wrestlers don't get enough respect. Like boxers, they battle in a test of wit and brawn, repeatedly honing their bodies until they are efficient machines of ruthless power. Nothing sissy about that. [10] X Research source Rugby. Football is a prance in the park compared to rugby. It's not that football is puny (it's not), it's just that rugby is seriously rough. Rugby dudes run around in next to no pads, routinely break noses and dislocate fingers, and keep going like nothing is the matter. Kung-fu. Among the most badass martial arts indeed. Kung Fu is the best way to learn to defend yourself from people who want to start a fight. Nothing says badass like some good old asian fighting sport so people know who they are dealing with."

      "title": "Be on your best behavior.",
      "content": "Be on your best behavior. Avoid making anyone's day needlessly worse or alienating people. There’s a difference between being a badass and being an asshole. People respect the former, but despise the latter. The most revered badasses are the ones who manage to put on a tough image while still managing to be kind and understanding on the sly. [11] X Research source Think Han Solo, a rascal who ends up fighting for the Rebel cause. Or James Bond, a variation on the badass with class and finesse who can fight fearlessly in any situation, always for the good of Britain. Another example is Samurai Jack, a noble warrior who independently fights armies of bounty hunters on a regular basis, while putting other people's life before his own, and is also a man of kindness, honor and acceptance. Some people mistake being a badass with being rude, disrespectful, egocentric or arrogant. That is incorrect. The definition of a true badass is: One of respect, courage, humility, charisma, and a burning passion for their dreams and goals. Cultivating small and large acts of kindness will ensure that you’re the kind of badass that people root for. Keep your good side mysterious and don't brag about it. Badassery, here you come!"
