To achieve Hailey Bieber’s chrome nails at home, use a soft-grit emery file to slim down the sides of your nails into a tapered shape. [9] X Research source Start filing the outer edges of your nail before working your way toward the center, and file in smooth, single strokes along the grain of your nail to prevent breakage. Alternate strokes between each side of the nail to ensure it’s symmetrical. [10] X Research source For instance, file 10 strokes on the left side of your nail, then 10 strokes on the right side. After you file one nail into the right shape, use it as a model for the rest of your nails. View your nails from various angles as you work to make sure they look as similar as possible. If your nails are too short to file into an almond shape, purchase an almond nail tip kit online and apply the tips with a thin layer of adhesive gel included in the kit."
