If you happen to have baby powder at home, this is a great way to mask extra oil and grime in your hair without washing it. Either sprinkle the baby powder right onto your roots, or use a clean makeup brush to swipe it over your roots instead. Wait a couple minutes before massaging it into your hair. [1] X Research source Apply the baby powder using 2-3 shakes to avoid sprinkling too much on your hair. If your hair is longer or super thick, you may need 3-5 shakes of the container to cover your hair."
