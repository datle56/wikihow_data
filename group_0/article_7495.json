Use a comb attachment on your trimmer to style your facial hair to your desired length. [2] X Research source Professional barber Woody Lovell suggests keeping a neutral expression while trimming: “The number one common mistake that men make when grooming their beards is that they will make funny facial expressions when trimming. You do not want to make any unnatural facial expressions when you’re trimming facial hair, because if you do, that line [will be in] a different place [when you go back to a natural expression].”"

The look includes a neatly trimmed mustache that connects to a rounded goatee, framing your mouth and chin. Try to keep the hair symmetrical on both sides of your face as you go. For the best results, keep the hair shorter on your neck and cheeks. [3] X Research source"

[4] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source When going for a close shave, barber Timmy Yanchun says, “You can go across the grain, or depending on [your] skin sensitivity, you can go against the grain of the hair growth. The easiest way to prevent red bumps and irritation is shaving with the grain of the hair. Professional barber Juan Sabino says to clean your razor regularly to prevent skin irritation: “Every time you shave, you want to make sure the blade itself is clean. Get something called Cool Care, which is a spray disinfectant, [and use that], or just run your blade under hot water and leave it in some alcohol to disinfect everything. Then, rinse it with hot water again.”"

Depending on the tool you have, use a precision blade , a detail trimmer , or simply a disposable razor to define the edges of your beard. Focus on sharp lines that define your mustache and the curve under your chin. If you notice any asymmetrical areas, fix them now. [5] X Research source Lovell recommends using a small, sharp razor when shaping your goatee: “To create that sharp line, you’re going to need a sharp razor. A small razor will work best—even your little cheap fix, the ones you just toss and throw away. Because the goatee is small, any hairs you take off will be noticed and it’s very easy to make a mistake.”"

Dry your face with a towel, then apply a hydrating aftershave to reduce itchiness and irritation. Consider applying a beard oil , as well, to soften and condition the hair. [6] X Research source Barber Marlon Rivas says, “When you’re completely done [shaving], splash cold water back on your face. That will close up the pores and give you an even closer looking shave, because the skin constricts itself back to the regular look that it’s supposed to have. If you’re experiencing a lot of itchiness after you shave, Yanchun says you might have dry skin: “I would check what you’re putting on your face and try to use witch hazel, as opposed to alcohol, to moisturize.”"

This will help keep the skin beneath your beard supple and prevent flakiness. Yanchun recommends applying beard oil “whenever your beard seems dry. For some reason, a lot of guys think that you can only apply beard oil once a day, but if your beard feels dry, apply beard oil so you’re moisturizing that hair and keeping it healthy.”"

While you want to keep your beard clean, scrubbing too hard and too often (and using harsh chemicals) can strip your beard of its natural oils and lead to dryness and irritation. [10] X Research source In some cases, it may even damage the hair follicles and the skin underneath. Try washing your beard just a couple times a week with lukewarm water. Additionally, pat your beard dry rather than rubbing it with a towel. This keeps your beard smooth and reduces the risk of irritating your hair follicles and skin. Rivas says how often you should wash your beard “depends on how much product you’re using throughout the week.” The more product you use, the more often you should wash your beard to keep the skin clean."

So I’d say start eating a little healthier, drinking more water, having less stress, [and] working out. I think these are things that aren’t usually mentioned when it comes to skincare and hair, but it’s something that should be addressed because I believe there’s a direct correlation between skin and hair and your inside health.”"
