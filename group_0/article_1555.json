      "content": "Check if Termidor is available for sale in your area. In some regions, Termidor is only sold to pest control professionals who are Termidor Certified. These individuals are trained in how to effectively use this pesticide without risking harm to people, pets or the environment. However, it is available for sale online in some areas, and you may be able to get it shipped to you. Additionally, it's sold in some hardware stores in places without restrictions. [1] X Research source Although it's sold online, stores usually won't ship to regions where it's not legal to purchase Termidor without a certification. Keep in mind that termites are very difficult to treat on your own. If you miss just one spot, your termite shield will be ineffective. Hiring a trained professional is the best way to ensure a successful treatment. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Order Termidor online or purchase it from a hardware store, if it's available. Buy the amount recommended for your home's square footage. You'll need to treat the entire perimeter of your home, even if you only have termites in one small area. [3] X Research source If you only treat a small area around your home, the termites will just move to the untreated area. You'll also need a pesticide sprayer in order to apply the Termidor around your home. You can purchase Termidor for under $100, if it's sold in your area."

[4] X Research source Research the professional to check their service record and look for complaints. Get at least 3 different quotes, if possible, to help you identify the best value. [5] X Research source Ask your professional for a pest control plan in writing, which includes how many treatments are included in the price. Many plans cover a 1-2 year period, since termites are hard to eradicate. You can find the zip code locator here: https://www.termidorhome.com/ . If you live outside the United States, you’ll need to do an online search for pest control professionals in your area. Make sure they are licensed to operate in your area, and check that they’re a member of local or national pest control associations. Additionally, read reviews from prior customers.

Termidor SC is toxic to humans, fish, and other wildlife, so you don’t want it tainting the water. [7] X Research source Never apply this product near an area you know will runoff into a waterway. Remember, you can’t get it out of the water once it’s gone into it. If you’re in doubt, call in a professional."

      "content": "Check the weather forecast to make sure no rain is expected within 48 hours. Rain will wash away the Termidor SC, reducing its effectiveness. Additionally, this may cause the product to contaminate nearby waterways. However, allowing 48 hours for the product to dry will ensure it stays in place. [8] X Research source Do your best to apply the Termidor SC on a clear day, if you can."

      "content": "Keep any family members, roommates, or pets out of the home for 1-2 hours. The fumes from the pesticide can be toxic in high doses, so you want to allow the area time to ventilate. Although this may not always be necessary, it’s better to keep your family and pets safe. [9] X Research source Since you’re applying the treatment outdoors, you don’t need to open windows or doors to ventilate the inside of your home."

This is especially important if anyone has a pet that typically roams around your home, as it may inadvertently come into contact with the pesticide. [10] X Research source Say, “I’m going to be applying a pesticide to kill termites around my home. It’s considered safe for use around humans and pets, but I wanted to let you know so you can avoid the area for a few hours.”"

Make sure there are no gaps around the plastic, so that there is no leakage. This prevents the Termidor from getting into your home. [11] X Research source Cover the vents on the outside of your home, since that's where you'll be applying the Termidor. You don't want it to come into your home through the vents. Turn off your air conditioner or heating system while your vents are covered."

If you can, remove the plants from the area while you apply the pesticide. However, you can cover them with a plastic sheet if this is not an option. Use a stick or rod to tent the plastic sheeting so that it doesn’t crush the plant. [12] X Research source You should still wash the part of the plant you eat before consuming it."

      "content": "Use a hoe to loosen the soil around the perimeter of your home, if necessary. Break up the soil that’s directly beside your home’s foundation. This will keep the Termidor SC from flowing away from the treatment area. Hard-packed soil is hard for the treatment to penetrate, so it will not soak in as well. [14] X Research source If you don’t have a hoe, you can use a shovel or spade."

      "content": "Dig a 6 in (15 cm) wide and 6 in (15 cm) deep trench around the base of your home. Use a shovel to make your trench and follow the entire perimeter of your home. The trench allows the Termidor to penetrate below the soil, killing the subterranean termites. Additionally, it prevents the product from flowing away from the treatment area. [15] X Research source Trenches are necessary and effective whether your house is built on a slab or on blocks. For a home built on a slab, the trench will run alongside the slab. If your home is on blocks, the trench will run in front of the blocks."

      "content": "Hammer rods about 4 in (10 cm) into the trench, spaced 12 in (30 cm) apart. Using rods is optional but will allow the Termidor to reach even further into the ground, providing extra protection. You can use any metal stake or rebar for your rods. Remove the rods after you create a hole. Remember not to hit any pipes or sewer lines. Pest control professionals use rodding to help the product work more effectively, but not all homeowners will use it."

This includes a washable hat, protective eyewear, a face mask, thick work gloves, a long sleeved shirt, long pants, and close-toed shoes. [16] X Research source It’s best to wear a half-facepiece respirator with a combined dust and gas cartridge, as this provides the best protection against breathing in the fumes."

As long as you know the size of your tank, you’ll be able to create the right mixture by measuring out your Termidor. [17] X Research source Use your water hose or a bucket to fill the tank. You'll need to purchase a pesticide sprayer separately from the Termidor. Choose a model that comes with a pump and applicator. If you don't have a sprayer, you can use a 5 US gal (19 L) bucket to mix and apply the Termidor. However, application won't be as easy and may not be even. Additionally, it's best to use a sprayer to treat the soil you took out of your trench. [18] X Research source"

It’s better to apply a little more solution than necessary, as it will soak into the soil around your home. Since termites are likely living in the soil around your home, this is necessary to kill them. [24] X Research source For best results, apply about 4 gallons (15 L) of Termidor for every 10 feet (3.0 m) of the length of your trench. However, your soil may not accept this much pesticide, so you can apply less if necessary. Stop spraying if the pesticide starts to runoff."

In most cases, you'll notice that the pesticide has soaked into the ground at your starting spot once you've worked your way around your home. If it hasn't, give it more time to dissipate. Monitor the area until there's no more standing liquid in the trench. [27] X Research source This ensures that the Termidor goes as far into the ground as possible. If you add soil back into the trench before it soaks into the ground, the added soil will soak up some of the pesticide."

      "content": "Spray the Termidor on the soil you dug out of the trench. Use long, even strokes to wet the soil with the pesticide. This ensures that termites will make contact with the treatment. If you don't treat this soil, termites that stay on the surface of the ground won't die. [28] X Research source Use a sprayer to treat this soil. If you use a bucket, it will be too hard to control the application. If you can, ask someone to help you refill the trench. It's faster and easier to accomplish this if one person is treating the soil and the other person is putting it back into the trench."
