      "content": "Don't try to be someone you aren't. It's tempting to change things about yourself to be more appealing to someone else, but it will only end in heartbreak. You deserve someone who likes you for who you are, and they deserve to know the real you. If you're already dating that, that means they like you! You don't need to be a \"perfect\" guy to be a good boyfriend. There's no such thing as perfection!"

      "content": "Keep up with your own interests, even if they don't like them. It's normal for you to like different things. Although it's great to share things in common, both you and them will likely have separate interests. Set aside time to do what you care about, and encourage them to do the same. This will make your relationship happier in the long run. [1] X Research source For example, you might enjoy watching sports, while they don't. You can enjoy your favorite game with friends while they do something else. Similarly, they might like going to live concerts, while you find them too noisy. They could enjoy regular concert outings with friends instead of with you."

It's important for you to be real around them so that you can have an honest relationship. This will show them that you feel comfortable around them and trust them. Let them comfort you in your times of need! [2] X Research source For example, it's okay to cry when you're upset or talk to them about how stressed you are."

      "content": "Don't try too hard to impress them. You might think that showing off at school, scoring a major win, or giving them nice presents is the only way to win their heart, but that's not true. A person who is with you for the right reasons won't need flashy reasons to be your partner. It's okay to do nice things for them, but don't go overboard. For example, it's okay to bring them flowers before a date, but don't bring them flowers every day. Similarly, it's normal to show off a trophy you won, but don't try to win a trophy just to impress them."

      "content": "Wear clothes that make you feel your best. Being a good boyfriend often includes tending to your appearance, but stay true to who you are. Choose clothing that you like and that fits your interests, rather than what you think your partner wants you to wear. [3] X Research source You don't have to look like a teenage pop star to show your partner that you care about how you look when you're around them. Just shower regularly, shave if that's what you normally do, and wear flattering, well-fitting, and unwrinkled clothes. If you look sloppy around them, they'll think they're not important to you. It's important to look nice, especially before you pick them up on a date. Show them that they're worth the effort it takes to look nice."

Part of being a gentleman means being attentive to your partners's needs, from opening the door for them or their friends to hanging up their coat if they come over. If you pick them up, open the car door for them. Let them walk into a room first, before you. If they look cold, offer them your coat. If you take them out to dinner, pull out their chair for them to sit down. Reader Poll: We asked 772 wikiHow readers, and only 7% of them said the best way to make your partner feel more respected is being on time. Instead, making gentlemanly gestures and listening to them might be better ways to make them feel respected. [Take Poll]"

When they are venting about something -- whether it's about their life or about your relationship -- don't turn it into something about you. They're just telling you their feelings. Don't try to read something into it that isn't there. If their feelings trigger something in you, save it for an appropriate time. Wait for a good time to share your feelings, such as after they're calmed down."

      "content": "Be honest. If you want to be a good boyfriend as a teen, then you have to learn to be honest with your partner. This doesn't mean that you have to tell them every thought that runs through your head, but it does mean that you should be able to tell them if you're in a bad mood, if you're upset because you did poorly on the math test, or that you wish they wouldn't call you every five minutes. [5] X Research source Part of honesty is tact. If you have to be honest about something you wish they did or didn't do, tell them in a kind and sympathetic way so they don't get mad at you. Don't pretend that you never had another partner if you did. You don't have to go into all the details with your partner, but you shouldn't lie about your past. You don't have to tell your partner everything -- for example, if you think the girl in your gym class is cute, you can just keep that to yourself. If they find out that you've been dishonest, that will break their trust very quickly."

You may want to see the new Bond movie with your friends, but they may really want to have a date night -- you have to learn how to pick your battles and how to make sure that both people in the relationship are happy. [6] X Research source Remember that it's better to be happy than right. If you think your partner really wants something while you just kind of want it, let them get their way. Be mature. If you and your partner are arguing about something, sit down and make a list of all the pros and cons of each decision. That can help you both get perspective on the situation. Make sure that both people are compromising. It's not a real compromise if you always end up getting your way, or if your partner always ends up getting what they want. Learn to take turns. Maybe you can pick the dinner place tonight, but they can pick the movie tomorrow."

You may think that admitting you're wrong will only make you look worse, but quite the contrary is true. If you acknowledge that you've made a mistake and even apologize by giving them flowers or a sweet note, they'll like you much more than if you ignore the fact that you did something wrong and hope they'll get over it. [7] X Research source It's not easy to say you're sorry -- it can be very humiliating or embarrassing. But if you get into the habit of apologizing when you've done something wrong, it will feel much more natural. When you say you're sorry, you should sound like you mean it. Sit down, look into your partner's eyes, and even take their hands if you need to. This will show them that you're making time to apologize. If you just mutter the word \"Sorry\" as you pass by, or apologize in a text message, they won't take you seriously."

      "content": "Don't fight without reason. It's important to have disagreements from time to time and to work together to find a solution to the problem, but constantly fighting for no reason and with little provocation is a quick way to ruin your relationship. Teenage couples are prone to fighting a lot because they don't have a lot of experience compromising or having serious discussions with people they're romantically involved with, and this does take practice. Whenever you find yourself raising your voice or even shouting, just calm down and take a few deep breaths. You won't resolve anything if you're feeling emotional or heated. If you think your partner is starting a lot of fights, communicate about why this is happening and how it can be changed. If you're kind of annoyed about something minor and have the urge to pick a fight, ask yourself if it's really worth it. Don't let your anger build up -- if you're really mad about something, it's better to communicate about it than to avoid the topic and wait for weeks until so much anger has built up that you feel like fighting."

If you want to be a good boyfriend, then you have to be attentive to their moods and to understand when they're feeling happy or when they're annoyed or even upset. They may be trying to hide their moods, but as you get to know them better, you should understand how they're really feeling. If they're clearly upset about something, you can ask them to open up about why. If they don't want to talk about it, don't push it or keep asking about it, or they'll feel much worse. If they're sad, give them some love and affection. Ask if they want to stay in instead of going out, or how they feel like dealing with their mood. They may want to be left alone, or they may just want to snuggle with you. Don't say, \"I can tell you're in a bad mood.\" Instead, say, \"Is something wrong? I'm worried that you're upset. Talk to me.\" If you accuse them of being in a bad mood, they may get annoyed and defensive."

Maybe they're really busy during lunch because they have to cram for their Spanish exam -- offer to buy them lunch in the lunch line while they study. If they stay home sick, offer to pick up their homework from their teachers. [8] X Research source If they need a ride somewhere, offer to give them one if you can drive. If they need help, they may not admit it right away, so be attentive and see if there's anything you can do. Make sure there's a give-and-take balance. If you do favors for them, they should help you out, too. If it's a one-way street, then they may be taking advantage of you."

You should recognize that your partner is their own person and that you should support them as they try to reach their goals as well as when they deal with any conflict in their life. Here are some ways to be supportive: [9] X Research source If you know they have a big test coming up, then you should either give them space to study or help them if you can. If they're really passionate about soccer, tennis, or some other school sport, then you should cheer them on the sidelines during their big games. If they're going through some trouble at home, make sure to be extra attentive and to ask if there's anything you can do. And if they don't want to talk about it, they don't want to talk about it. Ask about their interests. If you know they're passionate about painting or playing the violin, support them by letting them talk about these interests and sharing how much they mean to them."

      "content": "Pay attention to their friends. It's very important to be attentive to your partner, and it's also key to pay attention to their friends. Friends can make or break teenage relationships, and if their friends love you, they'll tell them how lucky they are to have found an amazing guy like you. But if they don't like you because you're rude or ignore them, they'll tell them that you're a jerk and may even convince them that they can do better and that they should break up with you ASAP. Be friendly to their friends. Say hi, even if your partner isn't around, and ask them how they're doing. You can even talk to them about their interests and get to know them a bit. [10] X Research source Don't ignore them. If you approach your partner when they're with a group of friends, make sure to greet them when you do. Don't tell your partner that you don't like their friends. Even if they're a little annoying, they mean a lot to them, and if you admit this, you'll be making a rift in your relationship."

Don't ditch them as soon as your friends show up, or they'll start to feel like a burden or like a last priority. [11] X Research source If you two are hanging out with your friends, you should sit next to them and include them in the conversation. Don't leave them hanging. Help your friends get to know them. If your friends are shy or awkward around your partner, it'll be hard to have a good time. Bring up some common interests for your friends and your partner to talk about."

Space and privacy are necessary for every healthy relationship, so don't be put off if it seems like your partner wants a night to themselves or even a night with their friends. If you're always around, then your relationship may be becoming too intense. Take some time apart from your partner so you have time to gain perspective and realize how much you miss each other. If you're always around, then they may start to feel that you're controlling or domineering. Let them do their own thing. If they want to be alone, be cool with it. If you look upset or hurt, they'll think you're insecure. Leave some room in their schedule. Don't try to plan your weekends so you're together every second and don't have time for your families or other friends."

If you're a teen, then this may be your first, or one of your first relationships, and you may feel awkward about telling your partner that they look nice or for complimenting their outfit, but you should get into the habit of complimenting them. This will let them know that you like them and notice them, and that they mean a lot to you. [12] X Research source You should compliment them even more if they get a new haircut or wear a new outfit. You can tell them they looks attractive whenever you want to -- it doesn't have to be only when they're all dressed up. If they look cute in a tank top and a pair of casual shorts, let them know. You don't have to overdo it -- just make sure to compliment them at least once every time you see them. You don't only have to compliment their looks -- you can compliment an aspect of their personality, like their amazing sense of humor, or you can tell them that they're an amazing gymnast or that they're great at French."

If you want to be affectionate, you should put your arm around your partner from time to time, hold hands, or even give them a quick kiss when you meet them. You don't have to overwhelm them or put your hands all over them whenever you see them, but you should give them some sign that you like being around them, even if it's just a gentle squeeze on the hand after class. [13] X Research source Learn to cuddle. Spend some time hugging them, stroking their hair, or showering them with kisses. Put your arms around their waist! People love this, they feel protected and safe in your arms. Only be as affectionate as they want you to be. Don't make them feel like they're getting groped in public or like they don't have room to breathe. Take it easy on the PDAs (Public Displays of Affection). You'll find that often, the couples that are the most comfortable with each other don't need to hold hands 24/7 or to make out in public.

You can also try something new out whenever it seems natural, whether during a kiss or something out of the blue. But just be careful to read both their verbal reactions and their physical cues clearly, and stop if they're not comfortable. Don't rush them! Let them work at their own pace.

If you're a teen, you probably don't have a lot of spending money, and you don't have to save up to get a diamond necklace. Just give them a cute and silly teddy bear for Valentine's Day, a bouquet of flowers on their birthday, or tickets to the movie they wanted to see as a special treat. [14] X Research source It's not the actual gift that counts -- it's the gesture. A gift shows that you've taken the time to think about them."

Leave them in their locker or hand them to them after school, or even at the end of a romantic date. You don't have to say much in the notes -- just tell them that you've been thinking about them and compliment something about them. Don't leave the notes if it feels forced. But if you really want to show your affection this way, they'll love it. You can also just text them randomly, saying things like \"I love you\" or \"Thinking of you\". This feels a little less personal than leaving notes, but it is better than nothing, especially if you're apart for a period of time and can't leave them notes."

Part of being affectionate is making time when just the two of you can hang out, go on a date, and talk about how much you like each other -- or about nothing at all. You should try to have a \"date night\" at least once every week or two so you and your partner can have time to make your relationship move forward. You and your partner can alternate picking where you'll go and what you'll do. Maybe they want to go mini-golfing one weekend and you want to go to the beach another time. Almost any situation can be romantic if you're alone with your partner and show them lots of affection. You can have a romantic time at the county fair or even when you're watching a silly movie.

You can even find a new TV show that you're both addicted to.

Pick them up after school and drive them to a park for an impromptu picnic. [15] X Research source Don't do the same thing every weekend. Make sure you try at least one new thing together every time you go out, even if it means seeing the same movie in a different theater. Don't forget about your looks.

Let's face it -- teenage relationships are less likely to last than adult relationships, or even college relationships, so you shouldn't invest 100% of your time in each other or you may both be disappointed. Your relationship can continue to grow and strengthen while both of you still remember who you are without each other. [16] X Research source Continue to make time for your guy friends. Don't ditch them completely to hang out with your partner. Don't let your partner ditch their friends to hang out with you all the time, either. Don't stop pursuing your interests just because of your partner. Continue to practice with your band, even if they don't like the music.

Don't ever pressure your partner to do more than they want to do. They may feel forced to give in to you, and they will regret it later. If you keep trying to move too fast, your partner may think that you're not in the relationship for the right reasons. Let your partner make the calls sometimes. Wait for them to tell you what they want instead of making it clear that you want more. You should avoid moving too fast not only in the bedroom, but in general.

Never ever talk about their faults or flaws, your opinion is very important to them so by saying mean things you could really damage their self-esteem.
