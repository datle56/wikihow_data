      "content": "Don’t be a carbon copy. As you start out it might feel overwhelming to put together a great outfit, and it may be tempting to just copy other people’s outfits. Try to keep your look more unique by doing variations on what you see elsewhere. For example, you might do the same silhouette as someone else did, but with different colours or patterns. Alternatively, you can use the same colors, but different pieces. For example, instead of wearing a white blouse, a blue skirt, and tan heels, try a white shirt, blue jeans, and tan boots. Add individuality to your outfit by using different accessories, such as bags, belts, hats, or jewelry. For example, instead of using fancy gold jewelry, you could try rustic wood jewelry."
