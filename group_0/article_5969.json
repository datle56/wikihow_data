      "content": "Choose a variety. Sunflowers range from eighteen foot (5.5 m) stalks to a knee-high cluster of pom-poms. Besides the size and appearance, there are a few other considerations: The classic, yellow, single-stem sunflower usually grow quickly and easily. Sunrich and Pro Cut are good beginner options. [2] X Research source Branching varieties produce many flowers per seed, but most grow more slowly. If you plan to cut the flowers, get a pollen-free or low-pollen variety such as Cherry Rose to avoid a sticky mess. [3] X Research source Larger varieties such as Mammoth Gray Stripe and Humongous tend to produce tastier seeds, and can provide support for climbing plants. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source (Some smaller varieties produce birdseed-quality seeds.)"

      "title": "Decide when to plant the sunflowers.",
      "content": "Decide when to plant the sunflowers. You can plant your sunflowers starting in late spring, once the last frost is passed. However, many sunflowers are daylight-sensitive, and may grow leggy and delay flowering if planted at the wrong time. There are three types of varieties: [6] X Research source Short-day: These need long nights to trigger flowering. Plant them toward the end of summer (or start them indoors in mid-spring). Long-day: These bloom during the middle of summer. Day-neutral varieties can be planted any time during the growing season. Plan ahead based on the expected flowering time. Most single-stem sunflowers bloom 60 days after planting from seed, while branched sunflowers bloom after 90 days. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose a spot with well-drained soil and full sun.",
      "content": "Choose a spot with well-drained soil and full sun. Sunflowers grow best in loamy soil with good drainage and neutral pH. [8] X Research source More importantly, make sure the area gets at least six hours of full sun a day, and preferably eight or more. [9] X Research source If the soil is poor, mix in 3 or 4 inches (7.5–10cm) of compost into the topsoil. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Plant the seeds.",
      "content": "Plant the seeds. Farmers usually plant large, single-stem sunflowers at least an inch (2.5 cm) deep. [11] X Research source In home gardens with good quality soil (not too dry or sandy), you can likely plant at ½ inch (1.25 cm) depth instead. [12] X Research source Plant extra seeds if you have the space. You may thin them later, or lose some seeds to pests."

    {
      "title": "Space the seeds apart depending on desired flower size.",
      "content": "Space the seeds apart depending on desired flower size. The further apart you space the seeds, the larger their flowers will grow: Plant the seeds 6 inches (15 cm) apart for smaller, bouquet-sized flowers, or 9\" (23) cm + for larger blooms. [13] X Research source If your sunflower's max height is above 5 ft (1.5m), plant them at least 1 ft (0.3m) apart. Giant varieties may need 2 ft (0.6m) of space. [14] X Research source Most branching varieties need 18\" (46 cm) of space. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Water young sunflowers daily.",
      "content": "Water young sunflowers daily. Sunflower seedlings need plenty of water while they're establishing themselves. Keep the soil moist, but not soaked, until the seedlings emerge. This usually happens within 5–10 days of planting, but may take longer in cold weather. Once the seedling emerges, water about 3–4 inches (7.5–10cm) from the plant to encourage root growth.

      "title": "Fertilize the sunflowers if the soil is poor.",
      "content": "Fertilize the sunflowers if the soil is poor. Sunflowers do not need fertilizer, and overdoing the nitrogen can create a leggy plant with delayed flowering. If your soil is poor, add compost or slow-release fertilizer to the surface of the soil. [17] X Research source This should help strengthen the plant without overdosing it."

      "title": "Look out for yellow leaves.",
      "content": "Look out for yellow leaves. Downy mildew can be a major problem in clay or waterlogged soils. Check regularly for this fungus, which causes shrunken yellow leaves in addition to its namesake down. If you see these symptoms, reduce water use to keep soil dry, and apply fungicide immediately. Infected plants rarely produce flowers, so you may want to simply remove them to avoid spreading the disease. [18] X Research source [19] X Research source If the leaves look normal except for a striking yellow bleached color, this is a bacterial infection instead. Keeping soil dry will help here as well, and the plant will usually be fine. If the leaf looks yellow but still has green veins, the problem is most likely a mineral deficiency. It can be tricky to pinpoint the exact problem, but diluted fertilizer may work. Be aware that it’s normal for sunflowers to lose their first set of leaves once they begin growing in earnest. Don’t worry if the bottom leaves yellow and drop, but the rest of the leaves are fine."

      "title": "Reduce watering for mature sunflowers.",
      "content": "Reduce watering for mature sunflowers. Once they've developed a deep taproot, sunflowers are fairly drought-resistant. They'll still thrive on regular, deep watering, especially while buds and flowers are developing, but allow the soil to dry out between watering sessions. Over-watering is more likely to harm them than under-watering. [20] X Research source Try not to get the blooms wet, as this can damage them. [21] X Research source"

Tie them to a sturdy support using cloth or other soft material. [22] X Research source You may need to put up a wind barrier for extra tall sunflowers."

      "content": "Cut decorative flowers when they are ¼ open. At this stage, the flower petals stick up perpendicular to the central disc. Cut them at this point for maximum vase life (usually five days, much longer with some varieties): [23] X Research source Cut flowers in the early morning or early evening. Use a clean knife or shears. Strip off any leaves that would be below the water line. Place in water immediately."

      "content": "Cut flowers for drying. In this case, it's best to wait until the flower is about half open, and the petals are leaning outward. [24] X Research source Once cut, there are many ways to preserve them . The simplest is to tie the stems with twine and hang them upside down in a warm room with good ventilation."

      "content": "Protect seeds from birds and squirrels. If you'd like to harvest the seeds yourself, you'll have to battle the neighborhood animals. Once the flowers start to droop and lose their petals, cover the head with cheesecloth or a paper bag. Most sunflowers will produce many more seeds if you attract bees to your garden to pollinate them."

      "content": "Harvest the seed head. You may cut off the seed head once the disk it rests on starts to turn color from green to yellow. Store in a dry, cool location until the disk turns dark brown. The seeds are now ready to eat, raw or roasted . Store seeds in a cloth bag to allow air to circulate. This helps prevent mold."
