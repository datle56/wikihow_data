      "content": "A “femme fatale” is a woman who’s glamorous and powerful. Technically, “ femme fatale ” is French for “fatal (or dangerous) woman.” Really, she’s just “dangerous” because she’s unstoppably seductive. In movies, you can find all sorts of femmes fatales, from old Hollywood starlets to today’s celebrities. In books, she might be an undercover spy or just a seductress that wants to toy with people. Wherever you find her, the femme fatale is the ultra-attractive woman whose mysterious beauty is her secret weapon. [1] X Research source You could say that a femme fatale has a certain “ je ne sais quoi ”—that’s just another fun French phrase that roughly translates to “I don’t know what it is (about her)!” Here's a clue: most are so drawn to the femme fatale because she has a quiet confidence and is always elegant. When she slinks into the room, she’s impeccably dressed and looks sure of herself. Classic femmes fatales include actresses in noir films, like Ava Gardner. In comics, Black Widow and Catwoman qualify as femmes fatales. A great example of a modern femme fatale is Angelina Jolie in Mr. and Mrs. Smith or any current Bond woman."

      "content": "Always put yourself first. Ultimately, a femme fatale is ruthlessly ambitious. She doesn’t step over people with her killer stilettos, though. To channel her independence and driven attitude, set goals and achieve them. Above all, focus on yourself and what thrills you. When you get to the top without needing anyone, you’ll leave everyone breathless. [2] X Research source For example, if someone you're dating wants to have a spontaneous dinner out, but you'd prefer to pull an all-nighter to work on a project that will impress your colleagues, say, \" I really can't—duty calls. Marketing, you know? How about this weekend? \" Remember, it's not selfish to make yourself your number one priority. If anything, loving yourself makes you an empowering icon to look up to."

      "content": "Be independent. To be a true femme fatale, rely on yourself and only yourself. While it’s fun to fantasize about a lover or see if your friends will call you up, focus on being happy on your own. Develop your own passions and carve out plenty of time for personal growth and self-improvement. Once you discover you’re all you need, people will notice the way you glow with self-assurance. [3] X Research source You can form meaningful relationships with people, but you remember—even if you’re dating the lover of your dreams, it’s best if you act like you don't need them . Let your SOs know your philosophy about enjoying lovers but not depending on them with a remark like, \" I really appreciate and value your company. It's a great bonus to have you in my life .\""

[4] X Research source If you notice that everyone is looking at you, don't doubt yourself. Congratulate yourself. You've single-handedly managed to steal the show just by walking in. When you see someone you want to befriend or win over, give yourself an inner pep talk like, \" Of course they'll fall for me and all I have to offer. Everyone does! I just have to be myself .\""

When you socialize with others, act mildly amused so it seems like you aren’t worried about being popular—you’re just there to have a good time. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Ask for your \"signature drink\" with conviction because you know what you want and expect it. For example, instead of waiting for a bartender's attention, announce, \"I'll have a Dark and Stormy—thank you.\" Play hard to get and give everyone the sense that your schedule is booked because you're so sought after. Casually make a remark like, \"Well, this has been fun, and maybe we'll run into each other again.\" Unavailability can be really sexy. For example, if a man reaches out and asks to catch up, but you want to get him to chase you , tell him, \"I'm all booked up. Check in with me next week. \""

Everyone will see you as the epitome of a real lady and idolize you. [6] X Research source Show that you're kind to other women. When you express interest in them instead of upstaging or ignoring them, you'll demonstrate the strength of your character. For example, say, \" It's nice to see you again, Susan. How is your graduate program going? It sounds fascinating! \" Avoid consuming too much alcohol while you're out—just one drink should be enough if you want to enjoy yourself a bit."

[7] X Research source Don’t be afraid to challenge people. State your ideas and back them up with evidence. You’re smart enough to do it. Start off with a remark like, \"Interesting perspective.

To be the woman everyone talks about, discuss what you've learned with lots of enthusiasm. For instance, bring up a subject you've been immersed in—\" I've recently gotten into a bit of Egyptology, and there's just been a new discovery about how the pyramids have been built... \""

Having a naturally sexy, mysterious, and seductive personality is what draws people in.
