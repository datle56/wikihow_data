      "content": "Find out if your spouse has claimed their benefits. If you're currently married, you can't claim spousal benefits unless your spouse has already started receiving their retirement benefits. If you're older than your spouse, you can collect your own retirement benefits until your spouse reaches retirement age, then claim the spousal benefits on top of your own retirement benefits. [2] X Research source The amount of your spousal benefit isn't affected by the age at which your spouse started receiving their retirement benefits. It is always based on your spouse's primary insurance amount, which is the amount they would receive if they started claiming benefits at their normal retirement age (NRA). This age is based on the year you were born. You can find out your NRA, and the NRA of your spouse, at https://www.ssa.gov/oact/ProgData/nra.html . If you and your spouse are divorced, it doesn't matter if they're receiving their benefits yet or not. You can still collect your spousal benefit if you are otherwise eligible."

      "title": "Compare your spousal benefit to your own retirement benefits.",
      "content": "Compare your spousal benefit to your own retirement benefits. The Social Security Administration (SSA) always pays out your own retirement benefits first. However, if your spouse worked for more years, or made more money than you did, it's possible that your spousal benefit will be greater than your retirement benefits. [3] X Research source The SSA looks at the amount of retirement benefits you're eligible for, then the amount of spousal benefits you're eligible for. If the spousal benefits are greater than your retirement benefits, you would be paid your retirement benefits first, then spousal benefits would be used to make up the difference. You always get the larger of the two amounts. If your retirement benefits are greater than your spousal benefits, you technically wouldn't be eligible for spousal benefits, because you would be paid your retirement benefits since they would give you more. For example, suppose you are eligible for $200 a month in retirement benefits. Your spouse's primary insurance amount is $500 a month, and they started receiving benefits at their NRA. This means you're entitled to 50 percent of their primary insurance amount, or $250 a month. Technically, you would be paid your $200 a month in retirement benefits, plus another $50 a month in spousal benefits, to bring you up to the full $250 a month."

If you are divorced but were married to your spouse for at least 10 years, you may be able to get spousal benefits off of their account. To be eligible for divorced spouse benefits, all of the following must be true: [4] X Trustworthy Source US Social Security Administration Independent U.S. government agency that administers Social Security and related information Go to source You are unmarried You are at least 62 years old Your ex-spouse is entitled to Social Security benefits (either retirement or disability) Your retirement benefits are less than your spousal benefits based on their work would be You've been divorced for at least 2 years (if your ex-spouse has not yet claimed their benefits)"

      "title": "Decide when you want to start receiving benefits.",
      "content": "Decide when you want to start receiving benefits. Your full spousal benefit is 50% of your spouse's primary insurance amount. However, if you decide to start receiving those benefits before you reach your normal retirement age, your benefit amount will be permanently reduced. [5] X Research source If you are between the age of 62 and your normal retirement age, the amount of spousal benefits you receive is reduced by a percentage that is based on the number of months until you reach normal retirement age. The lowest percentage you could possibly get is 32.5% of your spouse's primary insurance amount. In some situations, it might make sense for you to claim your spousal benefits early. However, if you can afford to do so, you'll get more money if you wait until you reach your normal retirement age."
