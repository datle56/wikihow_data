Be sure to check the time zones before placing a call, and try to plan the call for a time when people in Hawaii will be available to talk. [1] X Research source When calling from a place like Australia or Asia, Hawaii can be nearly 24 hours behind. This means that it can be 7:30 A.M. on a Tuesday in Australia, and 6:30 A.M. on a Monday in Hawaii. Remember to plan accordingly if you need to call someone on a specific day! If possible, let the person you are planning to call that you will be calling at a certain time."

If you’re making a lot of calls, this can be a logical and very inexpensive option. Sometimes, the company can apply discounts, so ask the provider if they’re able to give you a deal for being a loyal customer."
