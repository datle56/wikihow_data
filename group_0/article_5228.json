      "content": "This method may let you bypass age restrictions without signing in. To watch restricted videos without a Google account, try installing the Tampermonkey extension in Chrome. Then, download and install the Simple YouTube Age Restriction Bypass script here: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/423851-simple-youtube-age-restriction-bypass . Use the following steps to ensure the script works properly: To install Tampermonkey, visit the Chrome Web Store, search for Tampermonkey, and then click Add to Chrome on the app’s page.

Visit the age restricted YouTube video you want to watch. Open the Tampermonkey extension in your extensions menu and make sure that the age restriction bypass script is toggled on. If the YouTube video was open before you made all these changes, you might need to reload it to get it working."

      "content": "You can watch some YouTube videos by adding “NSFW” to the URL. To do this, simply insert the letters “NSFW” before “youtube” in the video’s address. [1] X Research source The first part of the video’s address will now look like nsfwyoutube.com instead of just youtube.com. Hit ↵ Enter to navigate to the new address and watch the video there without restrictions. However, if you try this method, be aware: Websites like NSFWYouTube may display aggressive popup ads or try to install malware on your computer. Make sure you have a good adblocker and security software installed before trying this method. This technique might not work for every age-restricted video. If it doesn’t, try replacing the “youtube.com” part of the URL with “listenonrepeat.com” instead. Keep in mind that this method is also not completely reliable."

      "content": "This is a good option if you want to watch age-restricted videos offline. However, many of the most popular downloaders can no longer get around YouTube’s age restrictions. A couple of options that may still work are AceThinker Video Keeper (a free desktop application) and 4K Video Downloader (a subscription-based app for desktop computers and Android devices). Some of these downloaders, such as 4K Video Downloader, bypass age restrictions by having you log in via the app rather than directly through the YouTube website. This means you will still need an 18+ Google account to download the content. However, once you have the video, you can watch it any time you like without limitations."

      "content": "The easiest method is to sign in with an adult Google account. Whether your YouTube account is under 18 or you just want to watch the video anonymously without using your main account, creating a new Google/YouTube account is the simplest way to get past age restrictions. There's no limit to the number of YouTube accounts you can create, and if you live in the US, you can sign up with any name and age you'd like. If you're in the United States, you won't be asked to supply an ID to verify your age. However, many countries have stricter age requirements for creating Google accounts. [3] X Research source If you're creating a new account in Europe or another region with age restrictions on Google accounts, you'll be asked to prove your age with a credit card or government-issued ID. [4] X Research source You can avoid this by signing up from a US-based IP address, such as through a VPN (a free trial will do the trick) or the Tor web browser. If you're using a computer, phone, or tablet with parental restrictions and can't create a new Google account , you can do so from any other computer, phone, or tablet."

Replacing the “watch?v=” part of the video URL with “embed/”. Using a third-party client, such as NewPipe, FreeTube, VLC Media Player, or Invidious, to watch age-restricted YouTube videos. Downloading age-restricted videos onto your device (although there may still be a few downloaders that can bypass the restrictions)."
