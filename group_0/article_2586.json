      "content": "Create specific and realistic goals. It’s hard to be consistent if you don’t have a firm idea of what to do. When starting your new path, create simple goals with specific, measurable results. Try writing down potential goals, then evaluate them and break them into smaller pieces; once you know your end goal, you can develop manageable steps to reach it. Aim for “S.M.A.R.T” goals: [1] X Research source Specific . Know precisely what your goal entails. Instead of saying, \"I'm going to appreciate my partner,\" you might say, \"I'm going to thank my partner when they wash the dishes, make dinner, or help out around the house.\" Measurable . Make sure there’s a way to track your progress as you pursue the goal. For example, if you want to be fitter, you might set a goal to exercise 5 days a week (and track those days). Achievable . The goal should be something you can actually achieve; be realistic, but have faith in your abilities, too. Relevant . Ensure your goal will have a meaningful impact on your life and is in line with the type of person you strive to be. Time-bound . Establish a timeline and ultimate deadline for yourself to help motivate you. For example, if you aim to build an emergency fund, you might give yourself 12 months to save a specific amount of money."

      "title": "Define what consistency means to you.",
      "content": "Define what consistency means to you. Don’t base your goals on anyone else’s standards; figure out what works for you. Someone else might view “consistency” as going for a 6 a.m. run every morning, for example, but that doesn’t mean your version of consistency is the same! So, take time to think about what a consistent life and schedule looks like for you. [2] X Research source For example, do you need to be consistent about your exercise habits? Are you aiming for a higher quality of work? Do you want to be more available and reliable in your relationships? Any of the above goals might fit your definition of consistency—but some might not, and that’s okay, too."

      "content": "Create a schedule for yourself. Packing on tasks and promises can be easy, but a calendar, planner, or schedule will keep you on track. Make a schedule and plan your day to ensure you finish everything on time. It’ll also help you understand which commitments you do and do not have time for. [3] X Research source Try downloading a scheduling app on your phone or tablet, like Google Calendar or Outlook . Alternatively, use a paper planner or desk calendar. Block off realistic amounts of time for each task. If you’re uncertain how long a task will take, give yourself extra time to complete it. For larger goals, like writing a book or losing weight, set small, daily tasks that you can do to work towards this goal. For example, you might set a daily word count to achieve or plan specific meals to eat each day. Reader Poll: We asked 168 wikiHow readers if they use a calendar to keep track of their schedule, and 54% said yes . [Take Poll] Keeping a calendar is a great way to remember important events and complete major tasks."

      "content": "Place reminders of your goal around your home and workspace. Sometimes, it’s easy to forget new goals, habits, commitments, or promises, especially when you’re the only one tracking them. To remind yourself of your goals throughout the day, put messages to yourself in easily visible areas where you can’t miss them. For example: [4] X Research source Write down your goals on post-it notes and place them on your mirror, computer, refrigerator, car dashboard, and planner. Slip a piece of paper with your goals into your wallet, desk drawer, or purse. If you’re establishing a daily routine, put a reminder on your phone. Set an alarm or use a reminder app to alert you when you need to do it."

      "title": "Make commitments only if you can keep them.",
      "content": "Make commitments only if you can keep them. Consistency is all about being able to follow through on promises and commitments. However, it’s easy to get overwhelmed if you make too many of them. If you think a request may be difficult to do, say no . Turning down commitments doesn’t make you rude or unmotivated; it means you’re responsible and understand your limits. [5] X Research source For example, if you tell your significant other that you're going to handle half of the chores, make sure that you have time after work to do them. In some cases, you may be able to negotiate a promise that you’ll be able to keep. For example, if someone asks you to help them move, you can say, “Well, I can’t make it before 3 PM, but I could swing by after. Does that work?” This includes promises to yourself. If you know it’s unrealistic to write 10 pages per day for your novel, promise yourself that you'll write at least a little bit daily instead."

      "title": "Prioritize the commitments and goals you currently have.",
      "content": "Prioritize the commitments and goals you currently have. When you’re juggling multiple commitments simultaneously, it might be hard to focus on anything consistently. So, work on prioritizing tasks . Make a to-do list in order of importance, with the most immediate task at the top of the list. That way, you’ll know what your priorities are and when you need each thing to be done. [6] X Research source If you have a lot of things to do, you could also categorize them. For example: The first category is urgent, important tasks that have the highest priority. The second category is important tasks that don’t have to be done right away. The third category is tasks that aren’t important or urgent (and therefore don’t have priority)."

      "title": "Reward yourself when you get something done.",
      "content": "Reward yourself when you get something done. As you complete goals, give yourself rewards to keep motivated. Even small goals deserve small rewards, since they’ll help you maintain your momentum until you get to the next goal. For example, if you manage to finish work by 5 pm daily for a week, take a night off, see a movie, or treat yourself to a special dinner! [7] X Research source Ultimately, your rewards can be anything you find enticing and motivating. Try tying the size of the reward to the size (or difficulty) of the goal; the bigger the goal, the bigger your reward. You might give yourself a 30-minute dance break, do some drawing or gardening, play a video game, or watch the newest episode of a TV show for a small reward. For a bigger reward, you might let yourself go out with friends for the night, throw a party, enjoy a spa day, or buy yourself one thing you've been wanting to get. If you’re training for a marathon and you’ve managed to hit your daily exercise goals, sign up for a 5k to give you a sense of your success. If you manage to improve your friendships by being more consistent, those friendships may even become the reward. Take your friends out or host a dinner to celebrate the success."

      "title": "Limit distractions to build up your willpower.",
      "content": "Limit distractions to build up your willpower. Consistency requires willpower to achieve because it’s something you need to be able to do even when you don’t feel like it. To help yourself along the way (and build up that willpower), remove as many distractions or temptations from your space as possible—and practice self-care to ensure you stay healthy and strong. [8] X Research source For example, to be consistent about eating healthy food, ensure you always have healthy meal and snack options available when you’re hungry. Don’t keep junk food in your house or office! Exhaustion can cause you to skip tasks or ignore goals for the day, so get at least 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night so you’re refreshed and ready to go the next day. Remember the long-term benefits of your goals whenever you feel unmotivated, and read over your list of goals for inspiration."

      "title": "Replace negative thought patterns with positivity.",
      "content": "Replace negative thought patterns with positivity. Negative thinking is the bane of consistency. When you think negative thoughts, you’re making it harder for yourself to follow through and practice consistent behavior. So, pay attention to negative thought patterns that might trip you up, and catch yourself if you start thinking things like, “I can’t do this” or “I’m too lazy or stupid to do this.” [9] X Research source When you notice negative thought patterns, reverse them and turn them into something more positive (or at least neutral). For example, if you think, \"I can't do this,\" turn it around and say to yourself, \"I'm going to practice doing this, even if I'm not great at it to start with.\" If you’re starting to dread a task or goal, revise the task, goal, or outcome, break it into smaller steps, and promise yourself a reward when you finish it."

      "title": "Forgive yourself and keep going if you make a mistake.",
      "content": "Forgive yourself and keep going if you make a mistake. Even the most consistent and well-organized people slip up sometimes. Instead of getting upset when it happens, go into each goal planning for a potential slip-up, and don't beat yourself if it happens. Show yourself the compassion and patience you’d show someone else, let it go, and don’t give up. [10] X Research source For example, just because you had to cancel an appointment or pass a deadline doesn’t mean you’re not consistent. Sometimes, external factors can get in the way despite your best planning. Plan for setbacks and failures. If a literary agent rejects your manuscript, figure out where next to send it or look it over to see what might be improved. Consistency doesn't equal perfection. If you miss a day at the gym or fail to read your child a book at night, encourage yourself to start again the very next day!"

      "title": "Keep track of your ongoing progress.",
      "content": "Keep track of your ongoing progress. Try keeping a journal where you can write down and track the progress you’ve made on a goal—or, if you prefer, write up a checklist or progress log on your computer somewhere you can easily find it. Furthermore, track the time it takes you to do each task. That way, you’ll have a more accurate idea of how to spend your time in the future. Once again, you can track your time spending and management in a journal or create a spreadsheet on your computer and record it that way. With a time log, you can also see if there are tasks taking more time than you want them to or interfering with your consistency."

      "title": "Plan breaks for yourself and take time to recharge.",
      "content": "Plan breaks for yourself and take time to recharge. Consistency doesn’t mean working all the time. Giving yourself scheduled breaks and time off can improve your productivity and avoid burnout in the future! Schedule free time to relax, eat, have fun, and regain your energy, and don’t let work or other commitments get in the way. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source For example, you might give yourself an hour each evening to read, take a bath, or watch TV. Don’t work during this time. Schedule intermittent breaks as you work, too. For example, for every two hours you work, you might step away for a 10-minute break and take a walk or have a snack. Meditation is a great way to quiet your brain and get some peace. Try meditating for at least 5 minutes daily and work up to 15 minutes at a time. Don't push aside your free time for other responsibilities. If you need to sleep on Saturday, don't tell your partner you'll get up early to mow the lawn. Tell them you'll do it on another day or time (and follow through)."

      "title": "Hold yourself accountable for goals and commitments.",
      "content": "Hold yourself accountable for goals and commitments. To be consistent, work on recognizing when you don't reach your set standards and goals. In these moments, consider whether your goals are realistic—and if they are, ask yourself what you can do to improve. Don’t beat yourself up when you don’t hit the mark; just find a new approach to work with. [12] X Research source On your schedule or calendar, check off tasks as you complete them. This will give you a sense of satisfaction and help you realize what you can realistically do in a day. Ask a friend, family member, mentor, or coworker to be your accountability partner. Have them check in once a week to see what your progress is like. Give them permission to call you out if they see you’re being inconsistent."

    {
      "title": "Give yourself time to see changes in your consistency.",
      "content": "Give yourself time to see changes in your consistency. When you try to establish new habits, it’s essential to understand that it’ll take time. Instead of uprooting your life with several new practices at once, allow yourself time to figure out what works and be realistic with what you can expect to see over time. Don’t get impatient if there isn’t an immediate change! [13] X Research source It usually takes 3 weeks of consistently doing something to make a new habit. Every three weeks, set a small goal to attain in that time period. Don’t tackle too much. Start with small rituals and build your way up."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set boundaries for your commitments and personal relationships.",
      "content": "Set boundaries for your commitments and personal relationships. Boundaries make it easier to keep commitments because they give you specific limits within which to work. Before taking on new tasks or promises, establish what you’re willing and able to do as well as what you know you realistically can’t do. [14] X Research source For example, you might establish that you won’t take phone calls during a family dinner. Tell your boss, coworkers, and friends that this time is off limits. Put your phone in another room during dinner. You can also establish quality markers for yourself. For example, you might tell yourself that you’ll check your work twice before submitting it to your boss. Give yourself extra time to do this so you achieve consistent quality."

      "title": "Consistency means having a regular and reliable pattern of behavior.",
      "content": "Consistency means having a regular and reliable pattern of behavior. Beyond that, consistency can take many different forms—but in general, it can mean setting routines, following through on goals, commitments, and promises, developing habits, and doing certain things on a regular basis. Consistency can also help bring stability and progress to your life as you work on those goals and routines. [15] X Research source For example, going on daily walks is a form of consistent exercise. Similarly, taking out the trash or cleaning up around the house weekly means you’re consistently doing chores."

    {
      "title": "You might be focused on the end result and not the work involved.",
      "content": "You might be focused on the end result and not the work involved. While it can help to envision the outcome of your goal and how it’ll benefit you, be careful not to get too caught up in it. When you’re only thinking about the end results, you may get impatient, losing motivation for the work needed to achieve those results. Remember that the journey matters as much as the destination. For example, if you want to write a novel but keep focusing on finishing it (rather than planning out milestones and coming up with strategies to reach them), you might lose steam partway through the project."

    {
      "title": "You might be setting unreasonable goals for yourself.",
      "content": "You might be setting unreasonable goals for yourself. When a goal is unnecessarily difficult or complicated (or you don’t break it up into smaller goals), being unable to accomplish it might make you feel like you can’t be consistent. However, that’s not the case; in reality, the problem might be that you weren’t setting goals you could reasonably achieve. That’s why it’s important to be specific and consider every aspect of your goal: what you want to do, how you’re going to do it, and how much time you have to do it."
    },
    {
      "title": "You might be dealing with mental exhaustion or worry.",
      "content": "You might be dealing with mental exhaustion or worry. Spending all your time worrying about being inconsistent or unable to accomplish your goals can interfere with your ability to actually get things done. Similarly, if you don’t give yourself breaks and free time in between work, you may get so fatigued that you won’t feel motivated to be consistent anymore."
    },
    {
      "title": "You might be relying too much on external motivations.",
      "content": "You might be relying too much on external motivations. If your aim to be more consistent is based on a challenge from someone else, or all your motivation comes from an accountability partner in charge of checking up on you, it might be harder to keep up with your goals. You have to feel motivated internally, too, to keep yourself going even when life gets in the way! However, it’s also totally reasonable if there are actual external situations that arise and keep you from being consistent for a little while. For example, you shouldn’t expect yourself to stay perfectly consistent after getting sick or while dealing with a loss in the family; what matters is your ability to start up again after you’ve dealt with an obstacle."
