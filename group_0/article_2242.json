Remind yourself that you are in control. You are in control of how much you let another person’s feelings and thoughts affect you.

Research suggests that optimism may increase mental toughness. [4] X Research source This means that your own optimistic outlook can help you combat pessimism and the spill-over from negativity. If you find yourself feeling down around the pessimist, make a mental list (or even write it down if you wish) of five good things in your life.

Spending more time around optimists will help raise your mood and reassure you that your state of mind is the right one for you."

      "content": "Focus on the person’s good qualities. The individual’s outlook on things isn't her only feature - there are many more complex qualities within a person, so rather than fixating on the negatives, look for the good things. Is she intelligent? Supportive of you? Is she unique enough not to care what anyone else thinks about her? Is she good to work with? Focus on the positive aspects of a person and seek to balance out the negatives. Just as you might make a list of the five positive things in your life, try to make a list of at least three positive things about your pessimist and run these through your mind when dealing with this person gets tough. You can also draw on this list to remind the pessimist of what she is good at, in case it seems she has forgotten. Find compassion for the pessimist in your life by remembering that her pessimism might be rooted in unhappiness or low-self esteem. When you hear negativity, remind yourself that she may be going through something very difficult that is contributing to her pessimism."

This is a kind, yet subtle, way to highlight the thing she is being negative about - by focusing on it directly and expressing sympathy for her worry, and pain. Be understanding and supportive without validating the negativity. For example, tell a pessimist who is disinclined join you in an activity that she can go home/not come, while you go ahead and do it anyway. Say something like, \"I'm sorry this is hard on you. Go ahead and do whatever it is you need to feel better (go home/not come/stay here/do the easier task, etc.).\""
