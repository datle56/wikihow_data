An LLC's operating agreement includes details about the roles and responsibilities of members, how decisions are made, how profits and losses are allocated, and how the business's structure can be changed. [1] X Research source If your LLC has an operating agreement, it should have a clause dealing with changes in membership. If it does, you'll need to follow this procedure to add a member. If you don't have an operating agreement, you should consider hiring an attorney to draft one for you. If you'd rather draft the document on your own, many states have fill-in-the-blank forms that you can tailor to fit the needs of your LLC. [2] X Research source"

If you don't have an operating agreement, the law of the state where you registered your LLC has default rules that outline the proper procedure for adding a new member, and the documents that must be amended or filed by law. For example, in Arizona an LLC can add a new member only if all members consent and if the new member is identified as a member in a written statement signed by all members identified in the original Articles of Organization.

      "content": "Meet with the other members. If you have a multi-member LLC, schedule a meeting with your partners to discuss the potential new member before you hold a vote. At the meeting, you'll want to demonstrate the qualifications, financial resources, and general business experience of the potential new member. The other members may want to interview the member candidate, if they don't already know her, and ask her questions. After the interview, they probably will want to discuss and debate the advantages and disadvantages of bringing a new member on board. The existing members need to agree on the new member's capital interest, as well as how this effects the value of the capital investments made by the existing members. If the capital interests of existing members aren't updated when a new member is added, the new member could receive a disproportionate amount should the business be dissolved. [4] X Research source"

At a minimum, you will need to update the sections that cover the percentage interests of each member in the company, their capital contributions, the allocation of profits and losses, and voting power of all members. [7] X Research source Since a new member acquires an interest in the company, the interests of existing members in profits, losses, and distributions will automatically be affected.

[9] X Research source Your state law will have a deadline for any amendment to be filed following the event that prompted the amendment. For example, in Arizona you have 30 days from the day you add the new member to file your amendment with the state.

If you were required to amend your articles of organization, you must file the amendment with the Secretary of State or other agency in charge of business filings in your state. Since operating agreements don't have to be filed with the state, you can amend the agreement without filing anything. However, some states give you the option to file your operating agreement. If you took advantage of this option, you should file your amendment as well. [14] X Research source Check with your secretary of state's office to find out if you can file the amendments online or if you are required to file paper forms.
