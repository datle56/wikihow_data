Decide what you’ll serve. Are you having a full dinner or just drinks and appetizers? Think of who’s coming and consider what they might like. Are your guests more carnivores? Vegetarians? If you know your guests’ preferences, use that knowledge. Consider the climate when planning your party . If it’s cold, warm dips and hot bread can be a relatively simple path. If your birthday falls in the warmer months (or if you live in a hotter region) cool drinks, fruits, and cold dips are great.

When things don’t go exactly as you planned, go with it—it’s your birthday, and, well, you can cry if you want to, but there’s really no need. Everyone will have a good time if the host or guest of honor is relaxed and enjoying themselves, so that’s all you need to worry about. Things not going according to plan often makes for a great story.
