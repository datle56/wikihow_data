      "title": "Remove movable items from the floor being buffed.",
      "content": "Remove movable items from the floor being buffed. Place these items in a separate room or hallway. Moving these items allows you to buff the area under and around them. Otherwise, it will be very difficult for you to get an even shine. Keep in mind that a buffer is a bulky machine that can easily damage items that it bumps into, and it'll be harder for you to buff the area around the items in the room if you don’t remove them."

      "content": "Block off the area to prevent people from slipping on the wet floor. This will also help protect your freshly buffed floor from getting dirty while you’re still working. Tell other people living in your home or those who are in your place of business that the floor will be wet for the next several hours. [1] X Research source If you moved large items from the room, you can always use these as a blockade to help keep people out. Simply position them along the entrance to the room. If you’re cleaning a commercial floor, put up “Caution” or “Wet Floor” signs for added safety."

      "title": "Place your pets in a safe location if you’re buffing the floor of a home.",
      "content": "Place your pets in a safe location if you’re buffing the floor of a home. Pets can get in the way of the buffer and may dirty your floor. You don’t want to accidentally buff pet fur into your floor, as you won’t be able to remove it once it’s buffed into the finish. Put your pets in a separate room and shut the door. Alternatively, you can place your pets in their kennel if they already use one. Your pets will likely be afraid of the buffer, so keeping them out of the way will save them a lot of stress!"

      "title": "Use a broom or dust mop to remove any debris.",
      "content": "Use a broom or dust mop to remove any debris. Start in the corner of the room and slowly sweep the entire room. Make sure you get the floor as clean as possible. Otherwise, you risk buffing dirt into the finish. [2] X Research source Over time, buffing a dirty floor can permanently alter the color of your floor finish, turning it a dingy yellow color. You can also use a vacuum to suck up the dirt you swept. Use a vacuum attachment meant for your type of flooring."

      "title": "Wash the floor with a wet mop to ensure it’s completely clean.",
      "content": "Wash the floor with a wet mop to ensure it’s completely clean. For best results, dip the mop into a bucket of soapy warm water. Then, start in the corner of the room and slowly work your way back toward the entrance. As you mop, make short, even strokes to clean the floor. [3] X Research source Rinse your mop when it starts to look dirty. Use a floor cleaner that’s formulated for the type of flooring in your home."

      "title": "Allow the floor to dry for 2 hours or use a fan to dry it faster.",
      "content": "Allow the floor to dry for 2 hours or use a fan to dry it faster. Touch the floor to make sure it's dry before you move on to buffing. Don’t try to buff a wet floor because you will be applying a buffing solution, which is also a liquid. If the floor is already wet, there will be too much liquid, which will make you need to change your buffing pad more often. [4] X Research source Turning on a fan will help you dry the floor more quickly. A ceiling fan or box fan will work best."

      "content": "Work in 3 ft (0.91 m) by 3 ft (0.91 m) sections until you finish buffing. Focusing on small sections will help you achieve better results. Plus, it will keep you from getting overwhelmed during the process. If you don't like the results of your first few sections, you might decide to stop hand buffing the floor and switch to a machine. Some floors won't show much improvement from hand buffing. Depending on the size of your room, it can take a while to finish buffing. It's a good idea to take regular breaks, if necessary."

    {
      "title": "Spray a buffing solution onto your floor for extra shine.",
      "content": "Spray a buffing solution onto your floor for extra shine. When you're buffing by hand, spray the solution onto just the area where you're working so the solution won't be dry by the time you get across the room. It's best to use a bottle with a spray nozzle to evenly distribute the solution. If your solution doesn't have a spray nozzle, use a clean cloth to wipe it onto the floor. Make sure you choose a buffing solution that's formulated for your type of flooring material. If you prefer a natural option, create a white vinegar solution by adding 1 cup (240 mL) of white vinegar to 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Put the solution into a spray bottle, then spritz it onto your floor."

      "title": "Use a microfiber cloth to buff the floor using tight, circular motions.",
      "content": "Use a microfiber cloth to buff the floor using tight, circular motions. Move your cloth slowly from side to side as you work each section. When you complete each pass, start the next one with some overlap with the previous pass. As you buff, apply as much pressure to the cloth as you can. The microfiber cloth shouldn't damage your floor, no matter what material it is. Keep in mind that buffing a floor typically requires a lot of pressure, so you may not see much difference if you don't press down very hard."

      "title": "Spray the buffing solution onto your floor, if you’re using it.",
      "content": "Spray the buffing solution onto your floor, if you’re using it. For best results, use a professional sprayer or a product that comes with a spray nozzle. Start in the far corner of the room and work your way toward the other side. Aim the spray 2–4 ft (61–122 cm) in front of the buffer in an area that’s about 6–8 in (15–20 cm) wide. [5] X Research source Use a buffing solution formulated for the type of floor material you have, such as wood, tile, or vinyl. If you don’t have a sprayer, you can use a mop to apply the solution. However, it won’t be as effective at distributing it. You can buy or rent a sprayer from most home improvement stores. Additionally, some buffing solutions come in a spray bottle."

      "title": "Attach a red buffing pad if you're spray buffing your floor.",
      "content": "Attach a red buffing pad if you're spray buffing your floor. This pad is intended for use on a wet floor, so it will soak up some of the buffing solution. Follow the instructions for your buffer to attach it correctly. [6] X Research source Be sure to read all of the instructions that come with your buffer. It’s best to have an extra pad handy if you’re going to be buffing a large surface area. Although you’ll be able to use both sides of the pad, it can get clogged up or dirty as you work. If you’re spray buffing your floor, you’ll need both a red pad and a gray or beige pad, for best results. Your floor will look better if you do a dry buffing after your spray buffing."

Not only does it ensure the buffer covers all of the surface area, but it will also help you really work areas where there are scratches or scuffs. [8] X Research source Your motion should swing back and forth like a pendulum."

      "content": "Move backward as you work so you don’t step on the buffed sections. This helps you avoid stepping on the parts of the floor you’ve already buffed. You don’t want to step on the buffed areas because they will be very slippery. Also, you don’t want to mess up the finish. Walk slowly so you don’t accidentally trip over your own feet."

      "content": "Hold the buffer over scratches and scuffs for a few extra seconds. As you work, look for visible scratches and buffs. It’s okay to give these areas special attention by holding the buffer over them for a few extra seconds. Additionally, you can make several passes over them. If you still notice a scratch or scuff after you finish, you can try hand rubbing it with a soft cloth soaked in buffing solution."

      "content": "Flip or change the buffing pad if it gets clogged or dirty. Stop and check the buffing pad every few minutes to see if it looks dirty or clogged. Additionally, you’ll know the pad needs to be changed if the floor isn’t getting as shiny as it was previously. [9] X Research source Most buffing pads can be flipped once during cleaning. If your pad looks soaked through, just switch to a new one."

Slowly work your way toward the other side of the room. Your buffing pad likely won’t need changing on this pass. However, continue to check on it regularly to make sure it’s not clogged or dirty. It’s best to wait until your floor is dry before you start your dry buffing. You may want to apply a finish to the floor to reduce slipperiness and increase the shine."

      "content": "Use a clean dust mop to remove any dust created by the buffing process. Once your floor is dry, return to the corner of the room and begin making short, even passes with your dust mop. Continue working your way over the entire surface of the floor until you reach the other side of the room. This helps get your floor as clean and shiny as possible. [10] X Research source Using a floor buffer can stir dust up into the air, which will then fall back down onto your freshly buffed floor. A clean dust mop can remove this debris."
