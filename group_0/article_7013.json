These types of apps are great if you prefer having one-on-one conversations but don’t have anyone to talk to at the moment. Decide if you want to talk via text or video app, then let the app match you with someone else who’s ready to talk. For example, you might try Chatroulette, Omegle, Telegram, Yahoo! Chat, Tinychat, and Spinchat. Be careful when using these apps, especially if you’re open to video chatting. Some people have bad intentions and may use the app to share graphic images."

What instruments do you play? Which team sports have you played? Do you prefer the forest, mountains, or the ocean? Have you ever had a job? Where do you hope to travel to some day?

Limit your questions and comments to the other person's interests. Additionally, continue conversations started by the other person. [7] X Research source If you're in a chat room, stick to the chat room's theme or target audience. For instance, if the chat room is intended for music lovers, only ask questions that are related to music.

Capitalize the first word of a sentence and proper pronouns. However, never capitalize all of a post because people will read it like you’re shouting, which is considered rude. [11] X Research source For example, “I came here to make friends,” sounds like a nice invitation for people to talk to you.

For instance, you might not message them during their workday if they're not allowed to use their phone. Only message them when you know they're open to chatting. Talk to the person you're chatting with to find out their personal preferences. You might say, \"Let me know if you have any chat preferences, like when we can exchange messages. I don't want to accidentally message you at a bad time.\" You don't need to worry about this when you're using a chat room. Just talk to the other people who are in the chat room when you're online."

Unfortunately, some people use online chat apps and chat rooms to trick and scam people. Protect yourself by keeping your true identity secret. Never share any details that someone could use to figure out who you are. [15] X Research source For instance, don’t share your full name, birth date, city, address, school information, age, height, weight, phone number, or details about your family structure.

This person could try to find out where you are so they can come find you. Make sure you don’t share anything that has your location or where you’ll be at a later time. Additionally, use your privacy settings to turn off location services so an app can’t automatically ping your location. [16] X Research source For instance, don’t tag your location in a photo or post a photo of you in front of something that will show where you are. Similarly, don’t say things like, “I’m about to go get tacos from the food truck on Main St., or I’m getting ready to go roller skating tonight.”"

Although this can be harmless, some people may use a fake persona to try to harm you. Keep in mind that people you meet online may not be who they say they are. Question what people tell you and use caution when opening up to someone who seems like a good confidant. [17] X Research source For example, an adult may pose as a teen to talk to younger people. You might feel like you’ve met someone who has a lot in common with you, but in reality someone could be tricking you.

However, you may get to the point that you feel ready to meet someone who has become a good friend. If this is the case, play it safe by doing the following: [18] X Research source Video chat before meeting them in person so you know they’re really who they say they are. Choose a well-lit, busy public place for your meeting. Tell family and friends you’re meeting someone you met online. Bring a trusted family member or friend with you."
