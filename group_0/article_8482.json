      "content": "Clamping the belt in an extended position will make it easier to clean thoroughly. Firmly pull the seat belt toward you until it’s stiff and no longer has any give. Follow the belt strap upwards and locate the reel (where the majority of the belt is stored when not in use). Place a metal clamp right next to the reel and fasten it to the belt. [1] X Research source You can find metal clamps at most hardware stores. As you pull, keep an eye out for any mold spores or noticeable stains on the belt."

      "content": "An all-purpose cleaner or fabric cleaner is safe to use on a seat belt. “Spray your cleaning solution straight onto the seatbelt” to create a light, even coating, says auto detailing expert Chad Zani. [2] X Expert Source Chad Zani Auto Detailing Expert Expert Interview. 2 October 2019. Cover the front-facing fabric as well as the underside of the belt. These cleaners can be found at any general store or hardware store and usually come in spray bottles. A mixture of equal parts of a gentle, neutral pH detergent such as Dawn dish soap or a baby wash and water can be used as a cleaner instead. Don’t use bleach to clean a dirty seat belt. The bleach will weaken your seat belts, and it doesn’t do anything to prevent mold growth."

      "content": "The stiff bristles will effectively remove hardened dirt and stains. Start at the top of the belt and move downwards. Move the stiff-bristle brush back and forth over the belt in the same directions that the fibers are facing. Don’t move the brush in circles or move upward along the belt. [3] X Research source Scrub gently—too much force over time may degrade the fabric of the seat belt."

      "title": "A more potent solution may be needed to clean stained seat belts.",
      "content": "A more potent solution may be needed to clean stained seat belts. Fill a container with 1 cup (240 mL) of warm water. Add 3 cups (710 mL) all-purpose cleaner, fabric cleaner, or gentle dish soap. Pour the solution into an empty spray bottle and spritz it onto any stains. [4] X Research source Gently scrub the stains with a stiff-bristle brush . Use straight strokes rather than circular scrubbing motions. If you have a steam machine , this device is actually the most effective way to clean really stubborn stains. Once you’ve added a coating of fabric cleaner or upholstery shampoo, run the machine over the belt on a low moisture setting."

      "content": "Baking soda helps to remove mold, mildew, and funky smells. Mix 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) baking soda with 1 cup (240 mL) warm water. Alternatively, combine one tablespoon (15 mL) of a non-bleach dish soap into a cup (240 mL) of warm water and add two tablespoons (30 mL) of vinegar. Stir your mixture well until all the components are well-mixed. [5] X Research source Dip a soft-bristled scrub brush or unused toothbrush into the solution. Gently scrub the seatbelt with the brush, moving downwards from the top of the belt. Don’t move the brush in circles or go back upwards. Continue until the seat belt fabric has a thin, even coating of cleaning solution covering it. For recurrent mold issues, spray on a mold preventative such as Concrobium Mold Control or Mold Armor while the belt is still damp."

      "content": "Microfiber towels won’t add any extra moisture that may damage the belt. Wrap the towel around the belt and gently move the towel up and down. Squeeze gently to remove excess moisture. Zani specifically recommends microfiber towels because they’re gentle and less likely to fray your seatbelt.

      "content": "The belt must dry completely before being retracted. Leave the belt alone at least overnight (with the metal clamp still fastened). If it’s not completely dry the next day, leave it for longer. If you unclamp the seat belt too early, it’ll create an ample breeding ground for mold and nasty odors inside the reel.
