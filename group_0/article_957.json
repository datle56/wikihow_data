      "content": "Import text if your document does not already contain it. Create a text frame with your Text tool, which is located in your Tools palette. Click within your newly created text frame, with your Text tool still created, and begin typing your text. To import text directly from a pre-existing word processing document, select File>Place, navigate to the file you wish to import and double click the file name. A loaded cursor will appear. Move your mouse to the location where you want your text to appear and click to place the text. If you are importing a large amount of text, you may need to thread it across multiple text frames. Do this by clicking the red plus sign in the bottom right-hand corner of your text frame, navigating to the new page or column where you want to place your text and clicking your mouse. Repeat this step until all your text is placed."

The Character panel is located at the right-hand side of your workspace. If you have applied vertical justification to your text or set it to align to the baseline grid (bottom of your text frame), InDesign may not accept your leading adjustments. If this happens, turn off vertical justification and baseline grid alignment and re-adjust your leading."
