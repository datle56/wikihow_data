Some keys to good negotiation include: [10] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source [11] X Research source Research the car you want before you begin negotiating. After you have completed your shopping and you believe you have found the car you want, research it thoroughly. Using online sources like KellyBlueBook.com or Edmunds.com, you can look up the values of both new and used cars. These will give you a starting place for your negotiating. Have a target price in mind. Before you begin the process, you should know what you want to pay, and then a higher amount that you might be willing to pay. Use leverage to your advantage. When you are negotiating a price for a car, let the salesman believe that you are willing to walk away and go buy a different car from someone else. If they know they might lose your business, they may be willing to lower the price. Focus on the car’s price, not the monthly payments. Many car salesmen will try negotiating the price in terms of monthly payments, rather than the total. If you do this, you run the risk of adding thousands of dollars to the price without really noticing it. Keep the conversation focused on the total price.
