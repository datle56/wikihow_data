      "content": "42 is the meaning of life in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy . The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a comedy science fiction book and pop culture franchise created by Douglas Adams. In Chapter 27 of the book, a supercomputer called Deep Thought answers \"the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything\" with \"42\" after pondering it for millions of years. After giving its answer, however, Deep Thought designed the Earth as a new computer that would eventually figure out what the Ultimate Question was."

      "content": "Douglas Adams didn't reveal why 42 is the answer to life in his books. Adams never revealed the significance of 42 to anyone before he died in 2001 except one person: actor Stephen Fry, who says he'll take the secret to his grave. [1] X Research source However, many fans speculate Adams chose the number (at least subconsciously) because of his experience as a computer programmer. In the ASCII computer programming language, the number 42 is code for an asterisk (*). An asterisk is sometimes called a wildcard in programming because it can stand for anything the programmer wants. According to this theory, the reason the number 42 is the meaning of life is it's whatever you want it to be . 42 could also refer to page 42 the 1971 edition of Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe by Ken Welsh, which Adams took inspiration from. On that page, the book remarks how people traveling to the United Kingdom to search for their ancestral roots found \"the answer a little disappointing.\" [2] X Research source Adams echoes the above statement in his book when the supercomputer Deep Thought tells the two men asking him for the answer to the meaning of life, \"You're really not going to like it.\""

      "content": "Some fans theorize it’s a base 13 joke—but Adams denied this. A base system is a system for counting and calculating numbers. In base 13, 6 x 9 = 42. [3] X Research source While the true significance of 42 as the meaning of life is unknown, Adams shut down many popular theories, including one suggesting he was using the 13 base system in mathematics in a joking way. In the sequel to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy – called The Restaurant at the End of the Universe – the main character, Arthur Dent, tries to trick his subconscious into revealing the Ultimate Question that 42 supposedly answers. In doing so, he writes, \"What do you get when you multiply six by nine?\" But according to Adams, this was a coincidence!"

These letters are encoded in the first 42 words of Genesis which describe the creation of the universe, as well as in many Jewish prayers such as the Ana beKho'ah. [6] X Research source Many Kabbalists view these 42 letters as the spiritual sequence God used to create the universe. [7] X Research source 42 is also the number of locations the Israelites camped in the wilderness after their escape from Egypt in the Book of Exodus. In this context, 42 might symbolize the spiritual journey human beings take throughout their lives to draw closer to God."

When a ray of light passes through a raindrop, it gets reflected and then refracted (or bent) off the raindrop's circular walls. The angle it bends is 42 degrees. During this process, the white light from the sun separates into its individual wavelengths, creating the bands of color in the rainbow. Sun rays must enter the raindrops at an angle of 42 degrees or lower above the horizon to make a rainbow. [11] X Research source"
