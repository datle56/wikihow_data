      "content": "Add garlic and/or lemon juice for extra flavor. If you’re a fan of garlic, consider adding some coarsely chopped garlic cloves to the mixture. If you want your potatoes to have a little savory tartness, add some lemon juice. Stir the potatoes well so that the flavors will be evenly dispersed. [3] X Research source You can use bottled lemon juice, but it will taste better if you squeeze it fresh. Just be sure to strain out the lemon seeds before adding the juice to your potatoes."

      "content": "Preheat the oven to 400 °F (204 °C). If your oven does not have a Preheat feature that alerts you when it reaches temperature, check to see if it has a thermometer inside that will indicate when it’s hot enough. Otherwise, put the potatoes in whenever they’re ready -- they may just take a little longer to roast."

      "content": "Spread the potatoes evenly in a 13 in × 9 in (33 cm × 23 cm) baking pan. Ideally, you should use a baking dish with raised sides, as it will make it easier to stir the potatoes without knocking them over the edge. However, a flat cookie sheet will work fine too -- just be careful when you stir them. It’s okay if your pan isn’t exactly 13 in × 9 in (33 cm × 23 cm), but make sure there’s enough room to spread your potatoes evenly on the bottom with some space between. This will keep them from getting over-steamed and soggy. [4] X Research source"
