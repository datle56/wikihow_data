      "content": "Do a test patch on a small spot before you apply the bleach all over. Read the box, and mix a small amount based on the particular ratios of bleach and activator product. Apply the bleach to a 1 in × 1 in (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm) section of your body, such as your inner arm. After about 7-10 minutes, remove the product with water. If there is no redness or irritation after 24 hours, you can use the bleach kit safely. [1] X Research source If you notice any redness or irritation after using the bleach, do not use this to bleach your body hair. If the reaction does not go away within 1-2 days, see your doctor."

      "content": "Mix the bleaching ingredients based on your particular instructions. Read over your instructions to ensure you mix the products correctly. Typically, there is a powder bleach container, a jar or cream activator, and a mixing tool in at-home bleach kits. Use the included mixing tool to scoop up the products, and put them in a small dish. Most kits call for 1 spatula of powder bleach and 2 scoops of cream activator. If you mix the bleach incorrectly, you may wind up damaging your skin. As you do this, be careful not to get the bleach on your skin. If you do, rinse it off completely."

      "content": "Apply a solid, even layer of bleach to your intended area. Once your bleach is mixed up, use the mixing tool to scoop up the product, and spread it across the area you want to bleach. You can bleach your arms, legs, or upper lip, for instance. Ensure all of your hairs are fully covered so they lighten evenly. As you spread the bleach, avoid rubbing it back and forth into your skin. If you notice any empty spots after you first apply the bleach, go back in and fill them in with more product."

      "content": "Let the bleach process for 5-10 minutes. Set a timer for 5-10 minutes, as directed in your particular instructions. Some kits require more or less time to process the bleach. If your hair is light brown or blonde, you may not need quite as much time to process the hair. If your hair is very dark, you may need the full processing time. Do not leave the bleach on longer than indicated in the directions—it could lead to chemical burns. [3] X Expert Source Karina Villalta Certified Esthetician Expert Interview. 11 August 2020."
