Like using Incognito and deleting cookies , masking your IP address usually only works for soft paywalls—the sites that let you read a few articles before charging you for a subscription. Here are some easy ways to hide your IP address: The Opera web browser for Windows, macOS, and Android comes with a built-in VPN that you can use to mask your IP address. [5] X Research source You can get Opera from https://www.opera.com/download or from the Play Store . Get a VPN. The best VPN options cost money, but they come with other benefits—including keeping your computer and network secure while you browse the web. If you don't want to pay for a VPN, you can use a free web proxy instead. While a free proxy will usually slow down your browsing, it'll be helpful if you just want to view a few free articles. The Tor web browser is another browser with a built-in feature that masks your IP address. You can get Tor for Windows, macOS, and Android from https://www.torproject.org/download ."
