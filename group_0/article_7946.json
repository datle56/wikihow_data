      "content": "Verify the metal is copper and check for the presence of lacquer. Position a magnet close to the copper—if it sticks to the metal, the item you are cleaning is copper-plated. If the magnet doesn't react, your item is likely copper. To check if the surface has been lacquered, dap a little white vinegar and baking soda on an unseen area. [1] X Research source If the metal cleans after rubbing the baking soda and vinegar on it, then there is no lacquer on the surface—clean it using the other methods. [2] X Research source If it is lacquered, follow these steps. Lacquer is frequently applied to copper to prevent tarnish. However, this can crack and cause copper to tarnish unevenly. [3] X Research source Pure copper can be cleaned with the other methods below, while plated copper is cleaned best with regular dish soap and warm water."

To remove tarnish from copper plate or lacquered copper, mix together 3 parts flour, 1 part white distilled vinegar, and 1 part salt. Apply the paste to the oxidized area and let it sit for 10 minutes. Using a new microfiber cloth, polish the copper until it shines. [5] X Research source Use a soft toothbrush or cotton swab to polish hard-to-reach areas in the copper. To remove the excess paste, rinse the area with water and buff it with a new clean cloth."

      "content": "Remove lacquer by boiling copper in baking soda if desired. To get that iconic shiny copper look, you’ll need to remove the lacquer on top. Add water to a large pot until there is enough to completely submerge the copper item. For each 1 US qt (950 mL) of water, add 1 tbsp (17 g) baking soda. [6] X Research source Boil the solution and place the item in for 30 minutes. Cracked or damaged lacquer can also cause the copper to age unevenly, making it oxidize in odd places. Some people prefer to remove it so they can clean the surface evenly. Large items can be boiled in sections. It may be easiest to use a lacquer remover or acetone to remove lacquer from very large items. Use a pair of tongs, ladle, or spoon to remove copper from the water. Place it on a wooden cutting board or towel until cool."

      "content": "Rub a mixture of salt and vinegar on the oxidized area with a cloth. Mix 1 tbsp (18 g) table salt with 1 c (240 mL) white vinegar and scoop up the mixture with a soft cloth. Rub the cloth over the tarnished area in the direction of the grain until it comes clean. Once you’re done, rinse the item with water and dry it completely. [7] X Research source Alternatively, submerge the item in a pot with water and the salt and vinegar mixture. Bring it to a boil and let the item sit until the tarnish comes off. Wash it with soap and water, then dry. The salt acts as a natural abrasive, stripping away the tarnished layer. If the oxidation sticks around, repeat this method or try a different approach in this article."

Rinse [the area] with water, [and] dry with microfiber cloth for extra shine.” [8] X Expert Source Alicia Sokolowski Green Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. To remove heavier oxidation, leave the paste on for up to an hour. Alternatively, combine baking soda with lemon juice or sprinkle the baking soda alone on the copper surface. [9] X Research source When polishing the copper , try to follow the grain (direction) of the metal. Use brisk motions when polishing. If oxidation remains after removing the paste, repeat this step again until it’s gone or try another method."

[21] X Research source These items probably don’t need to be cleaned using the methods above until they start to get a green or brown patina (about every 8 months or so). Try to avoid putting copper utensils, pans, or pots in the dishwasher—this can cause tarnishing."

[28] X Research source However, it may crack over time, leading to uneven tarnishing. Find a food-safe (or non food-safe) lacquer and apply it according to the directions. Only apply lacquer to copper that's been well cleaned and polished. Once the lacquer is applied, any remaining oxidation or dirtiness will be preserved under the lacquer. Many copper lacquers have spray applicators. Spray an even layer of lacquer onto all copper surfaces. Be careful when drying lacquer; paper or fuzz may stick to the lacquer."
