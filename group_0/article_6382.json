      "content": "Check the basement for something resembling a metal pole. Instead of erecting a tree or displaying a menorah in your home, find a metal pole and place it in a corner of the living room. Festivus is all about low maintenance, so it’s ideal to rummage through your basement, attic, or garage for the metal pole, or for something else such as a tall lamp, that can act as a festivus pole. If you want to buy a Festivus pole, you can purchase one online. You can also make your own Festivus pole. Head to a local hardware store, buy an aluminum pole and supplies to make a stand, and put it together at home in your workshop space."
