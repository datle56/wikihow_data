While many book clubs are shaped around a specific theme or author, more and more clubs are taking a stand against censorship by reading banned books.

Reading the book as closely as you can will help you be more knowledgeable and able to host a discussion. Pay attention to particular themes or ideas that come up in the book, and note anything interesting about the plot or characters or writing. Highlight your favorite passages and take notes on topics you want to bring up at the meeting. Consider doing some background research on the book and its author in order to be able to better contextualize what you've read. Don't feel like you need to be a total expert.

Acceptance: Suspend judgment towards other perspectives. Curiosity: Seek to understand rather than to persuade. Discovery: Question your assumptions and looking for new insights.

Having everyone share what they thought and how they felt about the book is a good way to warm up and get everyone in the right headspace.

Maybe you've got a specific discussion question you'd like to begin with, or maybe after hearing everyone's impressions of the book, you'd rather ask a different question. Once you've asked the first question, pace yourself before asking anymore: instead, dwell on the same topic as long as you can so that the group can thoroughly explore each idea.

Don't be afraid to use what other group members say to guide the discussion, even if it feels like you're going against the questions you had planned.
