      "content": "The 3-2-1 method is a system for structuring weekly workouts. It’s super simple: the 3-2-1 method involves 3 days of strength training, 2 days of Pilates, and 1 day of cardio exercise—six days total. Then, the seventh day of the routine is a rest day with no workouts needed, and after that, the schedule begins again. [1] X Research source That’s the entire method—there are no requirements about which specific exercises you need to do, how intense they should be, or how long to make your workouts. That’s for you to decide! The 3-2-1 method went viral on TikTok as a new fitness trend. While many social media health trends aren’t actually very healthy, the 3-2-1 method has gained some support for being an effective workout plan!"

      "content": "TikTok features many variations on the 3-2-1 method as well. People who try the 3-2-1 method are absolutely encouraged to tweak it based on their personal preference, skill level, and workout goals. For example, you could adjust the ratio, doing three days of Pilates and two days of strength training, or switch around Pilates and cardio—it’s your call. You could also swap out Pilates for sculpt or barre—something that’s also low-impact and works similar parts of your body."

      "content": "Organize your 3-2-1 workouts so you’re doing 6 days of exercise per week. You can use this method at home, at the gym, or in any way that works for you. However, it’s a good idea to alternate your strength workouts with Pilates and cardio, so your muscles get some rest between strength training days. That way, you’ll be in the best condition possible for each strength day! [2] X Research source Here are a couple of example schedules to try: Example 1: Pilates (day 1), strength (day 2), cardio (day 3), strength (day 4), Pilates (day 5), strength (day 6), rest (day 7). Example 2: Strength (day 1), Pilates (day 2), cardio (day 3), strength (day 4), Pilates (day 5), strength (day 6), rest (day 7). In each schedule above, strength workouts are padded with Pilates or cardio before and after—but you can rearrange these schedules however you like."

      "content": "Pilates exercises Pilates is a type of body conditioning that focuses on movement, controlled breathing, and core strengthening. The 3-2-1 method calls for two days of Pilates, and there are many Pilates exercises to add to your workout based on skill level and intensity. But, if you’re a beginner, here are a few pilates moves to consider: [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Deep breathing. Lay on your back with your knees bent, feet on the floor, and hands on your rib cage. Inhale through your nose, letting your rib cage rise, then exhale while letting your rib cage lower to the floor. Leg lifts. Lay on your back with your knees bent and feet spread apart. Lift one leg so that your knee and shin are parallel to the floor, then inhale and hold the position. Exhale and lift your second leg into the same position, then inhale again and count to 5. As you exhale, lower both feet to the floor. Toe taps. Lay on your back with your feet on the floor. Lift your knees into a 90-degree angle, then lower your feet until your toes tap the floor. Finally, raise your knees back into a 90-degree angle and return to the original position.

      "title": "Strength training exercises",
      "content": "Strength training exercises Strength training (or resistance training) is all about building up your muscle strength and endurance. According to fitness trainer Laila Ajani, that means doing exercises such as lunges, crunches , bench presses, and planks . Other strength training exercises include push-ups , pull-ups , squats , and deadlifts . Feel free to mix and match those exercises, or explore other forms of weight training ! If you’re struggling to stay motivated while strength training, Ajani suggests “switching yourself to barbell lifts and doing low-rep sets (like sets of 3 to 8) to give yourself a break and some variety, then building up to more.” She continues, “Every time you go to the gym, add a little bit more…you’ll know that you’re getting better. And that’s really motivating for people because even though the changes are small, you can see the progress.” And, if you’re doing strength exercises at home, trainer Katie Dunlop has a few other suggestions, such as resistance bands . “Resistance bands are a great way to up-level your workouts and add serious weight at home without needing to build a full home gym. I also love adjustable dumbbells to save space.”"

      "title": "Cardio exercises",
      "content": "Cardio exercises According to fitness trainer Jesse Pichardo, you don’t need gym access to have a great cardio workout. “I always recommend walking,” he says. “Walking doesn’t require a warm-up, it’s free, and you can do it until you’re 85 or 90 years old. It’s sustainable and low-impact, and you can adjust how long or briskly you walk.” So, if you need a quick cardio workout, a walk is likely your easiest option. If you want something other than a walk (or if you’re very out of shape), Pichardo recommends a recumbent bike. “It’s comfortable, especially if [you] find saddles on regular bikes uncomfortable,” he explains. He adds that you can also use a treadmill on a low setting or do some cycling to get your cardio exercise. Running is an option, although Pichardo cautions that it’s a weight-bearing exercise. “Weight-bearing exercises like running can aggravate knee or hip issues, so cycling, which isn’t weight-bearing, is a good alternative.” Of course, cardio can take many forms—even sports (like tennis, pickleball, soccer, and boxing) and games (like jumping rope)."

      "content": "It provides consistency. This can be super helpful, especially if you’re someone who struggles with making schedules—the 3-2-1 method has a schedule for you already! It adds structure to your week and helps you figure out exactly what type of workout you need to do, when to do it, and for how long. [4] X Research source Because it’s so structured and consistent, it’s also easy to sustain this schedule and keep the 3-2-1 workout going in your daily life. You’ll probably also notice that this workout regimen will get easier the longer you do it—and the more comfortable you get with it, the more you can adjust your workouts for intense exercise (if you want)."

That is to say, the 3-2-1 method doesn’t rely on a single type of exercise; it combines pilates (for posture, balance, and flexibility), strength (for building muscle mass and strength), and cardio (for cardiovascular health). Essentially, the 3-2-1 method is holistic and works out your whole body, not just part of it! [5] X Research source"

When you get bored of your workout routine, it’s easier to let workouts slide or avoid doing them altogether—but when you’re doing different exercises and training styles throughout the week, you can stay engaged and focused!

      "content": "It’s easy to fit into a busy schedule. Yes, the 3-2-1 method calls for six workouts per week—but they don’t have to be super long or even strenuous workouts every single time. Although there’s no specific requirement, an effective workout should generally be anywhere from 20 to 45 minutes long. That means you only need to spare 20 minutes for some exercise if you have a busy day! You can also adjust the length of your workouts based on the exercise style you prefer. So, if strength isn’t your favorite, you could do three 20-minute workouts. And, if you love low-impact cardio, you could take a longer 45-minute walk or jog on cardio day!"

There’s a designated rest day, of course—and by alternating different types of exercise (Pilates, strength, and cardio), your body can recover more easily even on non-rest days. For example, if you do an intense strength day and then a lower-impact Pilates day, your body will have some time to recover from the strength training (while still getting exercise).
