      "content": "Grab an automotive battery charger to recharge an old battery. If you want to charge a dead battery that has potentially been degraded for some time or jumping wasn’t successful, charging it may bring the battery back to life. All you need is a remote automotive battery charger (sometimes called a float charger.) [1] X Research source Charging with a battery charger, also known as trickle or float charging, is unique from jumping. While jumping provides a huge burst of power to restart a battery, float charging pumps the battery full of a slow and steady amount of the minimum necessary voltage (for a car battery, 6V or 12V) over a longer period of time. In theory, this will reload the battery without putting any pressure on it. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Select the 12-volt setting for traditional car batteries. If you’re charging a battery for a motorcycle, tractor, e-bike, or some other small motor, you’d use the 6-volt setting. Basically all modern car batteries are 12-volt, but read the label on top of the battery just to confirm. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Run the charger and wait 12-24 hours.",
      "content": "Run the charger and wait 12-24 hours. Refer to the float chargers manual to determine how you run a float charge (these chargers often jump, as well). Once you’re on the right setting, start the float charge. Let the battery charge for at least half a day. [5] X Research source There’s no real way to determine whether a float charge was successful or not, so the longer you wait, the more likely you’ll be to successfully charge the battery."

      "title": "Use the battery but dispose of it if it dies on you a second time.",
      "content": "Use the battery but dispose of it if it dies on you a second time. If the battery works, you’re good to go. However, if the battery loses voltage again in the next few trips, it’s a sign the battery is sulfated. This is a fancy way of saying it’s no longer capable of holding a charge, so it's time to discard and replace it. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Inspect the battery to make sure it isn’t leaking.",
      "content": "Inspect the battery to make sure it isn’t leaking. Your battery should be intact with no cracks, and should not visibly leak any battery acid. If it is leaking, you cannot safely jump or reuse your battery— replace it with a new battery . [7] X Research source Do not attempt to jump-start your car if your battery is oozing liquid, covered in leak stains, or misshapen, as you may cause injury to yourself or others if you do so. Wear safety goggles and rubber gloves. While you're there, confirm that the cables attached to your car's battery are secure and free of corrosion. If any of cables are loose, it could be the source of your battery woes. Tighten the loose cables with a wrench, if necessary. If your battery cables are corroded, clean them as best as possible using a brush with stiff bristles and some baking soda."

      "content": "Drive a functional car into position next to the dead car. Don’t let the vehicles touch one another. Ideal positions for this task are either placing the cars closely next to one another facing the same direction, or facing one another head-on, or nose-to-nose. [8] X Research source Verify that the distance between each car's battery is close enough for the jumper cables to connect the cars together. The length of jumper cables varies greatly depending on their style and manufacturer. Do not attempt to connect two different pairs of jumper cables together if your first pair isn’t long enough. This can melt the jumper cables and start a fire."

      "content": "Ground the remaining jumper cable. Maynes explains that you can use either the negative terminal of the dead battery, or attach the terminal to any unpainted metal on the chassis. “Generally, a good spot is like the top of the strut tower nut.” This will ground the car that contains the dead battery upon jump-starting. You can attach the ground cable to the frame, chassis, or another component that is reasonably clean and free of paint or oxidation. If you don’t ground the remaining cable, Maynes explains that it could cause a spike in the voltage that destroys your alternator."
