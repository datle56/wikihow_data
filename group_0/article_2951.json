      "title": "Listen attentively to your teacher.",
      "content": "Listen attentively to your teacher. This is the easy part and will lay the foundation for the way others view your behavior. When a teacher, principal, or other school official is speaking, be sure to listen carefully or they may cross-question you. Listen even if they're not speaking to you directly (for instance, at an assembly). A teacher's day is spent struggling to win the attention of kids who would rather talk to friends and be on their phones and such things during lessons. If you listen intently, they will notice you and begin to think of you as a good student. Avoid asking your teacher to re-explain things they've just explained in great detail just for fun or to gain their attention or else you may frustrate or anger them. Instead, wait for a moment when you can approach your teacher one-on-one and say something like, \"I'm sorry, I think I need a little more help understanding how to do this.\" If you have any such condition that makes it hard for you to concentrate, remember to take resolve it when you wake up in the morning (such as take a medicine if you are not feeling well) so that you'll pay attention during the lectures and lessons."

      "title": "Follow the teacher's directions.",
      "content": "Follow the teacher's directions. Teachers like to see that their students are treating them with respect. If you intently follow all of their directions, they may even give you special freedoms or privileges under the assumption that you're trustworthy. In addition to following their verbal directions, read your teacher's syllabus carefully and follow any special instructions you find. Many students forget to study their syllabuses - get one step further than them by paying extra attention. If, for instance, your teacher said not to enter the classroom before they arrive, but your classmates have gone in anyway, you should wait outside. If you're the only person to follow the rules exactly, you'll stand out in your teacher's mind as a good rule-follower. Some teachers like to give vague, cagey advice to see who listens and who doesn't. If they say something mysterious like, \"be sure to study this weekend,\" take note - they might be planning a pop quiz for Monday. You'll make an excellent impression if you are the only one prepared."

      "title": "Strive for good grades.",
      "content": "Strive for good grades. Everyone's academic strengths and weaknesses are different - don't worry if you can't get perfect grades or marks. It's much more important to show your teacher that you're trying your level best. Ask intelligent and sensible questions during class. If there's something you're having an especially hard time understanding, meet your teacher after class. Your willingness to seek help will show your teacher that you're taking their class seriously. A student who's clearly engaged in the material is more likely to be considered favorably when the teacher is assigning partial credit, tests, re-takes, etc. If you're struggling hard to comprehend any subject, don't be afraid to ask your teacher for a tutor recommendation. Seeking help when you need it is a sign of maturity which most teachers will admire and prefer."

    {
      "title": "Participate in the class.",
      "content": "Participate in the class. Many classes are discussion-centered. The lecture in these classes takes the form of a dialog between the teacher and the students. Try to answer questions your teacher asks the class. Even if you don't answer correctly, you'll show your teacher that you're engaged in the material. If you don't participate, the teacher may think you aren't listening or don't care about the material. Raise your hand when you have something to say in class. Never blurt out answers! Most teachers get irked when students answer without being called on."

    {
      "title": "Be quiet.",
      "content": "Be quiet. Don't talk to your friends or otherwise disrupt the class, especially if you're in your teacher's favouritism. Repeated disturbances can infuriate your teacher or even get you ejected from class. Respect your teacher. It should be fairly obvious when they want you to be quiet. If you're not sure, err on the side of quietness or try waiting for another student to talk first, then judge your teacher's reaction. If the teacher leaves the room, you might get away with talking a little. However, quiet down as soon as they return. Never talk if the teacher leaves during a test - other students might tell about you if you disturb them or try to cheat."

      "title": "Work towards a clean slate.",
      "content": "Work towards a clean slate. Not every student who reads this guide will have a history of perfect conduct. If you've behaved poorly in the past, start improving your image immediately. Apologize to your teachers, students, or administrators you've disrespected. If you've been especially bad, bring your teacher a small, modest gift for an upcoming holiday. Devote more attention to your schoolwork. Pay more attention in class. Serve any outstanding detention time, then follow the above steps to keep out of trouble in the future."

      "title": "Don't waste time in the hallway.",
      "content": "Don't waste time in the hallway. Between classes, it's only natural to say hi to any friends you might meet. This is perfectly acceptable for a well-behaved student. However, don't let yourself get distracted talking or goofing off. Keep track of your time and always allow yourself enough time to get to class before the bell. Passing periods can be deceptively short and teachers hate it when a student is late. If you're tardy repeatedly, you might even be subject to detention or other discipline. If you've got a timer function on your watch or cell phone, use it. Designate a set amount of time - three minutes, for example - that you're allowed to talk with friends. When your timer goes off, wrap up what you're doing and get to class!"

      "content": "Stay in the administration's good graces. Presidents, deans, and provosts: these school figures aren't teachers, but that doesn't mean you can ignore them and other people in the administration. Anyone who works in an office in the school probably has the ear of the principal or someone else who can discipline you. Be respectful to these people - a good reputation among the members of the administration can be a godsend if you get in real trouble. Here's one example: many schools have a secretary in the school's office who you need to talk to if you arrive at school late for some reason. Sometimes, this person is annoying, and, because they don't have the power to discipline you, it's tempting to give them sass. Don't do it. They probably talk to the principal every day. Even if they don't rat you out to the principal, they'll make life difficult for you the next time you show up with a poorly-forged doctor's note."

      "content": "Avoid fights. This one's sometimes very difficult, but it's always very important. Many schools have zero-tolerance policies on fighting - throw a punch and you can easily find yourself suspended or expelled. Spare your permanent record from the threat of black ink. Don't get into fights unless it's absolutely necessary to protect yourself. Even in desperate cases where you have to fight, you run the risk of serious trouble. Teachers and administrators won't necessarily know who started the fight. If it's your word against the bully's words, then there's a good chance you'll both be punished. The best policy is to avoid fights entirely. Here are some tips: Know how to deal with bullies. Bullies are weak, insecure people who hurt you to feel better about themselves. Try to thwart them without fighting. [1] X Expert Source Katie Styzek School Counselor Expert Interview. 26 March 2021. Ignore your aggressors.

No matter how disrespectful someone is to you, you'll bear the brunt of the blame if you throw the first punch. If you're fuming mad at another student, do whatever you need to do to control your temper - listen to some calming music, eat a big meal, or perform some vigorous exercise, for starters."

[4] X Expert Source Katie Styzek School Counselor Expert Interview. 26 March 2021. Word gets around schools quickly, and if someone hears you've said something nasty behind their back, you'll quickly get an untrustworthy reputation. This goes double for teachers or administrators. Vicious rumors about staff members can put their jobs in jeopardy. If you're caught for starting a rumor about one of the school's employees, your punishment will be severe. It goes without saying, but spreading gossip is also just a mean thing to do. Before you say something mean about someone, reflect on whether the statement is true or just a rumor. If it's true, think about how it would make this person feel if they heard it. Don't contribute to drama on social media, either.

      "content": "Cultivate a \"good\" appearance. It's sad but true - many students and teachers are shallow - they'll judge you based on your looks. If you really want to get a reputation as a goody two shoes, try to dress and groom yourself so that you look as clean-cut as possible. Avoid ripped denim, baggy pants or jerseys. Don't wear piercings on your face or body. Keep a smile - don't try to look tough or menacing. Sadly, these changes to your surface appearance will cause some people to view you differently. Boys should be clean-shaven, with a short, conservative haircut. Tend towards button-up shirts and clean, good-fitting pants or slacks. Don't wear earrings. Girls should avoid ostentatious makeup, revealing clothing (a bare midriff, low-cut shirts, etc.), and excessive jewelry."

Volunteer to show new kids around the school. If you see someone sitting by themselves at lunch, pull up a chair next to them. Stand up to bullying. You can even try taking social pariahs to school dances. Above all, be a friend to the friendless. You'll definitely be noticed. Plus, it's a really nice thing to do."

By doing so, you display maturity and restraint. In turn, you make them look immature. Don't let the haters get to you - the rewards of behaving well aren't worth the instant gratification of retaliation. Don't stoop to your haters' level by hurling your own insults back at them. The best revenge is to live happily while continuing to do good - it'll frustrate them to no end."
