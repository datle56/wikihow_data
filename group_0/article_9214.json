This app works with all Vizio TVs manufactured in 2015 and up. If you have a TV older than that, some buttons on the remote may not work. [4] X Research source The easiest way to find out is to search the internet for your phone model's specs (or your phone model and the words \"IR blaster\") and see what comes up. Fewer Androids come with IR blasters these days, but you'll find them on some models. Modern HTC and Samsung models no longer come with IR blasters, but you can often find them on newer models released by Huawei, Honor, and Xiaomi. [5] X Research source Devices like the Samsung S4, S5, S6, and S6 Edge, as well as the Note, Tab, and Mega have an IR blaster. You can also check your Android user manual if you still have it. iPhones do not have an IR blaster built-in."
