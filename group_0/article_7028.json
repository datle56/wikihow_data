Especially if you hope to cut costs as you cut those cable cords, you’ll want to find an alternative service that’s both cost-effective and worth the bang for your buck. Look for a base plan that fits your budget, but also make sure that the base plan includes channels or offers add-ons that interest you. [9] X Research source You might also check out which services offer you a free trial or discounted promotion (like Sling TV ’s discounts on the first month of use) so that you can test out the product before committing your wallet to it."

When you sign up for any of these streaming providers, you’ll likely be asked to enter your zip code. Then, you’ll be able to see which of your local channels and affiliates you’ll be able to access through the streaming service. Then, consider which ones are most important to you—is CBS your most trusted news source? Are you a die-hard sports fan who needs ESPN access? Choose whichever service gives you the most of what you want at the best price. [10] X Research source Try a customizable option, like Sling TV , that lets you choose from packages and add-ons where you can design your own selection of channels. That way, you’re focusing on the channels you do want and paying for fewer channels that you don’t. [11] X Research source"

If you’re mainly after ESPN, for example, Sling TV is the cheapest program that offers that channel. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Tiers, Packages, & Add-Ons While the base cost of any TV streaming service is important, it’s also crucial to consider which add-ons or upgraded levels are available…and how much they cost. Packages usually include groups of live TV channels that are bundled by theme, such as news channels, sports channels, entertainment channels, or international channels. Some services may also ask you to pay for premium extras like Max, AMC+, and Starz. Each of these add-ons generally costs an extra $5-$20/month on top of the base price.

Any video content that’s delivered to your screen over an internet connection could be referred to as “streaming.” Traditional streaming options, such as Netflix, offer on-demand options that users can choose to stream immediately. Live streaming also delivers content over an internet connection, but the content is happening in real time—e.g., newscasts, sports games, timed TV airings, etc. [19] X Research source"

      "content": "Do live TV streaming services have commercials? Yes, most live TV streaming services have commercials because they’re broadcasting the same programs to you as you’d see on cable TV. Because those stations have commercial breaks, your live TV streaming service will as well. When watching pre-recorded content, however, you’ll likely be able to fast-forward past commercials in most cases."
