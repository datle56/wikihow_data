      "title": "Scrub the countertops with a sponge.",
      "content": "Scrub the countertops with a sponge. Use the rough side of a scrubbing sponge to remove any stains. Wet the sponge with hot water and use a bit of mild dish soap to clean the wood countertops while you scrub. [1] X Research source Once you finish, be sure to rinse off any soapy residue with fresh hot water."

      "title": "Spray the countertop with vinegar.",
      "content": "Spray the countertop with vinegar. Pour some undiluted white vinegar into a spray bottle and spray the surface of your wood countertop with it. Let the vinegar sit on the surface for several minutes. Then rinse it off with a clean sponge or damp rag. This will help sanitize your wood countertops. [2] X Research source Use hot water to rinse the vinegar off the countertop, as this will help clean and maintain your countertops even more effectively. Don’t let the vinegar sit for more than a few minutes, as the acidic properties can make the wood glue deteriorate over time."

      "title": "Scrape off food residue.",
      "content": "Scrape off food residue. One important way to keep your wood countertops looking clean and new is to make sure you regularly clean off any gunk or food residue that builds up. If you have any residue that is particularly difficult to remove, consider using a spatula or metal pastry scraper to remove any additional buildup. [3] X Research source Be sure to use these tools gently to avoid scraping the wood and leaving a permanent mark."

      "title": "Clean stains with lemon juice.",
      "content": "Clean stains with lemon juice. Cut a fresh lemon in half and rub the stain with the juicy inner side of the lemon half. The acidic nature of the lemon juice should help remove the stain from your wooden countertops. [4] X Research source Consider sprinkling lemon juice on the stain and scrubbing with a sponge if you don’t have any fresh lemons. You can add a dash of salt for extra abrasion when scrubbing with the lemon."
    },
    {
      "title": "Iron the stain through a piece of cloth.",
      "content": "Iron the stain through a piece of cloth. Empty your iron of any water that might be left inside and turn it on to the lowest possible setting. Place a clean dishrag, or any other type of thin, clean cloth (like a clean, old t-shirt), over the stain. Apply the iron to the area of the cloth covering the stain and leave it there for a very brief moment. [5] X Research source Be careful not to leave it for too long, as this could create a burn mark on the surface of your wood countertops."

    {
      "title": "Sand the wood countertops.",
      "content": "Sand the wood countertops. Use a piece of 120-grit sandpaper to gently sand your wooden countertops. Remember to sand with the grain, not against it. After giving it a good once over with the 120-grit paper, switch to a piece of 180-grit sandpaper and sand the countertops, again keeping with the natural grain of the wood. [6] X Research source This should help remove any tough stains on the surface of the wood. Once you finish sanding, you’ll need to apply mineral oil and rub it into the wood grain with a clean rag. Let it soak into the wood for about 30 minutes, and then wipe away any excess mineral oil residue with a paper towel. Be sure to choose a food-safe mineral oil. You can also use walnut oil for the same effect. [7] X Research source Avoid using culinary oils because they can oxidize and become rancid over time."

      "title": "Avoid wet spots.",
      "content": "Avoid wet spots. Even with protective oil or varnish coverings, wood countertops can stain and warp over time if they are exposed to water quite often. Take care when using liquids in your kitchen and try to soak up any spills on the countertops as soon as they occur. [8] X Research source This means you should also avoid leaving your wet dishes to dry directly on the wood countertop. Even with a dishtowel underneath them, this could potentially damage your countertops over time. Place a plastic (or absorbent) mat under your wet dishes as they dry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clean up after every use.",
      "content": "Clean up after every use. Whenever you finish in the kitchen, give your wood countertops a quick once over with a sponge and some mild dish soap. If you clean your counters regularly, they will be less likely to stain and will require sanding/re-oiling less frequently. [9] X Research source This is especially true for any liquid spills or if there are lots of food scraps left on the countertops. Consider using a plastic mat when completing messy tasks in the kitchen. But if you do make a mess on the wood countertops, clean up as soon as you have finished."
    },
    {
      "title": "Re-oil the wood.",
      "content": "Re-oil the wood. Pour a bit of mineral oil onto a clean rag and rub it into the grains of the wood countertops. Let the oil sit for about 30 minutes, and then wipe off any excess with a paper towel or clean cloth. Apply a second coat using the same method. [10] X Research source Be sure to only use high quality mineral oil for this task. Other types of oils, like cooking oils, can become rancid over time."
