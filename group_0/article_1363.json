      "content": "In Appalachia, whistling is said to attract “them.” Some stories claim this only applies to whistling in the woods at night, while others state it applies to whistling in general. The legend goes that if you whistle in Appalachia, you’ll attract evil spirits known only as “them.” You’ll hear your own whistle echo back to you as “they” come to find you. They may even follow you home. [1] X Research source This legend is based on Native American folklore, and many believe the spirits are actually skinwalkers, or Wendigos. Some versions of the story say that whistling at night can even attract the Devil himself."

      "content": "Appalachian locals have passed down the legend for generations. Many people in the Appalachian region have heard warnings from relatives never to whistle in the woods during the day or night (but especially at night). As European settlers populated the region, their own mythologies probably became mixed with those of the Native population. Many today acknowledge there is some kind of mysterious spirit in the Appalachian woods and mountains, but beliefs are mixed on what those spirits actually are."

      "content": "The Appalachian whistling legend has gone viral on TikTok. In 2024, TikToker ashleeinc posted a viral video sharing the story of her friend Jane. Jane grew up in Appalachia, where her grandmother had two rules: Jane had to be inside by dusk and she could not whistle at night. When she goes to visit her grandmother as an adult, she is suddenly struck with the urge to whistle. The air later goes completely still and she hears her whistle repeated back to her from the woods. She and her grandmother retreat inside. They hear the whistle again and then a pounding at the door. It eventually goes away when they don’t answer. [7] X Research source Many other Appalachians then shared their own stories in the video’s comments. Even people from places like Australia and Hawaii said they’d grown up with similar legends."

If you look on social media sites like TikTok and Reddit, you’ll find many Appalachians who do believe in the whistling legend, as the stories have been passed down from generation to generation. However, just as many people say they do not believe in the legend and they’d never even heard of it until it became popular on TikTok. Appalachia is a large region, so it’s possible this folktale is more common in some areas than others. While many people believe in the legend, there is no scientific evidence that anything will happen if you whistle in the woods in Appalachia or anywhere else. Some believe the legend began because hunters didn’t want people whistling during hunting season and scaring off the prey."
