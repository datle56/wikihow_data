      "content": "“Bi panic” may refer to the panic non-bi people feel around bi people. There’s a lot of stigma around bisexuality, and some people use “bi panic” to describe the confusion and discomfort non-bi people might experience around bi people, mostly due to a stereotypical understanding of bisexuality. Bi people experience stigma from gay and straight people alike. There’s an assumption that bisexuality is just a phase, and that the bi person will eventually “commit” to either homosexuality or heterosexuality. [2] X Research source Bisexual people are also sometimes stigmatized as overly sexually promiscuous, flirtatious, or fickle; using “bi panic” in the sense of being overwhelmed at one’s attraction to multiple genders may be viewed as a tongue-in-cheek way to deal with this biphobic assumption."
