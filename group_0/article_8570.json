      "content": "Run a pipe cleaner through the pipe before you use it. Even if you have cleaned your pipe after the last time you used it, you should always clean it before you smoke it. Take a pipe cleaner and run it through the pipe. This helps get rid of any remaining ash or dottle. [1] X Research source Gently knock the pipe in your palm to get the debris from the bowl."

      "title": "Clean the pipe after each smoke.",
      "content": "Clean the pipe after each smoke. You should always clean your pipe after you smoke. Never allow the ash and debris to remain in the pipe. However, make sure you let the pipe cool completely before cleaning. Never clean while it is warm. If you remove the stem while it is warm, it will mess up the fit of the stem and cause cracks in the pipe."

      "content": "Notice the signs that your pipe needs cleaning. As you smoke your pipe, you will be able to tell if it needs a good cleaning. The taste should be pleasant when you smoke. If you start to notice a change in taste, such as a salty, sour, or bad taste, you probably need to clean it."

      "content": "Let the pipe sit before smoking. Because you cleaned your pipe with alcohol, you want to make sure that you let the pipe sit for at least a day, if not more, before smoking. This ensures that the alcohol completely evaporates. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Shake your pipe.",
      "content": "Shake your pipe. After the pipe has cooled, shake the pipe. Make sure to put a finger over the bowl so the ash doesn't go everywhere. Do this for a few seconds. Then, pour the ash and debris out of the bowl. If you can't get everything out when you pour, use the pipe tool with the spoon end to scoop out the ashes. Shaking the pipe with the ash still in it helps to form cake on the inside of the bowl, which helps prolong the life of the pipe."

      "content": "Clean the pipe with a pipe cleaner. After dumping the ash and dottle, blow through the stem to get rid of any excess ash and dottle. Then, use a pipe cleaner to clean the pipe. Start with a bristle pipe cleaner. Push the pipe cleaner through the stem of the pipe. The tip of the pipe cleaner should be the only part visible. Then remove it. Afterwards, you can use the other side of the pipe cleaner or use a clean pipe cleaner to do the same thing. Do this until the pipe cleaner is clean when you remove it."

To preserve the wood, you may want to use a cloth dampened with olive oil or a special wood pipe cleaning cloth. [4] X Research source Place the pipe on the shelf. If you are concerned about moisture in the stem, you can leave a pipe cleaner in it to soak up moisture."

Make sure to pull it all the way through. After you have pulled the damp pipe cleaner through, run a dry one through. The pipe cleaner will probably have black and brown debris on it. Continue doing this until the pipe cleaner doesn't have any debris on it when you push it through. You can use isopropyl alcohol or grain alcohol. If it is available to you, you can also purchase pipe cleaning solution."

Use this pipe cleaner to wipe the airhole, and follow that with a dry regular pipe cleaner. There should be some resistance. If the airhole is too large, then fold the pipe cleaner in half. Do this until the pipe cleaner you scrub through the airhole comes out without any debris."

Reaming the bowl means scraping off some of the cake. You can use a reamer, which you can buy at a tobacco shop or online. As you clean the inside of the bowl, make sure to go slowly as you shave the cake. Don't pull it out in chunks. You can easily damage or scrape the bowl with the edge of the tool. [8] X Research source You can also use the blunt knife tool that came with your pipe tools. This can clean the cake in an uneven way or dig into the wood. You can also use wooden dowels that have been wrapped in sandpaper or grit cloth. The cake should only be about 1/16 in or 1.5 mm in thickness. Anything larger than that should be reamed."
