      "title": "Fake listings",
      "content": "Fake listings A scammer creates a fake listing for a property that either doesn't exist or belongs to somebody else. The scammer will usually lure potential guests into communicating with them through another app (or by phone or email) to avoid being caught by Airbnb, ultimately convincing the victim to pay through a third-party service, wire transfer, or a phishing site that looks like Airbnb but actually just steals the victim's credit card information (phishing). [1] X Research source Possible signs: Photos you've seen before in another location, a description that doesn't match the photos, hosts and properties that don't have reviews. How to avoid this scam: If a listing seems too good to be true, especially for the price, it's likely a scam. Always insist on keeping all communications on Airbnb, and never agree to pay a host using another platform like Zelle, Cash App, or Venmo. If a host asks you to \"register\" on a different website, avoid doing so. If a host demands payment through a different platform, report it at https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/199 .

      "title": "Multiple listings",
      "content": "Multiple listings This scam occurs when a host lists the same property multiple times with different prices from different accounts. Sometimes, the scammer will list the property on Airbnb and on another platform like VRBO, which makes it harder for Airbnb to detect. When someone books a stay at one price point, the host will wait for a higher price booking through one of the property's other listings and ultimately cancel the less-lucrative booking. [2] X Trustworthy Source United States Department of Justice Official website of the U.S. Department of Justice Go to source Possible signs: The same photos are linked to a property with another name, you found the property for rent on a site like VRBO, Vacasa, or even Hotels.com, there are no reviews. How to avoid this scam: If you come across a suspicious photo, do a reverse image search to see if it appears elsewhere on the internet. If a host asks you to communicate with them in another app, by phone, or via email, insist that all communications occur through the Airbnb app or website to ensure you're protected by Airbnb's safeguards. Communicating on platforms like WhatsApp or via text or email also opens you up to security issues like phishing. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Fake reviews",
      "content": "Fake reviews A scammy host might pay people (or use fake accounts) to post fake positive reviews to lure unsuspecting guests to a substandard or dangerous property. Fake reviews can also be used to make a fake listing look legitimate, or as damage control to push a legitimate bad review further down the list. Possible signs: Multiple positive reviews posted in a short period, claims that don't match the listing, multiple reviews posted by people who haven't posted other reviews. How to avoid this scam: Be wary of brand-new hosts with multiple positive reviews and hosts with unreasonable, unsafe, or unfair demands."

      "title": "Bait and switch",
      "content": "Bait and switch This Airbnb scam is sometimes combined with the multiple listings scam—a guest books a stay, then the host cancels the stay (often on the day of arrival) with a fake excuse like property damage or plumbing problems. The deceptive host usually sends the guest a reservation change request through Airbnb for a different property, either at the same or a higher rate. [4] X Research source Because this scam often happens the day the booking is scheduled to begin, the guest often feels pressured to accept this reservation change, which either charges them more money or books them at an inferior property. [5] X Research source Possible signs: Bad reviews (or no reviews), a host who doesn't respond to your messages within 24 hours, a host who has several properties concentrated in a single area. How to avoid this scam: Read the reviews carefully to see if anyone mentioned being offered a different property than the one they booked. Check the host's profile to see if they have multiple properties available, and read those reviews as well."

      "title": "\"Extra fees\" scams",
      "content": "\"Extra fees\" scams A scamming host demands the booker pay additional fees, deposits, local taxes, or other amounts not mentioned in the listing. This scam tends to occur after a guest books their stay, either before they arrive or upon arrival. The guest then feels pressured into paying the fees to avoid losing their reservation. [6] X Research source Possible signs: A too-good-to-be-true price for a resort-type property, bad reviews. Avoid this scam: Read the reviews carefully to make sure other guests haven't mentioned being charged for unmentioned fees. However, some off-site and in-person payments (such as local taxes, resort fees, Wi-Fi charges, etc.) are allowed if explicitly mentioned in the listing. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Post-checkout charges scam",
      "content": "Post-checkout charges scam This scam occurs after an unsuspecting guest checks out of their Airbnb. The host submits a claim for damages and violations that didn't happen, leaving the guest on the hook for extra fees they shouldn't have to pay. Possible signs: This one doesn't have very obvious signs other than bad reviews or no reviews, but you should watch out for any communications that feel \"off.\" How to avoid this scam: Take photos of the property upon both arrival and departure. Always read the reviews, including older ones, to ensure previous guests have not mentioned anything concerning about their stays."

    {
      "title": "Chargeback scams",
      "content": "Chargeback scams This scam, which targets Airbnb hosts, happens when a guest disputes the charge of their stay through their credit card company. This often occurs when the guest pays with a stolen credit card, but it could also happen if a scamming guest decides they don't want to pay for their stay after it ends. Once the guest (or the stolen credit card's owner) charges back the cost, the host may be on the hook for the total amount. If the host hasn't been paid by Airbnb for the stay yet, they won't be paid unless they can prove that the chargeback wasn't valid. Possible signs: Unusually hard-to-please guest, threats, demands for refunds. How to avoid this scam: Read the potential guest's reviews thoroughly before accepting a booking. If a guest has unreasonable, unsafe, or unfair demands, reconsider their booking. Disable Instant Book, or tighten your requirements, so you can chat with potential guests before accepting their reservations."

      "title": "Threats bad reviews or complaints",
      "content": "Threats bad reviews or complaints A scamming guest may demand the host refund them for all or part of the stay for a fraudulent reason, threatening to leave a bad review for the property or escalating to Airbnb if the host doesn't comply. Because a bad review or a deactivation from Airbnb could devastate a host's business, they often comply and refund the guest, even if nothing went wrong. Possible signs: The same as chargeback scammers—guests who demand refunds for things they shouldn't or complain about strange things. How to avoid this scam: Take photos of the property before the guest checks in to prove that no damage occurred before a problem guest's stay. Only communicate with the guest through the Airbnb platform to ensure you are protected by Airbnb's safeguards, such as host damage protection, liability insurance, and terms of service. Hosts are no longer allowed to monitor the inside of their properties with security cameras or other recording devices . Cameras cannot be inside the property at all, even if they are turned off. External cameras, including video doorbells, are allowed if their locations are disclosed in the listing. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Fake accounts and reviews",
      "content": "Fake accounts and reviews If a bad guest or scammer gets a negative review or is deactivated by Airbnb, they might make a new profile (often with fake positive reviews) to keep using the service. The fake reviews make the new account look legitimate, so unsuspecting hosts may agree to host guests who might try to scam them, damage their property, or worse. Possible signs: Brand new accounts, no reviews (or several positive reviews from a short period). How to avoid this scam: Don't enable Instant Book so you can check a user's reviews before accepting their booking."

      "title": "Unauthorized guests and parties",
      "content": "Unauthorized guests and parties A guest might tell you only one or two people will be staying at the property but bring several more guests or, worse—host an unapproved party. Even though frequent party damage from guests led to Airbnb banning parties in 2022, scammers may still use Airbnb properties to host parties, leading to property damage, injury, or worse. [9] X Research source Possible signs: One-night or two-night stays, bad reviews mentioning trash and noise. How to avoid this scam: Update your listing description and house rules to clarify whether you'll allow any guests who aren't included in the reservation. Disable Instant Book, and ask potential guests directly whether others will be staying with them before deciding whether to accept the booking. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Payment scams",
      "content": "Payment scams To defraud the host, a guest convinces a host to communicate on a non-Airbnb platform like WhatsApp, phone, or text message. The scammer might persuade the host to accept payment through a wire transfer, Zelle, or other non-Airbnb payment service, overpay, and then ask for the overpaid amount back before disputing the charge with their credit card company. Once disputed, the host will lose the \"overpaid\" amount and may even be on the hook for the entire amount sent. Possible signs: A request to communicate on another platform, such as WhatsApp, phone, text, or Messenger. How to avoid this scam: Never communicate with guests or accept payment using a different platform."
