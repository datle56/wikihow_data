      "content": "Make sure you’ve worked enough. Each state has its own requirements, but you generally must have earned a certain amount of money before you become eligible for unemployment benefits. This period is called your “base period,” and states measure it differently. [2] X Research source For example, in Illinois, you must have made at least $1,600 in your base period, and you must have earned at least $440 in one of those quarters. If you’re unsure whether you’ve earned enough, go ahead and apply. Let the office reject you if you haven’t earned enough."

      "content": "Analyze why you lost your job. To qualify for benefits, you must have lost the job through no fault of your own. Consider the reason why you are now unemployed. Layoff . You will typically qualify for benefits if your employer was downsizing or if they just didn’t have enough work for you. Firing . Generally, you can’t collect benefits if you were fired for serious misconduct, such as intentionally neglecting your duties. However, you might qualify for benefits if you were fired because the company thought you weren’t a good fit. [3] X Research source Quitting . You probably can’t get benefits if you quit because you disliked your job or because your boss annoyed you. However, you might qualify if you quit for “good cause.” Each state defines good cause differently, but harassment, discrimination, or fraud usually qualify. You might also qualify if you quit because of health or family concerns, such as domestic violence or because you needed to take care of a sick relative. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Be willing and able to work. Your state wants you out and looking for work. For this reason, you can only get unemployment benefits if you are willing to accept a job when one is offered to you. You might not qualify as willing and able to work in the following circumstances: [5] X Research source You probably won’t qualify if you are sick and cannot work. You won’t qualify if you don’t have transportation. You aren’t required to travel hundreds of miles to a potential job, but you must be able to get to one reasonably nearby. You might not qualify if you are mainly a student."

In some states, such as Iowa, you can appeal online. [10] X Research source Other states will ask you to submit either a letter or an appeal form. Regardless of the method of bringing an appeal, remember that you must proceed quickly. States usually only give you 30 days to bring an appeal. [11] X Research source Your chances of success will depend on the reason why you were denied. For example, if you were denied because you didn’t earn enough in your base period, then you will be lucky to win the appeal unless the office incorrectly calculated your wages. Some other denials are easier to appeal. For example, you might have been fired from your most recent job. If your employer claims your poor performance was intentional, you might be denied benefits. However, you can argue you just weren’t good at the job, and your poor performance wasn’t intentional or malicious."
