      "title": "Dust mop once a week.",
      "content": "Dust mop once a week. The best way to maintain your epoxy floor is to run a soft dust mop over it once a week. This removes dirt and dust gently, which prevents scratches and protects your floor. For floors with an anti-slip aggregate coating--such as aluminum oxide--a soft bristle push broom may be more effective than a standard dust mop."

      "content": "Vacuum any joints once a month. If you have visible construction joints or saw cuts, you should use a vacuum to clean these out. For best results, use your vacuum attachment hose with a crevice tool. Vacuum these joints about once per month. [1] X Research source If you do not have a vacuum, you can try to clean any joints/cuts with a stiff bristle broom."

      "title": "Clean spills immediately with a soft cloth.",
      "content": "Clean spills immediately with a soft cloth. Oil, chemicals, or even just water left to sit for too long can damage your epoxy floors. Clean any spills as soon as you see them using a soft towel or cloth. You can use a gentle cleanser--such as Windex--if a spill is sticky or leaves a film."

      "title": "Perform a deep cleaning every three months.",
      "content": "Perform a deep cleaning every three months. In addition to general cleaning, you can keep your epoxy floors in good shape by doing a deep cleaning about once every few months. In order to accomplish this, you may need to move some vehicles, tools, or other items out of your way. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Choose a cleaning solution.",
      "content": "Choose a cleaning solution. You have two good options to choose from: the first is a non-toxic, biodegradable cleanser (like Simple Green), and the second is ammonia. When prepared with the right amount of water, both of these cleansers are safe and effective for epoxy floors. Mix 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of Simple Green with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water. If you make an over-concentrated solution, it can leave a film on your floor. Mix 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of ammonia with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water."

    {
      "title": "Mop the floor",
      "content": "Mop the floor with a hard foam mop. Create a bucket of cleaning solution, as well as a bucket of plain hot water. Submerge your hard foam mop into your cleaning solution, ring it out, and then move it over your floor. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Rinse the floor.",
      "content": "Rinse the floor. Fill a bucket with clean warm water. Using your hard foam mop, go back over the floor with water in order to rinse off any detergent. When you're finished, dry the floor with a soft towel. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Scrub stubborn spots with a stiff nylon brush.",
      "content": "Scrub stubborn spots with a stiff nylon brush. For stubborn spots and stains, spray the area with a stronger ratio of cleansing solution (either ammonia or Simple Green) and scrub with a stiff nylon brush. Repeat this action until all stains are gone. When you are done scrubbing, rinse the area with a bit of water and dry with a towel. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean rust stains or salt film with a lactic acid-based cleanser.",
      "content": "Clean rust stains or salt film with a lactic acid-based cleanser. The best way to remove rust stains or to clear away film from road salt is to clean your floor with a lactic acid-based cleanser (such as CLR). Create a solution that is 1 part lactic acid cleanser to 1 part warm water, and apply it directly to the area you want to clean. Scrub with a regular scrub brush and rinse with cold water. [6] X Research source Do not let the cleanser sit for more than 1-2 minutes on your epoxy floor."

      "title": "Remove tire marks with a concrete degreaser.",
      "content": "Remove tire marks with a concrete degreaser. The best way to remove tire marks from epoxy floors is to saturate the area with a concrete degreasing product and let it sit for 5-10 minutes. Then use a stiff bristle nylon brush to vigorously scrub tire marks away. If they are persistent, you may need to apply the degreaser a second time. Once the tire marks have been removed, rinse the area with a bit of water and dry with a towel. [7] X Research source Work on tire marks right away when they’re made. They will be more difficult to remove the longer they build up."
