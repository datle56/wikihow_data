Decide what characteristics you want people to associate you with. Think about what your idols are like and how you can tailor your public appearance to be more like them. [4] X Research source For example, you might wish to be admired for your bravery, like your favorite superhero, or give off the class and sophistication of a classic movie star. Start small. Begin with the basic personality traits you wish to have and make room for them in your life, making sure they're still in line with your personal values and beliefs. One fun way to brainstorm who you might want to be is to use a platform like Pinterest to collect images you enjoy looking at. By noticing visual patterns of characteristics/traits that you're naturally drawn to, you can model yourself accordingly.

If you want to change it, you will need to emphasize your good qualities and minimize the negative ones. Think about personality flaws that people have taken issue with in the past, and try to fix them. After a while, people will notice these changes and begin to view you in a new light. [6] X Research source For example, if you get defensive and becoming argumentative in disputes, try to keep a level head and acknowledge the opinions of others. Figure out what you've done to earn a tarnished image and try to do the opposite. For example, if you're often seen as insensitive, go out of your way to show more concern for others. Everyone has room for improvement in their interpersonal habits and characteristics, even those commonly perceived as being \"nice.\""

Come up with a projection of how you’d like to change the way people view you in a week, a month, a year, etc. Focus on becoming more outgoing, or make a resolution to keep your cool in stressful situations, one day at a time. Keep your goals and progress written down in a notebook to serve as a reminder to exhibit the characteristics you’re trying to develop. [7] X Research source No matter what your long-term goals are, always think day-to-day. It can be helpful to say “Today, I will be more generous and caring” at the start of each day.

That's why it's important to change people's minds about you. Rectify as many cases of bad behavior from the past as you can. Offer sincere apologies to people you've offended, resume friendships that were ended over petty disagreements, and erase any gossipy or vindictive posts from social media that might make you look spiteful.

      "content": "Change the way you think about yourself. Before you can overhaul your image with others, you have to accept your own self-image by changing your internal language. Consider the traits you want to have, then start thinking about yourself in those terms. For instance, if you’re used to thinking “I can't do this” when faced with obstacles, and you want your new image to be that of a strong, self-assured leader, start telling yourself “I’ve got this!” Your actions will follow the same course as your thoughts. It can be daunting to make such a big change, but remember that many of your thoughts and characteristics are formed through behavioral patterns and can be relearned with enough conditioning."

If you've always been the shy, quiet type, there’s no use in trying to immediately transform yourself into the life of the party. Pick one or two characteristics you want to tweak and give those your attention. Once you’ve changed your patterns of thought and behavior, you can use this progress to guide yourself toward bigger, more substantive changes. Be patient. It can be disheartening to feel like people aren’t seeing you the way you want to be seen, but changing your image just takes time. Reward yourself for small successes. Practice positive thinking by encouraging yourself whenever you break a bad habit, or react to something in a way your old self wouldn’t have."

[12] X Research source No one can read your thoughts, so be mindful of the way you want to come across when presenting your new image. A change of image means a change in the ways you act towards others. Don't be discouraged if some people don't believe in the new you.

If something doesn’t feel right, don’t do it, even if you want it to be part of your new image. Rather than ignoring who you are at heart, your new image should be sincere, refined by the addition of characteristics and values that you admire. It’s about becoming a better version of yourself and putting that on display to the world, not fabricating a fake persona. Your new image should be authentic in the sense that you act in a way that is consistent with your true feelings. Acting like somebody you’re not can be emotionally exhausting and leave you feeling dissatisfied with yourself and your relationships."

You have a chance to let people see you in a whole new light—take it! Starting small, being sincere and doing a little at a time is key to gaining confidence in your new image."
