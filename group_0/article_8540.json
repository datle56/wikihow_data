      "content": "Thaw your turkey before you clean it. If you have enough time, you can thaw your turkey by setting it in the refrigerator for a few days, allowing 24 hours to thaw every 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of turkey. For a slightly faster thaw, place the turkey in a leak-proof bag and set it in a sink or bucket. Completely submerge it with cold water, changing the water every 30 minutes and allowing 30 minutes to thaw every 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of turkey. For the fastest method, place the turkey in a pan and use the defrost setting on your microwave to thaw it. [1] X Research source Keep the turkey in its wrapping, unless you’re thawing it in the microwave. If you thaw your turkey in the refrigerator, you can keep it there for up to 2 days before cooking it. If you thaw it in water or the microwave, you’ll need to start cleaning and cooking it as soon as it’s ready."

Fill it with 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of cold water, then rinse out the cavity of the turkey with a gentle stream of cool water. Drain the turkey by holding it up over the sink, then set it down in the roasting pan.

In fact, it can actually help spread the bacteria around your kitchen and even onto you, which can lead to illness. The safest way to prepare your turkey is to simply move it directly from its packaging into the baking dish.

Plucking takes longer than skinning a wild turkey, but it’s the way to go if you’re planning to roast, smoke, or deep-fry. It tends to preserve the turkey’s moisture more effectively as well. Plucking is also the option to choose if you want to cook your turkey whole. Plucking is a messy process, so do it outside or in a garage, if possible."

You can also remove part of the wings, starting at the first joint to leave a drumstick-shaped section behind.

You can heat the water on a stove or on an outdoor burner. You’ll need to use a kitchen thermometer to check the water’s temperature."
