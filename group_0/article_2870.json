      "content": "Snuggle with your partner to help bonding. [1] X Research source Snuggling is a great romantic activity and it doesn't take a lot of skill, preparation, or extra effort. It's also a great way to transition into just about any bedroom activity, from foreplay to a serious talk. Go slow on this step. Snuggle for a long time, at least 20 minutes, before moving on to other activities. Use the time instead to talk and caress their body gently, stroking their hair and running your finger along their collar-bone. When you're snuggling is also a great time to talk about your relationship and your future, which can be really romantic for partners that have been together almost a year or more. Really, you can talk about anything you want to talk about. However, talking about needing to go to the grocery store on Saturday isn't very romantic. Just keep that in mind. Don’t schedule romance in bed or just outright say that you want to go have sex. Being romantic means being subtle, so you’ll need to either wait until you’re in bed as normal or find another way to get them in bed and set the tone for romance. Try flirting and then taking their hand and leading them to the bed."

Massages are very relaxing and a great way to lead in to other romantic activities. You don't even need to be very strong. A light touch in just the right places will still feel just as good.

      "content": "Surprise them with what they find under your clothes. The vast wonderland hiding under our street clothes is a space generally reserved specifically for ourselves and our partners. When you give them a treat to find under your clothes, you can really take them by surprise, especially if you're not the sort of person that usually does that kind of thing. You can wear sexy lingerie, write a love note in permanent marker, or get creative with your shaving routine (turning your pubic or chest hair into a heart shape, for example, but admittedly not for everyone). This means you’re going to want to go the extra length on your clothes and underwear too. Pass on the ratty stuff with holes and stains and go for something that’s appropriate for the mood."

If your foreplay has been a little...one-sided, now is the time to turn the tables. By throwing all of your attention into your partner's pleasure, you'll really grab their attention. And their gratitude. [4] X Research source If you are a guy, try to turn your girl on .

      "content": "Be open about your feelings. [5] X Expert Source Jacqueline Hellyer Licensed Psychosexual Therapist Expert Interview. 15 October 2021. The best place to start is by just telling your partner how you feel. You don't need to worry about being really eloquent or coming across as cheesy. As long as you speak from the heart and are honest about your feelings, your partner will be very touched. Tell them what they mean to you and what your life feels like when they're in it. This will make them feel great and help set a really romantic mood. For example, you can say something like, \"When I'm with you everything feels like coming home after being completely lost. When I'm with you, I feel like I have my compass. I'll never be lost again.\""

This works particularly well if you use words from something that means a lot to them. Quoting one of their favorite romantic moments from a movie, memorizing their favorite poem, or singing them their favorite love song are all great ways to get your romance on. Just be careful not to be cheesy! Good classic poems to recite include Shakespeare's \"Sonnet 116\" or E.E. Cummings \"somewhere i have never traveled, gladly beyond\"."

It's especially important when your partner doesn't really see themselves as a sexual creature or someone that's desirable, because when you show them that you do think of them this way then they start to feel better about themselves. By showing them how sexy you think they are, they'll become more comfortable and have a better time in the bedroom. Say something like, \"You look so hot like that. I feel like a teenager again...\""

[8] X Research source For example, you can get incense, fabrics, pillows, and maybe a quick new coat of paint to give a room an Indian makeover before you show your partner just how much you can both learn from the Kama Sutra. You can also set a soundtrack to further the scene. Try anything by Ravi Shankar or try Anoushka Shankar if you want something a little more modern and sexy. You can also buy fancy fabric to drape and hang from the ceiling and walls, transforming an unromantic room into a plush love-den."

However, not everyone can afford to rent out a whole theater for a single date. Skip the price tag and set up a theater in your bed instead. Drag the TV into your room or use a computer or laptop as your movie screen. Set everything up with popcorn and a candy stand, so that your partner feels like they're going to see a real movie. It's a good idea to try to choose a movie which has significance to the two of you. Try to track down the first movie you ever saw together, for example."
