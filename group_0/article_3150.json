      "content": "Consider removing hair from your legs, face, or armpits if you want to. Body hair is not unhygienic, so this step is entirely optional. You don't have to shave to be hygienic, and whether or not you shave is completely up to you. If you do shave, though, make sure to use shaving cream or soap - never try to shave dry skin or with just water, as this can lead to irritation, nicks, and little red bumps, which you don't want. If you don't want to shave but still want to remove hair, you can also wax, thread, epilate, pluck or use hair removal creams. You can apply oil to remove wax from skin. It helps to reduce the stickiness of wax."

Smelling good does not necessarily make you hygienic, but, if you smell bad, it could indicate an underlying hygiene issue. You can also wear perfume, eau de cologne, eau de toilette, scented lotion, or body spray to smell fragrant, though this is optional. If you have asthma triggered by certain smells, avoid these products. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use gentle soap and water, and never go to bed with makeup on.",
      "content": "Use gentle soap and water, and never go to bed with makeup on. This is enough to have a hygienic face. If you're interested in looking after the appearance of the skin on your face beyond hygiene you can: Use a cleanser recommended for your skin type. Put a small amount of face cleanser on your hands, about the size of a nickel, and rub some on your wet hands. Use a product that is gentle enough for your skin, because something that's too strong will just dry the skin out and stimulate the oil glands to produce more oil - you're trying to remove oil and retain moisture at the same time. Do not use soap - it's too strong, and can't be rinsed easily. Using your fingertips, massage the cleanser all over your face, removing any dirt and oil. Take thirty seconds or so, concentrating on first the hairline, then paying special attention to the \"T-zone\" (forehead, nose, and nostril area), then around the mouth and chin, then cheeks. Cleanse the neck using upward strokes. You have oil glands behind your ears, so don't neglect that area. It's messy, but do it anyway. When you're fifty, you will be glad you went to the trouble to help your mature skin look its best. Rinse your face with warm water and pat it dry with a soft towel. Moisturizer is a very good thing. You have just washed off dirt and oil, and a moisturizer will help keep the moisture in the surface cells, which promotes a more youthful looking complexion - plus it feels great."
