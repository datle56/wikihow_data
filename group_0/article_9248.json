You can find a plethora of USB DVD drives at any electronics retailer. [1] X Research source These are generally the cheaper option to buying a video capture card so you can use your TV's DVD player with your laptop. You'll buy a portable external drive that only works with a computer and can't be connected directly to a TV. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Buy a DVD player with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth capabilities.",
      "content": "Buy a DVD player with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth capabilities. Generally, older DVD players require a cable to play videos smoothly and without losing quality, but there are some smart DVD players out there (like the Sony Blu Ray Player with WiFi ). With your laptop and DVD Player on the same Wi-Fi network, you will be able to watch your favorite DVDs wirelessly! This is not a common way to watch DVDs since HDMI or USB prevents the movie from losing too much data. However, these DVD players do exist, albeit they are expensive and your laptop must be able to use screen mirroring to use the DVD player attached to a TV."

    {
      "title": "Connect the HDMI cable from your DVD Player to the capture card.",
      "content": "Connect the HDMI cable from your DVD Player to the capture card. This might be labeled \"HDMI Out\" on your DVD Player and \"HDMI IN\" on the video capture card. Since your laptop most likely has an \"HDMI Out\" port only, you cannot run an HDMI from the \"HDMI Out\" port on your DVD Player to the \"HDMI Out\" port on your laptop. You won't see or hear your DVD since both the player and your laptop will be sending out/displaying information. In that case, you'll need a video capture card to connect the \"HDMI Out\" port from your DVD Player to an \"HDMI In\" port. These tend to be slightly more expensive than buying an external USB-DVD drive as outlined in the previous method."

      "title": "Connect the USB cable to your laptop's USB port.",
      "content": "Connect the USB cable to your laptop's USB port. You'll most likely find this rectangle-shaped port on either side of your laptop. Some video capture cards will have a USB attachment at the end opposite of where you plug in the HDMI cable. You'll want to plug this end into the USB port on your laptop."

      "title": "Ensure that both connections are secure.",
      "content": "Ensure that both connections are secure. A stretched cable could cause interruptions in your audio or video output, so make sure the cables between the DVD Player and the video capture card and between the capture card and your laptop aren't pulled too tightly. If they are loose, you might need to try using a different HDMI cable."

      "title": "Test the connection.",
      "content": "Test the connection. Put a DVD in the DVD player and start watching. If your sound or audio is off, you might have issues with your ports/cables. If this is the case, try using different cables. When you initially connect the capture card to your laptop, you'll most likely get a pop-up to install the software you'll need to use with the capture card."

    {
      "title": "Follow the on-screen instructions to install the necessary software.",
      "content": "Follow the on-screen instructions to install the necessary software. According to the capture card you're using, you may need to open the capture card's software first to watch anything from your DVD Player. Not every capture card will ask for software or driver updates, so don't worry if you don't see the installer!"
