Sleep specialists suggest that the best way to change your sleep cycle is by making adjustments in 15-minute increments. [1] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source For example, if you normally get up at 8 A.M. but want to start getting up at 5 A.M., set your alarm for and wake up at 7:45 A.M. Do this for 3 or 4 days until you feel comfortable with the time. Then, shave off another 15 minutes. Do this until you reach your goal time. If you're looking to change your sleep schedule sooner, try 30-minute increments."

While it can be difficult to get up earlier, snoozing doesn't improve the situation and can in fact make you more tired since it doesn't give you the most restful sleep. Instead, get up when the alarm goes off. You can also put your alarm on the other side of the room. That way, when you wake up, you'll have to go to the other side of the room to shut off your alarm.

In other words, you need to stick to the sleep and wake times you set every day of the week—this includes weekends! [3] X Research source You can sleep in a little bit on weekends, but sleep specialists only recommend allowing yourself an extra hour or so (to a maximum of 2 hours). This helps keep you on track for the upcoming work week."

      "content": "Calculate your optimal sleeping time. Most people require 6 to 8 hours of sleep every night, but the exact duration of necessary sleep differs from person to person. Determine when you need to fall asleep in order to wake up at your desired waking time. [4] X Research source One way of figuring this out is to keep a sleep log. Document the hours you sleep every night for a couple of weeks. Average them and then work backward from there to determine what time you need to go to bed to get that average amount of sleep and get up at the time you desire. For example, if you usually sleep for about 6 hours on average and you want to wake up at 5 A.M., plan to fall asleep by 11 P.M. Doctors recommend that you aim for at least 7 hours of sleep every night. [5] X Research source"

Harvard researchers have found that when you eat affects your internal clock; changing when you eat can be helpful in adjusting to changes in your schedule, whether due to work, life, or travel. [6] X Research source Aim to eat your last meal at least 2 to 3 hours before you go to bed. [7] X Research source Then, wake up at the desired time and eat a healthy breakfast containing protein. This helps reset your internal rhythm clock to begin your day, which in turn helps set your new waking pattern in place. Going to bed hungry can negatively impact your sleep, too. [8] X Research source If you get hungry before bed, eat a light and nutritious snack, like peanut butter toast or fruit. Some foods can even promote sleep, like tart cherries.

Make sure your diet is full of fruits, vegetables, protein, and grains. Avoid fatty foods, which can unsettle your stomach.

Doctors advise that you avoid a heavy cardio workout a few hours before you plan to go to bed; this can unsettle your circadian rhythm and make your sleep less restful. That said, light stretching and exercising, such as an evening walk, can help you get ready to go to sleep. [13] X Research source If you're someone who does intense exercises at night but sleeps well afterward, then there is no reason to change your routine. Just know yourself."

[16] X Research source Instead of looking at a screen, read a book, write, or draw. Do something relaxing that calms you or makes you feel restful. You might consider turning down the lights while you do this activity."

This means that many people have a hard time falling asleep when it's still light out, which happens in the summer thanks to daylight savings. [19] X Research source At night, shut your blinds and curtains. Turn off bright overhead lights. Consider getting a blackout curtain that keeps any light from shining through. If it's still too bright or too much light is getting in, consider wearing a sleep mask. In the morning, turn on all the lights once you are awake. This helps kick-start your body for the day."
