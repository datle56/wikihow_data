      "content": "Allow yourself to want to be hot. Maybe you want to look like a hot guy or girl, but you're afraid you’ll be judged or looked down on. For some, wanting to be hot has negative connotations of someone being too vain or shallow. Don’t let these stereotypes and misconceptions stop you from achieving hotness. Give yourself permission to become hot. Being hot should be something you want and not something you feel pressured to be. Today’s society puts a lot of importance in looking attractive in a certain way, but it’s not necessarily the only way to be attractive"

      "content": "Exude self-confidence. In order to be hot, you have to believe you’re hot. Have confidence in your decisions, in the way you look, and in who you are or want to be. It will also help you bounce back from setbacks and accepting difficult challenges that come your way. Remind yourself of what you’ve already achieved and enjoy these successes. Don’t forget how much you’ve accomplished and the goals you’ve reached in the process of trying to reach a new one. Don’t put too much importance on how others perceive you. If looking hot makes you feel happy, then that’s more important than what others might think."

      "content": "Have realistic body image goals. You don’t have to look like a model. You should be the shape you're happy with. Half of that means changing your body through exercise and eating healthy, but the other half is accepting your body's own uniqueness. It's understandable to want to reach a healthy weight level, but it's not realistic to achieve a tiny waist if you're naturally top-heavy or try to make your butt bigger if it's naturally petite. Don't ignore your own assets in the process of trying to mimic someone else's. Avoid labelling a certain body type as the “perfect” body. There are many kinds of bodies that are beautiful in their own way."

      "title": "Figure out what body shape you have and dress to flatter it (for women).",
      "content": "Figure out what body shape you have and dress to flatter it (for women). A great outfit should accentuate your best features and minimize unflattering parts of your body. Here are some ways to dress some common body types: [1] X Research source [2] X Research source Apple or circle shaped: Counter the roundness and softness of your body by adding structure to your outfit, especially on top. Wear a fitted blazer or wrap dresses that create asymmetrical lines across your body. Straight-legged pants help elongate your legs and draw attention to your body vertically. Large prints and patterns will flatter you better than small prints, especially if worn on top. Avoid covering yourself up with large or loose shirts – instead, wear more form fitted items or clothes drape down your body. Pear or triangle shaped: Balance out your great hips by creating layers on top. A cardigan or a jacket cropped at the waist helps even out your slender top half with your curves at the bottom. Show off those great shoulders by wearing one-shouldered shirts or shirts with embellished collars. Boot-cut or slightly flared pants paired with high heels will elongate your legs. Hourglass shaped: You’ve got the shape everyone is looking for! To better show off those sought-after curves, dress simple. Items in solid colours with cinched waists show off your small stomach. Avoid prints that take away the spotlight from your silhouette. Athletic or ruler shaped: Your slender body can sometimes look too boxy so avoid stripes or cropped shirts. Try fitted tank tops with smaller straps, or halter-tops that enhance the look of your bust. High-waist pants and skirts give the illusion of that hourglass shape. Stick with soft fabrics that flow off your body to counter the hard lines of your athletic build."

      "title": "Invest in clothes tailored for your body (for men).",
      "content": "Invest in clothes tailored for your body (for men). Learn what fit suits your body best or go to a tailor to have your clothes fitted for you. There’s nothing worse than wearing clothes that are too baggy or too tight in all the wrong places. Shoulders: The seam where the sleeve attaches to the body should rest on top of your shoulders. They should not hang down onto your arms. Arms: The fabric under your armpits should be tapered to your skin but still allow motion for your arms. Chest: Your chest should fill out the front of your shirt so that its shape can be seen through the fabric. You should also have a full range of motion in your arms. Try reaching up, back, and forward. If you can’t do those things, then your shirt is too tight. Buttons that looked pulled and cause wrinkles are another tell tale sign that your shirt is too tight. Sleeves: If you’re wearing long sleeves, the cuff of your shirt should stop just at the base of your thumb. Pants: If you’re opting for a slim-cut or skinny pant, make sure there is a straight cut from your knees to your ankles. The cuff of your pants should never create flaps or pool at your feet. They should stop just at the ankles or little past your shoes. Belts: They should really only be a way to accessorize and should not actually be holding up your pants. If a belt is the only thing keeping your pants on, then they’re probably too big. [3] X Research source Shoes: Many stylists claim shoes are the foundation of men’s looks. An outfit is dependent on the colour and type of shoe you're wearing. So dress from the shoes up."

      "content": "Polish your look by matching simple colours with bold statement pieces. Solid coloured clothing items make statement pieces pop. Choose statement pieces like large earrings, patterned shoes, a colourful bag, or a fancy hat. Black is always hot and matches with almost anything. An all black outfit gives you a clean look but also gives you a little edge and mystery. Use the power of contrast to your advantage. Darker coloured clothing can help you achieve a more slender look or mask unappealing features. While patterns or light coloured items can highlight areas of your body you’d like to show off."

You’ll know when you’re being too revealing when: It gets in the way of forming meaningful relationships. We live in a sex-fuelled society, so it’s not surprising when people can’t help but look at bare skin. [4] X Research source It can make people perceive you differently or draw focus away from what you have to offer and more towards what you look like to them. If this type of attention is not what you want, then it’s not the right moment to show off too much skin. It prevents you from furthering your career or getting hired. In most work environments, showing off too much skin is discouraged. You receive negative or dangerous attention. It’s difficult for many people, especially women, to show off skin without attracting negative attention. And since you can’t control other people’s reactions and actions, your safety and comfort should always come first."

And a few tricks to improve your body language can help: Stand tall and with purpose. Stick your chest out and keep your hands from fidgeting. The power position is often described with the image of Superman with his hands at his hips, chin high, and legs apart. Move steadily with your actions. Talking too fast or doing things in a hurry shows that you're nervous or anxious. Have a variety of expressions on your face and body. Confident people are able to express themselves naturally but won't overdo it. This makes you more approachable and open."

Fixing your posture can reduce head and back pain, inflexibility, and prevent compromised muscles. Assess your posture so you can work on your body’s problem areas. [5] X Research source Generally, your shoulders should be balanced and one shouldn’t appear higher than the other. They should also be aligned with your ear so your neck and head aren’t jutting forward. Your back should not be rounded and your arms should relax at your sides. Do posture-improving exercises everyday. They can be simple exercises like straightening your back while sitting, walking more, or stretching out those kinks. Or they can be more complicated exercises that stretch and form your back to the correct posture. Be conscious of how you hold yourself. It’s easy to start slumping forward when you’re working at your desk or sitting down and relaxing. Make an effort to sit in the correct position with your back straight, arms back, and head and neck aligned with your shoulders."

Try out different products to make sure they’re right for your skin. Wear sunscreen. It’s the easiest thing to forget but a little sunscreen every day can prevent wrinkles and skin discoloration. Moisturize your skin. Use lotion, cream, or body butter for your hands, arms, legs, and face. Lip balm helps with chapped or cracking lips. For oily skin, use oil-free products to cleanse your face. For acne prone skin, avoid touching your face or popping your pimples. Instead, wash your face with an acne cleanser or warm water and hypoallergenic soap and keep your skin well moisturized. Acne develops when oils, either from your fingers or overactive hormones and glands, mix together with dirt to clog up your pores."
