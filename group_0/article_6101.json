      "title": "Provide bright, indirect light.",
      "content": "Provide bright, indirect light. Spider plants need enough bright, indirect light so the plant will produce flowers and plantlets or spiders. They thrive on windowsills, though they should be set 12-36 inches (30-90 cm) away from south-facing windows during the spring and summer months. They will tolerate lower light levels, in bathrooms, bedrooms and north-facing windows, however, they may not flower or produce spiders in these rooms. It's wise to have two or more plants to switch between higher and lower light areas if you enjoy the appearance of flowers and baby plantlets. Outdoor plants should have moderate to deep shade during the day, as too much direct sunlight may scorch a spider plant so indirect is better. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose well-draining soil or potting soil.",
      "content": "Choose well-draining soil or potting soil. If your spider plant is outdoors, plant it in an area with well-draining soil, such as soil that contains compost or sand. If your spider plant is indoors in a pot, select a high quality potting soil mix that may have peat moss, bark, coco coir, vermiculite and/or perlite. Don't fret too much over the soil, as spider plants are adaptable. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Maintain moderate and consistent temperature and humidity.",
      "content": "Maintain moderate and consistent temperature and humidity. If you live in an area where the temperature fluctuates wildly or reaches extremes, your spider plants will do better indoors. They prefer a temperature between 50 째F (10 째C) to 80 째F (27 째C) and can't thrive in outdoor areas with freezing or searing temperatures. Spider plants can tolerate low household humidity but the addition of a humidifier or pebble tray with water in the same room may help plant health. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Water your spider plant with distilled, bottled or purified water.",
      "content": "Water your spider plant with distilled, bottled or purified water. Spider plants are sensitive to the fluoride in tap water, which can lead to yellow and brown leaf tips. Tap water may leave behind mineral residue on the leaves when watered or misted that are unsightly. Use water at room temperature for watering, as cold or hot water may shock them.

      "title": "Keep the soil moist but not soggy.",
      "content": "Keep the soil moist but not soggy. Gently poke your finger into the soil to see if it is dry. If the top 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so of soil is dry, it's time to water your spider plant. Water moderately or once per week during the first year and subsequent years, should be sufficient to keep the soil consistently moist, but not overly wet. If you prefer, simply lift the pot periodically to determine its weight. Light weight needs water. Empty excess water from the saucer or drainage tray after an hour or so if your spider plant is potted. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Fertilize spider plants every 4 to 6 weeks when growing conditions are good.",
      "content": "Fertilize spider plants every 4 to 6 weeks when growing conditions are good. During the growing season, use a water soluble or controlled release houseplant fertilizer to feed your spider plants. Follow the directions on the fertilizer to know how much of the solution to apply to the soil at the base of the plant. Reduce fertilization for spider plants during the winter or when kept in low light areas. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Transplant your spider plant when it outgrows its container. If your spider plant's roots begin to grow through the drainage holes, you'll need to repot it into a larger container in the spring. Be sure to provide fresh potting soil and choose a container with drainage holes to keep the plant from becoming waterlogged. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Propagate large plants. Divide spider plants that are too large by pulling or cutting the root ball into several sections, each with some leaves, and repotting the sections with fresh potting soil. Alternatively, you can pluck off plantlets and root them in a cup of water. [8] X Research source When propagating the baby plants, it can help to place a cotton ball or wad of napkin in the cup of water to keep the roots from being immersed."

      "content": "Trim dead leaf tips or leaves with scissors. If you notice brown or dead leaves or leaf tips, you can remove them. Snip the tip of the leaf off using scissors. Be sure to use distilled or purified water on your spider plants, as brown leaf tips could indicate buildup of fluoride in the potting soil. [9] X Research source"

Spray a natural insecticide, like neem oil or insecticidal soap, on the plant to rid it of insect pests. You can find them at your local garden shop. [10] X Research source"

If your spider plant is outdoors, transplant it to a shadier location or place a tall plant near it to provide shade. If your spider plant is indoors, move it away from windows so that it receives indirect, rather than direct, sunlight. [11] X Research source"
