      "title": "Include full rank, name, and the branch they served in for official letters.",
      "content": "Include full rank, name, and the branch they served in for official letters. These are uniform rules for addressing a letter across all military branches. If the person is retired (rather than released from active duty or honorably discharged), you can also add the word “Retired” to the end of the address. [2] X Research source For example, you would write “Sergeant Major Jane Doe, USMC, Retired” to address someone who retired from the U.S. Marine Corps. [3] X Research source An official letter would specifically reference the veteran’s service, like if you are asking them to participate in an event as a representative of the armed services.

      "title": "Omit the military branch and the word “Retired” for a social letter.",
      "content": "Omit the military branch and the word “Retired” for a social letter. For example, if you’re sending a holiday card to a neighbor or a wedding invitation, you can use the more familiar address that includes rank and name. These are social events, rather than formal, because they aren’t specifically related to the veteran’s service history. [5] X Research source The address for a social letter would read “Captain John Doe.” Including the military rank will show that you are giving them proper respect. In addition, this is a great way to learn a little more about what that veteran did in the armed services.

    {
      "title": "Include your name and return address on the envelope.",
      "content": "Include your name and return address on the envelope. Or, if you are writing on behalf of another organization, include those details. This way the veteran will know the mail isn’t junk and will be more likely to read it. [7] X Research source If you are writing by hand, try to write legibly."

    {
      "title": "Address a veteran like you would any other person for casual letters.",
      "content": "Address a veteran like you would any other person for casual letters. An informal letter, like one you would send to a friend or family member, doesn’t need to include the same formalities as a formal letter or invitation does. These letters are much more familiar, and it’s okay to just use the veteran’s name. [8] X Research source If you are writing an informal letter to a veteran, chances are you know them. If you think they would be pleased to see their rank included on the letter, then include it! It can be a nice gesture to show you remember their service."
    },
    {
      "title": "Thank them for their service.",
      "content": "Thank them for their service. It’s a general rule of life: Saying “thank you” goes a long way. It’s polite to include a “Sir” or a “Ma’am” when addressing a veteran. Take the time to stop, make eye contact, and genuinely express your gratitude. [9] X Research source If the person you’re talking to is interested in starting a conversation, ask about what branch they served in, where they went, and give them an opportunity to tell their stories. Don’t ask disrespectful questions, like “Have you ever killed anyone?”"

    {
      "title": "Focus on the veteran by not talking about yourself too much.",
      "content": "Focus on the veteran by not talking about yourself too much. Focus on them and their experiences. If they ask questions about your life, of course you can answer. But in general, veterans sometimes feel like they are not seen and heard in society, and you can show respect by giving them your full attention. If the veteran you are talking to doesn’t seem like they want to continue the conversation, it’s okay to simply say, “Thank you for your service,” and move on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask questions about their time in the service.",
      "content": "Ask questions about their time in the service. Be sincere, caring, and compassionate. If you are attending an event hosted by veterans or in support of veterans, take the time to meet a few people and find out more about what they did for your country. Ask about where they served, why they joined the military, what branch they served in, and if they have any stories they could share."
