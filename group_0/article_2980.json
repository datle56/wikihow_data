But depending on what kind of hair you have, you may be able to come up with something different. Whether your hair is long or short, curly or straight, or something in between, aim to find a look that is voluptuous, healthy, and stylish.

      "content": "Take care of your hair so that it doesn’t get damaged and dry. Bombshell hair should be glossy and loose, and it should move naturally (so avoid using too much hairspray or other styling products). For healthy hair, wash and condition your locks every couple of days so that you don’t remove essential oils from your scalp. Avoid using super hot styling products on a daily basis, and give your hair some extra TLC every week with a hair treatment . [2] X Research source Check out dry shampoo if your hair gets greasy on the days you don’t wash it."

      "content": "Make time to do your eyebrows every day so they’re always defined. For a sexy bombshell look, natural, bushy brows are in style right now. Avoid over-plucking your brows, but do take some time to pluck away stray hairs that grow outside of your brow lines. Use an eyebrow pencil or powder to fill in your brows and make them more defined. Pick a color that is close to your natural hair color, or go 1 shade darker for even more definition. [3] X Research source If you hate doing your eyebrows every day, consider having them microbladed. Microblading is a semi-permanent tattoo that will enable you to spend much less time on your brows."

Don’t be afraid to try out different colors: reds, purples, pinks, and nudes are great shades, and there are literally thousands of colors and brands to choose from.

      "content": "Choose clothes that fit you well and that accentuate your curves. Being comfortable and confident in your own skin is a huge part of the bombshell look, and a big part of that is feeling good in the clothes you wear. A classic bombshell is curvy and wears items that highlight their waist, chest, and legs. Pick items that are form-fitting but not overly-tight, and steer clear of baggy or loose clothes. [8] X Research source If you aren’t naturally curvy, that’s okay! Look for items that create a waist, or consider getting undergarments that will help shape your body and make it appear curvier. Consider getting your clothes tailored if you have pieces that you love but that don’t fit you quite right."

      "content": "Wear a form-fitting dress for special evenings out. Every bombshell should have at least two or three dresses in their wardrobe that can be worn to fancy dinners or events. If you go out a lot, consider expanding your wardrobe to include multiple colors and styles of dresses. Look for dresses made out of spandex of similar materials so that the material clings to your body. [9] X Research source A classic red or black dress is a staple of the bombshell wardrobe, so make sure you have at least one of these pieces in your closet. Be careful when choosing your undergarments when wearing a form-fitting dress. Pick underwear, like a thong or shapewear, that will eliminate the chance of visible underwear lines."

      "content": "Finish your outfit with glamorous accessories . Jewelry, purses, clutches, watches, hats, sunglasses, and other items should all be in really good condition and should flow with the style of the rest of your outfit. For example, don’t carry a canvas tote bag in lieu of a leather purse, or something similar. Choose two or three accessories for any given outfit, like a purse, a scarf, and a nice watch. Overdoing it on the number of accessories can make you look bulky and can visually overwhelm, rather than stun. [13] X Research source Try following the rule of opposites: if your outfit is bold, pair it with toned-down accessories. If your outfit is more neutrally-toned, pick a few accents that will pop."

While a lot of being a bombshell is certainly about your looks and how you present yourself, there is a large component that has to do with attitude and with being a genuine person. Chances are, there are some parts of yourself that you might not like very much but that you can’t change—instead of zeroing in on and obsessing over those things, work on accepting them as part of who you are. [15] X Research source Look into the mirror every morning and tell yourself one affirming thing about the way you look. The more you speak positively to yourself, the sooner you’ll start to believe those things."

      "content": "Try to be mysterious to create a sexy aura. Part of the bombshell persona is wrapped up in mystery and sex appeal. You could try keeping your personal life private rather than oversharing on social media and try to keep your emotions concealed so others don’t always know what you’re feeling. You could also create an air of mystery by having your own interests and not always being available for other activities. [16] X Research source People will assume there is more to you than meets the eye, and they will want to know who you really are. Being mysterious captivates others."

[18] X Research source Pay attention to what makes you laugh when you watch television or talk with friends.

Cardio , like running or biking, are good for getting your heart rate up and working off body fat. Weight lifting is also a good option, especially if you want to tone up your muscles even more. Figure out what kinds of movements you like, and create a routine that enables you to work up a sweat most days of the week. [23] X Research source Not only will exercise make you look better, but it’ll also help you feel better, too! Each time you get your heart rate up, your body will release endorphins, which make you feel good.

Take a shower every day, especially if you’re working up a sweat at any point (if you don’t want to wash your hair every day, put it up in a shower cap so it doesn’t get wet). Brush your teeth at least twice a day, floss every evening, and consider using mouthwash to keep your breath smelling fresh. Remember to put on deodorant and to wear clean clothes every day.
