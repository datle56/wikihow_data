      "content": "Look for flights in advance. Booking your tickets in advance can help you to get tickets at a lower rate. [1] X Expert Source Greg Guiteras Travel Specialist Expert Interview. 18 September 2020. The best time to book a domestic flight is between 112 and 21 days before you depart to secure the lowest fare. 54 days before is considered the perfect time. However, even booking 54 days before your trip is not guaranteed to get you the lowest fare. [2] X Research source If you are booking an international plane ticket, you should book as far in advance as possible, especially if your destination is smaller or only has one nearby airport. [3] X Research source If you are flying to a popular destination during a popular time, such as Florida during Spring Break, you should book as far in advance as possible. Because this flight is popular, it is unlikely that the fare will be lowered. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose how many stops you want to make.",
      "content": "Choose how many stops you want to make. Many flights, especially to far away locations, will require you to make stopovers at airports along the way. Sometimes these will involve changing planes and going through security again. As you look at flights, remember to keep in mind how many stops you are comfortable making. Also check how long and what time of day the stops are. You may be able to find a cheaper flight if you're comfortable adding an extra stopover. However, it's important to take into account if the length and time of the stopover is worth the money you will save."
