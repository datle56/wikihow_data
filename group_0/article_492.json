Then, count down your number line, moving the same number of spaces as the second number you’re adding. You’ll land on your answer. [1] X Research source Let’s say you want to add 4+5. Circle 4 on your number line, then count 5 spaces down the line. You will land on 9, which is your answer. Use your number line to add these numbers: 5+3 1+7 6+2 4+4"

Create two piles of beans to represent your problem, including one group of 4 beans and one group of 6 beans. Next, you can combine your two sets of beans to get the answer to your addition problem. Count your beans to see that you now have a total of 10 beans. [2] X Research source If you don’t have beans, you can use any small item that fits in your hand to practice addition! For example, you can use blocks, candies, coins, or legos. Use your beans to add these numbers: 5+3 2+7 3+9 4+1"

Then, count all of the oranges to see how many you have when you add them together, which is 11 oranges. This is your answer. [3] X Research source You can draw any object to represent your numbers, but it’s best to choose something easy. As another option, you can use stickers! Use drawing to add these numbers: 1+7 2+5 8+6 4+3"

The third spot from the left is the “hundreds” place. Here’s an example: In the number 583, the 3 is in the ones place, the 8 is in the tens place, and the 5 is in the hundreds place."

[10] X Research source When you complete the last column on the left, you’ll have your final sum.

You can break the number down into just the hundreds, just the tens, and just the ones. However, using one of the other techniques may be easier when adding big numbers."

This gives you your answer. [15] X Research source For example, let’s say you’re adding -4+-6. You’d circle -4 on your number line. Then, count 6 spaces to the left.
