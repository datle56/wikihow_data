Try not to put all of the blame for something on them and avoid using absolutes like “always” and “never.” [4] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 22 June 2020. It’s just not a healthy way to communicate with your partner. For instance, say, “I feel like I’m not being supported right now” instead of “You never support my dreams.”"

But if an argument gets too emotional or angry, take it upon yourself to try to bring peace so you and your partner can effectively communicate.

      "content": "Try to understand how they may be feeling. Put yourself in their shoes and can help give you more perspective about your relationship. Think about how something might make them feel or how a situation might be affecting them. Use their perspective to help inform your own decisions and behavior. [5] X Research source For example, if you’re upset that your partner forgot to fill the car up with gas before they got home, try thinking about what was going on with them. Maybe they were in a rush to get back to help you with something, or maybe they just had a rough day at work."

And really, you can’t always assume you know what’s going on with your partner, no matter how long you’ve been together. If they seem like something is bothering them, don’t just let it slide and ignore it. Pay attention to any cues they’re giving you and ask them of they want to talk to you about what’s bothering them.

      "content": "Take advantage of opportunities to learn. View honest criticism not as a personal attack but as a chance to improve. It’s a gift to find out the truth about yourself, especially if it’s coming from a place of love and support. Look for the truth in any criticism you receive and use it as fuel and motivation to keep growing and improving.

      "content": "Take responsibility for your own shortcomings. Everyone makes mistakes and falls short sometimes. That’s okay. An important part of becoming a more mature person is taking ownership of those mistakes. Accept responsibility for your actions and resolve to change them rather than get defensive or angry. Focus on things you can do to make up for your mistakes and avoid repeating them in the future. [9] X Research source For example, if you’re upset about a mistake you made at work, don’t get angry at your partner and don’t blame others for your own shortcomings."

If they make mistakes or they do something that makes you upset, do the mature and responsible thing and support them. You’d want them to do the same for you and loving them unconditionally is much more mature than getting into an argument every time they do something that you don’t like. [11] X Research source For example, if your partner forgets to pay the phone bill or something like that, don’t blame them or get angry over their mistake. Instead, tell them you’ll help figure it out and it’s not a big deal."
