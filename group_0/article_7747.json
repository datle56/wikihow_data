      "content": "Use your owner's manual to locate the exhaust manifold. 4-cylinder engines have one exhaust manifold. 6 or 8-cylinder vehicles have two manifolds. Look for the manifold in front of the engine block on a front-end driven vehicle. Find the manifold on the side of the engine block on a rear-driven. This may vary slightly on boat engines or those on other small vehicles."

      "content": "Familiarize yourself with your manifold's design. [1] X Research source Most exhaust manifolds are made of cast iron or a steel alloy similarly able to handle high temperatures. Each manifold has an exhaust port matched to each exhaust outlet on the cylinder head. The exhaust flows through these ports to a single outlet. These ports are openings in an otherwise flat machined surface that fits with a gasket to the surface of the cylinder head. Gaskets, made of paper, asbestos materials, or copper, serve as seals to prevent leakage between the manifold and cylinder head."
