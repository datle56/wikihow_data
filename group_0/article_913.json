For example, you’d say, “Pleased to meet you, Mr. Smith.” Look on your nation’s parliament website to find your MP’s preferred title. It’s important to double check their title instead of making an assumption. For instance, a married woman may prefer to go by Ms. instead of Mrs., or you might not have known that your MP has a doctoral degree. [1] X Research source"

If you’re addressing a speaker in their electoral capacity as their constituent, it’s acceptable to omit “Speaker” from the salutation and envelope address.

If you’re writing to him about a local issue as your elected official, you’d use “Dear Mr Smith,” as your salutation. Your envelope address would just read, “The Honourable Tony Smith, MP,” followed by his constituency's (in this case, Victoria) mailing address. Since you’re addressing him as your MP, you wouldn’t have to include “Speaker of the House of Representatives” in the envelope address. [19] X Research source"
