      "content": "Connect with a photographer. Before getting out there as a model, you should research available photographers in your area. It is best to find a photographer that does headshots and can handle makeup. You will need to have a mild layer of makeup applied for your headshot. Look online for photographers who meet this criteria. You might also have luck finding a good photographer through an agency you’re in contact with."

      "content": "Pay for headshots. Yes, you will need to pay for a good photographer to do your headshots. It is a vulnerable part of the process, but being a model is a vulnerable job. You want the highest quality you can afford. It is best if your photographer or agency can do make up. A good photographer will take several photos, sometimes up to a hundred. Then they'll communicate to you which one you'd like to use. Some headshots are taken outside, and others are shot indoors at a studio. Both of these can be effective, if done by the right photographer."

If not, go online and research nearby modeling agency. It is better to pick an agency that is close to you as opposed to commuting over an hour.

If you are drafting an email, be sure to include an attachment of your headshot. Include any relevant information about previous jobs or something associated with acting/theater.

You don’t have to move to L.A. or New York to become a model, although it doesn’t hurt. If you live in a small or rural town, research the nearest city.

Unless the job offends your moral outlook on life, you should take the job. Having modeling experience will also show future employers that you know what it means to be a model. It might be easiest for you to start as a parts model. Parts modelling focuses on a zoom in of a part of your body like your hands. Another popular form of modeling that is open for different models is catalog work. Catalog modeling is becoming more popular to represent multiple body sizes to represent the common person flipping through a clothing catalog. You can still be a professional model if you're short. Kate Moss is a perfect example—even though it was years ago, she got signed in New York despite being 3 in (7.6 cm) shorter than the requirement.

      "content": "Assemble a group of photos. For a beginner model, you should include 5-8 photos for your portfolio. The key to having a successful portfolio is it’s ability to convey the range of modeling you can do. If you have a few photos using one photographer, reach out and work with other artists. The beauty of photographs is that they rarely convey your height, unless you stand next to something that shows a scale. Avoid any photographs with other people if they are much taller than you. You should show your ability to demonstrate different characters. One way is to try an array of different wardrobes and makeup styles. If one of your photos is in black and white, but you think it is a great picture that is different from the rest, include it to the portfolio."

For example, if you are passionate about cooking, include a tasteful photo of you in the kitchen. You should make sure to include a wide array of photos, but don't feel like you can't include any personal photos. Include a unique attribute about yourself that isn't inhibited by being short. For example, you can portray a range of faces. This type of attribute will show your skills and agencies might be less concerned with your height. Sometimes personalized photographs will stand out more for agencies."

Follow other models on social media and see the range they can portray. Spend time in front of the mirror practicing different looks and body poses. You should be able to portray an emotion if a photographer asks for it on the spot. Work on developing faces that express some of the quintessential emotions like being happy, sad, frustrated, confused, or awe-struck. Develop subtle and exaggerate versions of each emotion to widen your range as a model."

Some firms will hire you as a teen model, even if you're 25 years old because of your height and proportions. Some other avenues you can choose are body parts modeling and face/beauty modeling. Evaluate what parts of your body you find the most appealing. For example, if you think you have above average feet, market them. If you are constantly being complemented for your eyes and beauty of your face, market your face as a platform for make-up modeling."

You need to seek out realistic jobs instead of striving for the runway. The runway is not as realistic for a model under 5'6. There is, however, plenty of other types of jobs doing commercial, catalog, and print based modeling. Strive for your goals as a model, but if certain avenues don't pan out, seek out more attainable jobs. Try applying to be a commercial model instead of a fashion model. Unlike fashion models, commercial models have no age or height requirements. [8] X Expert Source Traci Halvorson Modeling Agent Expert Interview. 17 June 2021."
