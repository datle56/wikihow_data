      "title": "No, unfortunately you can't search for people on Facebook Dating.",
      "content": "No, unfortunately you can't search for people on Facebook Dating. Facebook Dating is an add-on feature to your Facebook profile, and it doesn't have a search feature. You're only shown people whose search criteria and preferences line up with yours. If you think your partner is using Facebook Dating without you knowing, they've likely altered their privacy settings to block you from encountering them as a potential match. While you can't find a cheating partner on Facebook Dating, you might be able to find a crush if your preferences perfectly match with theirs (meaning Facebook Dating will recommend them as a potential match). There are other “loopholes” for finding your crush on FB Dating, like naming them a Secret Crush, which we'll talk about more below."

      "title": "Make yourself a Facebook Dating profile.",
      "content": "Make yourself a Facebook Dating profile. Making a Facebook Dating profile for yourself is the first step! However, this method only makes sense if you’re hoping to find your crush listed as a potential match, not if you’re trying to catch a cheating spouse. If you’re single and you’ve got your eyes set on one particular cutie, you could be shown to them as a possible suitor as long as your preferences line up. [1] X Research source You must be 18 years of age or older, live in a country where Facebook Dating is available, and have a good standing with Facebook for at least a month. You must also have either an Apple or Android phone, as the Facebook Dating add-on is only available on mobile devices."

      "title": "Find mutual friends.",
      "content": "Find mutual friends. Facebook Dating works by listening to your preferences and suggesting matches within a certain social range. You can be matched based on things like height, age and education. You can then pick the “Suggest friends of friends” option, if your crush happens to be a friend of a friend. This is the most straightforward way of figuring out if someone in your friend group, or just outside of it, has a dating profile on Facebook. This is no guarantee that you’ll actually cyber-stumble upon your crush, as both of your preferences must align in order for you to be shown to them as a match. Ultimately, you can only chat with people that you end up matching with."

    {
      "title": "Narrow down your preferences.",
      "content": "Narrow down your preferences. If you’re trying to connect with one specific person, try narrowing down your search criteria as much as possible. Preference options include age, gender identity, distance from you, and whether or not they have children. If you have all of these details about the person you’re trying to match with, you can simply select all the right preferences so that your crush is most likely to be a suggested match. For example, if your romantic interest is 22, set your age range to 22 years old and only 22. If they definitely don’t have children, set your criteria to reflect that. Again, their preferences must also align with yours, which can throw a wrench in the mix. [2] X Research source You can narrow your suggested matches even further by selecting the “This is a strong preference” in the search for your perfect match."

      "title": "Use the “Secret Crush” feature.",
      "content": "Use the “Secret Crush” feature. Once you sign up for Facebook Dating, you’ll have the option of adding your crush to your Secret Crush list, which will send them a notification that they have a secret admirer. If your crush adds you to their Secret Crush list, both of your identities will be revealed and you'll become matches. If your crush doesn't add you to their Secret Crush list, your identity won't be revealed. They'll just receive a notification that they have a secret admirer, and you'll remain anonymous. It’s important to note that the Secret Crush feature will only work if your crush has an active Facebook Dating profile."

      "content": "Yes, you can search for their regular Facebook Profile after you’ve matched with them on Facebook Dating. It’s normal to be curious about someone’s Facebook profile after seeing them on the Dating side, as it could reveal additional information. You can do this by typing their name into the Facebook search bar. The person is more likely to pop up quickly if you have friends in common, although it’s also possible that they won’t pop up at all as some people prefer to keep their profile private, especially if they’re dating. [3] X Research source If your search yields no results, try logging out of Facebook to see if this bypasses their strict privacy settings."

      "content": "Observe any changes in their routine or behavior. In some more serious situations, the person you’re investigating may already be your romantic partner. Some people report a “gut feeling” that their spouse is cheating, which is already a red flag that there’s trouble afoot. However, there are a few other tell-tale signs they’re getting some action on the side, which can come in the form of improved appearance, changes in sexual activity, and secretive phone use.

      "content": "Voice your concerns to them. If you’ve picked up on clues that your partner is being unfaithful, try opening up the dialogue about your relationship . As long as you feel safe, ask them directly if they’re cheating on you or not and then react accordingly. If you’ve found no evidence but still feel like they may be up to something, investigate why you feel that way. It could be insecurity, jealousy, or projection. [5] X Research source Recent studies have shown that those in relationships who are attracted to other people were more likely to accuse their own partners of cheating."

      "content": "No, your Facebook Dating profile isn't searchable unless it's linked to your regular profile. Your Dating profile is separate from your regular Facebook profile, meaning you have to actively select to link them. If you do link them, that will allow your friends– or anyone who visits your profile, depending on your settings– to see that you are on Facebook Dating. Your settings allow you to bypass any friends as potential matches, granting you even more privacy. [6] X Research source You can also narrow down your search criteria so that it shows you matches just beyond your inner circle of friends, giving you the option of filtering out random strangers seeing your profile. Facebook Dating is only available on your mobile phone, and not on any other platform. These measures are in place to protect you, as well, since there is no way for other people to find your Facebook Dating profile unless you’ve matched with them."
