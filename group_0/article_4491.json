      "content": "Rack the balls tightly with the 8 ball in the middle. Gather the balls and put them in the rack. Align the base of the rack so it is parallel to the back of the pool table. For games of 8 ball (stripes and solids), put the 8 ball in the center of the rack. Put a solid ball in one corner, and a striped ball in the other corner. Then, press the balls together tightly, so that all of the balls are in contact with one another. [1] X Research source Other than the corners and the 8 ball in the middle, the rest of the balls are arranged randomly. Don’t bother trying to alternate between strips and solids. It is generally considered good sportsmanship to put a solid at the front of the rack, but it’s not mandatory. For 9 ball: Rack the balls in a diamond shape with the 1 ball in the head spot up front and the 9 ball in the middle. For 10 ball: Rack the balls in a triangle (with a missing back row) with the 1 ball in front at the head spot and the 10 ball in the middle. For straight pool or one pocket: Rack the balls in a full triangle with the balls randomly arranged."

      "content": "Check the balls to confirm there are no gaps in the rack. The balls will not break correctly if the balls are loose in the rack. Every ball must be tightly tucked against the other surrounding balls. After removing your rack, look closely at the balls to see if there are any gaps. Even a millimeter of space will mess with the break, so redo the rack if you find any air. [2] X Research source If you break and there are gaps in the rack, it is known as a “dead rack.” Seasoned players can spot dead rack tables because the balls don’t break fully—some balls come flying off the rack while most of them just sit in a clump at the racking spot."

      "title": "Place the cue ball anywhere behind the headstring.",
      "content": "Place the cue ball anywhere behind the headstring. You can put the cue ball anywhere on or behind the head string, which is the quarter of the pool table furthest away from the rack. You know you’re behind the head string if the cue ball is underneath the imaginary line you draw between the second diamond on each side of the table. [3] X Research source The area below the head string is often affectionately referred to “the kitchen” by seasoned players."

    {
      "title": "Stand behind the cue ball with your feet spread apart.",
      "content": "Stand behind the cue ball with your feet spread apart. Spread your feet out a little past shoulder-width. Lean forward from the waist with your knees slightly bent. Hold the pool cue with both hands with the cue directed towards the cue ball. Find a hip width that feels right for you. [4] X Research source A wider stance will give you more stability, but at the cost of power. A narrower stance will allow for more momentum as you move your hips forward through the shot, but you may lose some accuracy."

      "title": "Place your hand on the table in a closed bridge.",
      "content": "Place your hand on the table in a closed bridge. Put your hand on the table, then lay the pool cue across the middle of your thumb and middle finger. Curl your index finger around the cue. Then, touch your index finger with your middle finger and thumb so that you have a circle around the shaft. Spread your fingers for greater stability. Your bridge hand should be loose and relaxed to ensure accuracy. [5] X Research source Since your torso will move up when you hit the ball, a closed bridge will prevent your tip from rising up and help ensure greater accuracy. [6] X Research source The open bridge variation: If the closed bridge just feels too awkward, it’s okay to use an open bridge. Put your hand flat on the table and arch the fingers up so your hand makes a little gap. Stick your thumb out and set the cue on top of the valley formed by your thumb and pointer finger."

    {
      "title": "Set the distance between your bridge hand and the ball.",
      "content": "Set the distance between your bridge hand and the ball. Some people prefer a slightly longer bridge distance on their break shot. For instance, some people set up their bridge hand 8–10 inches (20–25 cm) from the ball, which allows for greater force. However, if your bridge distance is too great, you may compromise your accuracy. Experiment until you find a distance that works well for you. [7] X Research source Your stance should be comfortable. If you feel “off,” keep readjusting your position in relationship to the ball until it feels right to you."

      "title": "Move your back hand into position behind your shoulder.",
      "content": "Move your back hand into position behind your shoulder. With your back hand, hold the back of the pool cue with a firm grip (but not so firm that your knuckles are turning white). Close your fingers around the pool cue. Bring it into position, which is behind your shoulder and just above your hip. [8] X Research source Some people prefer a longer backswing, which allows for greater force in the break shot. Some people prefer to choke up slightly on the backswing, which can ensure greater accuracy."

      "title": "Line up your cue with the cue ball.",
      "content": "Line up your cue with the cue ball. Unless you’re employing a particular strategy, you’re probably best off aiming just below the center of the cue ball. By hitting just below the center, the cue ball will stop in the middle of the table after the break. With the cue ball in the middle of the table, you’ll be in a much better position for your next shot! [9] X Research source You’d be surprised how hard it actually is to hit the cue ball accurately when you’re swinging hard! If you find yourself “losing the cue ball” and scratching or failing to hit the rack right, slow down a little."

      "title": "Scan the line between the cue ball and the object ball.",
      "content": "Scan the line between the cue ball and the object ball. Start by glancing back and forth between the cue ball and the head ball. Once you feel comfortable with the shot, direct your focus to either the head ball or the cue ball. Keep your eyes on the ball before shooting! [10] X Research source Take a few practice strokes while you’re lining up. Slowly move the cue back and forth so that it lines up with the imaginary line between the cue and the object ball."

    {
      "title": "Pull your cue back slowly with your back hand.",
      "content": "Pull your cue back slowly with your back hand. Bring your back hand behind your shoulder and just above your hips. If you want more of a backswing, you can bring it back a little further. Steady your bridge hand, relax, and get ready to shoot! [11] X Research source You want a smooth, controlled backswing with full follow-through. A steady, square impact carries more force than a lightning-fast shank."

    {
      "title": "Shoot the cue ball.",
      "content": "Shoot the cue ball. Hit the cue ball with the cue stick. Move your body forward from the hips to apply more power in your break shot. Let your torso move up at the end of the stroke. Your cue stick should be pointing towards the back of the table when you finish. Follow-through is extremely important. Do not slow down your cue after making contact."

      "title": "Make direct contact with the object ball.",
      "content": "Make direct contact with the object ball. To break the rack effectively, hit the head object ball directly on target. Apply sufficient force to distribute the balls around the table. However, it is best to relax and focus on a square hit, as opposed to trying to apply excessive force. The main thing is to hit the head ball squarely! [12] X Research source The force in the break shot comes from the legs and hips. Move your hips forward to achieve greater force."

      "title": "Try the cut break strategy for an easy way to stay on the table.",
      "content": "Try the cut break strategy for an easy way to stay on the table. The cut break is widely considered the most consistent way to pocket a ball on the break. Set the cue ball one ball-sized gap away from the edge of the second diamond in the kitchen. Then (in 8 ball), aim at the second ball in the rack on your side of the table and hit it with bottom inside English. This should send the head ball right into the side pocket! [13] X Research source In 9 ball, the cut break is made from the same location on the table. The only difference is that you strike the 1 ball with a half-ball hit to send it flying into the side. No English needed."

      "title": "Fine-tune your break shot by watching where the balls land.",
      "content": "Fine-tune your break shot by watching where the balls land. Take a moment after each shot to note the position of the cue ball and the formation on the table. If the cue ball tends to drive forward after impact, hit it lower for more backspin. If it likes to veer off toward the sides, hit it slower for greater accuracy and power. If you are close to sinking the two balls behind the cue ball, think about how you could fine tune your shot to sink them in the corner pockets."
    },
    {
      "title": "Adjust your break location if you aren’t pocketing balls.",
      "content": "Adjust your break location if you aren’t pocketing balls. Every pool table plays differently. If a cut break isn’t working, move to the middle of the table and break from there. If that isn’t working, try breaking from the corner of “the box” which is where the second diamonds intersect with one another on the headstring. [14] X Research source You can even try breaking from closer to the bottom rail if you want to set your hand on something other than the table felt."

    {
      "title": "Prioritize solid contact and accuracy over power.",
      "content": "Prioritize solid contact and accuracy over power. It’s much better to hit the rack with a little less power if it means you’re making clean and solid contact with the object ball you’re aiming at. Losing the cue ball is disastrous—even if you do make a ball or two on the break. [15] X Research source Look at the cue ball after you break. If it’s flying all over the place, spinning in place, or running towards a pocket, you’re losing the cue ball and may benefit from reducing your power a little bit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Transfer your weight as you make contact.",
      "content": "Transfer your weight as you make contact. The power in the break comes from your legs and hips, not your arms. On the backswing, keep the weight firmly planted in your back foot. As you hit the ball, turn your hips slightly and shift the weight to your front foot. The power will flow through your legs and into the cue as you hit. [16] X Research source Some pro players will even hop a little bit at the end of their break and bounce on their front foot. This is all a consequence of that weight shift!"

      "content": "Purchase a break cue if you’re playing regularly. A break cue is a special cue designed specifically for breaking. These cues are stiffer and have tips on them designed to send the cue ball flying. If you’re going to continue playing regularly, invest in a break cue to maximize your game. [17] X Research source It’s actually not ideal to use a super heavy break cue. You’re best off sticking to 18-21 ounces, the same as a standard playing cue."
