      "content": "Leave treats out in these easy-to-spot places to excite squirrels. Lure squirrels into your yard by scattering different foods they like at the bottom of trees and shrubs. Feeding squirrels by putting snacks out where they're easy to find might encourage squirrels to nest in your yard. Since squirrels tend to bury nuts and forget where they put them, they’ll definitely enjoy discovering new nuts, like walnuts , hazelnuts , and acorns . [1] X Research source Give squirrels nuts that are in their shells—these give their jaws a great workout. That way, squirrels can eat foods with hard shells or tough skin. [2] X Research source If you’d like to mix up their diet and give them nutritious goodies, drop veggies—like broccoli, squash, and mushrooms—under your trees. [3] X Research source While you'll find a lot of places selling dried corn cobs for squirrels, corn isn't great for their gut health and doesn't offer these critters any nutritional value. Squirrels also enjoy making a feast out of any fruit that falls off of trees or bushes. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Line up these yummy surprises on branches to make squirrels curious. Hide these goodies on high branches or near hollows where squirrels may like to nest. These treats will likely inspire squirrels to climb your trees to grab them. You can buy pre-made nut balls at pet stores and garden supply stores. [5] X Research source If you want to show squirrels your love with homemade nut balls, combine: [6] X Research source 1 cup (240 mL) infant rice cereal 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) ground pecans 1 tablespoon (15 mL) brewer's yeast powder 1 teaspoon (5 mL) lecithin 1 1/2 teaspoons (7 mL) KAL brand dolomite powder ( for calcium ) 1/4 teaspoon (1 mL) iodized salt 1 1/2 teaspoon (7 mL) Cod liver oil ( for vitamin A and vitamin D ) 1-2 teaspoons (5-10 mL ) olive oil 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) unsweetened applesauce Mix the ingredients into a dough, roll it out so it's flat, and cut out squares. Dry the squares in a food dehydrator at 160 °C (320 °F). As another option, let the squares dry in the sun for 2 days. Store homemade nut balls in the freezer to avoid mold or rancid oil. Feed each squirrel 1-2 nut balls a day."

      "content": "A feeder that's full of tasty favorites will draw squirrels over. You can use either a feeder specifically made for squirrels or a bird feeder . To fill the feeder, take the top off of the feeder and fill the container up to the top. The feeder will automatically dispense food as squirrels eat from it. [7] X Research source You can find squirrel or bird feeders at garden or hardware stores. Some pet stores or outdoor stores also carry squirrel feed . Skip “squirrel-proof” bird feeders since they're designed to keep squirrels away. Refill the feeders once a week or when squirrels empty them out."

      "content": "Water is just as important as food to squirrels. Make sure that your yard has several sources of clean water that are easy for squirrels to find. Sources of fresh, running water are ideal, but you can also put out shallow containers of water—just make sure to change the water every day! [8] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source A bowl, basin, or bird bath is a cheap and easy way to give squirrels water since they need little to no setup. If you already have a fountain installed, it’ll provide a constant stream of fresh, running water that’s convenient for squirrels."

      "content": "Shrubs give squirrels nice hiding spots so they feel safe. Plant shrubs that squirrels can hide in if they get scared. Shrubs that produce nuts or berries are especially attractive to these shy but hungry critters. Plus, starter shrubs may provide an easier and cheaper alternative to planting trees. [9] X Research source Some good shrubs for squirrels include hazelnut plants, hedgerows, and any berry bush, including those that grow mulberries, elderberries, blueberries, or raspberries."

      "content": "Trees give squirrels security since they can make homes out of them. Squirrels use trees for cover while they run around and look for food. Trees also give squirrels great spots to nest and raise their babies—you may end up feeding several generations of squirrels! To plant trees that are already fully grown, visit a local nursery or tree farm. [10] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source Choose trees that grow well in your climate so squirrels can depend on them for hiding and nesting spots. Squirrels especially like trees that produce nuts and have hollows that they can nest in. Good trees include willows, aspens, spruces, and pine trees. When food isn't immediately available, squirrels will even chew on tree bark."

      "content": "Provide nesting boxes so squirrels can cozy up inside them. Nesting boxes give squirrels a place to live in and store their nuts. You can also use bird nesting boxes or houses. Mount the box or house to a tree, fence, or pole that's 10 feet (3.0 m) above the ground and away from strong winds. Alternatively, you can hang boxes from sturdy branches as long as they're 10 feet (3.0 m) over the ground and safe from harsh wind conditions. To encourage squirrels to use the nesting boxes, you can place nuts or sunflower seeds inside. Remember birds and other rodents might be drawn to the snacks, too. If pests, like rats, are a problem for you, then keep all food tightly secure inside a feeder. Rats and other vermin won't be able to smell it. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Dead trees are ideal for squirrels because they have holes to nest in. If you have a tree that is dying or already dead, let it naturally decay on your land. Squirrels like nesting and hiding food in dead trees because they have lots of holes and crevices. Just make sure that the tree is not in danger of falling on people or nearby houses. If you're worried about whether keeping a dead tree is safe or not, contact an arborist—or tree trimmer—in your area, who can evaluate the tree for you. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Squirrels will feel safe in your yard if you stop pets from chasing them. Dogs and cats can frighten or even hunt squirrels. Try to keep pets out of any areas where you want squirrels. If you have animals that go out into your yard often, try to install a fence around a sectioned off area that’s just for the squirrels. [13] X Research source Supervise your pets whenever you see squirrels feasting on the snacks you’ve left outside."

      "content": "These handy tools help you make noises squirrels are familiar with. Squirrel calls typically have a wooden or metal end as well as a rubber end. Most of these squirrel calls fit into the palm of your hand. These convenient tools are very affordable and usually cost between $10 and $30 USD. [14] X Research source Look towards trees, shrubs, and other plants since these are popular places for squirrels to hide. Then, turn slightly away so you'll keep these critters calm. [15] X Research source Tap the squirrel call to activate its sounds. Using one hand, hold the call by the wooden end and tap the rubber end against the palm of your other hand. Each of your taps will make a squirrel noise. Tap it repeatedly to make a unique series of sounds that squirrels feel naturally drawn to. When you use a squirrel call and make a sound similar to the way a squirrel eats, squirrels may think it is safe to come out."
