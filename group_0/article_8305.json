You can typically wash your cover with the rest of your clothes if it's made of cotton. If the cover is made of a delicate material like silk you'll want to run it through a separate, delicate wash. If the cover is made of silk, make sure to air dry the cover instead of putting it in your dryer or it may shrink or get damaged."
