      "content": "Heat 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil in a skillet and dry the fillets. Set a heavy skillet on the stove and pour in the oil. Turn the burner to medium-high and heat the oil until it shimmers. While the oil heats, set 2 pounds (0.91 kg) of grouper fillets on a plate and pat them dry with a paper towel. Drying the grouper will help the seasoning stick to the fish. Heat the oil just until it shimmers, but before it begins smoking."

      "content": "Coat the fillets in seasoning and flour. Sprinkle the seasoning mixture over both sides of the grouper fillets. Use your hands to gently press it into the fish so it sticks. Then put 1/2 cup (60 g) of flour into a shallow dish and lay the fillets in it. Flip the fillets over so they're lightly coated in the flour. Add more flour to the dish if your grouper fillets are large. The flour coating will make the fish crispy as it pan-fries."

      "content": "Lay the fish fillets in the hot skillet and cook them for 4 minutes. The fish should start sizzling as soon as it hits the hot skillet. Arrange the fillets so they're in a single layer and pan-fry them for 4 minutes without moving them in the skillet."

      "content": "Flip and cook the fish for 4 more minutes. Use a fish spatula to carefully flip each fillet over. Leave them to cook for 4 more minutes without moving them again. This will ensure that the fish fillets cook completely and evenly. Once the grouper has finished cooking, you should be able to flake center of the fish with the tines of a fork."

Transfer the fish to plates and serve the fillets immediately. To store leftover fish, put it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 or 4 days. Keep in mind that the fish will soften as it's stored, so if you want crispy fish, try to eat it the same day you pan-fry it."
