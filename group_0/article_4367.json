      "title": "Stand with your feet together and relax your butt.",
      "content": "Stand with your feet together and relax your butt. Your feet should be at a normal stance with your feet under your hips, but less than shoulder-width apart. Feel free to take your hands and massage your butt so it’s as loose as possible. Having tension in your butt will prevent your butt cheeks from clapping together. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Bounce on your toes to make your booty clap.",
      "content": "Bounce on your toes to make your booty clap. Slowly rise up on your toes and shift your weight to the balls of your feet. With your upper body relaxed, bounce up and down on your toes. [2] X Research source Focus on bringing your booty down with each movement to clap your butt cheeks together. [3] X Research source Keep your feet and legs together, and relax your entire body—do not squeeze your butt cheeks! Try putting your hands against a wall for support. Leaning on the wall will allow you to bounce faster without feeling like you’re going to fall over."

      "title": "Alternatively, keep your feet flat and bend your knees quickly.",
      "content": "Alternatively, keep your feet flat and bend your knees quickly. Instead of bouncing on your toes, you can move your knees to make your booty clap. Plant your feet flat on the ground and bend your knees up and down at a fast pace. [4] X Research source This motion should travel up your legs so your butt cheeks jiggle! Keep in mind that booty clapping is easier for people that have a big butt, but it’s still possible for those with smaller butts. Practice over and over until you nail the movement!"

      "title": "Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and loosen your glutes.",
      "content": "Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and loosen your glutes. Start by spreading your legs apart so they’re in line with your shoulders, and relax your butt cheeks as much as possible. Keep your legs straight and plant your feet firmly on the ground so you maintain balance while clapping your booty together. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Rise onto your tippy toes and move your heels in and out.",
      "content": "Rise onto your tippy toes and move your heels in and out. Keep your legs straight and rotate your heels side to side, in opposite directions. When you do this, both of your ankles will go inward at the same time, then outward at the same time. This is the basic movement you want to do across your legs so your butt cheeks clap together. [6] X Research source Make sure your glutes are loose and relaxed so your booty can jiggle. If you’re struggling to maintain balance, hold onto the wall or the back of a chair. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Rotate your thighs in and out, then speed up your movements.",
      "content": "Rotate your thighs in and out, then speed up your movements. Once you’re comfortable moving your feet in and out, keep your feet still and try to isolate the same movement in your thighs. When you rotate your thighs outward, your butt will pop out. When you rotate your thighs inward, your butt will go in. [8] X Research source If you’re struggling to make your booty clap, think of rotating your knees inward and outward. Once you’re comfortable moving your thighs in and out, arch your back and speed it up to make your booty clap!"

You can place your hands on the back of your head to help you focus on clapping your butt cheeks together. [9] X Research source If needed, hold onto a wall or chair for extra support."

      "title": "Bend your knees and rotate them in and out.",
      "content": "Bend your knees and rotate them in and out. Move your knees in opposite directions, letting your thighs, feet, and toes follow naturally. [10] X Research source When you rotate your knees outward, your toes will turn out to a 45-degree angle. When you rotate your knees inward, your toes will follow to form a 145-degree angle. You can put your hands on your knees or upper thighs for support."

      "title": "Swing your hips back when you rotate your knees inward to booty clap.",
      "content": "Swing your hips back when you rotate your knees inward to booty clap. When you move your knees inward, push your hips and butt back. Then, swing your hips forward when you move your knees outward. [11] X Research source Repeat this movement 10-20 times until it feels comfortable and you can get your booty cheeks to clap. [12] X Research source Keep in mind that nailing the booty clap takes a lot of practice. If you don’t get it the first time, keep trying and record yourself to see if you’re doing something wrong."
