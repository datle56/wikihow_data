      "content": "Trim the fat and cut the meat into small cubes. Using a kitchen knife, cut excess pieces of fat from your beef then cube it. After cutting, your beef should be in pieces less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide. Now you can cut them up even smaller into bite-sized diced beef pieces. If you bought pre-cut beef tips, move on to the next step. Remove any pieces of fat, gristle, or silvery membrane remaining."
