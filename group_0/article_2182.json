      "title": "Spread out the consumption.",
      "content": "Spread out the consumption. Instead of drinking the entire energy drink at once, spread it out over the course of a couple hours. Not only will this prevent huge spikes in your adrenaline, dopamine, and insulin levels, it will also prevent the dips that cause the crash. [1] X Research source Drink one to two ounces (30 to 60 ml) every 15 minutes rather than drinking it all at once."

      "content": "Eat regularly throughout the day. Avoid drinking caffeine on an empty stomach, as this could cause greater hormone spikes and dips. [2] X Research source To help your body metabolize the caffeine and sugar more steadily and to keep your energy levels consistent, eat healthy foods throughout the day (spread out over four meals), including: Carbohydrates, such as pasta, cereal, and potatoes [3] X Research source Whole grains Fruits, nuts, and vegetables [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Consume energy drinks at the right time.",
      "content": "Consume energy drinks at the right time. Caffeine can be a great way to give yourself some extra alertness, but there are optimal times of day to consume it to get the most benefits. During the day, your body has natural spikes in cortisol, which is a stress hormone, and you should avoid drinking caffeine during these spikes. The best times to drink caffeine are: Between 9:30 and 11:30 a.m. Between 1:30 and 5 p.m."

      "title": "Avoid energy drinks with sugar.",
      "content": "Avoid energy drinks with sugar. Although the caffeine in energy drinks can cause its own crash, a sugar crash will prolong and exacerbate the effects. [5] X Research source For one, sugar crashes can be worse than caffeine crashes, and the two don’t occur at the same time. While the effects of caffeine will last for at least five hours, a sugar crash will occur within about two hours. [6] X Research source To avoid extra calories and the sugar crash, look for sugar-free energy drinks."

      "title": "Look for energy drinks that contain electrolytes and glycogen.",
      "content": "Look for energy drinks that contain electrolytes and glycogen. This is particularly important for athletes looking for extra energy during endurance training. Your body loses electrolytes when you sweat, and your muscles burn off glycogen during long workouts, so it’s important to replenish these stores during workouts that exceed an hour. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Stay hydrated.",
      "content": "Stay hydrated. While caffeine alone won’t dehydrate your body, certain energy drinks can, especially if they contain a lot of sugar. To prevent dehydration from energy drinks, be sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day. Dehydration can cause sleepiness, irritability, headaches, and confusion, which will only make an energy drink crash worse.

Homemade energy drinks, electrolyte drinks, smoothies, and protein shakes can be consumed in the morning or during the day for an extra burst of energy. For a refreshing iced tea: [9] X Research source Boil one cup (240 ml) of water. Pour it over four grams (or two tea bags) of loose-leaf green tea and two grams (one bag) of yerba maté tea. Steep for five minutes, then remove the tea bags or strain the leaves. Stir in 1.5 tablespoons (22.5 g or ml) of sweetener, such as honey, sugar, or maple syrup, and two tablespoons (15 ml) fresh lemon juice. Cool to room temperature.

If you're looking for ways to boost your overall energy, you can do this with proper diet, exercise, and getting enough sleep.

      "content": "Get lots of sleep. Sleep isn't just necessary to ensure you make it through the day without falling asleep: it’s also essential to your brain and body, and without enough sleep, neither will function properly. While everybody is different, anyone over the age of 14 needs between seven and 10 hours of sleep per night in order to give the brain time to rejuvenate. [16] X Research source Caffeine consumption can actually create a vicious cycle, because while you might have a coffee after a long night when you didn’t get enough sleep, that caffeine can actually prevent you from sleeping properly the next night, which will result in you being tired again the following morning."

      "title": "Exercise regularly.",
      "content": "Exercise regularly. Exercise increases your energy on two fronts. On the one hand, physical activity promotes blood flow, which carries more oxygen and nutrients to your cells, giving your body more fuel to burn. On the other hand, exercise also promotes better sleep, which in turn leads to you feeling more energized as well. [17] X Research source To get the most out of your days, make sure that physical activity is a regular part of your routine. Healthy adults should aim for at least 2.5 hours of moderate activity per week. This can include working in the yard, brisk walks, or leisurely swims. Healthy adults who are more active should aim for faster paced exercises, such as swimming laps, jogging, or stair and hill climbing."

If you want to consume caffeine, try black coffee or tea instead of energy drinks. Coffee, which contains more caffeine than tea, should be consumed in small amounts over the course of a day, rather than all at once.
