Include not just the money you get from work but any cash you get from things like side-hustles, alimony, or child support. If you share expenses with your partner, calculate your combined income to figure out a household budget. [4] X Research source You should aim to have your overall monthly spending not exceed what you bring in. Emergencies and unforeseen occasions happen, but try to set a goal of not using your credit card to cover non-necessary items when your bank balances are low."

Paying these expenses should be your first priority, as these items are not only necessary for daily activities but could also damage your credit if you fail to pay them in full and on time. [5] X Research source Such expenses may include your mortgage or rent, utilities, car payments, and credit card payments, as well as things like your groceries, gas, and insurance. Set up your bills on autopay to make them easy to prioritize. This way the money comes out of your account on the day the bill is due. Set up autopay only if you're sure you'll have enough money each month to pay those bills in full."

Investing in a good coffee pot and a mug, for example, can help you save on your morning fix for years to come. Don’t forget your longer-term expenses. Check things like insurance policies, and see if there are places you can scale back. If you are paying for collision and comprehensive insurance on an old car, for example, you may opt to scale back to liability insurance only. [7] X Research source"

Aim to save something each month, however, whether it’s $50 or $500. Keep that money in a savings account separate from your primary bank account so that it doesn't accidentally get spent. [10] X Research source This savings should be separate from your 401(k) or any other investments that you have. Building a small general-savings balance will help you protect yourself financially if an emergency comes up, such as a major repair on the house or unexpectedly losing your job. Many financial experts recommend a target savings of six months’ worth of expenses. If you have a lot of debt you need to pay down, aim for a partial emergency fund of two months' expenses. Then focus the rest of your cash on your debt."

If you have a short-term loan (a car loan, for example), pay that down, too, as quickly as possible. Such loans can become very expensive if not paid off in full and on time."

When you pay off a credit card balance, don’t roll that payment amount back into your discretionary funds. Instead, roll the amount you were paying into your next debt. [13] X Research source If, for example, you finish paying off a credit card, take the amount you were putting toward that card and add it to the minimum payment you've been making on another card or a student loan. The point is that you want to eliminate all recurring, long- and short-term debt as soon as possible so that you can live interest-free."

If you already have a solid emergency fund and have a reasonable amount to invest, such as $1,000, you may consider something like a certificate of deposit (CD). CDs make your money much harder to get to for a fixed period of time but tend to pay you a higher interest rate. [16] X Research source Keeping your savings separate from your checking account will make it less likely that you'll spend your savings. Savings accounts also tend to pay a slightly higher interest rate than checking accounts. Many banks will allow you to set up an automatic transfer between your checking and savings accounts. Set up a monthly transfer from your checking to your savings, even if it’s just for a small amount. That's a relatively painless way to build your savings."
