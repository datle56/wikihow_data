However, other conditions, including dandruff and scalp eczema, can cause also itchy scalp.

Some people who have head lice may not experience itching right away. It can take up to six weeks after infestation for the scalp to begin feeling itchy.

They may also be caused by an allergic reaction to shampoos and other hair care products. However, these “flakes” may actually be lice eggs (nits). [4] X Research source Dandruff commonly occurs throughout the hair. Lice eggs commonly occur closer to the scalp and are not as widespread as dandruff flakes. If you cannot easily brush or shake the flakes off the hair or scalp, they may be lice eggs."

As you separate sections of hair, the adult lice can quickly move back into the hair and into the shadows. Even though an adult louse is tiny, you should be able to see them if you can read the small print of a newspaper. Adult lice are light brown in color, and are about the size of a sesame seed. The adults are often found near the scalp area, in the hair just above and behind the ears, and at the hairline around the base of the neck.
