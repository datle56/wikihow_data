      "content": "Get rid of any old caulk with a utility knife. Using a utility knife , position it between the countertop and the sink and slowly slice through the caulk. Keep the blade flat so you don’t scratch your counters or sink base. Once you’ve cut through, pull it free from the rim. If you can’t easily pull the caulk free after cutting it, grip it with a pair of needlenose pliers and gently tug it free. [1] X Research source Home improvement specialist Eric Shipe says that using a hair dryer to heat up the caulk makes for an easy removal. He advises, “Try a low setting and increase if needed. Once melted, you can use a razor blade to scrape it off.” [2] X Expert Source Eric Shipe Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 11 June 2021. Home improvement specialist Ryaan Tuttle offers another option for removing the caulk: “You can also use an olfa knife . It has a super sharp thin blade. And you can use that as well to try to get all the caulking out.” [3] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 7 April 2021. If the caulk still doesn’t break up easily, Shipe suggests applying a caulk remover around the rim of your sink.

      "content": "Be sure to leave a thin gap between the tape and the sink. The gap is where you will apply the caulk. Follow the shape of the corners of your sink with multiple pieces of tape to round off the edges. This will make clean up easier and ensure a straight, even caulk job. [6] X Research source Home renovation specialist Art Fricke says you can use either painter’s tape or masking tape for this step. He instructs, “Take the masking tape and use it to make a nice line of caulk.” [7] X Expert Source Art Fricke Home Renovation & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 Aug 2020. Fricke warns, “Once you start getting silicone all over the place, it's really difficult to fix that.” [8] X Expert Source Art Fricke Home Renovation & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 Aug 2020."

      "content": "Cut off the tip of the caulk tube with a utility knife. Trim the end of the tube to a 45-degree angle so it fits tightly against the rim of your sink. Make the cut only as large as the opening around the sink to avoid having too much caulk come out at once. Since most caulk guns have a seal inside, insert the long metal pin attached to your caulk gun into the tube to puncture it. [9] X Research source Insert the tip of the caulk tube into a caulk gun and push the plunger of the gun up into the back. Handyman Barry Zakar details how to properly open up the caulk tube. He recommends the following: “My first suggestion would be to keep the caulk opening relatively small so you get a small bead. Then just take your time and squeeze, trying to maintain an equal, even pressure on the gun as you move along and place the caulk.” [10] X Expert Source Barry Zakar Handyman Expert Interview. 16 July 2020."

      "content": "Squeeze the tube’s trigger to prime it for use. Squeeze it several times until the caulk rises to the tip of the gun. Wipe the excess caulk off of the tip with some paper towel so you get a clean start on your sink. Place the tip of the gun against the edge of the sink's rim where it meets the countertop."

      "title": "Slowly squeeze the trigger to release a thin line of caulk.",
      "content": "Slowly squeeze the trigger to release a thin line of caulk. Only apply slight pressure so you don’t spread too much caulk in one spot. Keep moving the gun as you squeeze the trigger, holding the tip of the gun tight up against the rim for a precise application. Move at a slow, consistent speed so the line of caulk has the same thickness along the entire edge of your sink. [11] X Research source Apply the caulk all the way around the rim of the sink from one end to the next. If you need to stop your line at any time, overlap the start of the new line with where you finished the last one."

      "content": "Pull away the painter's tape from the counter. Take the tape off while the caulk is still wet. If you wait until it’s dry, you’ll accidentally pull the caulk off as well. Fricke adds one final step to his taping technique: “When you pick up the tape before the silicone gets tacky, you have a perfect caulk line that goes exactly where you want it to go.” [12] X Expert Source Art Fricke Home Renovation & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 Aug 2020."

      "content": "Wet your index finger and smooth the caulk to create a watertight seal. Press the caulk firmly against both edges of the rim and counter, sliding your finger as you go. [13] X Research source Zakar is an advocate for the wet finger technique, stating that it “works pretty well” in achieving “a nice, smooth, even result.” [14] X Expert Source Barry Zakar Handyman Expert Interview. 16 July 2020. Re-moisten your finger frequently to ensure it slides easily against the caulk. You can also use a caulk tool to smooth out your line if you don’t want to use your finger."

      "content": "Let the caulk dry for at least 24 hours before using the sink. Fricke advises against impatience when it comes to allowing the caulk to dry. He says, “You can speed it up a little bit by blowing air over it. A fan or a hair dryer on low can help. However, if you heat the silicone up, it will actually take longer to cure,” he shares. He adds, “My rule of thumb with silicone is to let it do what it's going to do.” [16] X Expert Source Art Fricke Home Renovation & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 Aug 2020."
