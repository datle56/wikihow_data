      "content": "Determine why you want to breed pit bulls. Think carefully about the reasons why you want to breed your pit bull. Perhaps you want puppies, or maybe your pit bull is a purebred. Breeding a dog can be expensive. You will have to take good care of your pregnant female, pay for multiple vet visits, and supervise the puppies during their first weeks of life. Make sure that you are dedicated to the idea before you begin. Pit bulls are one of the most commonly surrendered dogs. In some areas, they can compose up to 40% of the homeless dog population, and many of these dogs are euthanized in shelters. Adopting a pit bull can not only be a cost effective option for many people but it can also save a life. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Ascertain what breed you want. There are several different breeds of dogs collectively known as pit bulls. If you want a particular breed of pit bull, you should make sure that both parents are of that breed. If you do not do this, you may have a mixed litter. The most common breeds of pit bulls include: American Pit Bull Terriers American Staffordshire Terriers Staffordshire Bull Terriers You may want to check that the parents are registered with the American Kennel Club. This will ensure that the parents are purebred and that they really belong to their breed. It will also increase the value of the puppies if you are planning on selling them."

      "content": "Test your dogs for genetic problems. Even if your dog has no outward problems, recessive genetic disorders can arise during breeding. You should have both the female and male dogs genetically tested to look for any potential diseases that could arise. While pit bulls are not known to have many problems, they can face the following issues: Hip Dysplasia Elbow Dysplasia Autoimmune Thyroiditis NCL-A (Cerebellar Ataxia) Eye problems Heart problems"

      "content": "Locate potential adopters. Before you begin the mating process, you should find homes for the puppies first. Realize that you might have a litter of seven to ten puppies, and each will need a home. If you start looking for homes early, you can find a replacement home should a potential adopter back out. [3] X Research source You can advertise online, through a local kennel club, or through your vet."

      "title": "Hire a stud.",
      "content": "Hire a stud. If you do not have a male pit bull, you can hire a stud from another breeder. You will have to pay stud fees and negotiate a contract with the owner beforehand. The stud can physically mate with your female dog, or he can be used for artificial insemination. Local kennel clubs can put you in touch with reputable breeders. Always make sure that you are hiring from a reputable, responsible breeder. Ask to see the dog, and verify its temperament first. Make sure it has no aggression or behavioral problems. If you are looking to breed purebred puppies, be sure to ask for proof of the stud's pedigree up front. Always make sure to have a written contract between you and the breeder beforehand. The owner of the stud may request that your dog is tested for disease first."

      "content": "Take the pit bulls to the vet. Before you try to mate the dogs, you should have the dogs examined by a vet. Talk to your vet about your plans to breed the pit bulls. The vet will be able to examine the dog for common problems and let you know if the dogs are ready to mate. If you are hiring a stud, you should ask the stud's owner to take the stud to a vet. Ask for documentation showing the stud's health, including any potential health or behavioral problems that could pass onto the puppies. The vet can also provide personalized advice on your dog's diet, health, and exercise over the course of the pregnancy."

[4] X Research source During this, you will notice that her vulva is swelling and discharging liquid. Your pit bull cannot mate until about two weeks into this cycle. At this point, you may notice that: Her discharge is turning from a bloody red to clear or brownish. She is beginning to show interest in mating. She is releasing a smell that will attract male dogs Her tail moves to the side to make room for a male dog. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Introduce the female to the stud.",
      "content": "Introduce the female to the stud. Leave the female and male pit bulls together. You may notice the male mounting the female. The male will begin to thrust, and then remain attached to the female for between ten and thirty minutes. Do not attempt to separate the dogs at this point. This is a natural part of the mating process. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Kennel Club The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States.

This is because the male may be less likely to mate in an unfamiliar environment than a female in heat."

      "content": "Test the female dog's progesterone levels. If you are having difficulty mating pit bulls, you may want to check the progesterone levels of the female. Progesterone is a hormone that is released when the pit bull is ready to mate. This test can help you find the proper timing for breeding or it can diagnose a problem that might interfere with breeding. Ask your vet if you can have your dog tested."

      "content": "Consider artificial insemination. Dogs can be artificially inseminated too. You can use a stud that you have personally chosen, or you can use semen from a sperm bank that has been frozen. Ask your vet if they offer reproductive services for dogs or if they can refer you to someone who can provide you this service. If you are using frozen semen, you may want to check that it has been DNA certified by a kennel club. Artificial insemination can cost hundreds of dollars. Freezing and storing semen may incur additional costs."

The only way to be absolutely certain that a dog is pregnant is to have her checked out by a vet. Typically, a blood test or ultrasound will be performed.

      "content": "Determine the litter size. There are a few different ways to estimate the dog's litter size during pregnancy. While none of these are completely accurate, they can help you prepare for the number of puppies you may have at the end of your dog's pregnancy. Ask your vet about: Abdominal Palpitation: beginning at around day 28 of the pregnancy, your vet may start to feel your pit bull's stomach to see how many sacs are in her uterus. This is easier earlier in the pregnancy than later. Radiography: your vet will use X-rays to count how many fetal skeletons are in your dog's uterus. This is the most effective way of determining litter size. It can be done around day 45 of the pregnancy. Ultrasound: your vet will use sound waves to determine if your pit bull is pregnant, although it may not be able to accurately determine the litter size. It can be done around day 30."

      "content": "Watch for the mother to go into labor. A few days before your pit bull is ready to give birth, she will start to build a nest in her whelping box. Start taking the dog's temperature. You may notice a drop to below 100 °F (38 °C). Within twenty-four hours of this change, the dog's cervix may dilate. This means she is ready to give birth. In most cases, your pit bull will need no assistance in giving birth. That said, you should supervise the birth closely in case a problem arises."

This will help the puppies breathe while removing their sacs. You should try to make sure that there is one sac and placenta for every puppy.
