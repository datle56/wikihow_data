      "content": "Understand what \"backup withholding\" means. While the form is super-straightforward, the discussion of \"backup withholding\" on the second page throws most people for a loop. In general, if you're not involved with any investment opportunities with the client for whom you're filling out a W-9, and if you're filling it out in the capacity of an independent contractor or freelancer, you don't need to worry about this part. [4] X Research source Backup withholding allows the IRS to claim income tax from investors' earnings, in the event that an investor attempts to claim this money before tax has been levied on it. The payment owed is called \"backup withholding.\" Again, in most cases, you're exempt and it will be your client who owes the 28% income charge, not you. [5] X Research source If your clients choose not to collect information from you with a W-9, or if you include incorrect information on your form, your clients be liable to furnish backup withholding fees to the IRS. If you fill out the form and furnish it to the requesters, you won't be liable for making these payments under any circumstances. Keep track of your records and you'll be fine."
