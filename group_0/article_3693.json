Shadowing a surgeon in their work environment may help you to understand the benefits and negatives of their unique position. Some high schools also offer summer camps tailored to specific professional goals."

      "content": "Graduate from high school. Make sure to sign up for classes that demonstrate your interest in math and science, such as biology, chemistry, and calculus. You may also want to take communication courses so that you'll be able to communicate clearly with your patients, peers, and superiors. [3] X Research source Taking extra classes at the AP or advanced level is always a good idea, as it will leave you with more flexibility in college. Try to do your best in all of your classes as your final scores will help to determine which college program you can enroll in. It may also impact the degree of financial aid that you receive. If you are unable to complete high school on the traditional schedule, you may be able to take the GED (General Education Development) exam instead."

      "content": "Get a bachelor's degree. Medical schools generally don't require a particular college major in order to apply. However, you will want to cover the basic prerequisites while in college. At minimum, you will need a year of biology, physics, English, and two years of chemistry. This goes for most international programs, too. [4] X Research source Try to space out your difficult math and science courses over a period of four years to avoid getting burned out early on. However, you will want to have your major requirements completed by your senior year, to fully prep you for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) or other admissions test. Be aware that the expectations facing undergraduate students can vary according to location. In the United Kingdom, a student receives a medical degree upon completing their undergraduate education."

      "content": "Take the MCAT (Medical College Admission Test). During your senior year of college in the U.S., you will need to take and do well on the MCAT. Your test scores will then be sent out to your various application schools and this, combined with your overall academic profile, will determine whether or not you are admitted. [5] X Expert Source Vlad Gendelman, MD Board Certified Orthopaedic Surgeon Expert Interview. 17 July 2020. Be aware that you may also need to provide letters of reference from your college professors as part of your medical school application package. Go to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) website to find out U.S. medical school admissions requirements. If you are applying outside of the U.S., you will want to contact the school and ask for their requirements. Many locations have equivalent testing to the MCAT. For example, in the UK, students are expected to take the UK Clinical Aptitude Test (UKCAT)."

      "content": "Find a mentor. From high school onward, keep an eye out for individuals who can provide with you some guidance and advice from a professional standpoint. Try to stay in touch with those surgeons that you meet and keep them updated regarding what is happening with you. These mentors can provide unique insight into the school process and what your life will be like afterwards. [6] X Research source It is a great idea to identify one or more of your professors as potential mentors. Your relationship with them can continue after you complete school. And, they can provide you with much needed letters of reference and connections."

      "content": "Complete medical school. Medical school usually takes at least four years to complete. You will spend the first few years primarily in the classroom and lab, learning procedures and surgical practices. Then, you will transition to working on your skills under the supervision of an experienced surgeon. You will rotate from specialty to specialty in order to expose you to a full array of options. [7] X Expert Source Vlad Gendelman, MD Board Certified Orthopaedic Surgeon Expert Interview. 17 July 2020. Obstetrics, pediatrics, and cardiology are just a few of the specialties that you may encounter on your rotation. Once you graduate, you will be awarded with a degree.

[9] X Research source Residency programs usually focus on a particular area of medicine, such as urology or critical care. This is the time where you will truly hone your skills in a more specific way. As another example, in the United Kingdom you move into a phase called “Foundation Training” after receiving your initial medical degree. During this two-year period, you work with patients and begin to explore a field of specialty."

This fellowship provides you with the time to focus even more closely on a surgical subspecialty, like cardiothoracic measures. Many fellowships will also provide with financial and academic support for publishing. [10] X Research source It is always a good idea to talk with a fellowship program about where their graduates are working now.

It will also give you more time to determine an exact specialty, if you remain uncertain. [13] X Research source After you've built up a practice, you can often take a leave of absence to pursue additional fellowships or to develop your skills as needed. In some locations, general practice exposure is not optional, such is the case in the United Kingdom. In the UK, each doctor is required to spend at least three years working in general practice, culminating with a Specialty Certificate Examination (SCE)."
