      "content": "Check the rug's label. Lift the corners of your rug to reveal the rug's label. Usually, on the label, it will have instructions on the safest way to clean your Oriental rug. Rugs can be made of silk, wool, cotton, or synthetic material and each requires a certain degree of finesse when cleaning. Cotton and wool rugs are generally more durable and easier to clean. If you have a silk rug, consider taking it to a professional instead of cleaning it yourself in the case of severe stains. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Vacuum and tend to the carpet regularly. Vacuuming your rug at least once a week will lift recent debris and dirt from it and keep it smelling and looking new for a longer time. Vacuuming also prevents the wool fibers in your rug from becoming packed down. [3] X Research source Do not frequently vacuum antique or silk oriental rugs as it can damage them and reduce their value."

      "content": "Keep your rug out of direct sunlight. Oriental rugs can be prone to sun damage, so keep it away from windows if you can. Keeping an oriental rug in the sun will cause the colors to fade over time. [4] X Research source If your rug has to be in direct sunlight, rotate it at least once a month. While the colors are still likely to fade, at least they will fade evenly. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Test to see if your carpet is colorfast.",
      "content": "Test to see if your carpet is colorfast. Some carpets are colorfast and won't bleed when wet, while others will. If the rug's label reads \"dry clean only,\" then there's a good possibility your rug is not colorfast. If you want to test your rug, saturate a small corner of the carpet with room temperature water, then press on it with a clean white cloth. If there is dye on your rag, then your carpet is likely to bleed if you clean it yourself. In the case that your carpet is not colorfast do a light cleaning but avoid getting your carpet wet or using chemical cleaners on it. If you need to deep clean a carpet that is not colorfast, your best option would be to bring it in to be professionally cleaned."

      "title": "Sweep your rug.",
      "content": "Sweep your rug. Use a broom with straw bristles or a carpet sweeper to do the initial cleaning of your rug. [7] X Research source Sweep in one direction from end to end. Don't rub your broom back and forth because you could end up damaging it. Once you're done sweeping the entirety of the rug, repeat the cycle and go over it a second time. Electric carpet sweepers use static electricity to pick up dirt and are the safest method for quickly cleaning an antique oriental rug."

      "content": "Vacuum the rug on both sides. Lay out your rug in an empty area and vacuum over the rug slowly to remove excess abrasives, hair, and dirt that can damage your rug over time. Repeat this process three or more times to get all the dirt and debris from the rug. [8] X Research source Avoid the rug's fringes because they can become stuck in the vacuum's sweeper. Once you're done vacuuming, flip the rug over and repeat the process on the other side. Make sure you vacuum in the direction of the rug fibers, not against them. When cleaning an expensive or antique rug, make sure to use the carpet tool because a revolving brush can damage your rug and hurt its value. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Spot clean your rug. It's best to tend to spills as soon as they occur because if they dry it will be much harder for you to get the stain or smell out of your rug. As soon as the spill occurs blot up as much of the liquid as you can, with a paper towel or clean rag. [11] X Research source Once you've soaked up the spill, dampen a rag and use cold water to blot the stain again. Do not rub back and forth on the spill because you could end up rubbing the stain deeper into the carpet."

Dip your sponge or brush into your water and soap solution until it's saturated and lightly go over a small part of the rug. Wait up to ten minutes to see if the cleaning solution has an adverse effect on it before proceeding to the next step.

Use a squeegee to squeeze the rest of the water out of your rug, then allow it to dry flat on the ground. Remember to flip your rug over so that both sides can dry. [18] X Research source If drying is taking too long try pointing a fan on to quicken the process."

While it will cost money, it may be worth it so you can avoid repairs in the future."
