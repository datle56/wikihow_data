      "content": "Soak the wound in a saline solution. If your doctor has advised you to soak your wound in a saline solution a certain number of times each day, then make sure that you do so. If not, then do not do this. Remove its dressing and soak an open or closed infected wound in a container of warm saline solution for 20 minutes. If it’s not easy to soak the wound in a bowl, cover the wound with a clean cloth soaked in saline solution for 20 minutes.

      "title": "Apply an antibiotic ointment.",
      "content": "Apply an antibiotic ointment. Your doctor will usually prescribe something like bacitracin, silver sulfadiazine, gentamicin, or mupirocin. Dab an antibacterial cream onto a cotton swab, taking care not to let the tip of the nozzle touch the swab. Use enough cream to apply a thin coating over the entire wound. Use a fresh swab if you need to squirt more ointment from the bottle. Use an over-the-counter cream, such as Neosporin or petroleum jelly, if you haven’t been prescribed one from your doctor. You can also ask your pharmacist to recommend an over the counter antibiotic ointment. If your wound feels painful, you might even be able to find an ointment that has pain relief."

Covering the wound will encourage healing and prevent the infection from spreading. You should change the dressing at least twice a day or when it gets wet or soiled. [6] X Research source Avoid using a dressing that sticks to the wound. If you apply enough ointment, your dressing shouldn’t stick to your wound. Choose a sterile bandage instead of gauze.

      "content": "Stop the bleeding. Minor wounds, like surface scrapes or shallow cuts, usually stop bleeding on their own after a few minutes. If necessary, cover the area with a clean cloth or bandage and apply gentle pressure. Elevate the wound if possible, so the area is held higher than the heart.

A topic antibiotic is an ointment that you apply directly on the infected area and is the most common form of treatment. Oral antibiotics, or systemic antibiotics, are taken by the mouth and are best if your doctor believes the infection is spreading or if your immune system is compromised.
