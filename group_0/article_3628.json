      "content": "Apply for a job at a reputable phone sex hotline. Some phone sex hotlines do still exist, so search online for “phone sex jobs” or “phone sex jobs” near me. You can also look on job sites that focus on adult entertainment positions, like SexyJobs.com . If you find a company with open positions, do your research to make sure that it’s reputable: look up the company on GlassDoor, search for reviews on Reddit, and try to connect with current or former employees. [1] X Research source Then, fill out their job application following whatever instructions they give. Often, potential employers will want you to leave a demo voicemail recording. They won’t necessarily expect you to have prior phone sex experience, but they may want you to have a knowledge of sexual interests and a nice voice. Practice reading a script that contains erotic content using your phone sex voice prior to leaving a voicemail recording for the phone sex company. Practicing while speaking in a sexy voice will help you feel more comfortable and confident at the time you call to apply. Wait to hear back from phone sex companies and follow up as needed. After you have been hired, you may be able to start speaking with phone sex clients immediately."

      "content": "Set up an account on a phone sex app or website. Rather than pursuing a full-time position as a phone sex operator, you can sign up to freelance or work part-time through a phone sex app or website. Once you find the website or app that you think will work for you, go through their sign-up process to build a profile. Depending on the company, you may need to build a following or otherwise solicit new phone sex clients.

These days, a lot of people get started in virtual sex work by building a following on apps and sites like Instagram, TikTok, and OnlyFans. However, it can be difficult to get enough clients to earn money through this method if you don’t already have a lot of followers . [4] X Research source If you already have a lot of followers on your OnlyFans, TikTok, or Instagram account, simply start to advertise that you’re offering personal conversations for a flat fee or minute-by-minute rate. If you don’t have a lot of followers, try to get into influencing and grow a following. Start an OnlyFans or begin posting more frequently on TikTok or Instagram. You might want to post photos related to the work you’re trying to do, like thirst traps and alluring selfies ."

As another option, you can check for requests for phone sex in local newspapers or online forums like Reddit and Craigslist. People (especially older generations) may post advertisements on these sources in order to solicit phone sex work. [5] X Research source However, keep in mind that this route to phone sex work may be more risky than others (although all forms of sex work come with some level of risk). By searching out clients or responding to requests on the internet, you have less security and accountability than you would if going through an official service or agency."

Some phone sex jobs may also require you to have a landline phone (so your connection is fully clear) and a strong Internet connection (so that you can online chat with clients as well as call).

While you should still pursue a phone sex operator position if that’s what you want, you should also take precautions to make sure that you won’t be taken advantage of: [12] X Research source Find work opportunities through reputable sources: Use well-known job boards like SexyJobs.com rather than general job boards at websites like Craigslist. Research any companies you may work for: Look into the companies or services that you’re thinking about applying to. All companies are likely to have some unhappy former employees, but trust your gut and stay away from any sketchy vibes. Look for red flags in the audition process: The typical phone sex company interview will involve a brief voice audition over the phone (usually with a female supervisor). If the interview involves a long, private chat with someone who seems overly invested in the call, hang up and apply through a different service. Beware of any mysterious fees: Besides maybe purchasing a landline phone, you shouldn’t have to pay any startup fees or administrative costs to a company that hires you for a phone sex operator job. Be suspicious of big promises: If a company promises you that you’ll make hundreds of dollars within your first week, they’re probably not being honest with you. It takes time to build up a client base and earn that type of income in phone sex work."
