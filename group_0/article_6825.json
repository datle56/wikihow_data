      "content": "Notify your creditors first of your move. Two of the three major credit reporting agencies, Equifax and Experian, both say that when you move, you need to notify your creditors, not the credit reporting agency. The agencies will get notice of any address change through the records of the individual creditors. [1] X Research source It is important that you notify all your creditors and all companies you do business with. If you move, but neglect to notify creditors, then bills and notices may be delayed, and your payments may be late as a result. If you want to be abundantly cautious and send a notice of address change to Equifax or Experian, you may do so, even though they do not require such a notice. You do not need to be concerned with any particular “proof” of the new address."

If you are notifying TransUnion of your address change, or if you wish to send a notice to Equifax or Experian, send your letter, with any supporting documentation, to the appropriate address. Your letter can be very simple. You may say something like, “I am writing to notify you that as of July 1, 2016, I have moved to a new address. The new address is _____. I am enclosing a copy of my new driver’s license and a utility bill that show this new address.” Send correspondence for TransUnion to TransUnion, LLC, Consumer Disclosure Center, P.O.

A dispute is the means for correcting something that is blatantly incorrect. This may include either an address that you never used, or something as simple as a typographical error. [3] X Research source For example, if your correct address is 123 Main Street, but it appears on your credit report as “124 Main Street,” you should treat this as disputing an error."

In your letter, include a clear statement that your address on your credit report is incorrect. Provide the information that currently appears, and then state what you believe the correct information should show. If you have supporting documentation, like a utility bill or driver’s license, you should include copies."
