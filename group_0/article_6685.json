      "content": "Figure out what you'd like to change. Sometimes change is so big and so scary that you don't want to contemplate it at all. But you can do something about that, and you can do it right now. Grab a piece of paper and a pen. Brainstorm and write out your answers to the following questions as quickly as you can. Don’t get hung up on grammar, spelling, or punctuation, just write. What's working well in my life right now? List some of the positives about your life as it is right now. To make a change, you need to be aware of what you like as much as you're aware of what you don't like so that you don't end up wrecking the positives in your life. You can also list some of your strengths here so that you know what you have to draw on as you go through the change process. What are the areas of my life I want to change? Do you hate your job? Are you in an unhappy marriage? Write down the parts of your life that are making you really unhappy. Pick out the top 3 to 5 things you'd like to change. Again, quickly and without too much thinking, write down the steps that you can take to make changes. Do not overwork this––there is plenty of time for fine adjustment later."

      "content": "Break larger objectives on your list up into smaller actionable items. Having a large goal like “become a millionaire” is great as a long term goal, but it does not give you concrete items to work on. To achieve a goal, you need to break it into smaller, more realistic goals. For example, you could break your large goal of becoming a millionaire into something more manageable like “set up a savings account” or “ask for a raise.” These are items that will help to move you closer to your goal and make it seem more manageable.

For example, instead of writing something generic like \"find my passion,\" pick something actionable and specific. You can instead say, \"visit a career coach\" or \"take an aptitude test.\" Turn big projects into small to-dos. For instance, instead of writing \"find a new job,\" break it down into steps like \"update my resume,\" \"create a LinkedIn profile,\" \"research new companies\" or \"write a letter of resignation.\""

To move to a new city: Find an apartment in the new place, list your current house or condo for sale, start throwing away things you don't want to take with you, or call your friends and relatives to tell them the news."

Make sure that you are eating well, sleeping enough, and getting regular exercise to feel your best. Look great on the outside. When is the last time you got yourself a great haircut or a pedicure or manicure? Do you need new clothes? Part of creating the new you may include changing the way that you look. Investing in looking good is an investment in yourself. Get regular exercise and eat healthy foods. When you're scared about making a life change, you may be tempted to hole yourself up inside your home and engage in some serious emotional eating. Instead, take care of yourself. Go for a 30-minute walk every day and eat foods that are good for you. Go for some checkups. When did you last go to the dentist or have a physical health checkup? Your body may need some fine-tuning to be at its best in your new circumstances. You don't want to have an unknown problem brewing with your physical health."
