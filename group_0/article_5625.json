After inputting the international calling code (00) and the country code (1), dial the area code of the region of the United States you are trying to reach. A US area code is always a three-digit number, and is often listed in parentheses before the following seven digits of the phone number, like so: (###)-###-####. A US toll-free number replaces the area code with one of the following codes: 800, 888, 877, 866, 855, or 844. [2] X Trustworthy Source Federal Communications Commission Independent U.S. government agency responsible for regulating radio, television, and satellite, and phone communications Go to source However, toll-free numbers will not be free when calling from outside the US, and in fact may not work at all when dialed. Instead, call the company's standard phone number. [3] X Research source Note that a person's area code may not be the same as their physical location in the United States if they've moved but kept the same phone number, or bought a phone in a different area than the one they live in. If the person you need to contact did not provide an area code, you'll need to confirm with them which area code is used for their phone number. Some cities or regions may be covered by multiple area codes, depending on their size."

Download Skype for free on a smartphone, tablet, or computer to immediately begin calling other Skype accounts for free. If you want to use Skype to call a regular US phone number, add Skype Credit to your account to pay as you go, or select a monthly subscription to save on frequent calls. [4] X Research source Make sure you are connected to a computer or phone with high-speed internet when you make calls from Skype, as the audio and video quality will be better and more reliable with a good connection. Note that if you use a mobile app for Skype on a phone or tablet that is not connected to WiFi, you will incur data charges. Check with your phone or SIM card provider on these charges, or purchase a plan with unlimited or a large amount of data if you plan to use phone apps frequently without an internet connection."

Remember that if your phone is not connected to the internet , you will incur data charges for the calls you make on the network.

Familiarize yourself with the process of making a call, the quality of the audio or video, and any other features so that you are ready to use it without any problems. If you can, test out the app before you are abroad in the UK to get familiar with it. Make sure you have a good internet connection and, if possible, use the same device you'll use to connect while abroad. You might want to be prepared with a reliable microphone and pair of headphones for making your calls from the UK, particularly if you are using an older computer that doesn't have a microphone or speakers built in, or you want to be able to make hands-free mobile calls."

If you are from the United States and traveling in the United Kingdom, bring along an unlocked phone that allows SIM cards to be inputted from other providers. A SIM card is a small information chip that you can purchase from a mobile provider while abroad. Ensure that the cell phone you want to bring to the UK is a GSM phone (global cellular technology used by most of the world) and it's unlocked , meaning that it doesn't have a restriction on being used with other providers. AT&T and T-Mobile carry GSM phones which are typically unlocked. [5] X Research source Look for a UK mobile provider that carries a SIM card that will fit in your phone. Most mobile phones have a standard SIM card size, but iPhones and other newer smartphones use special micro or nano SIM card sizes. [6] X Research source You can set up an international calling plan through your current US phone carrier, but note that these plans are typically very expensive. Whether you choose an international call plan or the SIM card route, make sure to call your US provider to change or suspend your service and ask any questions you may have before traveling to the UK."
