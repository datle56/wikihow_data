Boys and girls can join Cub Scouts as early as the first grade. Once a boy or girl is older than 10, or has completed the fifth grade, he or she can join Scouts. You can join Venturing for ages 14 through 20.

      "content": "Earn the ranks that come before Eagle Scout. To become eligible for the rank of Eagle Scout, you must first earn Scout, Tenderfoot, Second Class, First Class, Star, and Life Ranks. These ranks require accomplishments in camping, cooking, navigation, nature, aquatics, first aid, fitness, leadership, safety, citizenship, and Scout spirit. These ranks take time to earn and cannot be done in a rush. Make sure you join Scouts with enough time to accomplish these ranks. Part of advancing in the ranks is accomplished by earning merit badges, which signify a Scout’s knowledge and skills in a particular area. By the time a Scout completes Life Rank, they’ll have 11 merit badges that they’ve earned."

So you should keep those in mind as you work towards this goal.

[4] X Research source If you’re stumped on project ideas, consult community, Scout, or religious leaders to see what projects they may need help with. Most Eagle Scout service projects are construction based. For example, many Scouts build bridges, decks, or playgrounds for an institution in need. Other more unique project ideas include hosting a free football camp for low income kids or collecting shoes to send to earthquake victims. [5] X Research source"
