This is the best place to find these links, although you may also receive them in your email inbox if you subscribe to a newsletter from Ticketmaster or a favorite artist. While you'll need a Twitter account to follow Ticketmaster on Twitter, you don't need an account to view Ticketmaster's tweets."

      "content": "Click the Verified Fan registration link. Look for it in an email or Tweet. The registration link for each tour is unique, even if the tours are from the same artist. Although Ticketmaster continues to expand its Verified Fan program, not every artist or tour supports Verified Fans at this time. If you can't find a registration link for a concert you hope to attend, it may not be a part of the program."

As you wait, Ticketmaster will carry out a verification process, using a lottery system to determine which Verified Fans will receive a unique access code, and which ones will be put on the waitlist. If demand does not outweigh supply for your concert, there will be no need for a waitlist and you will be given equal access to the Verified Fan presale. If applicable, a lottery will determine which users get off the waitlist and receive an access code. Access codes are tied to your account, so you cannot sell or give away your code to another user."

If you lose your digital or physical tickets, you can retrieve them easily ."
