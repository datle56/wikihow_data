      "content": "Stick to the correct pronouns when you talk about your friend. Trans women (people who were assigned male but identify as female) usually use she/her, and trans guys (people who were assigned female but identify as male) tend to use he/him. However, some people may use they/them or neo-pronouns (pronouns other than she/he/they). “Hey Jordan, what pronouns do you use?”"

Tell them why you like them and what their friendship means to you. In particular, make sure you let them know you care when they come out to you or are going through an emotional struggle. [3] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source “I’m here for you. I care about you, and I’ll support you no matter what.” “I feel like you’re always there for me. You’re so kind and funny, and your friendship makes my life better every day. I want you to know I’m here for you, too.”"

      "content": "Apologize politely and move on with the conversation. Misgendering your friend can mean using the wrong pronouns or referring to them by the wrong name. When it happens accidentally, just apologize without making a big deal of the situation (which can make your friend more uncomfortable) and use the correct pronouns. [4] X Research source “I’m sorry. I meant ‘They’re going to the mall later.’” “Sorry, wrong name. Kenna, you should’ve gotten the chocolate ice cream.”"

      "content": "Unless they tell you otherwise, don’t “out” your friend. Keep your friend safe and comfortable by letting them choose when to reveal their gender identity to other people. Ask if there are cases where your friend doesn’t want you to use the correct pronouns, since your friend may not be openly trans/non-binary in some places. By giving your friend time to come out on their own, you let them experience the freedom to be or find who they are, on their own terms. [5] X Research source If you’re not sure who they’ve come out to, ask them: “I want to make sure I’m using the correct pronouns, but I also want to respect your privacy. Have you come out to the rest of our friends?” If someone speculates or asks about your friend, say: “I don’t like to speak for them. You can ask them directly if you’re curious about their gender.”"

If you're cisgender (meaning you identify with the gender you were assigned at birth), you might not be an expert on the issues your friend is facing, but you can validate how they feel. Always be ready to listen to them talk about their struggles and triumphs in discovering which gender identity feels right. [6] X Research source [7] X Expert Source Marissa Floro, PhD Counseling Psychologist Expert Interview. 1 April 2021. “I hear what you’re saying, and that sounds exciting/tough/amazing/scary.” You can use brief verbal responses like “mm-hmm,” “I see,” “okay.” If you’re not sure how to respond, ask, “Can you tell me more about that?” or “How can I best support you?”"

      "content": "Say your pronouns to make that a normal part of greetings. Your friend might feel uncomfortable introducing themselves with their pronouns if no one else is doing it. When you give your own pronouns, it can both help your friend feel less isolated and model appropriate behavior for others. Add your pronouns after you introduce yourself, or you can even add pronouns to your social media profile, email signature, or video call meeting nametag. [8] X Research source “Hi, I’m Zoe and I use she/her pronouns.” “It’s nice to meet you. I’m Karl and I use he/him pronouns.” “Hey, my name’s Denver and I use they/them pronouns.”"

      "content": "Pick words like “people,” “friends,” or “folks.” Change the way you greet others to make sure your friend feels included, and make gender-inclusive greetings a habit whether your friend is present or not. Referring to your friends or coworkers with gendered terms like “girls,” “boys,” “dudes,” “bros,” or “ladies” might make your friend with dysphoria feel uncomfortable. [9] X Research source “Hi all, how are you doing?” “Hey, friends. Can we get going?” “Athletes/teammates, let’s huddle up.” You can never tell someone’s gender identity from looking at them, so you might unknowingly make another person feel more comfortable when you opt for gender-inclusive language."
