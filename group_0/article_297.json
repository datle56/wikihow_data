      "title": "Match your accessories to the color of your dress.",
      "content": "Match your accessories to the color of your dress. This is one of the easiest ways to accessorize. Color is one of the most important aspects of your dress, and if you pick accessories that are similarly colored to your dress, it will make your outfit look balanced and well put together. [1] X Research source If you are wearing a light pink dress, choose pink or rose-colored accessories to go along with it. Matching doesn’t have to be exact. For example, you can still wear dark pink shoes with a light pink dress. This adds some funkiness to your matching."

    {
      "title": "Match your accessories to a detail in the dress.",
      "content": "Match your accessories to a detail in the dress. Instead of matching your accessories to the overall color of the dress, match them to a secondary color in your dress. This works especially well with patterned dresses, because there is more than one color you can match with. [2] X Research source If you are wearing a white dress with pink and blue flowers, wear pink or blue accessories. This is a great way to match with your dress in a more nuanced way."

    {
      "title": "Wear neutral accessories with a bright dress.",
      "content": "Wear neutral accessories with a bright dress. If your dress is an extremely bright color like bright yellow, wear neutrals to offset it. If you match your accessories directly with your brightly colored dress, you may look eccentric rather than put together. [3] X Expert Source Katie Quinn Personal Wardrobe Stylist Expert Interview. 14 April 2020. White, black, tan and brown are all neutrals that look good with almost any color. If you prefer some bling, try gold or silver jewelry instead."

    {
      "title": "Wear subtle or solid-colored accessories with a patterned dress.",
      "content": "Wear subtle or solid-colored accessories with a patterned dress. A patterned dress already has a lot going on. If you throw in accessories that are patterned or intricate, the look becomes too much. Your shoes, bag, belt, and/or jewelry should all be solid-colored. These accessories will help your dress make its statement. Try bright, red pumps with a blue-and-while polka dotted dress. If your dress has a floral pattern on it, a pair of simple, stud earrings would look especially cute. Pair it with black or leather flats to complete the look."

    {
      "title": "Wear a boldly–colored accessory with a neutral dress.",
      "content": "Wear a boldly–colored accessory with a neutral dress. If your dress is a neutral color like white, beige or tan, adding a bright accessory gives your outfit oomph. Whether it be a statement necklace, a handbag or your shoes, try to make one of your accessories a bright color. [4] X Expert Source Katie Quinn Personal Wardrobe Stylist Expert Interview. 14 April 2020. If your dress is a solid color, try wearing a patterned handbag or shoes. For example, you could wear a polka dotted bag with a white dress."

    {
      "title": "Match your jewelry to the tone of your dress.",
      "content": "Match your jewelry to the tone of your dress. Every color has a tone. Red, orange, and yellow all have a warm tone. Green, blue and purple are all cool toned. Similarly, gold has a warm tone to it while silver has a cool tone. Don't be afraid to experiment, however; gold can look quite striking with green. White and black are considered neutral tones, so you can wear gold or silver jewelry with them. Brown and tan come in cool and warm undertones. In this case, match the jewelry to the undertone."

    {
      "title": "Wear a necklace with V or U neck dress.",
      "content": "Wear a necklace with V or U neck dress. The cut of this dress is perfect for wearing a necklace. Try to pick a necklace that is above the neckline of the dress and that matches the curve of the neckline. You can opt for a simple pendent necklace or a more elaborate style. If you love the look of a certain necklace, but it's too long, simply switch the chain out for a shorter one. Some necklaces come with adjustable chains in the back. This is great, because you can wear them with more dresses."

    {
      "title": "Avoid necklaces with halter necks.",
      "content": "Avoid necklaces with halter necks. Halter neck dresses already have a lot going on in the neckline, so to wear a necklace or big earrings would make the outfit seem too busy. When you are accessorizing a halter neck dress, try wearing a bracelet or even layered bracelets. This emphasizes your arms and balances out the top of the dress. [5] X Research source Match the style of the jewelry to the style of the halter, however. A rustic pair of wooden earrings won't pair well with an elegant, velvet evening gown."

    {
      "title": "Wear long necklaces with crew necks.",
      "content": "Wear long necklaces with crew necks. If you are wearing a dress with a high neck, wear a long necklace to make the look more interesting. Because a crewneck is a simple design, you can wear bigger accessories without it looking overdone. [6] X Research source A necklace will bring attention up to your face and it will tie the outfit together."

      "title": "Balance the look of a one-shoulder dress with a bracelet.",
      "content": "Balance the look of a one-shoulder dress with a bracelet. One-shoulder dresses make a bold statement. To balance the asymmetry, wear a bracelet or cuff on the opposite side of your body as the strap of the dress. This is a great way to compliment this style of dress. [7] X Research source For example, if your dress only has a strap on the left shoulder, wear the bracelet on the right. Pair chunky cuffs with thick straps, and delicate bracelets with thin straps. This will help create even more balance."

    {
      "title": "Wear earrings with strapless dresses.",
      "content": "Wear earrings with strapless dresses. Strapless dresses showcase your arms and your shoulders. Wearing a necklace breaks up this area and doesn’t allow the dress to shine. Instead, try wearing earrings with a strapless dress. Simple stud earrings gives the outfit a classy and sophisticated look. Long, dangly earrings will bring focus to your face. They work especially well with elegant updos."

      "title": "Wear the right shoes.",
      "content": "Wear the right shoes. It may sound like the kind of advice your mother gives you, but it also applies to fashion! Make sure your shoes match your dress in terms of formality. [8] X Research source If you’re wearing a gown because you are going to a formal event, wear heels. If you’re wearing a sun dress for the beach, wear sandals instead of close-toed shoes."

      "content": "Make sure the quality of your jewelry is appropriate. If you are wearing a cocktail dress and heels, don’t wear rubber bracelets or jewelry that is low quality. Likewise, if you are wearing a casual dress for brunch with friends, don’t wear a diamond necklace. [9] X Research source These may be extreme examples, but you want to be sure that your accessories match the occasion."

      "title": "Bring the right bag.",
      "content": "Bring the right bag. You want your handbag to compliment your dress but also to be appropriate for whatever you are doing. Many people overlook the impression that a handbag can make! If you're going to a formal event, do not use a large or bulky handbag. Bring a simple clutch instead. Save straw or cloth bags for the beach or informal events. You can never go wrong with a basic black leather handbag. It's versatile and can go with virtually any dress or level of formality."

      "title": "Wear less rather than more with a formal dress.",
      "content": "Wear less rather than more with a formal dress. If you are wearing a professional or elegant dress, try not to wear too many accessories. Accessories would detract from the elegance of your dress and would downplay your outfit. Don’t wear layered or chunky jewelry. Instead, wear one or two simple pieces. Be careful with accessories like hats or scarves. Only wear them if they add to the elegance of your look."

      "title": "Match your metals.",
      "content": "Match your metals. If you are wearing multiple pieces of jewelry, try to match your metals. For instance, wear either all silver or all gold jewelry. It is possible to get away with mixing, but it is harder to pull off. For this reason, many choose to just wear one type of metal per outfit. You can mix-and-match metals with other types of jewelry. For example, you can layer a short silver necklace with a long pearl necklace."

      "title": "Wear only one statement piece.",
      "content": "Wear only one statement piece. You definitely want to make a statement, but you don’t want to look like a Christmas tree. If you have a piece like a large necklace or a patterned handbag, compliment it with smaller or simpler accessories. This will give your outfit a focal point and will make it more cohesive. [10] X Research source Wearing too many statement pieces will make your outfit look tacky and won't lead the eye around; there will be no focus."

      "title": "Pick bright and neutral shades.",
      "content": "Pick bright and neutral shades. If you are wearing multiple accessories, make sure they are not all brightly-colored. Doing this can overwhelm your dress or make your outfit seem cluttered. Choose either all neutral or a mix of neutral and bright accessories. [11] X Expert Source Katie Quinn Personal Wardrobe Stylist Expert Interview. 14 April 2020. For example, if you want a boho look, layer a necklace made from large, colored glass beads with a necklace made from small, brown, wooden beads."

      "title": "Pick only one or two bright colors for your accessories.",
      "content": "Pick only one or two bright colors for your accessories. If you want to wear more than one brightly-colored accessory, make sure they are the same color. This way your accessories will look like they all belong together and the look won’t be overwhelmed by multiple bright colors. [12] X Research source For example, if you're wearing a blue-and-white polka dotted dress, pair it with a bright red belt and a matching pair of bright red pumps."
