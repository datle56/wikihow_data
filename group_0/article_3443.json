      "content": "Have confidence in yourself and your manliness. Confidence comes from having a well developed sense of self and a grounded sense of stability. [1] X Research source In specific terms this means not bragging about your successes and being unwavering in your commitment to overcome personal fears and obstacles: Accept yourself. You do not owe explanations for who you are and how you behave in the world. People will not acknowledge you if you have not already learned to accept yourself. This means that you have faced your dark emotions and thoughts, have processed them, reached your own conclusions and have a purpose and ambitious path in life. Ambitious can mean different things for different people, but women admire guys who know where they are going and actively work each day to move closer to what they want. Confidence and arrogance are two different things. Confidence is inner strength, while arrogance is an outer display of overconfidence and an unhealthy obsession with an individual's persona. The arrogant man spends all his energy persuading others that he is always right and can do no wrong. The confident man does not involve himself in such behavior. He knows he is not perfect. [2] X Research source You should be able to talk about your achievements confidently without coming off as being cocky. Rather than just talking about how great you are, focus on the impact that the experience had on you. This way you will give a woman a little more insight into your personality and values."

      "content": "Be the sexiest version of yourself. You have to want to keep yourself clean and your body lean. Outside influences cannot do this for you. Change and sexual power comes from within. The sexiest thing a guy can do is to understand what he wants, who he is, and where he currently stands in relation to where he wants to be. Next, work hard to get there. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Make sure you have good hygiene.",
      "content": "Make sure you have good hygiene . This is important to project a positive self-image. [4] X Research source Taking a shower every day or two is a must. Even if you do not sweat a whole lot, it is important to good hygiene. Brush your teeth twice a day, and floss once a day. People do not take this seriously enough and soon come to regret it. If your teeth are a bit crooked, you should consider orthodontics, if you can afford it and feel it will make you feel more confident. A straight smile can make a big difference. Wear deodorant every day. Body odor is not an attractive smell, and nobody around you enjoys it. It is a simple routine that can benefit your friendships and relationships. Most deodorant is not so fragrant that it would be considered \"too much\". Apply liberally. Make sure you get antiperspirant deodorant every time, as it will save you shirts in the long run. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Cultivating a scruffy look can be very successful, up until the time you reach middle age. This does not count those dirty looking mustaches you see from time to time. If you have one, shave it off. Pluck your uni-brow or shave it. Either way, create two brows. No exceptions. Wash your face every day. This helps to clear up both red acne and blackheads. Remember, if you are a teenager a little acne is totally normal. If you are having trouble with blackheads, any skincare product with \"Salicylic Acid\" in it is a good choice. [6] X Research source If you are having trouble with red acne, grab a tube of Benzoyl Peroxide 8-10%. [7] X Research source Both of these products are quite cheap and last for weeks. They are the similar ingredients to some of the name brand products, which are typically much more expensive. Using cologne to your advantage is a smart move, but do not overdo it. Wear nice clothes. The style of clothes that you wear does not matter, as it expresses your personality. Your clothes should be clean and ironed (if appropriate). Also, do not wear pants in such a manner that reveal your underwear. This is not sexy. If you are going to wear jeans, make sure they are not too baggy. This, too, does not look good."

      "content": "Be funny ! Women love a funny guy. Puff your chest out a tiny bit, pull your head back. That is what cocky feels like; a little swelled up and goofy. When you mix a little bit of cocky and a little bit of funny, you can get amazing results. Women do not just appreciate humor, they appreciate humor along with sexiness and social tact."
