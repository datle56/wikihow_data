      "content": "Evaluate a first-degree burn. First degree burns are the least severe. They are characterized by redness, swelling, and mild to moderate pain. First-degree burns are very common, and they are the result of brief contact with something hot (such as a stove, hot pan, or the sun). First-degree burns affect only the outermost layer of skin, and can usually be treated at home. [1] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source Symptoms to look for include: Red skin that is painful to touch. Skin that tingles. Skin that is dry to the touch. Slight swelling. Very severe sunburn or any first-degree burn that covers a large area of your body should be looked at by a doctor."

      "content": "Identify a second-degree burn. Second-degree burns also damage the layer under the top layer of skin. These burns result from more extended contact with hot items or prolonged sun exposure. Many second-degree burns can still be treated at home. In addition to the symptoms of first-degree burns, characteristics of second-degree burns include: blotchy skin, blisters, and mild to severe pain.

      "content": "Determine if you have a third-degree burn. Third-degree burns destroy both the outer and inner layer of skin. These burns may or may not cause a lot of pain, but pain during recovery is usually more severe than with less severe burns. Third-degree burns occur when a heat source penetrates multiple layers of your skin. These burns are serious, and should not be treated at home. If you experience a third-degree burn, it is crucial for you to get to a hospital as soon as possible. [3] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source Symptoms you may notice include: Red or white skin.
