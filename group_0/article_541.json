Pick any folder you want - it doesn't need to be the actual genre for the song. For example, if you want a song to play on the Pop station, you would put the file into Custom Music > Pop . Putting music directly into the Custom Music folder won't work, nor will creating a new folder. You'll need to pick a preexisting genre."

However, other players report the file not showing up, or showing up with a blank name. If this happens to you, test it on the stereo."
