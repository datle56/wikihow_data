      "content": "Let your sandals air dry. No matter which method you use to clean your sandals, you should dry them the same way—out in the open, away from direct heat or sunlight. Both heat and light can break down the wet material, so keep them on a shaded porch or in the garage. Allow for plenty of air circulation, as well. [6] X Research source Never put sandals in the dryer."

      "content": "Scrub your feet in the shower before wearing sandals. Dead skin trapped in the sole of the sandal is often the culprit of stinky sandals. Take the time to really scrub your feet each time you shower or bathe, and use an exfoliating product or pumice stone to remove dead skin cells a few times per week."
