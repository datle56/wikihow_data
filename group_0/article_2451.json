      "content": "Buy castration bands. Don’t use household office supplies for banding. The bands should be thick enough and tight enough to lead to castration within a few weeks. Store your castration bands in the refrigerator until they are ready for use. This will keep the rubber from breaking down. Always check the rubber ring for elasticity/ breakage before applying it, simply put it on the tool and squeeze the handles to stretch the rubber ring. It should not break/ rip and be free of any cracks."

If you are right handed, put the tool aside for a minute, with your left hand hold the scrotum and feel if both testicles are inside. If not, don't let go, still holding with your left hand, reach with your right hand to the goats belly close to the scrotum, they tend to hold the testicles in sometimes, find them under the skin and push towards the scrotum \"catching\" them with your left hand. Once you can feel both testicles inside you can put the rubber ring on. Still holding the testicles with your left hand, squeeze the tool's handles, pushing scrotum through the open rubber ring, carefully place it where you want it to be, close slightly so that they don't escape again, and with left hand's fingers help push down the rubber ring from the first two metal ring expanders and then remove it completely. Check for proper placement again. Leave them loose, putting the ring a bit closer to the body. Otherwise it will be very painful for the animal and you will have to redo it. Also, make sure that the nipples are outside of the band. [7] X Research source"
