      "title": "Stand sideways to the bowler with your feet a shoulder-width apart.",
      "content": "Stand sideways to the bowler with your feet a shoulder-width apart. Stand sideways in front of the wickets with your knees slightly bent and your head turned towards the bowler. Bend at your hips but keep your back straight. Your non-dominant elbow should be pointing in the direction of the bowler as you hold the bat. [1] X Research source Don't let your shoulders drop. Keep them as straight as you can as you're batting. Stay on the balls of your feet while you're hitting. Your eyes and shoulders should be level. Keep your eyes on the ball at all times."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the bat tight with both hands.",
      "content": "Hold the bat tight with both hands. Your non-dominant, or lead hand, should be over the end of the bat's grip holding it tightly. Your dominant hand should be below it with a loose 2-finger and thumb grip. Both hands should be close together and the paddle should feel comfortable in your hands. [2] X Research source Your knuckles on your non-dominant hand should be facing the bowler and your backhand or dominant hand's knuckles should be facing the catcher."

    {
      "title": "Make a line in the turf where the middle wicket is.",
      "content": "Make a line in the turf where the middle wicket is. Making a line in the turf in the position of the middle wicket is known as making a guard and will give you some awareness to where the wickets are positioned as you're batting. Put the tip of your bat in the turf and make a line so that it runs parallel with the middle wicket. [3] X Research source If you are practicing inside, you can use a piece of tape to make your guard line."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tap the bat on the guard line.",
      "content": "Tap the bat on the guard line. Tapping the bat on the ground will give the bowler the sign that you're ready to hit. Don't tap the ground excessively hard and keep your bat as straight as possible so that you maintain good form. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Step forward with your lead foot and bring the bat back.",
      "content": "Step forward with your lead foot and bring the bat back. Swing the bat back so that it comes up to your back shoulder and is pointed straight in the air. As you wind up, keep the bat as straight as possible. As you step forward, turn your lead foot so that your toes are facing the bowler. [5] X Research source As you bring the bat back, your forearm should line up with your shoulder. Keep in mind that if the ball is bouncing high, then you will need to step backwards instead. Only step forward if the ball is low."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your eye on the ball.",
      "content": "Keep your eye on the ball. Try to follow the ball as it bounces towards you. If you can follow the pitch from when it leaves the bowler's hand, you'll know where you have to position the bat for a hit. As the ball comes towards you, decide which kind of hit you want to make with the bat. [6] X Research source If you think the ball will bounce in the sweet spot, you can wind up to drive the ball far. If the ball is short, prepare to make a defensive shot."
    },
    {
      "title": "Swing the bat downward to hit the ball after it bounces.",
      "content": "Swing the bat downward to hit the ball after it bounces. Step forward with your lead leg, and swing the bat downward so that your lead elbow points towards the bowler. This is the most traditional shot in cricket and is known as a straight drive. Follow through with your shot to make the ball go as far as possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Swing the bat to the side if the pitch is short.",
      "content": "Swing the bat to the side if the pitch is short. If the ball bounces early, or what is known as short, you should step back with your back foot to prepare for a high defensive swing. Swing the bat out to the side, as you would with a baseball bat instead of swinging it directly down. [7] X Research source This is commonly known as a pull shot and will cause the ball to go off to the side."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make contact with the ball if the bowler is aiming for the wickets.",
      "content": "Make contact with the ball if the bowler is aiming for the wickets. If the ball comes in low and fast, the bowler is most likely trying to hit a wicket and get you out. Your main goal is to make contact with the ball for a defensive hit. Use the same swing as you did for a straight drive, but concentrate on just making contact with the ball, rather than driving it far. [8] X Research source The goal is to hit the ball and prevent it from hitting the wickets, not to hit the ball hard so that you can score runs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Follow through with your swing.",
      "content": "Follow through with your swing. A good follow-through is critical, especially if you want to hit the ball far. Follow through the entire swing, even if you miss the ball. This will get you into the habit of always following through on your swings. If you don't follow through you could miss the ball or pop it up in the air for an easy out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stay calm while you bat.",
      "content": "Stay calm while you bat. Nervous energy can throw you off your game and cause you to make mistakes. Practice regulating your breathing and visualize the trajectory of the ball as it leaves the bowler's hands. [9] X Research source Try to block out any excited or nervous energy from the crowd and team members by concentrating on the ball."

    {
      "title": "Swing the cricket bat in the mirror to perfect your swing.",
      "content": "Swing the cricket bat in the mirror to perfect your swing. Before you practice with a ball, you should try to perfect your swing in front of a mirror, which is also known as shadow cricket. Seeing yourself will let you know what adjustments you need to make to improve your stance and swing. [10] X Research source Make adjustments to your stance when you notice that you're doing it incorrectly."

      "title": "Practice batting by yourself with a tennis ball.",
      "content": "Practice batting by yourself with a tennis ball. Throw a tennis ball down on the ground and hit it after it bounces. This will emulate a full pitch, or a pitch that lands right in front of you, and will help you practice swinging if you don't have anyone to practice with. [11] X Research source Keep your dominant hand on the bat if you are practicing alone. Doing this drill will help improve your bottom hand grip."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drill with your team as much as possible.",
      "content": "Drill with your team as much as possible. The best way to get better at being a batsman is active practice with your team. Make every effort to attend practice. Drill game scenarios and hitting as much as possible so that you're prepared when game time comes. Take your coach's advice and listen to any input that team members have on your hitting."
