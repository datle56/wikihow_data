In magickal practices, creating sigils is a way to set specific goals or intentions in your subconscious so you can bring your manifestations to life. While angels are unnamed entities who serve as God's messengers, archangels are a specific rank of angels entrusted with special tasks, like protection or wisdom. [1] X Research source Calling on the right archangel can strengthen your sigil. For example, suppose you're manifesting good health for yourself or a loved one. In that case, you'd call on the Archangel Raphael, who represents health, happiness, and joy."

      "content": "Write a new intention on a piece of paper. After your space is cleansed, you can focus on your true intention, meaning why you need the archangel’s powers. Define your intention in a single sentence. Be specific and use positive statements such as \"I want,\" \"I am,\" or \"I will.\" Doing so helps your subconscious believe that your manifestation is already yours. [8] X Research source Avoid setting multiple intentions for one sigil, as it'll decrease your chances of success. For example, if you’ve been struggling with your mental health and you’re looking for guidance from Archangel Raphael, you’d say, “I am Archangel Raphael,” or “I am guided by Archangel Raphael.”"

[10] X Research source You can always look up sigils online if you need inspiration. Play around with upper and lower-case letters or add swirls and stars to your design.

Take your chosen archangel's name and connect each letter from one box to the next. Every sigil will start with a circle and end with a line to create an abstract image. [11] X Research source If a letter doesn't exist, use the letter's sound instead or delete the letter from the sigil."

A smudging ritual works by burning a bundle of sage, rosemary, cedar, sage, or sweetgrass to banish bad vibes from a space, object, or person. [12] X Research source Create a simple intention such as, “I am letting go of negative energy.” Burn your sage for at least 30 seconds before blowing it out. Then, gently fan the smoke along the room while focusing on your intention. You can also cleanse yourself by standing in a T-shape, allowing the smoke to cover your body, working up from your feet. Once you feel the negative energy has been lifted, put the smoke out by pressing it into a heat-proof dish. Close off your ritual by declaring your intention out loud or silently in your head.

However, there are three sigil types that determine what you can do with a sigil after you create it. [14] X Research source For example: Destructible sigils can be a piece of paper with the sigil drawn on it used to burn over a candle fire. Temporary sigils can be hand-drawn onto your skin using eyeliner or a marker, where they can disappear over time. Permanent sigils can be a piece of art, a tattoo, or woven into clothing that lasts forever. In this case, you may need to recharge your sigil to give it power again."

Focus on your sigil by holding it in your hands or until you can see it in your mind. [15] X Research source You can also chant, dance, or clap your intention aloud to charge your sigil."

For destructible sigils, if you've chosen to draw your sigil onto a piece of paper or carve it into a candle, the act of burning is the activation. Similarly, if you carved your sigil into food, you can activate it by eating it. Temporary signals can be activated by drawing your sigil onto your skin. Permanent sigils, like a piece of art, can be activated by placing it in a safe space. Once your sigil is activated, forget about it! Now it's time for your manifestation to come to fruition—but give it time. Things don't happen overnight. [16] X Research source"
