Having goals that don't fit with your overall values is like riding in a buggy with two horses that are going in opposite directions - it's mayhem. You can have the most inspiring goals, but if they are not supporting your personal values, your success won't feel like success. For example, Joe finds that his biggest values are community involvement, integrity, and leadership. In his current job, he is a supervisor at a non-profit organization that offers scholarships and training to under-served student populations. He learns that all the funds are not being directed to students as he once thought. Despite him meeting his values of community involvement and leadership, Joe may feel dissatisfied with his job because the organization is not one of integrity. Joe must develop new goals that align with his values to bring him balance and happiness."

Appreciating who you are and recognizing your worth are instrumental in developing a healthy mindset. Two practical solutions for boosting self-esteem are overcoming perfectionism and the tendency to compare. When we hold ourselves to unrealistically high standards (perfectionism), we will always fall short. Having realistic expectations about what you can accomplish motivates you to work harder and makes your feel good about yourself. When you move past perfectionism, mistakes aren't permanent failures, and even tiny successes are worthy of celebration. Assuming that everyone else has a better time than you is a recipe for disaster. All humans have shortcomings and comparing yourself to someone else based on what you see from the outside is unfair to you. The only comparisons you should be making is with yourself today versus yesterday."
