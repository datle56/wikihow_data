      "title": "“Yellow” is a song expressing unconditional love and devotion.",
      "content": "“Yellow” is a song expressing unconditional love and devotion. It’s narrated by someone who feels overwhelming love and admiration for someone special and writes a song for them about it. In the song, the narrator sings about everything they’ve done for this person and how that person makes them feel: “yellow.” Thus, at its core, “Yellow” is a love song! The book Coldplay: Nobody Said It Was Easy explains that the song’s title comes from the feeling of the band while it was written—full of “brightness and hope.” [1] X Research source"

      "title": "The song’s specific meaning is left intentionally vague.",
      "content": "The song’s specific meaning is left intentionally vague. If you’re wondering whether Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin wrote the song for someone specific—a partner or family member, for example—the answer is no. He has confirmed that, while the song is about love and devotion to someone, there wasn’t anyone in particular in mind when he wrote it. [2] X Research source The beauty of the song is that it can describe anyone you feel that kind of love for! According to Martin, “Yellow” is “a feeling more than a meaning.” Then, when asked on The Howard Stern Show if it was about a girl, he said, “It’s about all girls.” [3] X Research source Martin may have been inspired by unrequited love while writing the song—but again, nobody specific has ever been mentioned. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "The song was inspired by stargazing in Wales.",
      "content": "The song was inspired by stargazing in Wales. Chris Martin, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland, and Will Champion wrote “Yellow” at Rockfield Studios in Wales. When the band decided to take a break outside, they noticed how vibrant the night sky was compared to the city, and their producer, Ken Nelson, said, “Look at the stars.” This inspired the first line of “Yellow,” and the rest followed soon after! [5] X Research source “Yellow” was a challenge for the band to record; in an interview with MTV, drummer Will Champion said they tried numerous tempos and versions of the song, struggling to pick one. Producer Ken Nelson agreed, telling Sound on Sound that after a few different recordings and nothing solid, the band just used Pro Tools to finish the song."

      "title": "Martin found the word “yellow” from the studio’s Yellow Pages.",
      "content": "Martin found the word “yellow” from the studio’s Yellow Pages. That’s right: in the beginning, “yellow” didn’t actually mean anything—and it was the title of the song! After struggling to find the right word to tie the song together, Martin told MTV there was a gap after “And all the things you do…” While singing it in the studio, he looked around and saw the Yellow Pages—and incorporated “yellow” into the song. [6] X Research source Martin told Howard Stern in 2011 that “yellow” just rolled off the tongue well, and that’s why it was added to the song. [7] X Research source Even if it meant nothing initially, Martin acknowledged that “yellow” ended up being quite fitting, considering the color’s symbolism. At the time, though, Martin actually doubted his own lyrics and worried about describing stars as “yellow.”"

      "content": "“Yellow” became a breakthrough song for Coldplay. When it was first released, it was the song that earned Coldplay international recognition—and since then, Coldplay has become one of the most well-known bands in the world. After over two decades, “Yellow” is still one of the band’s most popular and beloved songs. [8] X Research source Funny enough, the song has had its doubters, too. When Coldplay played “Yellow” for Steve Jobs, Apple’s former CEO, he said they’d never make it!"

      "title": "“Look at the stars / Look how they shine for you / And everything you do / Yeah, they were all yellow.\"",
      "content": "“Look at the stars / Look how they shine for you / And everything you do / Yeah, they were all yellow.\" At the song's start, the narrator expresses admiration for the person they’re singing about. This person is so amazing and radiant that, in the narrator’s eyes, the stars themselves shine for this person—and everything they do brings light to the world. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "“I came along / I wrote a song for you / And all the things you do / And it was called yellow.”",
      "content": "“I came along / I wrote a song for you / And all the things you do / And it was called yellow.” The song is sung from the perspective of a narrator who, in turn, wrote it for someone they love and admire—so this is a bit of a meta phrase about how “Yellow” came to be. The narrator in the song is saying that everything their loved one does is “yellow.” [10] X Research source Like all colors, yellow is traditionally associated with different meanings, including warmth, joy, and hope. [11] X Research source So, the narrator is saying that they named the song “Yellow” because this person and everything they do is “yellow”—full of cheer and hope. Since Martin has confirmed that the song isn’t about anyone specific, “Yellow” is a descriptor for any loved one who brings joy to your life!"

      "title": "“Your skin and bones / Turn into something beautiful / And you know I love you so.”",
      "content": "“Your skin and bones / Turn into something beautiful / And you know I love you so.” In the chorus, the narrator tells the person they love that they are beautiful and that all the separate little parts of themselves (including their skin and bones) form a wonderful whole. It’s yet another way for the narrator to express their love for the person they’re singing to. [12] X Research source Fun fact - the lyrics “All I know / Is that I love you so” reappear on Coldplay’s 2014 song “Ink” as well."

      "title": "“I swam across / I jumped across for you / Oh, what a thing to do / ‘Cause you were all yellow.”",
      "content": "“I swam across / I jumped across for you / Oh, what a thing to do / ‘Cause you were all yellow.” The narrator continues with a metaphor expressing everything they’ve done for their loved one— “swimming” and “jumping” to them as an act of service and devotion. “Oh, what a thing to do” also contains a little surprise and pride, like the narrator is proud of the many gestures they’ve made for their loved one. [13] X Research source This part of the song emphasizes the narrator’s unconditional love and the idea that they’d do anything for the person they’re singing to. There’s joy and giddiness in these declarations—the narrator feels joyful around their love, and that joy inspires their actions."

      "title": "I drew a line / I draw a line for you / Oh, what a thing to do / And it was all yellow.”",
      "content": "I drew a line / I draw a line for you / Oh, what a thing to do / And it was all yellow.” “Draw a line” implies that the narrator has set boundaries on behalf of their loved one. This could mean in terms of sticking up for them around other people—or in terms of figuring out what the narrator can and can’t do for their loved one and how far they’re willing to go for their love’s happiness. [14] X Research source With “And it was all yellow,” the narrator confirms that doing these things and being with this person brought them all the things that “yellow” represents—hope, happiness, energy, and joy."

    {
      "title": "“It’s true / Look how they shine for you / And all the things that you do.”",
      "content": "“It’s true / Look how they shine for you / And all the things that you do.” Finally, at the song's end, the narrator brings back the idea that the stars are shining for their loved one—as though they’re reminding their loved one while getting them to look at the sky. Throughout the song, there’s no specified gender or relationship between the narrator and their loved one. So, “Yellow” isn’t overtly romantic, although it can absolutely be interpreted that way; it simply describes devotion to a loved one, whether that love is romantic, familial, or otherwise."

      "content": "The “Yellow” music video features Chris Martin walking along the shore. The video was originally supposed to feature the whole band on the beach during a sunny summer day. Then, on the day they were supposed to shoot the video, rain was falling—and it turned into a more poignant music video with Martin on the beach solo. [15] X Research source To make the video, Martin lip-synced to a sped-up version of “Yellow.” That way, the video could be given a slow-motion effect during post-production."

      "title": "Yellow is associated with joy, positivity, hope, and enthusiasm.",
      "content": "Yellow is associated with joy, positivity, hope, and enthusiasm. Historically, it’s been used to represent the sun—and everything related to the sun, including optimism, enlightenment, energy, and happiness. Better yet, yellow is actually proven to stimulate creativity and a positive attitude (as do many bright, “happy” colors). [16] X Research source Thus, in the song, “yellow” describes how a loved one can make you feel and the kind of metaphorical light that person can radiate!"
