Although the concept of a credit score can feel abstract, it is valuable to understand credit and to know your score, especially if you are planning to apply for a loan or other significant financial step in the future (buy a car, buy a house, etc). Your credit score (or FICO score) is a 3-digit number between 300 and 850 which represents your success in borrowing and repaying money. [5] X Research source A higher number indicates a better credit score. Credit scores are affected by many forms of financial transactions. Credit card payments and the number of credit cards that you use, loan payments (including student loans), the number of years you’ve been accruing credit for, and the amount of money that you owe all influence your credit score. [6] X Research source A credit score is important to financial institutions and credit card companies; banks and credit unions will use your FICO score to determine your eligibility for loans."

      "content": "Understand Experian’s offered services. Many individuals sign up for a free 30-day trial or for a “one-time” $1 credit report, without realizing that Experian will roll these one-time registrations into a permanent subscription. While finding out your credit score is useful, many people don’t appreciate Experian’s automatic subscription policy. Always read the small print, especially when giving Experian money, or if they already have your credit card information. Many individuals sign up for Experian (or another credit-monitoring service) because they are concerned about credit fraud. You can do this yourself by watching your monthly bank and credit card statements; keep an eye out for suspicious charges or fees."
