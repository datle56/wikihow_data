      "title": "Search for scholarships you’re eligible for.",
      "content": "Search for scholarships you’re eligible for. Look for scholarships through colleges, your guidance counselor or local library, or scholarship websites to find scholarships you qualify for. Some scholarships are awarded based on financial need, while others are given based on GPA, student involvement, or other factors. Be sure to read all the qualifications to make sure you’re eligible. [1] X Research source For example, to get the highly-competitive Coca-Cola Scholars Program Scholarship , you need a GPA of at least 3.0, and you have to demonstrate outstanding character and leadership. [2] X Research source Scholarships are also offered to students who live in a certain state, students who are of a particular ethnicity, students who are majoring in a specific field, or athletes. Some scholarships have even narrower requirements—one of your parents might need to work at a certain company, for instance. Try looking for scholarships based on the career you want. For example, if you want to be a nurse, consider applying for the A Nurse I Am scholarship , the Scarlett Family Foundation scholarship , and many more. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "File the FAFSA.",
      "content": "File the FAFSA. Many need-based scholarships use your FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) data to determine if you’re eligible. In many cases, if you haven’t filled out the FAFSA, you won’t qualify. This is the case for many institutional scholarships, and sometimes these scholarships require no additional forms or applications other than the FAFSA. [4] X Research source The FAFSA determines how much help you'll need to pay for college based on your parents' incomes (or yours if you're an adult). It may be helpful to have your parents around while filling out the FAFSA, but it’s possible to complete it on your own , as well."

      "title": "Read and understand the application requirements.",
      "content": "Read and understand the application requirements. Once you’ve determined your eligibility, read through the scholarship’s application requirements to determine what materials you need to submit your application. This varies depending on the scholarship, but in general, you may be required to submit your basic personal information, a copy of your transcript and/or diploma, an essay, letter(s) of recommendation, and financial aid information. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Write an eye-catching essay.",
      "content": "Write an eye-catching essay. If your scholarship application requires an essay , don't see it as an obstacle—this is your moment to shine! Read the essay prompt carefully, then share a personal story that demonstrates why you're a great candidate. Even if you’re not a strong writer, this is your opportunity to express your personality, ideas, and opinions. It may help to create an outline to organize your ideas. [6] X Research source For instance, if you have to tell a story about overcoming a challenge, paint the scene with vivid detail—talk about how you felt as you faced the problem, a little background to explain why it was such a big deal for you, and how you summoned the strength and courage to succeed. Try to find ways to relate to the organization's mission statement. For instance, if you're applying to a faith-based school, mention how your belief in God helped you during a hard time. Pay attention to all requirements, like word count limits. Make sure you follow all instructions to give yourself a bigger chance at winning. Give yourself plenty of time to write, edit, and proofread your essay. It may help to have a teacher or parents look it over, as well."

    {
      "title": "Ask for a letter of recommendation, if required.",
      "content": "Ask for a letter of recommendation, if required. Many scholarships require a letter of recommendation as part of their submission guidelines. Ask your teachers , coaches, and/or employer if they’d write a letter of recommendation for you. It’s best to choose someone you have a good relationship with and who understands your skills and qualifications. Give them an idea of what you'd like them to include in their letter—maybe you worked really hard on a project for them, or you'd like them to mention that you worked after school while maintaining a strong GPA . Then, follow up with them to make sure you get the references back in time for your scholarship deadline. [7] X Research source Be sure to ask several weeks before the application deadline so they'll have plenty of time to finish your letter. You can usually reuse your references if you're applying for more than one scholarship."

      "title": "Submit your application by the deadline.",
      "content": "Submit your application by the deadline. Give yourself plenty of time to get your application materials together. If you miss the deadline, all that hard work will be for nothing! If you’re worried you might forget, mark the deadline in your calendar and set a notification on your phone. Create a timeline to finish everything you need to do before that day arrives. This will help relieve a lot of stress! [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Look on colleges’ financial aid websites.",
      "content": "Look on colleges’ financial aid websites. Even if you haven't started applying yet, it’s a good idea to see what each school offers. In many cases, your application packet will contain a list of scholarships in the financial aid section. Many colleges also list the information on the school’s website. If you can’t find anything, contact their financial aid office by phone or email. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Check with your guidance counselor or local library.",
      "content": "Check with your guidance counselor or local library. These are both great resources for all kinds of scholarships. In addition to information about school-based, federal, and state scholarships, you might also find out about scholarships offered by local organizations or companies that you wouldn't have heard about otherwise. [10] X Research source If you're a member of a religious community, check with your church, temple, or synagogue to see if they offer any scholarships. Check with your employer or your parents’ employers, as well. Sometimes companies offer scholarships."

    {
      "title": "Use an online scholarship search.",
      "content": "Use an online scholarship search. There are tons of sites that offer scholarship searches. To keep from getting overwhelmed, start with 1 or 2 of the most popular free search sites, like Career One Stop , which is sponsored by the US Department of Labor. Other popular databases include FastWeb and Scholarships.com . Make a list of any scholarships you qualify for and their application due dates to make sure you don’t miss anything. [11] X Research source Scholarship information is available publicly, so you don't need to pay a website to give you these search results."

    {
      "title": "Apply for scholarships as early as possible.",
      "content": "Apply for scholarships as early as possible. Ideally, start researching scholarships during the summer between your junior and senior year of high school. Each scholarship has its own deadline, and some require you to apply as early as a year before you start college. However, it’s never too late—you can even apply for some scholarships after you’re already in college. Just check the deadline information to be sure. [12] X Research source Use a calendar or a spreadsheet to keep track of all the due dates so you don’t accidentally miss one!"

      "title": "Scholarships can be merit-based or need-based.",
      "content": "Scholarships can be merit-based or need-based. Merit-based scholarships mean you have to meet some requirement—like having a certain GPA, playing a sport, or having a particular interest. Need-based scholarships, on the other hand, are only granted to students who are facing financial hardship. These are often called grants. [13] X Research source You can find scholarships for almost everything, from playing a certain musical instrument to being a twin. That means it can take a lot of searching to find the exact scholarship that suits you, but if you're persistent, you’ll almost certainly find something!"

    {
      "title": "Focus on academics and extracurriculars while you're in school.",
      "content": "Focus on academics and extracurriculars while you're in school. You're most likely to win a scholarship if you were a good student, active in your community and school, and demonstrated leadership throughout your school years. Also, get really clear on what you want to do after school—if you have very specific goals, a scholarship committee might be more likely to see you as a good investment. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Start by applying to just a few scholarships that fit your interests.",
      "content": "Start by applying to just a few scholarships that fit your interests. Because there are so many scholarships out there, it can seem overwhelming at first. Focus on finding scholarships that you feel like you're a really good fit for. Then, gradually expand your search to scholarships that you qualify for, but maybe aren't as confident about. [15] X Research source Remember—you don't always have to be a perfect candidate for a scholarship as long as you meet the basic requirements. You might very well be the best fit out of all of the applicants! Also, keep in mind that the more scholarships you apply to, the better your chances of getting one."

    {
      "title": "Try applying to smaller and local scholarships.",
      "content": "Try applying to smaller and local scholarships. It can be tempting to only apply to scholarships that offer a large amount of money, but remember that you'll also have to compete with more people for those. On the other hand, if you get several smaller scholarships, those can add up quickly—and they might have fewer applicants, so you may have a better chance of winning! [16] X Research source Similarly, you might be one of only a few candidates when you apply to scholarships that are only available to students who live in your city or state."

    {
      "title": "Organize your application process.",
      "content": "Organize your application process. As you search for scholarships, save all of the scholarships you're considering to a spreadsheet . Include the deadline and anything you need to include in your application. When you're more organized, you'll be less likely to miss out on an opportunity because you got your application in late. [17] X Research source It can help to dedicate a few hours each week solely to finding and applying for scholarships."

    {
      "title": "Keep searching year-round and during college.",
      "content": "Keep searching year-round and during college. The more scholarships you apply for, the more likely you’ll be awarded one. Because scholarship deadlines vary, it’s possible to find new ones at any time throughout the year. Many scholarships are also available to college and grad students, as well, so don’t stop your search just because you graduated high school. [18] X Research source"

      "title": "Are scholarships for all 4 years of college?",
      "content": "Are scholarships for all 4 years of college? Some are, but not all of them. Some scholarships, especially the ones offered by an institution or a large organization, might be enough to cover all 4 years of your college education. However, some scholarships will only be for a few hundred dollars. Don't pass those up, though—even small amounts can really add up once you start looking at tuition! [19] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "How do I get my scholarship money?",
      "content": "How do I get my scholarship money? It depends on the scholarship. Some scholarships send the money directly to your college to be applied to tuition and fees, and any leftover amount will be given to you. Other scholarships may send you a check directly. The scholarship provider should tell you what to expect when you’re awarded the scholarship. If they don’t, make sure to ask. [20] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "How does a scholarship affect my other student aid?",
      "content": "How does a scholarship affect my other student aid? Your total student aid cannot be more than the cost of attendance at your chosen school, so receiving a scholarship can affect your other aid. Let your college know that you’ve received a scholarship so the financial aid office can subtract that amount from the cost of attendance and other aid and loans you may have been offered. Any costs remaining after the scholarship has been applied can be covered by other forms of aid. [21] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "How do I know if a scholarship is a scam?",
      "content": "How do I know if a scholarship is a scam? Legitimate scholarships are free to apply to and search for. If a scholarship site is behind a paywall, it’s a scam. A scholarship provider may ask for your bank information if you’ve been awarded the scholarship, but never before. If you’re ever unsure, contact the provider directly to determine if the scholarship is real. [22] X Research source Ask your school counselor or your college’s financial aid office for reputable scholarship sites and sources."

    {
      "title": "Why do I need scholarships?",
      "content": "Why do I need scholarships? Scholarships give you free money to put toward your college education. Depending on the size of the scholarship, they can save you hundreds or thousands of dollars. Some will even pay your tuition altogether. The best part about scholarships is that, unlike loans, you’ll never have to pay the money back. They’re a great way to reduce student debt. [23] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "What is the difference between a grant and a scholarship?",
      "content": "What is the difference between a grant and a scholarship? Both grants and scholarships offer free money toward your college education. Typically, grants are awarded based on financial need and usually come from the government or the college. Scholarships, on the other hand, are often merit-based (though they can be need-based, as well) and can be awarded from a variety of providers, including businesses and religious organizations.

      "title": "Can international students apply for scholarships?",
      "content": "Can international students apply for scholarships? International students may be eligible for some scholarships if they’re attending college in the U.S. Not all scholarships are available to international students, however, so be sure to read all the requirements when applying. [25] X Research source Often, international students have to pay higher tuition than domestic students, so it’s a good idea to apply to colleges that offer tuition waivers."
