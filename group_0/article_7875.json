      "content": "Put your car in park and let the engine cool for about 10 minutes. Because the sensor is connected to wires, your car needs to be off when you go to remove it. Just park it in your driveway and turn it off. Then, leave your car for about 10 minutes so the engine is nice and cool. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Pop the hood and look for the sensor by the air box and throttle body. Open your car’s hood and look towards the driver’s side. You’ll see a large black box connecting to a silver part; this is the air filter box and throttle body. Right in between these parts is the MAF sensor, which is usually a small black square attached to a thick connector. [3] X Research source Some cars house the MAF sensor inside the air filter box, so open it up and move the box aside to find the MAF sensor. Every car’s MAF sensor placement is slightly different. If you’re still unsure where your sensor is located, check your car’s manual. Or, search online for “a mass air flow sensor” with your car’s make and model."

      "content": "Pinch down on the connector to unplug it from the MAF sensor. Find the large, black connector that’s plugged into the MAF sensor. Most connectors have a squeezable head that loosens it from the sensor. Then, pull on the connector while wiggling it back and forth to remove it from the sensor. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a screwdriver to unscrew the MAF sensor from your car. Take a Phillips-head screwdriver and remove each screw securing the MAF sensor to your car. Be sure to put the screws in a safe location so you don’t lose them. Then, take out the sensor and place it on a table covered with a towel. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Spray the MAF sensor’s hot wire or plate with MAF cleaner.",
      "content": "Spray the MAF sensor’s hot wire or plate with MAF cleaner . Depending on your car, your sensor will either have a tiny silver wire resting inside a hole or have a silver plate extending from it. Insert the straw into the MAF cleaner. Then, hold it about 4 inches (10 cm) away from your MAF sensor. Spray about 10 to 15 spurts of the cleaner onto the wire or plate. [6] X Research source Do not use anything besides MAF cleaner to clean your sensor. This cleaner is specifically designed to clean its delicate wire or plate. Using brushes, cloths, other car part cleaners, or rubbing alcohol can damage the sensor. [7] X Research source If the wire or plate still has gunk covering it or doesn’t look bright and shiny, spray it with cleaner until it’s sparkling."

      "title": "Let the MAF cleaner evaporate before reinstalling the sensor.",
      "content": "Let the MAF cleaner evaporate before reinstalling the sensor. It’s important not to put a wet MAF sensor back in your car, as this can damage the electronic connector. MAF cleaner usually dries pretty quickly, but to be on the safe side, let it be for 1 hour. [8] X Research source It might be tempting, but don’t dry your MAF sensor off with a cloth. The sensor is super delicate and wiping it can damage its parts."

      "content": "Screw the MAF sensor back in place and plug in the connector. Using a Phillips-head screwdriver and the screws you removed, secure the MAF sensor into your car. Then, attach the connector to the sensor. Your MAF sensor is now sparkling clean, which your car will thank you for! [9] X Research source If you have a car stalling issue or a lit check engine light, cleaning the MAF sensor can often solve the issue. If these problems persist, your sensor might just be old or faulty. To replace it, search for the MAF sensor that’s compatible with your car or check your car’s manual. Unplug the connector, take out the sensor, and pop in your new one. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Cleaning your sensor every 6 months can help your car run smoothly. To extend the life of your MAF sensor and prevent costly repairs, clean it semi-regularly. Because the MAF sensor is stored near your air filter box, that makes it a great time to clean it when you change your air filter , or about every 6 months. [11] X Research source"
