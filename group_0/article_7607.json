      "title": "Wipe crumbs and dust off with a microfiber cloth.",
      "content": "Wipe crumbs and dust off with a microfiber cloth. Surface dust usually comes off easily. Start by wiping the mousepad down with a microfiber cloth. Push any debris towards the sides of the mousepad to work it off the surface. If your mousepad isn’t very dirty, this might be all you need. [1] X Research source You could also shake your mousepad a little to dislodge any other crumbs that might be stuck. Use a microfiber cloth rather than a towel or brush because rough items could damage the mousepad."

    {
      "title": "Clean other stuck material with a damp cloth.",
      "content": "Clean other stuck material with a damp cloth. If some of the dirt is stuck on the mousepad, then a bit of water can help. Wet a microfiber cloth and wring it out so it isn’t dripping. Then wipe down the pad to remove any stuck crumbs or dirt. [2] X Research source Wait until your mousepad is completely dry before using it. Your mouse won’t track well if the pad is damp. A quick wipe like this can improve your mouse performance by removing any obstructions."

    {
      "title": "Rub the bottom of the pad with a damp cloth to prevent shifting.",
      "content": "Rub the bottom of the pad with a damp cloth to prevent shifting. Dust and dirt under the mousepad can cause slipping, which can ruin your gameplay. Whenever you clean the top of the pad, flip it over and wipe the underside with a damp microfiber cloth. This should remove any dirt or crumbs. [3] X Research source Let the underside of the pad dry before you play. The moisture could soak into the pad and interfere with your mouse."
    },
    {
      "title": "Disinfect the mousepad with disinfectant wipes.",
      "content": "Disinfect the mousepad with disinfectant wipes. The mousepad will pick up a lot of bacteria over time, so an occasional disinfection can prevent you from getting sick. Take a disinfectant wipe and scrub the pad surface to kill any germs. Wait a few minutes for the liquid to evaporate before using the pad. [4] X Research source If you don’t have wipes, you could spray a bit of disinfectant on a microfiber cloth and wipe it on the pad. Don’t wipe the pad with paper towels or tissues. These will leave paper remnants behind."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill a bowl with lukewarm water.",
      "content": "Fill a bowl with lukewarm water. Make sure the bowl is large enough to fit the mousepad. You could also fill the sink as well. Just make sure the sink is clean and free of any food leftovers. [5] X Research source Don’t use hot water for this job. You could damage the mousepad."
    },
    {
      "title": "Submerge the mousepad in the water.",
      "content": "Submerge the mousepad in the water. Drop the pad into the sink or bowl and press it down so the entire thing is submerged. Let it sit for a minute and get completely wet. [6] X Research source If the whole mousepad doesn’t fit in the bowl, then roll or fold it up to get the whole thing wet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Massage a drop of dish soap into the front and back of the pad with your fingers.",
      "content": "Massage a drop of dish soap into the front and back of the pad with your fingers. Take the pad out of the water and set it down on a towel. Squeeze a drop of soap onto the pad and rub it in until the soap lathers. Spread it around the front and back of the pad to clean the entire surface. [7] X Research source You could also use hand soap or detergent to clean the mousepad. They will work as well. Use your hands instead of a brush so you don’t pull up any of the fibers on the mousepad."

    {
      "title": "Wipe the pad with a wet microfiber cloth if there’s still dirt stuck on it.",
      "content": "Wipe the pad with a wet microfiber cloth if there’s still dirt stuck on it. Wet the cloth and wring it out a bit so it isn’t dripping. Scrub the front and back of the pad in a circular motion to work up any remaining dirt. Then scrub it off the sides of the pad. [8] X Research source If there aren’t any dirt or crumbs caked into the pad, then this might not be necessary. You can skip this step if the pad isn’t too dirty."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dip the mousepad back into the water to rinse it.",
      "content": "Dip the mousepad back into the water to rinse it. Wring the mousepad around gently under the water to wash off the soap. Make sure there are no suds left over so soap scum doesn’t form. [9] X Research source If there are still suds on the mousepad, try running it under the faucet or shower to rinse it further."

      "title": "Wrap the mousepad in a towel to soak up excess water.",
      "content": "Wrap the mousepad in a towel to soak up excess water. Take the mousepad out of the water and wring it out gently. Then lay it on a towel and wrap it up. Press down onto the mousepad to soak up the excess water. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Let the mousepad air-dry for a few hours before using it.",
      "content": "Let the mousepad air-dry for a few hours before using it. Your mouse won’t track correctly if you use it while it’s still damp. Leave the pad drying for 2-4 hours before you use it again. [11] X Research source Don’t try to speed up the process with a hair dryer or something like that. This could damage the pad. The sun could stain the mousepad, so don’t leave it out in the sun either."
