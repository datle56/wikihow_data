If you’re using formula, read the package instructions on mixing the formula powder with water, and follow the instructions exactly. Do not use more formula powder than what is called for in the instructions; doing so can give your baby painful gas or cause them to become dangerously dehydrated. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Breastmilk is the healthiest option for feeding your newborn. If you are able to breastfeed your baby or pump expressed milk to feed them in a bottle, you should do so. If you are unable to breastfeed, pump your breastmilk, or purchase donated breastmilk, infant formula is the only safe alternative for feeding your baby. Do not feed an infant under 6 months old cow’s milk, other animal milk, or milk alternatives such as soy milk. Breastmilk and infant formulas are the only safe milks for babies under 6 months. Be sure that you have clean, safe drinking water to use for your formula."

      "content": "Warm cold breastmilk in a bottle warmer or pan of warm water. If you are using expressed breastmilk to feed your baby, they may prefer it to be warmed if it has been refrigerated or thawed from the freezer. Warm a pan of water on the stove until it is warm but not boiling, then remove it from the heat. Place the bottle of milk in the pan and allow it to warm until it’s no higher than 100 °F (38 °C). You can use a clean food thermometer to check the temperature if you like. [5] X Research source Do not warm your bottle directly on the stove, use a microwave, or let the milk get higher than 100 °F (38 °C). Doing so increases the risk of burning your baby’s mouth. It is safe to feed your baby cold or room temperature breastmilk. Many parents warm breastmilk after it’s been refrigerated or frozen to make it closer to the temperature of milk during breastfeeding, and because their babies prefer it, but it is not necessary to warm it. There are commercial bottle warmers available for sale that you can use if you prefer. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions on using it if you have one."

Turn the bottle upside down and allow a few drops of milk or formula to come out onto your forearm. Check that the drops feel cool or warm but not hot, and that they flow steadily from the bottle in continuous drips. [6] X Research source If you have to squeeze the nipple or shake the bottle to get drops to come out, the hole may be blocked. Check the nipple hole to be sure it is clean and unobstructed. If the milk or formula seems to pour out of the nipple, the hole may be damaged. Replace the nipple with a new, sterilized nipple before feeding your infant. It's much better to give your baby breastmilk or formula that's cooler than to burn their tongues with breastmilk or formula that's too hot.

There are several ways to sterilize bottles, but you can submerge your bottle, nipple, and any other pieces in boiling water for 5 minutes as a simple method. You can also use the sanitize setting on your dishwasher. [8] X Expert Source Mor Levy Volner, IBCLC, RDN International Board Certified Lactation Consultant Expert Interview. 5 May 2020. Check the manufacturer’s label about the safety of sterilizing plastic bottles. Some plastics contain chemicals that should not be exposed to high heat. Many parents choose glass bottles for this reason. [9] X Expert Source Mor Levy Volner, IBCLC, RDN International Board Certified Lactation Consultant Expert Interview. 5 May 2020. You should sterilize anything going into your newborn’s mouth once per day until their immune system becomes stronger after a few months. You can clean the bottles with regular dish soap and water between sterilizations. Talk with your baby’s pediatrician about when you can decrease how often you sterilize bottles."

      "title": "Feed your baby when they show hunger cues.",
      "content": "Feed your baby when they show hunger cues. Newborns show that they are hungry by moving their heads from side to side, opening their mouths, sticking out their tongues, sucking on their fingers or fists, or trying to suck on anything that comes near their cheek. Crying is actually a late hunger cue, and it’s best to try to feed your baby before they are crying because it’s easier to calm them down to eat. [10] X Expert Source Mor Levy Volner, IBCLC, RDN International Board Certified Lactation Consultant Expert Interview. 5 May 2020. Babies sometimes fuss or cry for reasons other than hunger. If your baby is fussing or crying just an hour after a good feeding, they may need a diaper change, be tired, bored, overstimulated, or too hot or too cold. You can check these other things before trying to feed them again."

When it’s time to feed your baby, sit in a comfortable chair and hold them with their head in the crook of your arm and your hand down around their bottom. Their head should be comfortably above their belly. This is called the cradle position [11] X Research source Never feed your baby when they’re lying flat on their back. This can cause them to choke or cause them to get ear infections. You can also hold your baby on your lap and let their head rest against your chest when you feed them. Just be sure to support their head with your hands and reposition them if they start to slide down off your chest. This position works well for babies that have reflux because they are more upright."

      "content": "Allow your baby to draw the nipple into their mouth and suck. As you bring the nipple up into your baby’s open mouth, they will latch onto it and start to suck and swallow. This is their natural response when they are hungry. When they start to slow their sucking and swallowing, bring the nipple partially out of their mouth and allow them to draw it back in again. [14] X Research source Allowing your baby to draw the nipple back into their mouth throughout the feeding is called “pacing” the feeding, and it simulates the starting and stopping of milk flow during breastfeeding. Your baby will eagerly draw the nipple back into their mouth as you move it away if they are still hungry. If they become upset at having the nipple moved out of their mouth, you can tilt the bottle downward momentarily to slow or stop the flow of liquid. Tilt the bottle back up as your baby starts sucking again so they suck less air."

To add to the feeding experience and bond with your baby, you can talk to them, cuddle them, and look into their eyes while they drink. They will look forward to feeding moments not only to satisfy their hunger, but as a way to spend time feeling loved by you. [15] X Research source At night time, to encourage your baby to go back to sleep, you may want to decrease how much you talk to them during feeding. You can cuddle and look at them, but try to keep other interactions to a minimum. It is also helpful to keep the lights off or dim during night feedings."

      "title": "Follow your baby’s lead for how much and how often to feed them.",
      "content": "Follow your baby’s lead for how much and how often to feed them. Little babies differ from one another in how much and how often they need to eat. In general, a formula-fed newborn will eat 2–4 fl oz (59–118 mL) of formula 6-8 times every 24 hours up until 2 months old. Babies who drink expressed breastmilk may need to eat more often, as breastmilk is metabolized faster than formula. [16] X Research source Don’t worry if your baby doesn’t want to finish a bottle, or if they want more after they finish a bottle. Sometimes they’ll want to eat less, and sometimes they’ll have a growth spurt and need more. [17] X Expert Source Mor Levy Volner, IBCLC, RDN International Board Certified Lactation Consultant Expert Interview. 5 May 2020. The suggested feeding amount is a general guideline, and if they are drinking between 12–32 fl oz (350–950 mL) of milk within 24 hours, they are eating enough. The amount your baby eats will increase at 2 months old to approximately 5–6 fl oz (150–180 mL) of formula 5-6 times per day, or 25–36 fl oz (740–1,060 mL) in 24 hours. At 3-5 months old, the amount increases again to 6–7 fl oz (180–210 mL) 5-6 times per day. Again, babies drinking expressed breastmilk may need to eat more frequently."

When your baby seems finished eating, you can try burping them again to see if they’ll eat more after a burp. If they still are uninterested in eating more, you can keep the bottle for 1 hour after you started the feed in case they want more within the hour. When the hour is up, throw away the milk or formula away by pouring it down the sink drain. [19] X Research source Don’t store a leftover bottle for future use longer than 1 hour. It can become contaminated quickly after it’s been sucked on. Throw the milk away and wash the bottle before you use it again."

Bottle-fed infants suck a lot more air during a feed than infants eating from a breast, so it’s important to burp them frequently during a feed. Burping them throughout the feed makes them more comfortable and more likely to finish their bottle. [20] X Research source Try to burp your baby at least after every 2–3 fl oz (59–89 mL) of milk or formula they drink, or more frequently if they seem squirmy, fussy, or otherwise uncomfortable."
