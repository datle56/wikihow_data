      "content": "Make sure it's actually abandoned. Just because a house is vacant or appears run-down doesn't necessarily mean it's abandoned. The problem with taking control of an abandoned piece of real estate is that somebody does technically own it, even if they don't live in it or take care of it. [2] X Research source Generally speaking, real estate can never be abandoned, because there will always be the name of an owner recorded on the deed for the property. [3] X Research source But that doesn't mean that whoever owns it still wants to own it. In many cases, the owner decided selling the property was more hassle than it was worth."

      "title": "Find out who owns the property.",
      "content": "Find out who owns the property. The easiest way to find out who owns the property is to check your county's property tax records . You can talk to neighbors or take other steps to find out who owns the property, but property tax records are the easiest way. If real estate exists, someone is paying taxes on it – or owes taxes on it – and the county tax assessor will have that person's name and contact information. Keep in mind it's possible that the address the tax assessor has for the owner is the same as the address of the property you believe is abandoned. Another way to find the property owner is to look up the deed for the property in the county recorder's office. If any liens such as mortgages are recorded on the deed, try contacting the bank or mortgage company instead of the individual listed as property owner."

      "title": "Contact the record owner.",
      "content": "Contact the record owner. Once you have a name and address of the owner of the property, attempt to get in touch with them regarding the status of the property. This may require a little detective work on your part. For example, if the only address you can find for the owner is the street address for the property you believe to be abandoned, try sending a post card anyway. The property owner may be having his mail forwarded to a different address, so you can still reach him that way. If the property owner is actually a bank or mortgage company, you might have better luck tracking them down – especially if you make it clear you want to pay them money. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Make the owner an offer.",
      "content": "Make the owner an offer. If you are able to make contact with the owner, offer to take the property off their hands. If the owner owes back taxes, you may be able to acquire the property simply by offering to pay the back taxes. However, this amount may be more substantial if the owner owed additional money on the house when he abandoned it. Make sure you conduct thorough research on the house's title to ensure you're taking title free and clear of any debts aside from those you're willing to pay. A bank that owns property due to a foreclosure probably wants to get back as much as it can. Decide how much you can afford to spend on the property, accounting for any repairs that might need to be made, and make an offer. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Attempt adverse possession. If you cannot contact the owner, you can stake a claim on the property and see if you can keep it. If you openly \"squat\" on the property for a number of years – typically anywhere from five to 25 years or more – and the owner of record never tries to stop you, the title for the property might revert to you. In any case, this is a risky move considering the rightful owner could return at any moment and have you arrested for trespassing. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source"

However, if someone intentionally abandons most kinds of personal property, they lose ownership of it. This must be a deliberate act. In many states, a previous owner may come back and reclaim even intentionally abandoned property within a certain period of time. [8] X Research source In the case of intangible property such as intellectual property, generally a period of time must pass during which the registered owner does nothing to control the property or limit access to it before it's considered abandoned."

      "content": "Determine if anyone else has a better claim to the property. Typically the owner of the building or land where the property is left has a claim to the property that beats everyone but the true owner, even if you found it. For example, if you find a wallet on a street, you may be entitled to keep it. If, however, you find that wallet in a coffee shop, the owner of the coffee shop may have a better claim to the wallet than you do. However, the original owner of the wallet always has the superior claim, and provided the wallet included some sort of ID, you could track down the original owner fairly easily.

For example, if tenants leave personal property behind after an eviction, landlords typically are required to store the property for a period of time and notify the former tenants that the property is being kept. If the former tenants return to reclaim their property, the landlord can charge them reasonable storage fees. [10] X Research source The amount of time property must be held varies among states, but typically is less than a month. After that period passes, the landlord is free to sell the property, throw it away, or keep it for himself."

      "content": "Contact local law enforcement. In most states, if you find an abandoned vehicle you must call local law enforcement and report it – even if you find it on your own property. Make sure you call the police or sheriff's department's non-emergency number – not 911 – to report an abandoned vehicle. [13] X Research source Be prepared to give the officer who handles your call the exact location of the vehicle, as well as the make, model, and any other information you can give her about the appearance or condition of the vehicle so she can find it. [14] X Research source In most states an abandoned vehicle or water vessel becomes state property. For example, in Michigan, you can't claim an abandoned vehicle on your private property, but you may have the opportunity to bid on it at public auction if it remains unclaimed. [15] X Research source In many states, abandoning a vehicle may constitute a civil infraction [16] X Research source or even a criminal misdemeanor, depending on where the vehicle is abandoned and in what condition."

If you have the owner's contact information and you want the car yourself, you may be able to work out something with the owner before his time to reclaim his vehicle runs out. In some areas, police place a warning sticker on the vehicle instructing the record owner that it will be towed and auctioned if not moved within 24 hours. If the owner moves the car, the period of time starts over. [17] X Research source If you find a car that already has an abandoned vehicle sticker or tag on it, you may be able to contact the owner and take the car yourself. Even with the owner's consent, you typically will be on the hook for title, registration, and towing fees, as well as whatever repairs are necessary to get the vehicle back in working order."
