Include links to your social media accounts so their team can see your follower count and engagement rate, and explain how you can help them increase sales and bring in more customers. [1] X Research source Shein will reply to your email if you meet their requirements and then you can negotiate a contract with them. Think of your pitching email as a cover letter for a job. Highlight your strengths and ask a friend to read over it to check for any errors. If you don’t have a lot of followers, ask for a gifting opportunity instead. This allows you to get free products, as long as you post product reviews and use their required hashtags. [2] X Research source"
