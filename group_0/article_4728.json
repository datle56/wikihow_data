      "content": "Measure the desired length of your shelves. Measure the two walls where the corner shelves will fit with a tape measure. Keep in mind that you'll want both of your shelves to be the same size on each wall. For the purpose of this shelf, we'll be creating a shelf with a 23-inch (58.42 cm) face. Measure from the corner of the wall to the space where you want your bookshelf to hang. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut two 45 degree angles on a 1x3 inch (2.54x7.62 cm) board. Lay your board on the thin edge. On one end of a 1x3 inch (2.54x7.62 cm) board cut a 45-degree angle with a miter saw. Once you've made one cut, measure 23 inches (58.42 cm) down the board and mark an X. Cut another 45-degree angle, pointing outward, on the end of your board at the X that you drew. This piece of wood will become the face of your shelf. Each end of your 1x3 inch (2.54x7.62 cm) board should be cut at a 45 degree angle. Read the instruction manual for your miter saw and remember to keep your hands away from the blade. Wear goggles and a face mask when cutting wood. This board will act as a pattern that will help you build the rest of your shelves. [2] X Research source"

Flush the edges of your board to each side of the plywood. This should look like you are laying the wooden board over the corner of the plywood and creating a triangle. Draw a line straight across the plywood, using the board as your stencil. This will create what will be the top shelf. [3] X Research source"

Use a pencil to outline the triangle and make two diagonal lines on both ends of your 1x2-inch (2.54x 5.08 cm) wooden board. Marking this line with a pencil will create lines for your cuts.

You may need to put multiple nails into your frame depending on how much weight you want your corner shelf to be able to support. If there are studs near the corner of your wall, drive the nails into them instead of the sheetrock. Use wall anchors and screws to better support your corner shelf if you are using more weight."
