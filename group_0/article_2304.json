      "title": "Empty the reservoir once a day after you’re done using the humidifier.",
      "content": "Empty the reservoir once a day after you’re done using the humidifier. Don’t let water sit in the reservoir overnight or for longer than 24 hours. Lift the top reservoir from the base and unscrew the cap at the bottom. Pour all of the water out of the reservoir and into the sink. Once you're ready to use it again, fill it up with distilled water. [1] X Research source Water that sits in the reservoir for too long can increase the number of mineral deposits on the sides of the reservoir and, in turn, create more white dust. If you use your humidifier all day, every day, be sure to change the water every morning or night. If your humidifier has a top and bottom reservoir or 2 reservoirs side-by-side, be sure to empty both of them every day. If you have houseplants or a garden, it’s safe to water them with the old water from the tank."

      "title": "Fill your humidifier's tank with distilled water only.",
      "content": "Fill your humidifier's tank with distilled water only. When you’re refilling your humidifier’s reservoir, only use distilled water. You can buy it by the gallon at most grocery, convenience, or drug stores. [2] X Research source Distilled water is made by removing the minerals from the water. The minerals are responsible for the white dust."

      "title": "Keep the humidity in your home between 40% and 50%.",
      "content": "Keep the humidity in your home between 40% and 50%. Get a humidity meter for your home if your thermostat doesn’t already have a humidity feature. Test it at least once a week to make sure it stays between 40% and 50%. If it's too high, leave the humidifier off for a few weeks and test it again to make sure it's within that range. [3] X Research source Too much humidity can cause dust, mold, or mildew to accumulate in your home and inside the humidifier, increasing the chance that it'll emit white dust (along with mold and mildew—not something you want in your home!)."

      "content": "Soak a demineralization cartridge and drop it into the reservoir if possible. Fill a bowl up with 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of water and drop the tiny cartridge in for 10 minutes. Drain the water away and put it into your humidifier’s reservoir after you’ve filled it with distilled water. [4] X Research source The cartridge will prevent calcium and lime deposits from building up inside the reservoir. Some ultrasonic humidifiers are sold with a few demineralization cartridges included. If not, you can buy them online or from most home goods stores that sell humidifiers."

      "title": "Change the filter in cool mist humidifiers every 1 or 2 months.",
      "content": "Change the filter in cool mist humidifiers every 1 or 2 months. Check the instruction manual to see exactly where the filter is and how to change it. In most cases, it's located in a cylindrical chamber sticking up from the base. To change it, remove the reservoir and open the latch or cap at the top of the cylinder. Slide the old filter out, slide the new one in, and replace the latch or cap. [5] X Research source If you use your humidifier every day, change it once a month. If you only use the humidifier a couple of times a week, you can wait 2 months before you change it. Refer to the owner’s manual that came with your model to see how often the manufacturer suggests changing the filter. Most models come with replacement filters, but if not, you can buy them online or from any home goods store that sells humidifiers."

      "title": "Turn the humidifier off and unplug it.",
      "content": "Turn the humidifier off and unplug it. Humidifiers are electrical appliances that can cause an electric shock if you're not careful, so always turn them off and unplug them before you open them up. If you have a warm mist or steam humidifier and it has been on for a few hours, turn it off and wait at least 30 minutes before touching it so it can cool down. [6] X Research source Never try to open up or clean a warm mist or steam humidifier right after it’s been running because the hot steam can burn your skin. Note that warm mist humidifiers don’t create white dust, but they still need to be cleaned regularly."

      "title": "Scrub the inner sides of the reservoir with plain dish soap and water.",
      "content": "Scrub the inner sides of the reservoir with plain dish soap and water. Dump out the old water from the reservoir and refill it about halfway with cool tap water. Squeeze a few drops of mild dish soap into the water as it's refilling so it gets nice and sudsy. Use a sponge to scrub the sides of the reservoir, focusing on any spots with a white water line or splotches—those are the mineral deposits. [8] X Research source Harsh chemicals or disinfectants like bleach can cause lung issues if they’re not properly rinsed away and get distributed into the air, so it’s safest to stick to mild dish soap."

      "title": "Remove the filter if your model has one.",
      "content": "Remove the filter if your model has one. Open the reservoir and take out the filter from the humidifier's motor housing in the middle. If you’re not sure where the filter is located, refer to the owner’s manual that came with your humidifier or look up the model for your particular online. [9] X Research source Cool evaporation, warm evaporation, and hot steam humidifiers all have filters, while ultrasonic humidifiers don’t."

      "title": "Rinse the filter under cool running water.",
      "content": "Rinse the filter under cool running water. Hold the filter under the faucet and rinse away any mineral deposits, using your fingers to massage it as you go. Shake off the water when you're done—don't squeeze it because it could deform the mesh. Let the filter air dry on a paper towel for 1 to 2 hours. [10] X Research source You can also gently scrub it with a scrub brush to get rid of stubborn buildup. Don't put the filter back into the motor casing until it's fully dry because even a little dampness can encourage mold and mildew to grow inside the unit. If there's mold or buildup on the filter, soak the filter in a solution made with 17 fluid ounces (0.50 L) of water and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of vinegar for 20 minutes. After time’s up, rinse it well under running water until you can’t smell any of the vinegar."

      "content": "Soak the base and reservoir with vinegar and water as an alternative. Empty any remaining water in the reservoir and pour 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of white vinegar and 17 fluid ounces (0.50 L) of tap water into the reservoir. Do the same for the base. Let it sit for 20 minutes and then rinse both parts until you don't smell any signs of the vinegar. [11] X Research source When you're done, fill the reservoir with distilled water, plug it in, and enjoy your clean, steamy air! The vinegar will help remove some of the mineral deposits stuck to the sides of the reservoir. If you're in a hurry, you can also just shake the reservoir with the solution inside and then rinse it right away. However, it won’t be as effective as letting it soak for the full 20 minutes."
