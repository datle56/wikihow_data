      "title": "Decide what you want.",
      "content": "Decide what you want. You might be starting a new life because you want to make a change. Or, you might be starting a new life because you have to. Some personal tragedy may have destroyed your home, job, or relationship. Either way, the first step in starting over is knowing what you want from life. Even if you are not happy with beginning a new life, prioritizing what is important for you to do in this new life is helpful. Having clear goals and determining what you need to do to achieve them will help you feel more confident and optimistic about building your new life. [1] X Research source Taking the time to determine exactly what you want will get you thinking about the business items you need to take care of, as well as clarify what changes you are able to influence."

      "title": "Consider the consequences.",
      "content": "Consider the consequences. If the life changes you are considering are of your own choosing, it is a good idea to spend some time thinking about the consequences your actions may have. Major life changes can be hard to undo. Spend some time considering what you will gain, and what you might be giving up by starting a new life. For example, perhaps you are contemplating selling your home and moving to another city. This new city may have much to offer, but once you've sold your existing home, it is unlikely you'll be able to get it back. Similarly, breaking off relationships with long-time friends or family members can create rifts that are very hard to mend, should you decide you want those people back in your life. The point here isn't that you should not begin a new life or make major changes. But, these decisions should be made only after careful consideration."

      "title": "Assess the obstacles.",
      "content": "Assess the obstacles. If beginning a new life was easy, people would do it all the time. The reason they don't is that there are many obstacles that can make major life changes difficult. Take some time to think about what might hold you back, so that you can plan for it. Perhaps you want to move and begin a new life in a different city or country. Determine what parts of your life will be affected. If you are moving far away, will you mind leaving your present community, friends and established patterns of coming and going? Compare the cost of living where you live now to where you want to go. Is it affordable? Are jobs in your field available? A move to an international location may take more thought and planning than a move elsewhere. Find out whether you must obtain permission to move to or work in your chosen destination. Likewise, finding housing, negotiating currency, banking and transportation will be much different from your current situation. If you do not have the funds to quit your job and start a new life surfing on the beach (or whatever your dream), you'll need keep your day job. This doesn't mean you have to give up your dream of surfing, but this is an obstacle you'll need to consider. You want to be sure your plans are as practical and realistic as possible."

[2] X Research source retrieved from www.michalehyatt.com It's a good idea to sit down with some paper and a pen and write this down. You'll probably go through several drafts as you consider and reconsider different approaches.

(nd) This is your life: A proven plan to get from where you are to where you want to be. retrieved from www.michalehyatt.com Next, as you list the changes in each area, prioritize them. Narrow down to the most important aspects of your life plan. Think about the practicality of beginning a new life. Consider the steps this will take and whether you have the funds, the support of others in your life, and the energy to undertake the changes necessary. For example, if you want to change careers, determine the steps you'll need to take and the parts of your life this will affect. Family, friends, education, salary, commute time, and hours worked are likely to be variables that change in your new life. Try to anticipate, as much as possible, how the changes you want to make will impact the different areas of your life."

      "title": "Take some time, then revise your plan.",
      "content": "Take some time, then revise your plan. You'll probably need to create your “life plan” over a series of planning sessions. After you take some time away from your plan, other things to add will come up, and you may wish to eliminate items from the initial plan. Do not rush the process. As you add, subtract and prioritize your life areas, you break down a potentially overwhelming project into smaller, more manageable pieces of information and tasks. Throughout the process of building your new life, review the plan often, and make additional revisions as they become necessary."

      "content": "Take care of the business. In most cases, starting a new life will require spending some time organizing your finances. This often means calls or visits to your financial institutions. No one looks forward to dealing with these issues, but taking care of them early will make everything that follows easier. For example, if you're starting over because you've lost your home in a fire, you'll need to contact your insurance company right away to set wheels in motion for receiving compensation. [5] X Research source If your plans involve an early retirement, you'll need to contact the company that runs your retirement plan to see what options they have for you. If you've lost your job, you'll need to look into getting unemployment and/or food stamps while you work on developing your new career. None of this is glamorous or particularly fun, but all of these actions are important for making sure you have the resources you need for your new life."

Understand that this will unfold as you incorporate different behaviors in your new life. For example, you may now become an early riser. Perhaps you work from home instead of commuting. There is almost an infinite number of variables and changes one could make in beginning a new life. Some changes are determined by the choices you make in where you live, what you do, whether you have returned to school, if you have children or a partner, and ultimately, by the kind of life you wish to lead. It takes about three to six weeks to build a new routine that displaces your old one. After this period, your new routine will be a habit.
