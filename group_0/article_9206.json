      "content": "Get a USB-to-USB bridging cable. [1] X Research source It's important to use the right type of USB-to-USB cable, as there is more than one variety. The only USB-to-USB cable that should be used to connect two PCs is a called a “bridging cable,” sometimes also referred to as a “USB data transfer cable,” “USB networking cable,” or “USB link cable.” The correct cable has an electronic circuit at the center (you'll see the bulge) and male USB connectors at both ends."

Insert the disc and run the installer when it appears on the screen. If it doesn't launch automatically, press ⊞ Win + E to launch the File Explorer, then navigate to your CD/DVD ROM drive on the left side of the screen. Double-click on the file called “setup” or “installer.” If the cable didn't come with software, go to the manufacturer's website and look for a section called “Software” or “Drivers.” Download the software made specifically for your cable. Do this on both computers. If you are given the opportunity to select a “mode,” select “link” mode (may be called “bridge” or “transfer” mode)."

      "content": "Launch the transfer software on both computers. No matter how the software was installed, there should be an entry for it in the Start menu. Click “Start,” go to “All Programs” or “All Apps,” and select the software from the menu. From this point, you won't need to keep switching back and forth between computers to transfer files—everything can be done from one computer."

The Local window displays files on the computer you're currently using, and Remote shows the files on the other computer."

Macs cannot technically connect to one another via a USB cable—the closest you can get to a USB-to-USB connection on a Mac is to run a cable from one computer's USB port to the other computer's Ethernet port. USB-to-Ethernet connector: These connectors are universal, meaning you don't have to buy one specifically made for Apple computers. One end of the adapter has a male USB connector, the other a female RJ-45 port for the Ethernet cable. 10/100BASE-T Ethernet cable: This cable is standard, has RJ-45 connectors at either end, and can be purchased at any electronics store. See How to Transfer Files Between Two Macs for simpler ways to get files from one computer to another."
