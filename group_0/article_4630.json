      "content": "Choose a tender cut of steak. Some steaks will broil better than others, so you should take care when choosing cuts of meat. For broiling, choose a tender cut of steak like a sirloin, porterhouse, ribeye, top loin, eye round, or T-bone. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Let the steak come to room temperature.",
      "content": "Let the steak come to room temperature. You can use any kind of steak you want, from flank steak to top sirloin. Just be sure that the steak is between 1–1.75 inches (2.5–4.4 cm) thick. Remove the steak from the fridge and set it on a plate on the counter for 20-30 minutes so it comes to room temperature. Sticking cold steak in the oven may cause it to cook unevenly, so it's important to let it warm up a bit. [2] X Research source If the steak is frozen, completely thaw it in the fridge, which may take up to 12 hours. Avoid thawing meat on the counter which could cause harmful bacteria to grow. Once it's thawed, remove it from the fridge and allow it to warm up to room temperature. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Place a cast iron skillet in the oven and turn on the broiler. While the steak is coming up to room temperature, you can preheat your skillet and oven. Set the oven dial to “Broil.” Make sure the rack you're using is about 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) from the heating element (use oven mitts to move it if necessary). Then, place the cast iron skillet on top of the rack and allow it to heat for 5-10 minutes. [4] X Research source If your steak has both high and low broiler options, opt for high. If you don't have a cast iron skillet, use a stainless steel frying pan instead. Do not use a non-stick frying pan. The very high temperatures involved in this cooking process can damage the non-stick coating and cause harmful particles from the coating to end up in your food."

      "content": "Season or marinate the steak as desired. Less tender cuts of meat will be more tasty if you marinate them first. If you have a favorite rub, seasoning, or marinade for steaks, feel free to use it. Otherwise, you can rub about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil over each steak, then season both sides with salt and black pepper. [5] X Research source You can make a delicious marinade from 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 ml) of soy sauce, 2 US tbsp (30 ml) of Worcestershire sauce, 3 tbsp (8.4 g) of minced garlic, 1 tsp (3.1 g) of garlic powder, and ½ tsp (1.6 g) of onion powder. [6] X Research source Alternatively, try a steak rub made from 1 minced garlic clove, 2 tsp (6.2 g) of paprika, 2 tsp (6.2 g) of ground coriander, 1 tsp (3.1 g) of dill seed, ½ tsp (1.6 g) of dry mustard, ¼ tsp (0.8 g) of cayenne pepper, and salt and black pepper to taste."
