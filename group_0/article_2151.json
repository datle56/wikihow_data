      "content": "Look around. As you walk, make sure to look around. Walk with your head up and look from side to side occasionally. Ultimately, the more you are aware of your surroundings, the easier it'll be to avoid being mugged. [2] X Research source If you see someone suspicious or threatening, walk away from them.

      "title": "Travel on well-lit streets.",
      "content": "Travel on well-lit streets. [3] X Expert Source Saul Jaeger, MS Police Captain, Mountain View Police Department Expert Interview. 21 February 2020. The better lit a street is, the less likely a person will try to mug you without fear. As a result, stick to streets that are well-lit. In addition, avoid dark streets and darker areas of town. If you’re going into a dark area, bring a torch and wear something reflective such as a high-visibility vest. Avoid shortcuts that are dark. Saving a couple of minutes isn’t worth jeopardizing your safety."

      "content": "Ask people about the part of town you’re walking in. If you’re unfamiliar with a certain area, you should ask locals about it before you walk about. This way, you’ll have an idea of whether an area is dangerous or not before you get there. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Review a map or ask for directions before you start your journey.",
      "content": "Review a map or ask for directions before you start your journey. Before you set off on a walk around town, have a good idea of where you’re going and how you’re going to get there. You can do this by asking for directions or by consulting a map before you start on the walk. This way, you won’t have to stop and ask strangers for directions or look to Google Maps on your phone – things that make you look vulnerable. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Travel with a group.",
      "content": "Travel with a group. If you think you’re in a high-risk location, you can lower your chances of being mugged by walking with a group. Muggers are much less likely to approach a group of people when they can simply target an individual. If you’re leaving a bar at night, walk to your car or home with a group of people. In addition, consider having one person drive everyone else to their cars or homes – if their cars or homes require a long walk."

    {
      "title": "Walk with a local.",
      "content": "Walk with a local. If you’re in an area you’re not familiar with, you’ll be much safer if you walk with a local. Locals will not only know what areas of town are dangerous, but they’ll likely fit in more and may not be targeted by a mugger."

If for any reason you suspect you are in danger or are actively being followed, you should seek help immediately. You can do this by approaching a nearby police officer or by walking into a bar, restaurant, or store. If you walk into a public establishment, make sure to wait enough time until you are sure the person following you has left. If you’re not sure, contact the authorities. If there aren't police or safe establishments around, continue to walk confidently and briskly to an area you know is safe."

      "title": "Stay in well-populated areas.",
      "content": "Stay in well-populated areas. Muggers are much less likely to strike in places where there are a lot of people around. As a result, try to walk in areas where there are a lot of people. If presented with two routes to your destination, pick the one with more people."

    {
      "title": "Dress like a local.",
      "content": "Dress like a local. If you’re visiting an area you’re not from, try not to dress like a tourist. This is because muggers and other criminals often target people who are tourists or visitors. If you have any, wear domestically made clothes instead of designer imports. Avoid wearing t-shirts that show you’re a tourist. For instance, if you bought a shirt at a local tourist attraction, wait until you are home to wear it."

      "content": "Avoid displaying signs of wealth that a thief might be interested in. Don’t wear expensive watches, jewelry, sunglasses, shoes, or display electronic devices.

      "title": "Walk with purpose.",
      "content": "Walk with purpose. Move along a street or sidewalk as if you know where you’re going and know what you’re doing. If you walk in a timid and unsure manner, a mugger could spot you as a vulnerable person. Avoid looking around nervously as if you are unsure of where you are or what you’re doing. Avoid taking pictures of every little thing on the street. While something might make a great photo op, your interest in photography may give off the impression that you’re a tourist. Take self-defense classes so you can defend yourself. [7] X Expert Source Saul Jaeger, MS Police Captain, Mountain View Police Department Expert Interview. 21 February 2020. While this won't prevent you from being mugged, it will bolster your confidence, and could deter a potential attacker."

      "title": "Don't walk around late at night.",
      "content": "Don't walk around late at night. Since there are very few people walking at night, you'll draw attention to yourself by being on the street very late. Even if you're with a group, you'll increase your chances of getting mugged. Instead of walking: Get a taxi. Call a friend to give you a lift. Return home earlier or spend the night at the person's house you're visiting."
