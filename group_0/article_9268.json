If you have the option of picking a password-protected network over an unprotected one, go with the protected network--being able to connect to a secure network is worth the hassle of having to ask an official (e.g., shop staff) for the password. Depending on your location, you may have to pay a fee (or purchase merchandise) before you can use a protected network. If you end up choosing an unprotected wifi network, be careful about the information you view and input while using it. Other users may be able to view this information as well."

Using an Ethernet cable to connect your Mac directly to your router will increase the stability of an otherwise-unstable Internet connection, and your browsing speed may increase. However, being tethered to your router means you have significantly less mobility with your Mac--and you probably won't be able to use an Ethernet cable in most public places."

Expect this process to take a minute or two."
