  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Consider using an adhesive label.",
      "content": "Consider using an adhesive label. If the clasp on your envelope makes it difficult to write legibly, think about purchasing a self-adhering address label from the post office, dollar store, or a big box store. You can write on the label on a flat surface, then peel it off and affix it to the envelope. [1] X Research source If you decide to write directly on the envelope, just continue to the next step. The return address label should be smaller than the main address label."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lay the envelope flat.",
      "content": "Lay the envelope flat. Before placing anything in the envelope, lay it flat with the clasp facing down. Run your hand across the envelope so you can feel where the clasp is."
    },
    {
      "title": "Arrange the envelope in a landscape orientation.",
      "content": "Arrange the envelope in a landscape orientation. Turn the envelope so the flap is on the right side."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write the sender's address in the top-left corner.",
      "content": "Write the sender's address in the top-left corner. Write your address in fairly small print, so you have plenty of space in the center of the envelope. Use the same address format as you would on a normal letter. [2] X Research source This is the standard in the US, and similar format are used for most other countries: Name of Sender Street Address Apartment/Suite Number (if needed) City State and Postal Code (a.k.a. ZIP code) Country (for international mail)"
    },
    {
      "title": "Write the recipient's address in the center.",
      "content": "Write the recipient's address in the center. Write the address where you'd like to send the envelope using the same format. [3] X Research source Write this on the same side of the envelope, in large print. If the clasp is located under the center, feel for it first to plan where to write. To avoid bumps, you might need to write this slightly off-center, or write so the clasp is in between two lines of the address."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add optional instructions.",
      "content": "Add optional instructions. If you have extra instructions such as \"Do not bend,\" write them once at the base of the front, and again on the back of the envelope. [4] X Research source If you're not sure whether you need to write \"Air Mail\" or a similar instruction, ask someone at the post office or look up instructions on the post office website."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place your mail inside the envelope.",
      "content": "Place your mail inside the envelope. Flip the envelope open and slide your mail into the opening. Place the top edge of the document nearest the opening if possible. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Lift the clasp arms.",
      "content": "Lift the clasp arms. The most common type of clasp envelope has a butterfly clip with two metal arms. [6] X Research source Unfold these so they stand straight up. You may need to pry them up using your fingernails. If your envelope has two circles and a string instead, just close the flap and wrap the string tightly around the other circle instead. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Wet or peel the flap if necessary.",
      "content": "Wet or peel the flap if necessary. If your envelope has a strip of paper along the edge of the flap, peel this off to reveal the adhesive. If your flap has a lick-able strip, wet this slightly to make it sticky."
    },
    {
      "title": "Push the metal clasps through the hole in the flap.",
      "content": "Push the metal clasps through the hole in the flap. Lower the flap and adjust the metal arms so that they are positioned right beneath the hole. Push the hole over both arms. [8] X Research source Seal the flap against the body of the envelope by running over the edge with your thumb."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flatten and secure the arms.",
      "content": "Flatten and secure the arms. Push the clasp arms outward again and flatten them against the flap. To prevent the clasp from catching on other mail, put a piece of tape over the arms."

      "title": "Affix postage.",
      "content": "Affix postage. Apply the appropriate postage in the upper right-hand corner of the envelope, and your envelope is ready to mail. The exact postage required depends on the size and weight of the envelope, as instructed by your local post office. [9] X Research source If you can't find instructions, just take the envelope to the post office and pay for postage over-the-counter."
