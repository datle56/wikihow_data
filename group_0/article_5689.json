      "title": "Yes, people with tattoos can go to heaven.",
      "content": "Yes, people with tattoos can go to heaven. According to Christianity, the way a person gets to heaven is incredibly simple: they have to accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior and dedicate their life to following Him and His teachings. This is the only requirement and condition for salvation—there are no other strings attached (like having/not having tattoos). Anyone who claims otherwise is incorrect and is ignoring this core belief of the Christian faith. [1] X Research source Here are a few Bible verses that establish and support this: “For this is how God loved the world: He gave his one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life.” - John 3:16 (NLT) “There is salvation in no one else! God has given no other name under heaven by which we must be saved.” - Acts 4:12 (NLT) “Jesus told him, ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me.” - John 14:16 (NLT)"

      "content": "The Bible only mentions tattoos in a book that doesn’t apply to modern Christianity. Leviticus is an Old Testament book that outlined the religious requirements of the Israelites. After Jesus was born, crucified, and then resurrected, those laws were essentially overruled within the new Christian faith. [2] X Research source By this logic, the rules of Leviticus should only be viewed in a historical context—not one that carries any direct implications about a Christian’s daily life."

      "content": "Leviticus 19:28 condemns tattoos in a pagan context, but not overall. Leviticus 19:28 reads “Do not cut your bodies for the dead and do not mark your skin with tattoos. I am the Lord.” Back in the age of the Old Testament, pagans apparently used self-mutilation practices to mourn those who passed away. This verse simply commands the Israelites to not hurt themselves in such a way when mourning. [3] X Research source Some scholars believe that God’s condemnation of tattoos came from an ancient practice of physically marking slaves in association with certain false gods, rather than mourning practices. [4] X Research source Although the theological community isn’t 100% certain on why this law originally existed, they are certain that it’s not a universal ban on tattoos. People who condemn and judge others on the basis of Leviticus are walking on a very slippery slope. Plenty of things are banned in Leviticus that are extremely commonplace today—for instance, someone preaching against tattoos would also have to abstain from eating shellfish or from wearing polyester."

      "content": "Googling “can you go to heaven with tattoos” doesn’t bring up a damning result. As humorous as the ridiculous screenshot meme is, it’s important to note that Google doesn’t actually produce this result when you search this question. The vast majority of top results discuss how Jesus is the key to salvation in Christianity, which is the most important takeaway in any religious discussion about getting to heaven."
