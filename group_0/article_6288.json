      "content": "Find the bat if it's hiding. If you don't know where the bat is, start your search during the daytime, when the bat is asleep and easier to find and catch. Start looking in areas that don't see a lot of light, such as an attic or a secluded room. Look in places that the bat could hang from or crawl into, such as: On curtains On the back of furniture In a houseplant On hanging clothes Between seat cushions Under or behind cabinets or entertainment centers"

      "content": "Close the doors and wait until the bat lands if it's flying around. The bat will eventually get tired of flying around, so close the doors to keep it in one room and wait for it to land, keeping your eyes on it at all times. It will probably aim for a place where it can hang, such as behind curtains or upholstered furniture, on clothes that are hanging up, or even in house plants. [4] X Research source Stay quiet and still while you wait for the bat to land. This will help it calm down more quickly. Don't try to catch the bat in mid-air. It's almost impossible, and will only panic the bat more. The bat doesn't want to touch you, so stay calm if it accidentally bumps into you. It will flit away as soon as it can."

For best results, use a clear tub or bucket so you can see the bat as you trap and transport it. You can also drop a towel on top of the bat to capture it. Carefully scoop the bat up with the towel and hold it closed. [6] X Expert Source Scott McCombe Pest Control Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2019."

To catch the bat with your hands, approach it slowly and quietly, then reach down and smoothly pick it up in both of your hands, keeping a firm but gentle hold on it. [8] X Research source Try to hold it so that its head is facing out, near the tips of your fingers, so you can keep the most pressure on its body. If the bat bites you, or if you get bat saliva in your eyes, nose, or mouth, seek medical attention immediately, since bats can carry rabies."

Tilt it against the tree trunk and, holding the container at arms-length, carefully remove the cardboard to let the bat hop out. [9] X Research source If you used your hands, hold the bat up against the tree trunk at arms-length. Carefully loosen your grip and let it hop out onto the tree. Bats typically can't take flight from the ground, so releasing it onto a tree will help it to escape more easily. This is especially important for a bat that's stressed and fatigued from flying around your house."

If the bat won't land long enough for you to catch it, you can try to encourage it to escape instead. After locating the bat, close any doors to other rooms and turn off the lights.
