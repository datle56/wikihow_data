      "content": "Count how many posts you will need. Your deck might already be supported by posts, especially if it is covered. If not, you’ll need to install these so that there will be something to support the railings. According to handyman Walter Brant, \"A railing made with pressure-treated wood can span about 8 ft (2.4 m) between posts, while a PVC railing can only have 6 ft (1.8 m) of space between posts. PVC isn't as strong as wood; plus the PVC railings you want may only come in 6 ft (1.8 m) lengths.\""

      "title": "Measure out the posts.",
      "content": "Measure out the posts. The most important step in building a deck railing is to ensure proper measurement and alignment of the posts. Secure the posts firmly to the deck structure, as they provide the foundation for the entire railing system. Cut 4x4s to be at least a little higher than the railing will be, plus extra length to hang below the deck planks. For instance, if you want a railing that is 36 inches (91 cm) high, cut posts that are perhaps 44 inches (110 cm) high. Most building codes require deck railings to be between 36 inches (91 cm) and 42 inches (110 cm) high. The posts' extra height above the railing is just for looks. An inch or two higher than the railing will look nice. You'll need enough length hanging below the surface of the deck to attach the posts securely to the supports. For instance, if your deck is made of boards that are 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick and the supports are 6 inches (15 cm) high, then you'll want your posts to be long enough to hang up to 7 inches (18 cm) but at least 4 inches (10 cm) below the railing Many people like to leave about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) or so between the bottom railing and the deck boards as well, so factor this into the post height as well."

      "content": "Cut the posts to have an overhang. Mark a line that goes several inches up the side of the bottom of each post. For instance, if you want your 4x4 posts to hang 4 inches (10 cm) over the edge of your deck, draw a line that far up the side, 2 inches (5.1 cm) from one side of the post (the midpoint of the post). Draw another line perpendicular to the first line's end. Use a saw and cut along the lines you drew to remove a section of the post that is 2 inches (5.1 cm) by 4 inches (10 cm)."

      "content": "Mount the posts. Handyman Walter Brant suggests \"holding a post in the position where it will be mounted and using a large level to hold it in a vertical position.\" Next, use a drill to form pilot holes through the overhang of the posts into the deck joists. Then, drill lag screws or carriage bolts into the pilot holes. If you will be using lag screws, Brant advises \"using two 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm)-diameter galvanized screws with washers, which are rust-proof. Drill 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) holes through the post, followed by 3 ⁄ 8 in (0.95 cm) pilot holes into the board behind the post.\" If you will use lag bolts, use two 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm)-diameter galvanized lag bolts with waters and nuts. Washers are used only on the ends of the bolts with the nuts. Drill 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) holes through the post and the board behind it. If the posts will be higher than the railing (the railings will not be nailed to the tops of the posts), nail a metal or wooden post cap onto the top of the railing. This prevents water from entering at the top. [1] X Expert Source Walter Brant Handyman Expert Interview. 2 September 2020."

      "title": "Mark the railing height on the posts.",
      "content": "Mark the railing height on the posts. Using a tape measure, make a pencil mark in the center of each post. This will probably be between between 36 inches (91 cm) and 42 inches (110 cm), according to your preference and building codes. Many homeowners like to leave a couple of inches open below the bottom of the railing. To compensate for this, set the railing height mark slightly higher than the height of the railing itself. [2] X Research source For instance, if you want a railing that is about 36 inches (91 cm) high, make marks on the posts at 40 inches (100 cm). That will leave enough room for the balusters, the top and bottom of the rail, and a couple inches open at the bottom."

      "content": "Measure the distance between the posts. If you didn’t install the posts yourself, you’ll need to know the exact distance between them so that you can cut the railing pieces to size. You’ll need a helper for this. Ask your helper to hold one end of the tape measure in place against the center of a post. Stretch the tape measure tightly across to the center of the next post and make a mark. Record the distance between the posts. Check the distance where you want the top and bottom rails to sit. If your posts are straight, the distance should be the same. If they're not, change the length of the rails to match the actual distance."

      "content": "Get balusters and wood for the handrail. Take a trip down to the lumber supply store. You’ll need to get several pieces pre-cut or cut them to size yourself. You can also ask the supply store to cut it to size for you. Handyman Walter Brant suggests \"using a miter saw if you plan on cutting the rails and handrails yourself.\" Cut 1x3 or 2x4 lumber into lengths equal to the distance between your deck posts. You’ll need two pieces for each length of railing (one for the bottom and another for the top). Get plenty of 2x2 balusters to use for the railing. You’ll want to space these no more than 4 inches (10 cm) apart. The length of the balusters should be approximately the height you want the railing to be. If they’re too long, cut them down. You’ll also need thin strips of wood. Get something that is about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) by 1.5 inches (3.8 cm). Cut it into lengths equal to the distance between the deck posts. You’ll need one strip per section."

      "content": "Finish all of the wooden pieces. If you want to apply a finish to your deck, such as a coat of polyurethane or paint, do this before assembly. Coat all of the pieces on all sides, and let them dry for about 24 hours. That way, the pieces will be more protected from weather conditions. Handyman Walter Brant advises \"sealing the end of each cut piece of wood to prevent water from entering. If the wood is not pressure-treated, paint the cut surface with exterior paint; if it is pressure-treated, press clear exterior caulk into the surface.\" Really push the paint or caulk into place, because you want it to fill all of the pores. [3] X Expert Source Walter Brant Handyman Expert Interview. 2 September 2020. Make sure you've finished cutting, sanding and drilling everything before you apply a finish. Let the finish dry completely before assembly to avoid smudges."

So, if you want them to be 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart, for instance, take one of the thin strips of wood you had cut. Screw the square end of one baluster to the flat surface 3 inches (7.6 cm) from one end of the strip, and another 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the other end of the strip.
