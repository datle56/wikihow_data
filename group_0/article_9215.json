Sliding the unit back will reveal the ports; if you don't slide this back, you won't be able to see or use them. You can slide the cover back when you're done to protect the ports if you want to. If you have the CUH-ZVR2, the cover is solid and won't slide, but the ports with the symbols you have to match with the plugs are easily visible. [1] X Research source"
