      "content": "Complete an accredited Ultrasound Technician program. Find a program accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP), and get your Associate's Degree or complete a postgraduate certificate program. [2] X Research source If you're shifting careers in the health care industry, or you're a high-school graduate, you can take a one-year program. These fast-track programs generally reward you with a vocational certificate. Two-year programs are the most popular, and when you complete the two years (one to one and a half years if you have taken many of the prerequisite courses), you will earn an associate's degree. Most programs only require that you have a high school diploma or GED, while others might have more specific requirements (like recommendations, a certain GPA, and a personal statement). You can also take a four year program, and graduate with a bachelors degree. Stay away from eight week or six month programs. Not only do they not prepare you adequately for a career as an ultrasound technician, but it will hardly matter as you will not be competitive in the job market. Note that some colleges may require you to complete a Certified Nursing Associate (CNA) course before being accepted into a Diagnostic Medical Sonographer (DMS) program. If you already have a Bachelor’s degree or Associate’s degree and want to become an ultrasound technician, the diploma program may be the best option. Each program has different requirements, and the previously earned degrees may or may not have to be in a related field like Radiologic Technology, Nuclear Medicine or an Allied Health discipline Diploma programs offer you the opportunity to expand your career options by adding Diagnostic Medical Sonography to your expertise The previous degree earned and the program requirements will determine how long it takes to complete the program, but it usually take 12-18 months You may need to complete prerequisite courses depending on your previously earned degree Always choose a CAAHEP accredited diploma program Earning a Master’s degree in Diagnostic Medical Sonography can open up many new career options. If you are interested in moving into administration, teaching, research, publishing or a position in private industry, this is the degree to pursue. You must have a Bachelor’s degree to apply to a Master’s degree program The program is designed to be completed in 12-15 months You may have to take additional courses that are not part of the Master’s degree program’s core curriculum, which adds to the time it takes to complete the program Always attend a CAAHEP accredited program Clinical training may have to be completed."
