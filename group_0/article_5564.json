Note that Canada's exit code is also 011, but you still need to use it when calling from the U.S. [1] X Research source If you see a number with a \"+\" sign at the beginning, you don't need to input the exit code. These numbers are designated for international use and thus don't require call prefixes."

These codes are anywhere from 2 to 4 digits long. For example, if you're calling Bari, which has a city code of 80, you need to input \"011 39 80.\" [3] X Research source Take a look at the following resource for Italy's city codes: https://www.howtocallabroad.com/italy/ ."

The final number you input into your phone must be ordered as follows: the U.S. exit code (011), the Italy country code (39), the city code, and the phone number. The phone number (minus all of the preceding codes) is typically 5 to 8 digits long, but may sometimes be shorter or longer. If you're calling \"555-5555\" from the U.S. to the city of Bari in Italy, the final number that you call should be \"011-39-80-555-5555.\""

      "content": "Keep the leading \"0\" at the beginning of landline Italy numbers. In many places of the world, you are told to drop the leading \"0\" in phone numbers when making calls from abroad. But in Italy, you need to keep it. For example, if the number is \"089 852 6221,\" be sure to dial it as is. [4] X Research source If you see a phone number with a \"0\" inside brackets, don't drop the zero! For example, \"+39 (0)89 123 4567\" must be dialed with the \"0,\" regardless of what you need to do when calling other countries. Don't add a leading \"0\" to mobile Italy numbers. All mobile numbers in Italy begin with a \"3.\" When you see a number starting with \"3,\" never add a \"0\" to it, as it might end up routing you to a landline in the northern region of Italy."
