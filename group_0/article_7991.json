The water level should also be high enough such that it will be able to cover the raspberries after having had the sieve/colander put in. Discard any already moldy or mushy berries."

      "content": "Make the solution. The solution is made up of 3 parts water to every 1 part distilled white vinegar [6] X Expert Source Ollie George Cigliano Private Chef & Food Educator Expert Interview. 31 January 2022. The vinegar kills any spores or bacteria that may be forming on the berries. This prevents any mold forming on the berries which would render them inedible. The container you have the solution in should be wide enough such that the berries won’t be stacked on top of each other. The vinegar will not get rid of mold that is already on any berries so discard berries that are already moldy. This not only washes the berries thoroughly, but it also extends their shelf life.
