      "title": "Chop 1/3 cup (75.6 grams) of fresh Italian parsley.",
      "content": "Chop 1/3 cup (75.6 grams) of fresh Italian parsley. Rinse your parsley under cold water and then place it onto a cutting board. Hold the knife horizontally in front of you and place the blade on top of the parsley. Grip the handle firmly with your dominant hand and use the heel of the palm of your non-dominant hand to press down on the knife's tip opposite to the cutting edge. Move the knife up and down over the parsley to cut it into pieces. Continue cutting your parsley until it's in small, manageable pieces. You can also use kitchen scissors to cut your parsley pieces or rip them apart with your hands. However, these options won't give you clean cuts."

      "title": "Mince 1 tablespoon (14.3 grams) of fresh garlic.",
      "content": "Mince 1 tablespoon (14.3 grams) of fresh garlic. Use your hands to separate the individual cloves (2 to 3 cloves is usually about a tablespoon) and peel off the transparent skin that covers them. Afterwards, cut each individual clove lengthwise into slices as thin as you possibly can. Turn the pieces 90 degrees and slice them crosswise. Continue alternating between lengthwise and crosswise cuts until your garlic is finely minced. To finely mince garlic, you must cut your cloves into very small pieces. Rest your knuckles against each clove piece to hold them in place. Keep a slight bend in your knuckles—the knife should rest against the cloves and create a gap between the garlic and your fingertips."

      "title": "Clean 3 dozen little neck clams.",
      "content": "Clean 3 dozen little neck clams. Hold each clam under cold tap water and turn them around to expose their entire surface. Afterwards, scrub the surface clean with a stiff vegetable brush. [1] X Research source If you notice open clams, tap them on a firm, flat surface. If they don't close, the meat is no longer good and you should throw them away."

      "title": "Sauté the garlic in unsalted butter.",
      "content": "Sauté the garlic in unsalted butter. Place a skillet on medium heat, which is typically considered to be 300 °F (149 °C). Add 2 to 2.5 tablespoons (30 to 37.5 grams) of butter and then throw in the 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of fresh minced garlic. Stir your ingredients gently with a whisk for about 30 seconds, or until the garlic turns tan. [2] X Research source Be careful not to burn or overcook your garlic—this will add a bitter taste to the dish. If you overcook it by accident, throw everything away, wipe the skillet with a paper towel, and start over."

      "title": "Add lemon juice to your skillet and bring the mixture to a boil.",
      "content": "Add lemon juice to your skillet and bring the mixture to a boil. Gently pour 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of lemon juice into your skillet. Afterwards, add your remaining butter, place the lid onto the skillet, and bring your ingredients to a boil for a maximum of 30 seconds. [3] X Research source You should notice small to medium bubbles in your mixture when it begins to boil."

    {
      "title": "Boil",
      "content": "Boil 3 cups (0.71 L) of white wine in a separate pot at medium-high heat. Pour your wine in, turn the element to 300 to 400 °F (149 to 204 °C), and put the lid on. Keep an eye out on your wine and watch for small to medium-sized bubbles, which indicate boiling. After about 5 minutes the wine should begin to boil—mix in your clams within 20 to 30 seconds from this point. [4] X Research source Remove the lid every minute or so to check on the wine. Always boil your wine—it removes the alcohol from it."

      "title": "Mix 3 dozen little neck clams with your butter, garlic, and lemon juice.",
      "content": "Mix 3 dozen little neck clams with your butter, garlic, and lemon juice. Add your remaining butter to the mixture as well. Avoid stacking the clams on top of each other, as this can prevent clams on the bottom layer from opening. Gently stir the claims until they are all evenly coated with butter. [5] X Research source Be sure to turn your clams around with tongs every now and then to ensure even heat distribution within the shells."

    {
      "title": "Pour boiled white wine gently into your skillet with your clam mixture.",
      "content": "Pour boiled white wine gently into your skillet with your clam mixture. Use 1 cup (0.24 L) of white wine for every 12 clams. Wine is great for flavor and also generates the steam necessary to open the clam shells. After adding your wine, place a lid onto your skillet. [6] X Research source Use a measuring cup to portion out enough wine. For this recipe, you're using 3 dozen clams, so 3 cups (0.71 L) is necessary."

      "title": "Steam your clams for about 5 minutes, or until they all fully open.",
      "content": "Steam your clams for about 5 minutes, or until they all fully open. Remove the lid every 1 or 2 minutes and check on the clams. By 5 minutes, most or all of the clams should be open, meaning they are completely cooked through. [7] X Research source When clam shells open, it's a sign that they're done cooking. Clams that have not opened either aren't cooked well enough or have gone bad. Signs of bad clams include damaged shells, a foul odor, and shriveled or discolored meat. Don't cook your clams for too long—they will become tough and unpleasant to eat."

      "content": "Remove your clams 1 at a time using tongs, then sprinkle them with parsley. Place each one onto a clean plate. Sprinkle 1 ⁄ 3 cup (0.079 L) of chopped Italian parsley. Layer the parsley evenly over your clams. Lemon wedges also go great with them. [8] X Research source If you cooked pasta to go with your clams, place your clams and parsley on top."

      "title": "Store your leftover clams in a colander set in the fridge for up to 2 days.",
      "content": "Store your leftover clams in a colander set in the fridge for up to 2 days. Don't store your clams in plastic—oxygen deprivation can make them go bad. Instead, put your clams in a colander, and then place it over a dish. Cover your colander with a damp towel and place it in the lowest temperature region of your fridge. [9] X Research source Keep your clams at 33 °F (1 °C). Anything between 35 to 40 °F (2 to 4 °C) will likely spoil them. For the best results, store your clams with some seaweed to mimic their natural environment."
