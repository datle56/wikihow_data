If you have an email from the person you want to add (and you're using a computer), you can skip the rest of this method and quickly add the contact right from the email. Here's how: Sign in to Gmail in a web browser. Open the email from the sender you want to approve. Hover your mouse cursor over the sender's name or icon. Click the Contacts button (the icon of a person and a plus +) at the top-right corner of the window. Now that the person is a contact, Gmail shouldn't block their messages."
