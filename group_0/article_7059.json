These squealers will let out a loud, high-pitched sound when your brake pads get too thin. [2] X Expert Source Duston Maynes Automotive Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 11 June 2021.

      "content": "Determine whether your car pulls to one side when you stop. Pulling to one side as you come to a stop is an indication that one side of the brakes are more worn than the other side. If you notice your car pulling to one side when you press the brake pedal, check that side's front tire and make sure that the brake pad isn't worn down."

      "content": "Get a professional to inspect your rear brakes. Some older cars and rear brake systems may have brake shoes instead of pads. These are cylindrical metal rings that fit around your wheel's rotors. If you suspect that your brake shoes are bad, you should take your car to a mechanic so that they can inspect them. [7] X Research source The exterior \"braking material\" (usually made of metal) should measure the same thickness on both sides. You can take measurements of the material with a ruler. Rear brake shoes are good for 30,000–40,000 miles (48,000–64,000 km) and can last twice as long as your front brakes."

      "content": "Look in between the spokes and locate the rotor on the front brakes. If you look in between the holes in your tire you can see the rotor, which is the round metal part that your rubber wheel fits over. Many vehicles will have drum brakes on the rear wheels, which have brake shoes rather than brake pads."

      "content": "Find the caliper next to the rotor. Find the long metal piece pressing up against the rotor. The large metal piece clamped to the side of the rotor is called the brake caliper. If you look inside of the caliper you should see a rubber lining. This rubber lining is your brake pads. This method is less accurate than taking your wheel off and measuring the brake pads. Make sure your car has been turned off for a while or it may still be hot."

The brake pad backing plate is about 5 millimetres (0.20 in)-thick, so you must subtract it from your number to get the accurate width of the brake pads.
