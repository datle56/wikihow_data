    {
      "title": "Brush off lightly-soiled oyster mushrooms with a paper towel.",
      "content": "Brush off lightly-soiled oyster mushrooms with a paper towel. Pick up a mushroom and brush it off on all sides with a dry paper towel to remove loose dirt. Repeat this for each mushroom to clean them all. [1] X Research source A light brushing with a paper towel will often be enough to clean the dirt off oyster mushrooms before using them. You can also use a clean dry or slightly damp cloth to wipe off dirt instead of a paper towel."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the edge of a knife to gently scrape off stuck-on dirt.",
      "content": "Use the edge of a knife to gently scrape off stuck-on dirt. Hold a small, sharp knife, like a paring knife, in your dominant hand. Pick up a mushroom with your other hand and use the sharp edge of the knife to carefully scrape off any dirt that is stuck to the mushroom. [2] X Research source You can also cut off any particularly dirty parts, such as the bottom of the main stem if it is still attached."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the mushrooms off the central stem prior to using them.",
      "content": "Cut the mushrooms off the central stem prior to using them. Oyster mushrooms grow in clusters around a thicker central stem. Cut off the smaller individual stems and caps from the thick main stem and discard it. You can save the main stem and use it to make something like stock for a soup, but it does not have a desirable flavor for eating itself. Cut off any parts of the mushrooms that are slimy, mushy, or have black spots as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse the mushrooms right before using them if they are still dirty.",
      "content": "Rinse the mushrooms right before using them if they are still dirty. Place the mushrooms in a colander or strainer and rinse them under cool running water. Shake the strainer or colander to drain the excess water. If you have a salad spinner, you can use it to spin the mushrooms dry after you rinse them. If you picked wild mushrooms, inspect them for dirt and insects carefully and always rinse them before using. Pay special attention to the gills where dirt and insects may be hidden."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid soaking mushrooms when cleaning them.",
      "content": "Avoid soaking mushrooms when cleaning them. Mushrooms are like sponges, so they will soak up water if you leave them sitting in it. Rinse them just enough to wash off any dirt, if you need to use water to clean them, and never let them soak in water. Even rinsing mushrooms will cause them to absorb a little bit of water, but not enough to make any kind of a difference in cooking. Make sure they are completely dry before using them for cooking."

    {
      "title": "Buy mushrooms from a loose bin instead of pre-packaged if possible.",
      "content": "Buy mushrooms from a loose bin instead of pre-packaged if possible. This will allow you to examine them and choose the freshest mushrooms. Fresh oyster mushrooms will last longer and taste better. Oyster mushrooms are extremely perishable, so it’s important to choose the freshest ones, especially if you don’t plan to use them all immediately."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid moist or slimy mushrooms.",
      "content": "Avoid moist or slimy mushrooms. Wet mushrooms will go bad quickly. Pick up each oyster mushroom you are considering buying and don’t buy any that are damp or slimy to the touch. [3] X Research source If you have to buy pre-packaged oyster mushrooms, then look closely at the packages and don’t choose a package that has a lot of moisture, such as droplets of water, inside of it."

    {
      "title": "Select mushrooms with firm, dry caps and stems.",
      "content": "Select mushrooms with firm, dry caps and stems. Pick up each mushroom and lightly squeeze the caps and stems with your fingertips. Choose oyster mushrooms that are firm and dry to the touch. [4] X Research source If any mushrooms feel powdery or look shriveled, then they are too dry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose oyster mushrooms that are 1.5 in (3.8 cm) in diameter or less.",
      "content": "Choose oyster mushrooms that are 1.5 in (3.8 cm) in diameter or less. This means the mushrooms are young and the best for cooking. Larger mushrooms are also fine to eat, but the smaller young ones are ideal. [5] X Research source There are many different ways to use oyster mushrooms in recipes , including stir frying, roasting, sauteing, or putting them in soups and stews."

      "title": "Store oyster mushrooms in a paper bag in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.",
      "content": "Store oyster mushrooms in a paper bag in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. A paper bag is the best way to keep mushrooms ventilated and dry in the fridge so they last the longest. Use a plastic bag and leave it open to allow air in if you don’t have a paper bag. [6] X Research source Oyster mushrooms generally last up to about 3 days if you select ones that are in their prime and store them properly. However, check them before cooking with them and don’t use any that are wet, slimy, or have developed dark spots."
