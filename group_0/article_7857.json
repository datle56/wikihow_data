      "title": "Pick a good spot for cleaning.",
      "content": "Pick a good spot for cleaning. Choose someplace you don’t mind getting a little wet and dirty. Try your garage, the back or front porch, or a room in your house that has linoleum or tile flooring. If you stay inside, you may want to lay down some newspapers. Leather cleaner can get pungent. If you're working in side, turn a fan on or open a window."

      "title": "Remove any laces.",
      "content": "Remove any laces. Before you begin cleaning, untie the laces of your boots and remove them from the shoes. They could get in the way or keep you from reaching all the nooks and crevices of the boots. [1] X Research source Roll the laces up and set them aside so that they don't get lost or tangled. If your shoes have zippers, consider opening the zippers. Sometimes, dust gets into the bit of leather behind the zipper. You want to clean that too."

    {
      "title": "Brush off any dirt with a soft brush.",
      "content": "Brush off any dirt with a soft brush. Use a soft-bristled brush to avoid scratching the leather. Gently brush the entire surface of the boots. This should remove most dust, dirt, and even some light stains. [2] X Research source Don't worry about cleaning dried up mud or stains; you'll need more than a soft-bristled brush to get rid of those. Pay extra attention to brown or tan shoes. Dust and dirt won't be as visible on those, so you might want to spend a little more time on those. If your shoes had laces, be sure to get the tongue part that sits behind the laces. If they had zippers, hit the strip of leather behind the zippers."

      "content": "Use leather cleaner for all leather except suede. Most leather boots can be cleaned with typical leather cleaners. You can buy leather cleaner at shoe stores, hardware and tack shops, or online. [3] X Research source If your boots are made by a particular designer or brand, they may make their own cleaners. While typical leather cleaner should also work, you can choose to go with the retailer’s recommendation."

      "title": "Use a special brush to clean suede shoes.",
      "content": "Use a special brush to clean suede shoes. Suede shoes can’t get wet and should not be cleaned with normal leather cleaners. Go online or to a shoe store to find a suede shoe brush. Rub the brush over the boots to clean them. [4] X Research source Use a back-and-forth and an up-and-down motion when cleaning the boots. You can also use a gentle, circular motion.

      "title": "Dampen a cloth or brush to clean with leather soaps.",
      "content": "Dampen a cloth or brush to clean with leather soaps. Some leather cleaners, including saddle soap, come in soap form. To use this type of cleaner, rub a damp cloth over the soap. Then make a light lather by rubbing the sides of the cloth together. [5] X Research source Use a soft cloth such as a cut-up cotton t-shirt. You can also use a very soft-bristled brush. The cloth should be damp, not wet. If it’s dripping with water, you need to squeeze out some excess liquid. If you have sensitive skin, consider putting on a pair of plastic gloves. This way, the lather won't get on your hands."

      "title": "Pour liquid leather cleaners onto a damp cloth.",
      "content": "Pour liquid leather cleaners onto a damp cloth. You can also find liquid leather cleaners. Pour a small amount (no more than a small circle) of liquid onto a dampened cloth. Rub the sides of the cloth together to make a light lather. Liquid cleaners sometimes leave a bit of residue on leather, so you may want to try soap cleaners first. Again, if you've got sensitive skin, it might be a good idea to wear plastic gloves for this. A little bit goes a long way. If you use too much, you'll end up with lots of difficult-to-clean residue."

Be sure to condition each time you clean, however, as too much cleaning could dry out the leather. Condition the boots with a leather conditioner or moisturizer made specifically for shoes. You can find these products online or in shoe repair shops. Like with cleaners, don't use leather conditioners on suede; use a specialized suede protection spray instead."
