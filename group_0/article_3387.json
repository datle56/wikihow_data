      "content": "Start a conversation by talking about what's happening around you. It can be hard to work up the courage to start a conversation, but it's pretty important if you plan on becoming your crush's new best friend. Find a time when they aren't busy or talking to someone else, then walk up and start a conversation about something that's going on around you. If you guys are at lunch, for instance, walk up and start a friendly conversation maybe about school work or an upcoming event. [1] X Research source If you have a class together, ask your crush about your latest homework assignment or offer to help them study for the next test. Never start a conversation by talking badly about another person, since this will make you seem negative."

      "title": "Ask your crush for advice.",
      "content": "Ask your crush for advice. Try asking your crush for casual advice, and try to use this advice as a way to open the door to hanging out. For instance, you could ask your crush for advice about where to eat after the football game, then use the conversation as an opportunity to invite them to sit with you and your friends at the game. [2] X Research source Say something like, \"Hey, my friends and I were looking for somewhere to get a bite to eat after the football game. Where do you think we should go?\" If your crush offers a suggestions, say, \"Thanks! Do you want to come with us to the game and eat with us afterwards?\""

      "title": "Ask your crush about the things they like.",
      "content": "Ask your crush about the things they like. Show an interest in learning about the things your crush is into. Find out if they secretly love math class or if they can't get enough of black and white movies on the weekends. These things help a lot...getting to know them better than anyone else is one of the most important steps in friendship. [3] X Research source Try asking your crush open-ended questions instead of questions that can be answered with yes or no. For instance, instead of asking \"Do you like the show Vikings?\" you could say \"What kind of TV shows are you into?\" Ask \"What do you like to do for fun?\" to find out what kind of hobbies your crush is into. Be ready to answer with the things you like to do, too. See what kind of things the two of you have in common!"

      "content": "Use humor to get closer. If you hear a funny joke, try repeating it to your crush. If telling jokes isn't your style, tell a funny story instead. Not everyone shares the same sense of humor, so don't worry if your jokes don't go over well, but best friends can usually find something to laugh about together. [4] X Research source Try telling your crush about something funny that happened in class, like when your teacher accidentally said a swear word after dropping her coffee cup."

      "title": "Don't pretend to be someone you're not.",
      "content": "Don't pretend to be someone you're not. If your goal is to be best friends with your crush, you'll need to be yourself in order to be a true friend. If you pretend to be someone you're not just to get them to like you, eventually they're going to discover that you were being deceptive. Another thing that you could say would be telling your crush about something that you did that was either stupid or attracted laughs. Chances are, they'll laugh too!l [5] X Research source Embrace whatever makes you unique! For example, if you love comic books, don't be afraid to share that. You might just find out that your crush has an impressive stash of vintage Green Lantern comics."

      "content": "Share things about yourself. When you're first getting to know each other, you and your crush might only talk about casual subjects like sports or school. As you get closer, it's important that you start to share things about yourself, like how you feel about your parents or the way you felt when your pet ran away. This will encourage your crush to open up to you, as well. [10] X Research source If you feel too vulnerable after you share something intimate about yourself, make a joke about it and change the subject. Even if your crush doesn't say anything at the time, they will remember that you felt comfortable enough to share a piece of yourself."
