      "content": "Many websites have search engines built into them, which allow you to find information on the site that isn't indexed by Google or Bing. The information you find on a website's internal search engine is part of the Deep Web. Millions of websites have their own search engines, but here are a few that you may find interesting: Biznar searches over 100 different search engines at once and removes the duplicates, ensuring you'll find deep web content you wouldn't on Google. IntelligenceX is a massive search engine that allows you to search document sharing platforms, whois data, data leaks, domains, Bitcoin addresses, and even the dark web. [1] X Research source Think Tank Search is a one-stop search engine meant for finding public policy research and analysis from governments, universities, advocacy groups, NGOs, and other partisan and non-partisan think tanks. [2] X Research source Napalm FTP indexer lets you search for files on thousands of public FTP servers at once. Search Engine Colossus isn't a search engine, but a list of smaller global search engines and indexes that contain links to millions of sites and documents you won't find on Google. Facebook's search tool is even a Deep Web search engine—you can find many users, groups, and Pages that aren't indexed by mainstream search engines."

      "content": "Find archived websites that no longer exist. The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine is an amazing Deep Web tool that lets you view websites that no longer exist and older versions of websites that exist now. For example, if you search for Facebook.com, you can see what Facebook's homepage looked like in 2006. Not all websites are archived by the Wayback Machine—some webmasters prefer their sites not to be indexed and can opt out."

      "title": "Academic databases and archives are some of the most interesting parts of the Deep Web.",
      "content": "Academic databases and archives are some of the most interesting parts of the Deep Web. There are plenty of great databases that contain peer-reviewed and other academic data that isn't completely searchable in Google or Bing, including: PubMed indexes articles about biomedical topics. Google indexes some of what is on PubMed, but you can browse and search the website for difficult-to-find articles. DOAJ offers a one-stop option to search over 20,000 journals for free open-access articles. Project Muse lets you read peer-reviewed academic journal articles and e-books about the humanities. Voice of the Shuttle is another humanities-focused resource curated by humans who share helpful and interesting Deep Web content. Library of Congress's Digital Collections is home to hundreds of manuscripts, photos, videos, articles, and other historical information you won't find in Google. National Archives Catalog search lets you search multiple archives, including documents uploaded by citizen archivists. [3] X Research source Most regional libraries have extensive websites available for members. As a library card holder, you can search dozens to hundreds of databases you won't find anywhere online. This includes genealogical information, local news archives, public directories, oral histories, and much more."

      "title": "Use Deep Web tools to look up information.",
      "content": "Use Deep Web tools to look up information. As you can see, anything behind a paywall, username and password, or CAPTCHA is technically the Deep Web. You might not realize that many online tools that show live content are also on the Deep Web. Some examples: Usenet Archive is a searchable archive of Usenet posts from the early days of the internet. The FAA's Air Traffic Control System Command Center lets you view live flight delays across the United States. Melissa lets you look up and verify the names and addresses of people across the globe. The United States Department of Transportation is home to a great lookup tool that lets you find documented safety issues and recalls by vehicle—enter your VIN to find out if your car is safe. The United States Congress website has a searchable index of bills, laws, and congressional records. Access to Archival Databases offers records that identify specific people and organizations, making it great for genealogy and social research. [4] X Research source The United States Copyright Office lets you search for copyright information. Project Gutenberg is home to over 60,000 free eBooks you can read on your eReader, computer, or tablet. SearchCode lets you search for code snippets from billions of projects."

Library archives, private databases, online banking accounts, subscription-only magazines, and court dockets are all things you'll find on the Deep Web.

Since the Dark Web's focus is on anonymity, it's home to a lot of illicit content, which gives it a bad reputation.

      "content": "Consider using a VPN. Before downloading Tor, which is the most common Dark Web-accessible web browser, you may want to sign up for and install a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your connection. [13] X Research source This is not required, but it does add an extra layer of anonymity to your Dark Web browsing. NordVPN, Surfshark, and ExpressVPN are common choices, but you can choose any VPN that has the following features: A kill switch for when your VPN goes down. A no-log policy can protect you if the government demands log files from your VPN server. Anonymous sign-up. Quick load times. Protection against IP and DNS leaks. The ability to connect via another country's server."

You could also use a virtual machine instead of booting Tails from a USB or optical drive, such as VirtualBox . If you're on a Mac, you should be fine if you use a VPN and Tor. Just make sure you're protected from viruses and other malware—Malwarebytes is a great option for malware protection."
