It's also a great opportunity to listen for potential conversation topics if you find yourself stuck in awkward silence.

If you've spent the last ten minutes talking about the same subject, wait for the conversation to die down and bring up a new topic . You can talk about something related, or you could simply bring up a new topic entirely. Good conversation topics include philosophy, sports, movies, art, and local events. Don't fret if your new topic seems wildly unrelated to the previous subject. Your friends will more than likely appreciate a new subject to talk about, especially if you've been on the same one for a while!
