      "content": "White face paint is your best option. If you’re looking for a base color that’s completely white, and not just a pale skin color, white face paint will do the trick. Speaking of trick (or treat), go with a commercial white Halloween face paint designed for costumes. It doesn’t have to be spooky season for you to use it! [1] X Research source For example, you could use Mehron’s Face & Body Paint, Ben Nye Master Creme Palette, or a hypoallergenic, vegan option such as Silly Cheeks. You don’t even need to use additional makeup with costume-quality white face paint. Look for white face paint at your local beauty supply store. You can also order it online."

      "content": "Use a makeup sponge or brush to apply the makeup. Whether you’re using a creamy paint or dry clown makeup, a makeup sponge or a makeup brush will allow you to cover your whole face as well as focus on covering small detail areas such as around your nose and your jawline. Add a small amount of the white clown makeup to your sponge or brush and apply it smoothly and consistently over your entire face. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Set the makeup with makeup powder to keep it from running. White clown makeup can easily streak and run if you start to sweat while you’re wearing it, and it can look a little greasy or shiny once you apply it. Luckily, you can easily solve the problem by gently applying light makeup powder, also known as setting powder, over your clown makeup to set it and give it a nice matte finish.

      "title": "You can use a white foundation or concealer instead.",
      "content": "You can use a white foundation or concealer instead. To give your face a whiter complexion, choose a foundation or a concealer that’s at least 3-4 shades lighter than your skin tone. Apply an even layer of foundation with a makeup brush to create a smooth and consistent finish. If you’re using concealer, use the applicator to apply an even amount over your entire face. [4] X Research source Most concealers come with an applicator you can use. But if you don’t have one, don’t worry. You can use a makeup sponge to gently blend the concealer so it looks smooth and consistent. If you need more coverage, apply foundation in several thin layers."

      "title": "You can mix a white color corrector into your foundation.",
      "content": "You can mix a white color corrector into your foundation. Color corrector is a liquid makeup product that you can use to alter the color of your foundation. Apply some of your foundation to the back of your hand, add a few drops of the white color corrector, and mix it all together so it’s a consistent color. You can then apply the lightened foundation. [5] X Research source If you want to make your foundation even lighter, just add more white color corrector! A popular white color corrector is Manic Panic Dreamtone Flawless Foundation & Color Correction. Instead of your hand, you can mix your foundation on a makeup mixing palette."

      "content": "Combine equal parts cornstarch and face lotion and a tiny bit of oil. Take a clean bowl and add 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of white cold cream or face lotion. Then, mix in 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of cornstarch to create a thick, but creamy consistency. Finally, add about 1 ⁄ 4 teaspoon (1.2 mL) of vegetable oil or baby oil and mix it together well to help make the face paint more spreadable and to prevent caking. [6] X Research source You can easily adjust the consistency by adding some water to thin it out or adding more cornstarch to thicken it."

      "content": "Use milk and cornstarch for an easy-to-remove option. If you want a homemade white face paint that’s easier to wash off than one made with cornstarch and lotion, mix together 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of cornstarch, 1 ⁄ 2 tablespoon (7.4 mL) of milk, and 1 ⁄ 4 tablespoon (3.7 mL) of water. Combine the mixture really well and you’ll have a ready-to-use white facepaint. [7] X Research source"

Use a clean bowl and combine equal parts white cold cream or face lotion and baby powder to create a paint-like consistency. Then, mix in 1 ⁄ 4 teaspoon (1.2 mL) of vegetable oil or baby oil and combine it well so the makeup is easy to apply and won’t cake up. [8] X Research source For instance, you could mix together 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of baby powder with 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of face lotion to get an even consistency."
