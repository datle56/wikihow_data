Go with your new favorite jam, browse music streaming sites for inspiration, or ask your friends and family for recommendations. [1] X Research source If you’re having trouble choosing a song, think about what kind of dance moves you like the most. For example, if you love expressive, modern movements like popping and locking, a hip-hop song would be perfect. Try doing a Google search that includes some of your basic preferences and see what comes up. For example, search “mid-tempo beat-driven R&B songs.\""

      "content": "Choose a short section of the song for your routine. Most songs are 3 minutes or longer, which is way too long for a routine. Songs usually have sections that won’t work well for a dance routine–maybe there’s an awkward tempo shift, a repetitive instrumental section, or a rhythm change you aren’t crazy about. Eliminate what you don’t like until you have about 1 ½–2 minutes of music. [6] X Research source To keep your routine interesting and hold the audience's attention, don’t go beyond 2 ½ minutes.

      "content": "Select a dance style that matches the vibe of the music. There are hundreds of styles to choose from! Start by considering the tempo and instruments in the song first. For example, ballet or jazz would best complement a slow, orchestral song. If your song is R&B or Latin, a dance style like hip-hop, break dancing, or a fiery flamenco would work well. [8] X Research source It's also important to pick a dance style that suits your skills. What are your strengths as a dancer? Play to those strengths! If you’re feeling daring, try combining multiple dance styles into one stellar routine. [9] X Expert Source Jean Franco Vergaray Professional Dance Instructor Expert Interview. 20 May 2020."

      "content": "Map out the basic sections of your song. You don’t need to get super technical, just grab a pen and paper and chart the basic structure and flow of the song. This will help you narrow down dance moves for different parts of the song later on. For example, if the intro is slow and sexy, note that and jot down some moves that might fit, like a slinky walk or dramatic turn. [10] X Research source Another example: if the song moves into a punchy chorus, you might try more dramatic moves like arabesques or spins during that part. [11] X Research source"

Every time you count 8 beats, write down an 8. When you’re done, you’ll know exactly how many 8-count sections you need to choreograph.

Remember that you’re working with 8-count sections, so count out loud if you need to. Experiment with combining moves in different patterns until the routine starts to fall into place. [13] X Research source [14] X Expert Source Val Cunningham Certified Dance & Yoga Instructor Expert Interview. 6 February 2020. Keep the purpose of your dance, the song’s vibe, and your audience in mind. For example, dramatic or provocative moves are great for a solo recital, but if you're performing the routine at your grandma's birthday party, twerking probably isn't a great option! [15] X Research source Ultimately, your goal is to make sure that your choreography fits with the math of the song.

      "content": "Choreograph smooth transitions between the main sections. Transitions link the sections together seamlessly; they should never disrupt the piece. Transitions aren't the stars of your piece, but they should never be boring or dull! Find creative ways to move from section to section. [17] X Research source For example, in your hip-hop routine, you could use the same body roll and clap sequence to transition between each section for a cohesive flow. Don't panic if you can't think of something at first. Instead, take a break from the part that isn't working and come back to it later. The choreography will fall into place when you aren't pushing yourself to fix it. [18] X Expert Source Val Cunningham Certified Dance & Yoga Instructor Expert Interview. 6 February 2020."

      "content": "Make sure your routine has a beginning, middle, and end. Give each section a unifying theme or character so they don’t feel disjointed or disconnected. Repeating certain sections, or variations of themes, can help your routine feel cohesive and bring everything together. [19] X Research source For example, a hip-hop routine might begin with high-energy step work, transition smoothly into a break-dancing section, and then flow into a dramatic finale of floor work."

Note the names of the moves for each section or even scribble little stick figures showing different moves. Whatever works for you! [20] X Research source If stopping to write breaks your concentration, record yourself during these sessions. Then, review the footage later and write everything down. If you plan to teach the routine to other dancers, note any particularly tricky passages that could take extra time to explain and demonstrate."
