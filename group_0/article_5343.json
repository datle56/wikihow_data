      "content": "Initiative is used to establish the order of turns during a fight. D&D 5e features turn-based combat, which means that participating creatures can only act (attack, cast a spell, help an ally, hide, and so on) when it’s their turn to do so. Thus, the order of turns is decided using initiative rolls—which essentially measure how quickly a creature is able to spring into action when a fight begins. [1] X Research source There are actually two ways to talk about initiative, so make sure you’re familiar with both! First, there’s a character’s initiative, which is essentially a Dexterity check they roll (using their dexterity modifier) to determine their place in the overall initiative order. Second, there’s the initiative order, which is the actual order in which each combat participant gets to take turns. This includes PCs (player characters), NPCs (non-player characters), and enemies."

      "content": "Your DM will ask you to roll initiative whenever combat is beginning. If you’re a player, you’re most likely not going to be the one who declares when it’s time to roll for initiative. Your DM will make that judgment, but you can generally expect them to ask for initiative whenever a PC or an NPC (non-player character) starts acting aggressively. You’ll need to roll initiative every time combat begins! [2] X Research source For example: If your character charges an NPC, your DM might decide to initiate combat. If you cast a spell on an NPC (regardless of whether it does damage), your DM might decide that the NPC reacts with hostility and attacks. If your character interrupts a negotiation by drawing their weapon, the DM might rule that the peace is shattered and a fight begins. When you sneak up on an enemy, the DM may give you a surprise round, wherein you (and your party) can attack, but the enemy can’t. You’ll still roll initiative first!"

      "title": "Roll a d20 and add your dexterity modifier to the outcome.",
      "content": "Roll a d20 and add your dexterity modifier to the outcome. Dexterity (DEX) is one of six ability scores in D&D, and it affects a character’s agility, reflexes, balance, fine motor skills, speed, and hand-eye coordination. Because initiative measures a character’s ability to ready themselves when combat starts, their DEX modifier influences the outcome of the d20 initiative roll. The higher the modifier, the higher the initiative. [3] X Research source Say your character has a DEX of 18 (+4 modifier), and when you roll a d20, the outcome is an 11. To calculate initiative, add 11 + 4 for a total initiative of 15. Your DEX modifier can negatively affect a roll if it’s low. If your DEX is 8, your modifier is a -1. So, if you rolled an 11, you’d have to subtract -1 from that roll, meaning your total initiative would be a 10. An ability score modifier in D&D is the number you add to rolls when trying to do something related to that ability. There are boxes for your character’s initiative and ability score modifiers near the top of their character sheet."

      "title": "Add any extra bonuses you may have to the initiative roll.",
      "content": "Add any extra bonuses you may have to the initiative roll. Generally, adding a d20 roll + your character’s DEX modifier is how you calculate initiative in 5e. However, depending on the class you play in D&D 5e and the feats, spells, or items you might have, your character might have additional bonuses to their initiative. Keep track of those bonuses, and don’t forget to add them in addition to your DEX modifier! [4] X Research source For example, if you’re playing a Swashbuckler Rogue at level 3, you can use your Rakish Audacity class feature to give yourself an initiative bonus equal to your Charisma modifier. So, if your Charisma modifier is a +2, your DEX modifier is +4, and you rolled an 11 (using the example above), then your initiative score would be 11 + 4 + 2, for a total of 17. Charisma (CHA) is another of the 6 ability scores in D&D 5e. The ability scores include Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom."

      "content": "Make initiative rolls for all the monsters and NPCs in combat. As a DM, once you decide it’s time to start a fight, you’re in charge of making sure every other combatant besides the PCs has a place in the initiative order. Roll initiative for NPCs and enemies using the same formula as above (a d20 roll + the creature’s DEX modifier) and make a note of each score. [5] X Research source To streamline the process, you could alternatively roll initiative while you’re still planning the session. That way, you only need your players’ rolls to complete the initiative order when combat begins. When you have large clusters of identical enemies, you could roll initiative for them once as a group (rather than rolling for every enemy). For example, if your battle includes an enemy wizard, bandit captain, and 5 bandits, you could roll initiative separately for the wizard and captain but use one initiative roll for all 5 bandits."

      "title": "Ask your players for initiative rolls one at a time.",
      "content": "Ask your players for initiative rolls one at a time. It can be confusing to have several players shouting numbers at you simultaneously. At the start of combat, ask your players to roll initiative. Then, once you’ve calculated initiative for all enemies and NPCs, go around the group and ask each player for their characters’ initiative score. [6] X Research source Don’t be afraid to tell your players you need them to speak one at a time. It’ll make your life a lot easier! If you have a big table, you could ask one player to collect everyone else’s initiative for you, so you only have to hear from that player and can easily note each score. Once an initiative order is set, it typically stays the same throughout combat. After everybody in the initiative order acts, a new round begins, and the character at the top of the order takes their next turn."

Write down the initiative score of every player, NPC, and enemy participating in the battle, and organize them from the highest initiative roll to the lowest. When combat begins, whoever is at the top of the initiative order goes first, and when the last person takes their turn, a new round of combat begins. [7] X Research source To track initiative during combat, you could: Write the complete initiative order on a piece of paper. Make your initiative list on a dry-erase board for the whole table to see. Use a customizable initiative tracker. Use digital initiative trackers on sites like Roll20 or apps like Encounter+ Designate one player to track initiative for you (so you can focus on running the combat)."

The Player’s Handbook for D&D 5e recommends that DMs decide the outcome of ties between NPCs and player characters or enemies and player characters. However, you could also allow your players to decide the outcome if the tie is just between PCs. [8] X Research source Ways to break a tie include: Have the tied characters roll d20s. Whoever gets the higher roll goes first in the initiative order. Compare the two characters’ DEX scores. Whoever has the higher score (or modifier) goes first."

      "title": "Passive Initiative Score",
      "content": "Passive Initiative Score If you’d rather not roll every time combat begins, you could adopt a “passive” initiative rule, where everyone’s initiative score is the same no matter what. With this rule, initiative can be calculated one of two ways: first, it can be the same as a creature’s Dexterity score. Alternatively, you could calculate it by adding 10 + the creature’s DEX modifier. [9] X Research source For example, if your character’s DEX score were 13, that would also be their initiative score. Alternatively, if you had a DEX modifier of +1, your initiative score would be 10 + 1 for a total of 11. This is useful if you want to make the start of combat run a little smoother—but, on the downside, you may often be last in the initiative order if your score is low."

      "title": "Side Initiative",
      "content": "Side Initiative “Side” initiative simplifies combat into two different groups: enemies and players. Each side rolls a single d20, and whichever side gets the higher number goes first. From there, combat is simple. One side starts, and everyone on that side takes their turns, and then the other side does the same. All you need to do is repeat that pattern until combat is finished. [10] X Research source For example, say you have 5 players, and they’re fighting a group of giant spiders and ettercaps. That means the 5 players are one “side,” while the spiders and ettercaps are the other. So, if one of your players rolls a d20 and gets a 16, while you roll a d20 for the enemies and get a 9, that means your players are going first, and then all the enemies get to take their turns."

      "content": "Popcorn Initiative To use this rule, have every player roll for initiative. Then, the player that rolls highest is at the top of the initiative order—and they get to choose who goes next in the order. Then, that player (or the DM) chooses next, and so on, until every PC and enemy has a spot in the initiative order. [11] X Research source Whoever is choosing the next creature in the order can choose from both PCs and enemies, so you can all be strategic about your choices. For example, if an enemy doesn’t have any ranged abilities, you could place them higher up on the initiative order; that way, they wouldn’t have much to do in the first round besides running forward or readying an action."

      "content": "Round-Based Initiative This is a fun rule to use if you want to shake up combat every round! With this rule, you roll initiative as usual at the beginning of a battle—but then, at the start of each new round, everyone must re-roll initiative. It means a little extra work for the DM, but some players might find it thrilling because it can completely change the stakes in a battle at the drop of a hat. [12] X Research source For example, say one PC is nearly unconscious, and there’s an enemy next to them. You and the other players may have been counting on healing that PC before the enemy gets another turn—but if the initiative order changes and the enemy gets to take their turn earlier, the stakes are suddenly much higher!"

      "content": "Build a character with a high Dexterity score. A high DEX modifier can increase your chances of getting a decent initiative score, and the best way to raise your modifier is to have a high DEX score. For starters, consider playing a character race with a natural DEX bonus. You could also opt to increase your ability scores and improve your character’s Dexterity as they level up. [13] X Research source Races with DEX bonuses include: Elf: +2 bonus Halfling: +2 bonus Human: +1 bonus (applies to all abilities) Half-Elf: +1 bonus (optional) Gnome (Forest): +1 bonus If you choose a fantastical race—like aasimar, firbolg, genasi, aarakocra, and so on—you can choose ability score bonuses yourself. Remember: initiative scores come down to the luck of the draw since they require a d20 roll. You won’t get a high roll every single time, but having a decent DEX modifier can certainly improve the outcome of low rolls."

Subclasses are essentially more specialized versions of a broader character class—like a wizard specializing in evocation magic (School of Evocation subclass). Consider playing a class or subclass with features that grant bonuses to initiative! [14] X Research source For example: Barbarian: Advantage on initiative rolls. Bard: Half-proficiency on all skills and skill checks. Fighter (Champion): Half-proficiency bonus to DEX checks. Ranger (Gloomstalker): Add your Wisdom modifier to your initiative. Rogue (Swashbuckler): Add your Charisma modifier to your initiative. Wizard (Chronurgy/War Magic): Add your Intelligence modifier to your initiative."

Feats are essentially another way for your character to gain new skills and specializations as they get more powerful—and the Alert feat will give your character a +5 boost to their initiative modifier. [15] X Research source So, for example, if you roll an 8 for initiative and your DEX modifier is a +3, your initiative roll would be an 11. With the Alert feat, however, you’d add 8 + 3 + 5 for a grand total of 16. When you take the Alert feat, your character can’t be surprised while they’re conscious, and enemies can’t get advantage on attacks against you even if they’re hidden."

Certain spells can either give you advantage on your initiative roll or they can give you a small bonus to the roll—either of which can really help in a pinch! [16] X Research source Spells include: Guidance (cantrip): Roll a d4 and add it to an ability check. Enhance Ability (2nd level): Advantage on all DEX ability checks when you choose Cat’s Grace. Foresight (9th level): Advantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws."

Keep an eye out for items such as: Rod of Alertness: Advantage on initiative rolls. Sentinel Shield: Advantage on initiative rolls and Wisdom checks. Sword of Kas: Grants a 1d10 bonus to your initiative rolls. Weapon of Warning: Advantage on initiative rolls."
