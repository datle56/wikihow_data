You don’t want to go to work or stress the entire day after a breakup, so try to pick a time where you both have free time afterward. Nights and weekends usually give the other person a little bit of time to decompress after the phone call and come to terms with the breakup. You can also try calling after the other person gets done with class or work."

Avoid breaking up when either of you are in a public place since you won’t be able to have as deep of a conversation. Wait until you know they’re at home or in a place where they feel safe and comfortable. If you aren’t sure where they are, just send them a text and ask where they are and if they can take a phone call. [6] X Research source For example, you could send a text that says, “Hey, are you home? I want to talk about something,” and wait for a reply before contacting them again."

      "content": "Avoid accusing the other person. Even though it might feel easy to shift the blame off of yourself, be respectful and only address how you feel. Since you’re the one who decided to break up, discuss why you want to break using “I” or “me” in the sentence instead of “you.” [11] X Research source For example, instead of saying, “You spend too much time going out with your friends,” you could say, “I don’t enjoy going out very much and I’d rather enjoy time together at home.” As another example, instead of saying, “You don’t like my family,” you could instead say, “I enjoy spending time with my family and I want someone that I can feel comfortable with around them.”"

[13] X Research source For example, you could ask, “How do you feel about this decision?” or “What’s on your mind right now?” If they have questions for you, try to answer them as honestly as you can so they know how you’re feeling."

The other person might be understanding if they agree with what you’re saying, but they could also get angry or sad. If they’re mad, stay calm and ask if they need to take a break for a few minutes before continuing the conversation. If they feel sad, empathize with them and let them know their feelings are valid. [14] X Research source If the person gets really angry, threatening, or abusive, tell them their behavior isn’t appropriate and end the call. You shouldn’t feel pressured by them to stay in the relationship. Some people will promise to change, but you can tell them that you don’t want them to change just for you and that you’re firm in your decision."
