      "content": "Buy a melamine sponge. Melamine makes these sponges denser than regular cleaning sponges. They also have pores that serve a dual purpose. They absorb any cleaning solution they're put into contact with and give the sponge a slight abrasive quality. These make them more effective for cleaning marks and stains. You can buy these sponges in bulk on eBay and other online stores. You can buy these sponges under the Mr. Clean brand; they come already soaked with cleaning solution. Otherwise you can buy the sponges in bulk and soak them in homemade cleaning solutions.

Use a clean rag; any dirt on it could leak out into your cleaning solution. [8] X Research source"
