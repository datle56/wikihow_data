      "content": "Use water-based lube for all your masturbation and sexual needs. Water-based lube can be used for just about anything—it’s perfect for any kind of masturbation, and it works great with all of your favorite toys. You can also lube up your condoms without worrying about them breaking later on. Unfortunately, water-based lube washes away easily, so it’s not a great option if you’re a fan of shower or pool sex. [1] X Research source Many water-based lubes are pretty affordable. Some common water-based brands are Astroglide , Liquid Silk , and KY Jelly . [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Grab some silicone-based lube for longer sessions. As the name suggests, silicone-based lube isn’t made with water, so you don’t have to worry about it washing away. It’s great option for shower, anal, or pool sex, and it won’t rub or wash away. Unfortunately, this product tends to be on the thicker side, and may be a little uncomfortable to use with your toys. Don’t use silicone-based lube if you use silicone-based sex toys—they’ll damage your toys. Wet Platinum , Eros , and ID Millennium are some well-known silicone lube brands. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Pick oil-based lube for massages or penile masturbation, but not condoms. Oil-based lube is the slickest product of all, but also the most finicky. It’s a great option for penile masturbation, or if you’re giving your partner an intimate massage. Unfortunately, your body can’t absorb oil, so you shouldn’t use it to lube up your vagina. [4] X Research source Oil-based lubes will also eat through latex, so don’t use them with any latex condoms. [5] X Research source Some oil-based lubes are listed as “massage oil.” In general, oil-based lube shouldn’t be used for sex."

Similarly, cooling lubes make your skin feel colder, and can help your masturbation and sex feel way more stimulating. [6] X Research source Cooling lubes work great with glass or metal toys. Some people find warming lubes a little irritating. Test out a small amount of this lube on a tiny section of skin before using too much of it! [7] X Research source"
