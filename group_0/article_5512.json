[2] X Research source If you know the circumference, divide it by 2π to get the diameter. [3] X Research source And if you don't know any of the measurements of the shape, just use a ruler to measure the widest pie circular base (the diameter) and divide that number by 2 to get the radius. Let's say the radius of this cone's circular base is .5 inches (1.3 cm)."

Plug \".5\" in for r to get A = π(.5) 2 and square the radius and multiply it by the value of π to find the area of the circular base. π(.5) 2 = .79 in. 2 . [4] X Research source"
