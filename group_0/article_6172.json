      "content": "Reel in the line. Reel the line in until your bait or lure is 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) from the rod tip. If you have a sinker or bobber attached to the line, it should be 6 to 12 inches from the rod tip instead."

      "title": "Hold the reel properly.",
      "content": "Hold the reel properly. Grip the rod behind the reel with your thumb resting over the reel spool. Baitcasting rods are designed the same as spincasting rods, and as with spincasting rods, most fishermen cast with the same hand they retrieve with, so if you prefer to hold the rod behind the reel when you retrieve, you'll need to switch hands when you cast. [2] X Research source You may want to rest your thumb at a slight angle on the spool instead of pressing the very flat of it on the line. This will give you more control over the flow of the line during the cast. [3] X Research source Picture yourself by the water's edge, poised to cast your line. First, perfect your stance: dominant hand gripping the rod, the other operating the reel. Angle the rod gracefully at 45 degrees, thumb gently on the spool for line control. Now, for the magic of the cast. Engage your whole body, coil your torso and shoulders for power, and with a flick of your wrist, launch your lure towards its target. Timing is key. As your lure glides through the air, release that thumb pressure at the exact moment, letting the line flow freely. To avoid dreaded backlash, apply a touch of thumb control as your lure nears its destination. With practice and patience, master timing and thumb finesse for precise, impressive casts.

      "content": "Press the reel spool release button. Baitcasting reels made since the 1970s have a mechanism to disengage the reel spool from the handles so they don't turn during the cast, allowing for longer casts. The first such models had the button on the side of the reel; most models today feature a release bar behind the spool that you press with your thumb when you rest it on the reel spool.

      "title": "Bend your casting arm.",
      "content": "Bend your casting arm. You need to bend your casting arm at the elbow so that the crook of your arm begins to approach a right angle. As you do, raise your rod until its tip goes slightly past vertical. This will give you the correct positioning to send the line out."

      "content": "Sweep the rod forward until it reaches eye level. This is about 30 degrees above horizontal, or the \"10 o'clock\" position. As you do so, lift your thumb off the reel spool enough so that the weight of your bait or lure pulls line off the spool as it is propelled toward the target. [8] X Research source If you are casting with a long-handled baitcasting rod of the kind used in saltwater fishing, you'll want to use your opposite hand as a fulcrum from which to pivot the rod as you cast."

[9] X Expert Source Michael Reynolds Professional Fishing Instructor Expert Interview. 26 February 2021. This is similar to pressing the button on a spincasting reel to brake the line; however, not applying your thumb soon enough leads to the spool continuing to turn after your bait hits the water, creating an overrun or \"birds nest\" that you'll have to straighten out before you can retrieve your lure.

[11] X Research source [12] X Research source But the most important thing when choosing a baitcasting reel is to pick one that feels good in your hand and fits your fishing needs. Go to a store that sells baitcasting reels and hold a few. Or, if you prefer the older models, try finding one at an antique shop. [13] X Research source Choosing the ideal baitcasting reel is a pivotal decision for any angler. To make the right choice, consider factors like your target species, fishing environment, preferred gear ratio, and braking system. A well-informed decision ensures a smoother and more productive fishing experience. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose appropriate bait. Baitcasting tackle is not suited for casting baits or lures weighing a quarter ounce or less. If you like to take several rods with you when you fish, carry a rod with a spincasting reel for the lighter weight lures and a rod with a baitcasting reel for the heavier lures.

Your bait can get easily caught in the branches and this will cost you much precious time to retrieve. [18] X Research source It’s important to avoid heavy brush or your lure may get stuck when you bring the rod forward to cast. If this happens, the entire spool of line can get tangled (called a bird’s nest) and destroyed."

You have to constantly make sure no one is behind you or too close to you in order to make sure you don’t accidentally snag them with your lure. And being hyper aware of your surroundings takes away some of the relaxing joy of baitcasting anyways. [19] X Research source"
