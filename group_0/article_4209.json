This will minimize breakage, dryness, and/or frizziness. [1] X Expert Source Courtney Foster Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 9 December 2019. Moisturizing products that contain natural oils, such as coconut oil or avocado oil, are great choices to help your hair retain and restore its natural oils.

      "content": "Blot your hair with a towel. Blow-drying your hair while it is soaking wet requires more heat and can damage your hair. [3] X Research source Gently blot your hair with a towel to remove the excess moisture. Avoid rubbing, squeezing, or twisting your hair, as this can damage it. Use a microfiber towel or a soft T-shirt to dry your hair if possible. Microfiber towels cause less friction and put less stress on your hair than cotton towels. This leads to less frizz and less damage to your hair over time. You can tell if your hair is dry enough by grabbing a strand of hair near the root and running your fingers along its length to the tips. If water drips from your hair, you should continue towel- or air-drying it before blow-drying. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Comb out any tangles.",
      "content": "Comb out any tangles. Combing a part into your hair will make it easier to style. Your hair should naturally fall around the part already. [5] X Research source Run a comb through your hair to remove any knots. This will allow you to dry your hair more evenly. When combing your hair, always start at the ends and work your way toward the crown of your head. It's better to comb instead of brush your hair when it's wet because your strands are weaker when wet. Be gentle as you comb your wet hair, as you can cause significant breakage. If your hair is curly, use a wide-tooth comb to gently untangle any knots. Brushing curly hair can make it frizzy and unmanageable. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply a heat protectant product. Blow-drying can cause intense damage to your hair if it isn’t properly protected. [7] X Research source Apply a thermal protectant product, such as a heat-activated spray or mousse, to keep it from being fried by the blow dryer. Use enough product to cover every strand of hair."

      "title": "Set the blow dryer to medium heat.",
      "content": "Set the blow dryer to medium heat. When your hair follicles get warm, they open up, which allows them to become more flexible and easier to control. But if you apply too much heat, it can damage your hair and make it frizzy and unmanageable. Medium is usually a good heat setting to dry your hair without frying it. If your hair dryer has 3 settings, the middle setting is usually the best. If your hair is healthier, you can use a higher temperature. For fine, weak, or brittle hair, use the lowest heat setting possible."

      "content": "Position the blow dryer 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) from your hair. [8] X Research source If you hold it too close, the hot air can burn your hair and/or scalp. Use a brush, comb, or your fingers to pull your hair closer to the blow dryer if necessary. Avoid targeting any single area of hair for too long, as this can damage your hair and cause it to be flat and limp. Keep moving the blow dryer around, aiming the airflow parallel to the section of hair you're drying. [9] X Research source Dry your hair from roots to ends, keeping the dryer behind your brush, comb or fingers, whichever you're using to style your hair. You can also wave the hair dryer back and forth to avoid directing the heat onto a single spot for too long."

      "content": "Use the pressure of the air to push your hair in the direction you want it to lay. Use a comb or brush to grab the hair and help you control it while drying it. If you don't have a brush, use your fingers and tug the hair gently in the direction you are drying it. Move from roots to tips for more control and less frizz. [10] X Expert Source Courtney Foster Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 9 December 2019. To give your hair more volume, angle the airflow upward from underneath the section of hair you want to give volume to. This will push the hair upward and help it set with more volume. It's best to use an air flow attachment nozzle to do this, as it makes it easier to direct the air flow onto your hair. [11] X Expert Source Courtney Foster Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 9 December 2019. To give your hair less volume, angle the airflow downward from above the section of hair you want to lay flat. This will push the hair downward and help it set closer to your crown. Most blow dryers are sold with an attachable air concentrator nozzle, which can be clipped onto the end of your blow dryer for more control of the airflow."

Use your fingers to gently lift and tug the hair at the front of your crown upward while you dry it. This will create a natural lift and add volume to the front of your hair. For even more volume, use a round brush to pull the hair up and away from you while drying. [12] X Research source"

If you're in a hurry or don't want to spend a lot of time fixing your hair, this is an easy way to give your hair more volume with less hassle. Focus the blow dryer on the crown of your head first, using your fingers to gently tug your hair up at the root while drying. This will add volume to fine or limp hair and create a more natural, textured look. [13] X Research source"

When your hair is completely dry, use the cold setting on your blow dryer to blast your hair with cold air. This will add shine and lock the hair follicles in place. [14] X Research source"

Different products achieve different results, so it's important to know what look you want to achieve before you choose a finishing product. Products with a lighter hold strength will provide more flexibility, while products with a stronger hold will create stiffer hair. Use the right product for the type of style you wish to achieve.

      "content": "Use a gel for shine and control of short hairstyles. Gels typically provide high hold and high shine. These are great options for finishing side-swept or slicked-back styles, but should not be used for styles that require flexibility. For a wet, sleek look, comb gel into hair while wet. Then, allow your hair to air dry or dry it using a diffuser attachment. If you want a strong hold that looks smooth, apply your gel to wet hair, then use a brush while blow-drying it. For thicker hair, use a gel with a stronger hold. For fine or thin hair, use a lighter hold gel."

They can also be used in wavy or curly hair for shine and separation. [16] X Research source To get a \"messy\" look, squeeze a dime-sized amount of pomade or wax onto your fingers and rub it around. Run your fingers through your hair, starting at the roots and brushing your fingers outward toward the tips. Make sure the product is evenly layered throughout your hair. Continue to gently tousle your hair with your fingers until you achieve the desired look. [17] X Research source If your hair is naturally oily, use wax instead of pomade. Pomades contain oil that will make your hair appear even oilier. [18] X Research source If your hair is thin, try a pomade. If it's thicker, try a wax. Don't use too much product, as this can make your hair appear heavy and greasy."

Use a cream when you want a flexible hold, want to tame fly-aways and control frizz. Creams work well for men who don't want anyone to know they have product in their hair.

It can be used for almost any hairstyle, except those that require a very strong hold. You should always apply mousse to wet hair. Then, you can blow-dry it. [20] X Research source"

      "content": "Finish your look with a layer of hairspray. Hold the can about arm's length from your head. Move the can in circular motions as you spray, making sure not to concentrate on one area of your hair for too long. [21] X Research source This will ensure your style stays put all day long. It can also help tame any last fly-aways. Use more hairspray and less gel if the product seems to be weighing your hair down too much. Hairsprays are sold in varying hold strengths as well. Avoid using a heavy hairspray that can weigh your hair down. Choose a lighter hold for less weight and more volume. Always keep your hand moving while applying hairspray. This prevents your hair from becoming over-saturated and heavy. [22] X Research source Wait until the hairspray dries completely before touching your hair."
