      "content": "The 😕 (confused face) lets others know you’re seriously confused. This emoji is a way to let the other person know you’re confused about what’s going on, what they said, or what’s expected of you. Maybe the friend you’re talking to isn’t making any sense or you need something explained better. Stick this emoji in your message to them to let them know that you’re kind of lost. [1] X Research source “What are you talking about? 😕” “Huh? 😕” “😕 I’m so lost.” “😕 Ok I’m going to need you to run that by me again.” This is definitely not something you want to use in a professional setting and is meant more for casual conversations between friends. If you’re confused at work, a simple question will suffice."

      "title": "😕 adds a note of disappointment to your message.",
      "content": "😕 adds a note of disappointment to your message. This emoji’s slight frown makes it the perfect way to passive-aggressively let someone know that you’re feeling kind of let down. Maybe they canceled plans with you or decided to do something that they said they wouldn’t. Adding 😕 to your message is like shaking your head and wagging your finger at them in emoji form. [2] X Research source “So we’re not hanging out? 😕” “Oh 😕 I see.” “Didn’t you say you’d be here soon? 😕” “😕 So…I guess Saturday’s off then.”"

      "content": "Adding 😕 can mean you’re feeling frustrated. You’re not explicitly saying you’re mad, but the other person will definitely be able to tell you’re not happy when you send the 😕 emoji. If you’re getting impatient because someone’s taking forever to decide something, or if you’re frustrated by someone’s nagging, send them 😕 so that they get the message. [3] X Research source “😕I heard you the first time. I’ll get it done, don’t worry.” “😕 You’re kidding right?” “Can we just decide on a place now? 😕”"

      "title": "😕 means you’re feeling unsure or hesitant.",
      "content": "😕 means you’re feeling unsure or hesitant. Along with the confusion 😕 expresses, it also carries a sense of uncertainty and a kind of insecurity. Maybe you’re giving someone an answer but aren’t 100% confident about its accuracy. Or maybe you’re hesitating on making a big decision. You can still send a reply, but adding 😕 will let the other person know you’re still not completely on board. [4] X Research source “I mean I think that’s right 😕” “Yeah, Saturday is probably good with me? 😕” “That’s just what I think but I could be wrong 😕”"

      "content": "Sending 😕 can also mean you’re feeling a bit sad. That downturned frown will let the other person know that you’re also feeling a bit down. You might not want to necessarily get into the reasons why you’re not feeling too great, but let them know you’re not at your best with 😕. [5] X Research source “Today was terrible 😕” “Remind me why I decided to work 12 hour shifts 😕” “😕 I don’t even want to think about that right now.”"

They’re clearly trying to tell you that they’re feeling lost by sending 😕, so help them out where you can. Along with that, you can send some cutesy emojis as an apology for confusing them. “Haha sorry didn’t mean to confuse you 😇” “That’s alright 😘 Let me explain…” “Oops 🤭 Sorry let me try that again.”"

If the other person is making a fuss out of something that’s not all that important, use something like the 🤷 (shrugging person) emoji to let them know it’s not that important of an issue.

Like 😕, it also expresses confusion, but can also be used when you’re in the middle of making a decision or trying to find the answer to something. “Huh that’s weird 🤔” “Hm 🤔 Ok let me think about it.” “🤔 I’m not sure but I’ll look it up.”"

Being a truly neutral expression, this emoji can be used to let the other person know you don’t have an opinion about what they’re talking about. It can relate to 😕 in that you may just be so confused that you have absolutely no thoughts or opinions to contribute. “😐 ok.” “I honestly have no idea 😐” “😐 I am very lost so I’m just not going to say anything.”"
