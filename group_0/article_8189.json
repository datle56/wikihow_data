Move anything from on your bed into a pile in one section of your room. Pull up your sheets and blankets, tuck them in, straighten your comforter, and place your pillows at the top of your bed.

If the item is clean, fold it and place it in your dresser or hang it in your wardrobe. If the item is dirty, place it in the washing basket. When in doubt, treat it as if it’s dirty! It's always better to wash a clean item twice than to wear a dirty item. Treat items on your floor as dirty unless you’re certain they’re clean. [2] X Research source"

[8] X Research source Place the boxes on your shelves, under your bed, in your wardrobe, or on your desk. Organize your things before you buy storage boxes and bins . Otherwise, you run the risk of having even more clutter after finishing organizing everything. Naylon says, “A common mistake I see is people go out and buy a bunch of organizing products. They'll buy bins and baskets and everything. I always say shopping is the last thing we do because you really don't know what you're going to need to organize or where things are going yet.” [9] X Expert Source Julie Naylon Professional Organizer Expert Interview. 18 December 2019."

This means that over time they can collect a lot of bacteria. Spray household disinfectant spray on a cloth and then wipe the switches and handles. [15] X Research source Disinfect your handles and switches once a week to keep them fresh and clean. Wipe off any outlet covers, too. Since they’re not as frequently touched, they don’t build up grime as fast as light switches, but keeping them clean and bright can help the overall look of the room. Don’t clean any outlets without switching off the circuit breaker for your room. Find the breaker box and flip the switch connected to your room. Then, flip it in the opposite direction to turn the electricity back on when you’re done. Always ask your parents before touching the circuit breaker box."
