This includes relaxing smooth muscles in your blood vessels, which in turn dilates them and may lower your blood pressure. Some ways to enjoy raw garlic include: Mixing chopped or minced garlic with fresh tomatoes and basil. Use this delightful mixture on top of pasta, bread, or a salad. Adding garlic to salsa or guacamole. Making pesto. Slicing garlic onto a salad. Spreading minced or crushed garlic on toast and topping it with a slice of tomato.
