      "content": "Prevent the buildup of oil for easier cleaning. When the oil is fresh on your ball, it'll be easiest to wipe away. Wipe your ball after every game to maintain its condition. Keep a ball towel with your bowling gear for this purpose, and change it out after every time you play so oil doesn't build up on the cloth and transfer again to the ball. Your ball towel, ideally, should be a lint free, microfiber cloth. Microfiber cloths will protect the finish of your ball, and lint free cloth will keep threads and pieces of cloth from rubbing onto your ball and influencing your game. For the best results and the most consistent throws, towel off your ball after every shot. During prolonged play, you may want to swap in a clean towel at about the halfway point in your play."

      "title": "Moisten your rag with rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Moisten your rag with rubbing alcohol. As soon as you finish bowling, the ball will be warm from the friction of the lane. This heat opens the pores on your ball, allowing you to clean the ball better. [1] X Research source A little bit of alcohol goes a long way, so use it sparingly to wet your rag, then wipe down the entire surface of your ball. After you have wiped down your ball with your alcohol dampened cloth, take a dry part of your towel or a fresh towel and wipe free any remaining moisture on its surface."

      "title": "Clean the ball regularly.",
      "content": "Clean the ball regularly. The longer the oil sits on the surface of your ball, the more a chance it has to sink in and become harder to remove. This means that by cleaning your ball every time you bowl, your ball will stay cleaner for longer. [2] X Research source This can save you a considerable amount in professional cleaning and help you bowl more consistently."

      "title": "Wait until you've bowled a significant number of games.",
      "content": "Wait until you've bowled a significant number of games. This kind of deep cleaning is known among bowlers and pros as \"pulling the oil out of the ball.\" Basically, this removes oil that has sunk deep into the pores of your ball over the course of many games. The number of games you should wait before deep cleaning will depend entirely on how frequently you play and the lanes you play on. When playing on oily lanes regularly, you may want to have the oil pulled from your ball every 50 games. Better regulated lanes might only require your ball to be deep cleaned every 70 - 100 games. When you start noticing the action of your ball on the lane to change, it's probably time for a deep cleaning."

      "title": "Tape up the finger holes on your bowling ball.",
      "content": "Tape up the finger holes on your bowling ball. You'll want to use a waterproof tape to do this. Water that gets into the finger holes of your ball can harm its performance. Apply the tape over the holes and smooth it so it is flat and there are no gaps in the tape. To ensure that no water gets into your finger holes, you may want to use an additional piece of tape per hole."

      "title": "Fill a bucket with hot water and insert your ball.",
      "content": "Fill a bucket with hot water and insert your ball. Oil is lighter than water, so it and any accompanying dirt will lift from the surface of your ball when soaked in warm water. To allow the water enough time to work into the pores of your ball, soak your ball for 20 minutes."

      "title": "Remove your ball, take off its tape, and dry it.",
      "content": "Remove your ball, take off its tape, and dry it. After your ball is finished soaking, it should be mostly clean. To prevent water on the surface of your ball from dripping into finger holes, keep the tape on the ball and use a clean, lint free towel or rag to dry the ball. When the ball is mostly dry, remove the tape and dry it again to remove any remaining moisture."

      "content": "Take your ball to your local pro shop. Even if you're a pro bowler, it's unlikely that you'll have a specialized ball cleaning machine of your own. These machines are essentially tanks of water that heat to open the pores of the ball and remove deeply entrenched oil. You should be able to find one of these machines at most bowling pro shops."

      "content": "Have a pro shop employee clean your ball. This service is usually relatively inexpensive, and having a professional clean and polish your ball all but ensures a thorough cleaning. Beyond that, your pro will be able to point out damage that you might otherwise not have noticed. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Plan for the wait time until the ball is clean.",
      "content": "Plan for the wait time until the ball is clean. The time it takes your pro shop to clean your ball may vary, but you can generally expect ball cleaning to take about an hour and a half. If you have a spare ball, this is just enough time for you to squeeze a few games in. Alternatively, you could run errands, tackle some chores, read a book, or play a handheld game while you're waiting. This way, you're not bored while your ball is cleaned."
