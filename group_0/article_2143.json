For this reason, you should avoid contact with anyone who has abused you in the past. If avoiding contact with this person is not possible, then avoid spending time alone with the person. Ask a friend or family member to accompany you whenever you have to spend time around the abuser. Stay away from anyone who has threatened you with abuse. Threatened abuse is likely to lead to actual abuse at some point, so you should also avoid contact with anyone who has threatened you."

      "title": "Notice if the person tries to isolate you.",
      "content": "Notice if the person tries to isolate you. Abusive people often use isolation as a way to control people. This may be subtle at first, such as requesting that you do not spend as much time with certain people. However, an abusive person may soon be forbidding you from seeing certain people, even if they are your close friends or family members. An abuser may accuse certain friends or family members of being “trouble makers” or “nosy.” In a heterosexual relationship with a male abuser, he may also accuse you of being a “whore” for spending time with male friends or of being a “lesbian” for spending time with female friends."

If so, then do what you can to get away from this person. It is likely that he or she is going to continue to justify violent behavior towards you. Some abusive people may also accuse those who they abuse of being \"too sensitive.\" If someone often makes you feel bad about yourself, but then dismisses your feelings, then this person may be abusing you.
