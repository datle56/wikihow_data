      "title": "Damaged brake calipers, pads, or rotors",
      "content": "Damaged brake calipers, pads, or rotors Your brake pads are the actual component that press against the rotors (aka discs), which spin when you accelerate. Those pads are covering ceramic discs, which are the core parts of the brake calipers—that half-moon shaped component you see wrapping around ¼ of the rotor. If any of these components are damaged or worn down, your brakes may begin locking up when you use them. Get your brakes inspected every time you take your vehicle to the mechanic for basic maintenance, and change your brake pads every 30,000 miles (48,000 km) or so. If the pistons and wheel cylinders in your brake system are damaged, your brakes will likely feel super soft."

      "title": "Defective ABS system",
      "content": "Defective ABS system ABS is short for anti-lock braking system, and most modern vehicles have one of these. It helps prevent your wheels from locking up and causing you to skid when you brake quickly. The ABS system relies on a series of sensors and hydraulic lines to automatically kick on, but if they’re damaged it can make your brakes feel like they’re locked up. [1] X Research source Try cleaning the ABS sensors before taking your vehicle to a mechanic. If they’re dirty, a quick wipe should fix this issue."

      "title": "Overheated braking system",
      "content": "Overheated braking system When you press the brake pedal, the brake calipers engage and push the brake pads into the discs. This friction slows your wheels down, but it also creates heat. If your brake pads are really worn down and you press hard repeatedly on the pedal, the excess heat can cause the calipers to stick to the pads. [2] X Research source This is a pretty rare problem and really only happens if you’re repeatedly slamming on the brakes while travelling at a high speed after years of letting your brakes go unmaintained. Get the brake pads replaced and then take it easy on the road!"

      "title": "Incorrect brake fluid",
      "content": "Incorrect brake fluid There are different brake fluid compositions based on what kind of hydraulic system and brake design your vehicle uses. You must use the correct brake fluid for your braking system. If you accidentally use the wrong brake fluid, it can make your brakes lock up while you’re driving. [3] X Research source If you’ve used the wrong brake fluid, you must drain the system and refill the brake fluid system with the proper type of fluid (DOT 3, DOT 4, DOT 5, etc.). Expired brake fluid or leaking brake fluid will cause the opposite of locking up—the brake pedal will be super “soft” and require much more pressure than normal."

      "title": "Stuck parking brake",
      "content": "Stuck parking brake If your parking brake (aka e-brake, or emergency brake), is stuck or on, it will feel like your brakes are locked up even when you aren’t pressing the pedal. Pull over, stop, and then try turning the brake on and off repeatedly to unlock it. The parking brake is the lever on the right side of your seat. Press the button on top and lift it up and down to loosen the brakes. [4] X Research source The parking brake is engaged when it’s in the upright position, and off when it’s flat and parallel to your seat. There’s an old Mitch Hedberg joke about the parking brake being the “make the car smell funny lever.” If your parking brake is on or the brake itself is stuck, you’ll smell a nasty burning odor."

      "title": "Release then hold the brake pedal if you have an ABS system.",
      "content": "Release then hold the brake pedal if you have an ABS system. If you’re driving a newer vehicle with an ABS system, let go of the brake pedal for a second. Then, slowly press down the brake pedal and hold it in place. [5] X Research source Don’t worry if you feel your brakes and brake pad clicking, vibrating, or shaking. That’s a sign that your ABS system is working as intended. Releasing the brake pedal and letting your car coast for a second should help rattle free any stuck rotors or calipers. Then, slowly engaging the brake will ensure it doesn’t lock up again. Despite popular belief, ABS systems do not help your vehicle brake faster. It just prevents your car from sliding when the wheels lock up."

    {
      "title": "Repeatedly tap the brake pedal if you don’t have an ABS system.",
      "content": "Repeatedly tap the brake pedal if you don’t have an ABS system. If you’re driving an older vehicle and you don’t have an ABS system, release the brake for a half second, then press down firmly and evenly. Continue releasing the brake pedal and pressing it down until you rattle the locked brake free and regain control of the vehicle. This is functionally the same thing an ABS system does for you when your vehicle starts skidding. Not only will it be easier to drive, but you’ll rattle any stuck brakes free."

      "title": "Use the parking brake to slow down as a last resort.",
      "content": "Use the parking brake to slow down as a last resort. Also known as the emergency brake, or e-brake, the parking brake can help you slow down in an emergency. Locate the lever on your right, press and hold the button on the top, and then slowly pull up the lever up to engage the brake. [6] X Research source This may feel kind of unwieldy and you might hear a strange noise, but don’t let it go if it’s working and you’re slowing down."

      "title": "No, it’s too dangerous, so pull over and get a tow truck.",
      "content": "No, it’s too dangerous, so pull over and get a tow truck. Your ability to slow down and stop when you’re driving is essential. If your brakes aren’t working correctly, do not risk your safety by getting behind the wheel. Have your vehicle towed to the mechanic for repairs. [7] X Research source If you’re in a situation where you can’t pull over and call a tow truck—like you’re in a blizzard in a rural area, or have zero cell phone coverage—drive very slowly and use the parking brake to slow down and brake as needed. Keep your emergency blinkers on."

      "title": "Take your vehicle to a mechanic to get the brakes fixed.",
      "content": "Take your vehicle to a mechanic to get the brakes fixed. The braking system on your vehicle is complicated, and making an even minor mistake when installing new brakes can have big consequences. Leave these repairs to a professional. They’ll be able to fix the problem to ensure that your brakes don’t put you in harm’s way in the future. Minor repairs should only cost $100-200, while more complex repairs, like fixing the hydraulic lines, can run up to $1,500 or so."
