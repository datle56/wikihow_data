[5] X Research source Take a close look at all your hair to make sure you’ve snipped away any broken, damaged sections.

      "content": "Pick out a semi-permanent dye to prevent extra damage. Permanent hair dyes can do a lot of damage to your hair, and aren’t a great option if your hair is already damaged. Instead, try a semi-permanent hair rinse that can change up your hair color without doing a lot of damage. Look for products that have some nourishing ingredients in the formula, like aloe vera, jojoba oil, or vitamin E. Temporary dyes are the safest dye to use since they usually wash out after a day."
