      "content": "Provide proof of residency in the state or territory you want to work in. In order to be eligible to serve as a justice of the peace, you’ll need to be able to show that you’re a legal citizen where you live. The exact procedure for doing so varies from place to place. Contact your local state department office to find out more about the specific requirements for your region. [1] X Research source Proving residency is often as simple as filling out a few forms and producing documents that show that you’ve lived in the area for a specific amount of time. In Texas, for instance, you must have lived in the state on a full-time basis for at least one year to be granted residency and therefore be eligible to become a justice of the peace. [2] X Research source Rhode Island is the one exception to this rule in the U.S. In Rhode Island, non-residents who regularly conduct business in the state can apply to become justices of the peace."

      "content": "Request a background check from your local police department. Head down to police headquarters and talk to a high-ranking officer about conducting a background check. As long as the investigation doesn’t turn up anything incriminating, the department will generate a document verifying that you have no past criminal charges, which you may be asked to present during the application process. [3] X Research source Alternatively, see if it’s possible to submit a request through their official website. Some police departments are authorized to carry out background checks remotely.

      "content": "Take advantage of continuing education if you're unable to go to school. If you don't want to go to the trouble of earning a degree, another option is to attend various seminars, special interest talks, and non-degree courses on legal subjects being offered in your area. These are often open to non-degree holders and people with no prior college education. The broader your foundational knowledge of the law is, the better your chances of being confirmed as a justice of the peace. [9] X Research source Make sure the institution offering the course is accredited before you sign up. Unaccredited education may not carry the same weight in the eyes of your state’s reviewing committee. [10] X Research source In some cases, continuing education is a requirement of serving as a justice of the peace, so it can help to already have some experience under your belt. Justices of the peace in the state of Texas, for instance, are required to complete 80 hours of continuing education during their first year in office."
