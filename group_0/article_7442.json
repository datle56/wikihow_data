      "content": "Choose a hair color that looks flattering with your eye color. If you want your hair and eye colors to play off one another, consider matching your eye color closely or choosing a complementary color on the color wheel to create a striking contrast. For example, if you have blue eyes, you could try a matching shade of blue, or go with a complementary color, like yellow or orange, to create contrast. If you have green eyes, try a matching shade of green for hair color. If you want to create contrast with a complementary hair color, consider red or purple. Brown is neutral, so it's harder to create contrast if you have brown eyes. Brown eyes usually have warm, yellowish undertones, so consider dyeing your hair a pale blue or violet shade to create contrast. If you have hazel eyes, think about shades of red, pink, or purple to create contrast."

      "content": "Go with an appropriate color for your daily lifestyle. Not all hair colors are appropriate for work and school. Keep in mind that unconventional hair colors will make you stand out in a crowd and stick around for quite a while, so think carefully about whether your color is appropriate for all situations before you take the plunge! Colors that are found in natural hair, like red, black, and blonde, are generally appropriate for most situations. Dramatic colors, like hot pink, may not be appropriate if you work in a highly professional setting or if your school has strict rules about appearance. With certain creative jobs, an unconventional hair color may not be a concern."

Matching your hair dye color to your skin's undertones is the easiest way to go, but you can also do the opposite and get great results. [1] X Expert Source Patrick Evan Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 17 January 2020. If you decide to go this route, be sure to hold up swatches of the color next to your face to make sure the contrast is complementary. For example, if you have red undertones, go with a cooler color, like an icy blue or soft green. Don't forgetâ€”you can always test-drive a hair color with a hair color app to make sure you like the way it looks before making a commitment!"

      "content": "Be ready to bleach your hair before adding the fun color on top. If your hair is naturally light blonde, you may be able to achieve a bright or unnatural color without bleaching first. For most people, however, bleaching is necessary if you want to rock a vibrant, unconventional hair color. If you try to dye dark hair with a bright dye, the color won't show up. Bleach is pretty strong stuff, so make sure your hair is healthy and in good shape before applying bleach. Be sure to follow the package instructions carefully if you decide to bleach at home for the best results! If you've never bleached your hair before and you're nervous about it, consider going to a salon. If you have dark hair and you really don't want to bleach your hair, you may have some luck using tinted conditioners like Overtone."

      "content": "Get a permanent hair dye for the longest-lasting color. Permanent hair dye lasts 4-6 weeks, so it's definitely the way to go if you're certain about the hair color you want. You may need to touch up your roots a couple of times during that time frame to keep your color looking its best. [3] X Research source Keep in mind that bright colors fade quickly. You may want to think about whether you can live with the faded version of your chosen color before you dye your hair. For example, your bright purple hair color will start fading to reddish pink or lavender after a few weeks. Red hair is one of the most difficult colors to maintain because it tends to fade very fast. Red hair usually requires a touch up every 2 to 4 weeks."

      "content": "Expect to alter your daily hair care approach to maintain vibrancy. To keep your hair color looking bright and fresh, you'll need to change up some of your habits. For example, the sun will fade hair color, so if you spend time outdoors every day, you may want to cover your hair or reconsider the color. Limiting how often you shampoo to once or twice weekly and washing your hair with cold water can also help preserve the color. If you play sports or sweat a lot, you probably need to shampoo your hair every day. A bright hair color may not be a good idea. If cold showers sound unpleasant to you, you might want to avoid unconventional hair color."

If you're planning to have your hair colored by a professional stylist rather than dyeing it yourself, the cost will be even higher. Spend some time considering whether you're willing to invest in the cost of your look. If you're low on funds, think about dyeing your hair a more natural color, which will be easier and cheaper to maintain."
