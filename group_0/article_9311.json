      "content": "Connect the amp's power cord to the wall. Before your amp projects sound, it requires power. First, make sure that your amp's switch is in the off position. Then, take the power cord from the back of your combination amp and plug it into a wall socket. Once it's plugged in, flip the power switch to test if its power is on. On many amps, there will be a red or green light designating that there is power running to your amp. [2] X Research source If your power cable isn't attached to the back of your amp, you may need to plug it into your amp before plugging it into the wall. If your amp doesn't turn on, switch sockets to see if it is a faulty electrical outlet. If you don't have a faulty electrical outlet and your amp still doesn't turn on, consider taking it to an instrument repair shop to get it examined."

      "content": "Plug your guitar cable into your guitar. You can purchase a guitar cable at most music stores. Guitar cables are typically called instrument cables or a 1/4‚Äù cable. These cables have a plug that fits into your input jack on your combination amp and is what allows the guitar to play through the amp's speakers. The guitar's jack should be on the front of the guitar or the edge of the guitar and will look like a metallic socket. [3] X Research source Popular guitar cable brands include Planet Waves American Stage Guitar and Instrument Cable, Monster S100-I-12 Standard 100 1/4-Inch Instrument Cable, and George L's 155 Guage Cable. [4] X Research source You can also purchase 1/4\" instrument cables online."

      "content": "Turn your amp on and turn the volume and gain up. Adjust the volume and gain knobs on your amp until your guitar reaches a suitable volume. You can test the volume of your guitar by strumming an open string as you adjust the knob on your amp. [7] X Research source You can use the knobs on your instrument to reduce gain and volume as you play instead of having to walk over your amp."

      "content": "Test other knobs on your combo amp. Test other knobs on the guitar like bass, mid, and treble knobs. Start these knobs off in the 12 o'clock position to give your guitar a default tone. Then, start to adjust the different knobs and play your guitar until it reaches the sound that you desire. [8] X Research source Your combo amp may already have built-in distortions like overdrive. Test the different features of your amp. If your tone isn't thick or full enough, experiment with bringing up your amp's bass knob. If your guitar's tone is too muddy or muffled, consider turning down the bass and the mid while turning up the treble. All amps are different, so there isn't a particular preset that you can use on all amps."

      "content": "Get enough guitar cables. When using a guitar pedal, it's necessary that you use more than one 1/4-inch cable. When using more than one pedal, you'll need even more 1/4-inch cables. The cables used to connect your pedals together can be much shorter than the cable you use to connect directly to your amp. [9] X Research source Cables can be as small as six inches long."

      "content": "Plug your pedal into a power source or use batteries. Many pedals have replaceable batteries so that you don't have to plug them into an outlet. They also come equipped with an adapter that allows you to plug the pedal directly into the wall. Make sure that the batteries are fully charged on your pedal or that it's hooked up to a power source."

      "content": "Chain effects pedals together. When working with multiple pedals, you can connect them together to create various effects. Do this by connecting small instrument cables from the output of one pedal into the input of the next pedal. You can chain pedals like this to create different kinds of sounds, or to have different effects at your fingertips. [10] X Research source Common pedals include tuner, reverb, overdrive, blues, and loop pedals. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Follow the right framework and order when using multiple pedals. Some rules and techniques when chaining your pedals together can improve the sound. For example, tuner pedals should come first because pedals that alter the tone of your guitar may throw off the tuner. Pedals that amplify noise like overdrive, compressors and wah pedals should go next. Pedals that modify the tone, like chorus and tremolo pedals should go after amplifier pedals, and should be followed by pedals that adjust the guitars ambiance, like reverb or delay pedals. Pedals that amplify the tone or volume should go before pedals that adjust or modify the tone, though you can mix this up to get some interesting effects. [12] X Research source"
