      "content": "Use the formula years in service X 12 months X final annual salary / 480 . [1] X Research source Government officers who served the Kenyan government are entitled to a good pension. Additionally, teachers are considered government officers under Kenyan law. How much you’ll receive depends on how long you served and your final salary. Fortunately, it’s pretty easy to calculate your pension amount using the formula. For example, let’s say you worked at your job for 20 years, and your final salary is KSh1500. Here’s how you’d calculate your pension: 20 years X 12 months X KSh1500 / 480 = KSh750 per annum . Per annum means annually."

      "content": "Take a reduced pension if you want a gratuity at retirement. You can get a big lump sum when you retire if you’re okay with receiving a smaller pension. You’ll get lower pension payments each month, but you’ll get a lot of money when you retire. This might make sense if you have a big expense you want to cover now, like paying off your home. Here’s how’d you calculate your pension: [2] X Research source Multiply your per annum amount from the previous step by 3/4. In this case, you’d multiply KSh750 X 3/4 = 562.5 per annum . Then, calculate your lump sum by multiplying your per annum payment by 1/4 and then by 20. The formula is 1/4 X 20 X per annum . So, you’d multiply 1/4 X 20 X KSh750 = KSh3750 . If you opt for a reduced pension with a gratuity, you'll receive both the lump sum and the reduced per annum. In the case above, you'd receive a lump sum of KSh3750 and KSh562.5 per annum."

      "content": "Use final salary X years in service X 12 months / 144 to calculate a marriage gratuity. If you’re retiring because you’re a woman who’s getting married, you’re entitled to a pension if you’ve served at least 5 years. You’re only entitled to this gratuity if the reason you’re retiring early is marriage. Additionally, this benefit is capped at the amount of your final salary. [3] X Research source Let’s say your final salary is KSh1500, and you served 10 years. You’d multiply KSh1500 X 10 years X 12 months / 144 = KSh1250 . This would be your gratuity. On the other hand, let’s say you made KSh1500 and served 13 years. You’d multiply KSh1500 X 13 years X 12 months / 144 = KSh1625 . In this case, your gratuity would be capped at KSh1500, since that’s your annual salary."

      "content": "Use month’s pay X years in service / 12 for police or prison, A.P. and forest guards . Your pension will actually be based on your monthly pay, not your annual salary. Because of this, the formula for calculating your benefits is super easy to use. Fortunately, there’s no cap for your pension, so you'll receive good benefits if you served for a long time. As an example, let’s say your final monthly salary is KSh550 a month, and you’ve been in service for 15 years. You’d calculate your pension by multiplying KSh550 X 15 years / 12 = KSh687.5 ."

Additionally, your money will earn interest for you, which increases your retirement benefits. However, the Kenyan government passed a law in 2019 that prevents you from accessing all of your money if you retire early. Fortunately, you’ll receive the rest of the benefits you paid into your pension scheme when you reach full retirement age, which is 60 years old. [8] X Research source You may be able to receive your full benefits if you are retiring early due to illness. If you have a personal pension, your employer won’t make any contributions. However, your money will still earn interest. The reason why you can’t access your employer contributions or interest earnings is to protect you from running out of money later in life. You’ll still have benefits to claim at the traditional retirement age of 60."

If you retire early, you may owe taxes on your benefits. If you take a lump sum before the age of 65, only the first KSh600,000 will be tax free.

[11] X Research source You might choose this option if you need money at the time of your retirement to pay off your home or cover a major expense. Similarly, it might be a good idea to get some of your benefits in a lump sum if you have multiple retirement accounts. With some plans, you’ll still receive low monthly benefits after you receive the lump sum."
