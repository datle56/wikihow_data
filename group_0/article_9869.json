    {
      "title": "Purchase Spanish or Mexican chorizo from the deli or meat department.",
      "content": "Purchase Spanish or Mexican chorizo from the deli or meat department. Spanish chorizo is sold in firm, sausage link form and it's already smoked so there's no need to cook it. To cook fresh Mexican chorizo, buy it ground up in a tube or in fresh sausage links from the butcher. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Remove the casing from fresh chorizo if you want to crumble and fry it.",
      "content": "Remove the casing from fresh chorizo if you want to crumble and fry it. If you bought Mexican chorizo links and you want to cook the chorizo so it crumbles, cut a thin slit across the length of each link. Then, squeeze the chorizo out. To grill or roast the chorizo links, leave the casing on. It's edible so there's no need to remove it. [2] X Research source If you bought a package of Mexican chorizo in a tube, cut open the end of the package and squeeze the chorizo out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slice links of fresh chorizo if you'd like to sauté them.",
      "content": "Slice links of fresh chorizo if you'd like to sauté them. To get pieces of chorizo that are crisp on the sides, place Mexican chorizo links on your cutting board and slice them into 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) rounds. Then, heat them in a skillet over medium for 8 to 10 minutes or until they're firm. [3] X Research source Use a serrated knife so the chorizo doesn't squirt out of the casing as you try to cut the links."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid boiling chorizo before cooking it.",
      "content": "Avoid boiling chorizo before cooking it. Although you might boil fresh sausages before grilling them, boiling chorizo will ruin its flavor. As the chorizo boils, fat melts out of it and you'll be left with dry chorizo that isn't as tasty. As long as you turn chorizo links frequently as they grill, the chorizo will be perfectly cooked."

      "title": "Chop the onion, tomatoes, and 1 clove of garlic if you want to add vegetables.",
      "content": "Chop the onion, tomatoes, and 1 clove of garlic if you want to add vegetables. Finely chop 1 white onion and push it to the side of your cutting board. Then, cut 2 plum tomatoes into 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) pieces and mince 1 clove of garlic. [4] X Research source If you don't want to add vegetables, skip this step."

      "title": "Cut a thin slit along the casing of your fresh Mexican chorizo.",
      "content": "Cut a thin slit along the casing of your fresh Mexican chorizo. If you purchased fresh chorizo from the meat case or a butcher, it's probably contained in a casing. To remove the casing before you cook the chorizo, slice a thin slit down the length of the chorizo. Then, you can squeeze the chorizo out of the casing. [7] X Research source Some brands of Mexican chorizo don't have this casing, so all you have to do is open the package! If you'd rather use cured Spanish chorizo, chop it into fine pieces and use it instead of the fresh chorizo. Keep in mind that since it's fully cured, you just need to reheat it for a few minutes in the skillet before adding the eggs."

Squeeze the 12 ounces (340 g) of Mexican chorizo into the skillet with the vegetables and stir the meat to break it up. Keep stirring it occasionally to help the chorizo cook evenly. [8] X Research source Chorizo releases a lot of grease once it's cooked. If you don't want to leave this in the skillet, carefully hold a lid over the skillet and drain the grease into a heat-proof container. Then, discard the grease."
