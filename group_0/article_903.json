Not only with your resume get in the hands of someone who will actually be able to act on it, it will also demonstrate that you took the time to research the business and know something about it. If the name is not easily available, a little sleuthing can track it down. An online search using the company's name and department you want to work in may find it.

Using that will make sure your text appears in the right place on the envelope. If you have trouble printing on an envelope, it might be better to print on a label sheet, and stick that on the envelope.
