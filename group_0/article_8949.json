From the dash, click on the Account icon in the upper right corner of the page, and select Settings from the drop-down menu. This should redirect you to the “Settings” page. The Account icon looks like the silhouette of a person, and the Settings option should be labeled with a gear icon. Note that you do NOT need to follow these steps if you only wish to comment on someone else's Tumblr blog. Only follow these steps if you wish to allow others to leave comments on your blog."

There are two options, and you can either select one or both: \"Allow replies from people you follow\" will allow any user who follows you to leave a reply. \"Allow replies from people who have been following you for more than two weeks\" will allow anyone who has followed your blog for 14 days to leave a reply. Selecting both will only allow users to comment on your posts if they meet both conditions. Tumblr will auto-save your changes immediately after you make them."

      "content": "Allow questions. Scroll down until you see the \"Ask\" section of your settings, which should be just beneath the \"Replies\" section. Check the tick box to allow users to send private questions to your blog. The exact option should read, \"Let people ask questions.\" When you enable this option, you'll need to choose a title for the ask page of your blog. The default title is, “Ask me anything.” You'll also need to decide whether or not to allow anonymous questions. Tumblr should auto-save your changes immediately after you make them."

You must create and sign into your Tumblr account before you can leave comments. Note that you are unable to comment on your own blog posts. This feature only works if you wish to comment on others' posts, and if the blog you wish to comment has the feature enabled. Unfortunately, there is no way to know if the feature is enabled or disabled until you go through the process."

      "content": "Wait two weeks. [2] X Research source To prevent trolling and spamming, Tumblr requires users to subscribe to a blog for two weeks before they can leave comments. There is one exception to the rule, however. If the Tumblr user you start following decides to follow you back and has the appropriate setting enabled, you can leave a comment for that user before the two-week period ends."

It should look like a speech bubble and be positioned next to the Reblog (rotating arrows) icon. Note that some blogs may not have comments enabled. In fact, replies are disabled by default; users need to specifically enable them in their settings before they can use this feature. For that reason, it is possible that the reply icon will be unavailable. Some blogs may use text action buttons instead of icon buttons. In this case, look for the word \"reply\" near the top of the blog post."

Once you submit your comment, Tumblr will notify the user and add it to the list of notes attached to that post. Understand that the user will be unable to directly respond to your comment on the blog post page. Instead, he or she will need to reblog your comment and add the appropriate reply in the comment field of the post box before publishing it. Alternatively, he or she may copy the text of the reply and paste it into a new quote-style post, attributing your username as the source. The user's reply to your original comment can be typed into the same text box beneath your quoted remarks."

If you are currently logged out of Tumblr or do not have an account, you might be able to use this feature as long as the user allows anonymous questions. This method is more likely to work if you create and log into your Tumblr account first, though. As with the public reply feature, private comments only work if the user enables them on his or her blog."

If the Tumblr user has either of these features enabled on his or her blog, you should see the relevant icon in the upper right corner of the page. The Fan Mail icon looks like a small envelop, while the Ask icon is merely a small button labeled “Ask me.” Click on either icon to be redirected to the related page. Both features are very similar to one another, but fan mail has a slightly larger character limit, cannot be posted anonymously, and remains private. Questions, on the other hand, can be directed to the Tumblr user anonymously or with your Tumblr username attached, and the question can be made public if the receiver chooses to answer it publicly."
