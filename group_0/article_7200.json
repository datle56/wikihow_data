Veterinarian Dr. Brian Bourquin says that some cats with a fever might “wobble, often hide,” “avoid wanting to be touched,” or have “a dry nose… because the cat will be dehydrated.” He also says “If a fever is high enough, you can sometimes even notice the difference by holding the cat. They'll feel warmer to you.” [12] X Expert Source Brian Bourquin, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 20 December 2019. Other signs of fever include: [13] X Research source Loss of appetite Weakness or lethargy Rapid heart rate Decreased activity or grooming Shivering or rapid breathing Vomiting, diarrhea, or sneezing Glassy or red and watery eyes However, Dr. Brian Bourquin also says “You may not see any signs of fever at all.

Cats can overcome a fever on their own if they have a mild sickness , but it’s always a good idea to consult your vet to make sure it isn’t a sign of a larger issue.

[17] X Research source If your cat’s fever stays above 100 to 102.5 °F (37.8 to 39.2 °C) for longer than 24 hours, take your cat to an emergency vet clinic. Tell your vet about any other symptoms your cat exhibits so they can determine a diagnosis. If the cause of your kitty’s fever cannot be determined, they might be diagnosed with a fever of unknown origin (FUO), which may be treated with antibiotics first. [18] X Research source"
