      "content": "Join the mobile connector and the adapter. Most Tesla models come with a mobile connector that you can use in your garage or take with you on the go. It's much like a laptop cord, as you can unplug it into both the wall and the car. To use it at home, plug the large end of the mobile connector into the adapter by lining up the spheres and pushing them together. [1] X Research source The connector should come with 2 adapters, one for a 120V plugin and one for a 240V plugin. You'll get a faster charge with the 240V plugin. Use a dedicated outlet for plugging in your Tesla. That is, if your outlet has more than 1 socket, don't plug anything else into the other socket. You could overload the outlet."

      "title": "Plug the adapter end into the wall.",
      "content": "Plug the adapter end into the wall. Push the plug all the way into the socket. The cord is only 20 feet (6.1 m), so pick the closest socket to the back of the car on the driver's side. [2] X Research source Do not plug the connector into an extension cord or power strip. Most are not rated high enough to handle the power the Tesla needs, and Tesla advises against this."

      "content": "Attach the mobile connector to your Tesla. The charging port is on the driver's side near the taillights, similar to where the gas tank would be. Press the button on the mobile connector handle to open the port on your car. Plug the connector into your car to begin charging the battery. [3] X Research source To use the handle to open the port, you must have the car key on you and automatic unlocking on. If the car is unlocked, you can simply press the charge port door to open it."

      "content": "Leave the car to gain 3 to 5 miles (4.8 to 8.0 km) an hour. Using a mobile connector and adapter is the slowest charging method, especially if you're using the 120V adapter. However, you may get a faster charge, depending on your Tesla model and how much amperage you're pulling. [4] X Research source Your touchscreen inside the car should show the car is charging at this point. This touchscreen will also tell you how long it will take to get a full charge, or you can estimate how long your car will take to charge on Tesla's website at https://www.tesla.com/support/charging . With the 240V adapter, you may get as much as 52 miles (84 km) per hour, but only if your outlet pulls a high amperage and you have a newer model car."

The car must be unlocked for this to work. [5] X Research source The door will close automatically when you pull the connector out if you have a motorized door. If not, just push it closed. If you want to take the mobile connector with you, unplug it and place it in your trunk."

In some cases, that means you can get a full charge in 6 hours. [10] X Research source While the mobile connector can charge fairly quickly, you're more likely to get a faster charge with the wall connector. That's because this connector must be hardwired in, and that means it can pull more amps than a standard 240V outlet. How fast the car charges also depends on your car model."
