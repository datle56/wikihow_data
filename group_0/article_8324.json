Although nail polish remover is not bad for the fiberglass, it should be used as a last resort because it can be bad for you. It is highly flammable, so do not use it near fire, or a heat source. Because the substance is toxic, do you not allow it to wash down the drain. Use a cloth to pick it up after you are done."
