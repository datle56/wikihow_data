      "title": "Wash the unshelled groundnuts thoroughly in water.",
      "content": "Wash the unshelled groundnuts thoroughly in water. Boiling is done with raw peanuts still in the shell. The shells can be pretty dirty, so rinse them off under lukewarm water. Make sure you eliminate as much debris as you can before attempting to cook the groundnuts. [1] X Research source Another option is to put the groundnuts in a big bowl, cover them with water, and then swirl them around to knock off most debris. Give them a quick rinse afterward to get rid of any remaining debris."

      "title": "Fill a large stock pot with enough water to cover the groundnuts.",
      "content": "Fill a large stock pot with enough water to cover the groundnuts. The amount of water you need will vary a little depending on how many groundnuts you plan on boiling. At a minimum, use about 4 cups (950 mL) of water for every 1 lb (0.45 kg) of groundnuts. You can put the groundnuts in the pot to test the water level. Make sure they are well-covered. [2] X Research source Using extra water is okay and can be a good thing. Keep in mind that the groundnuts will be boiling for a while, so the water level could lower over time, preventing them from staying submerged."

      "title": "Mix salt and other seasonings into the water.",
      "content": "Mix salt and other seasonings into the water. Use about 2 tablespoons, or 17.06 g, for every 1 lb (0.45 kg) of groundnuts you intend on boiling. If you’re using kosher salt instead, add ¼ of a cup, or 64 g. Change the level of salt to adjust the groundnuts to your preference. [3] X Research source Optionally, mix in smoked paprika, star anise, seasoning mixes, or other spices as well. Groundnuts are salted, but you can add extra flavor by seasoning the water."

    {
      "title": "Boil the groundnuts for about 3 hours or until they are soft.",
      "content": "Boil the groundnuts for about 3 hours or until they are soft. Submerge the groundnuts in the water if you haven’t already. Turn the heat up high until the water begins to bubble, then reduce the heat to a medium-low setting. Allow the groundnuts to simmer this way until they reach the softness you desire. You can boil them for 8 hours or longer to ensure they feel tender to the touch! [4] X Research source The wait can be a little long. To reduce it, try soaking the groundnuts in salted water overnight. When you boil them the next day, they will cook at a faster, more uniform rate. It can limit the boiling time to 2 to 3 hours, since sometimes they normally need more than that to reach the desired softness. Test the groundnuts on occasion, such as once every hour. Crack open one to test the nuts to see if they feel soft and taste sufficiently salty. Add more salt as needed."

    {
      "title": "Drain the groundnuts to let them cool.",
      "content": "Drain the groundnuts to let them cool. When they’re finished cooking, pour out the water. The groundnuts will be a little hot, so consider letting them cool in a strainer for about 1 hour. To speed up the process, you could also move the groundnuts into a bowl of cold water and then dry them off afterward. [5] X Research source Note that the shells aren’t meant to be eaten, although some people enjoy them. Once the groundnuts cool, you can crack open the shells to remove the nuts."

      "title": "Store the boiled groundnuts in the refrigerator for up to 7 days.",
      "content": "Store the boiled groundnuts in the refrigerator for up to 7 days. The groundnuts are best when they are fresh and don’t last very long in storage. Preserve leftovers as long as you can by keeping them in a labeled, well-sealed container. They will soften or begin to spoil after about a week. [6] X Research source You could also move the groundnuts to a well-sealed container in the freezer. They will last several months when stored this way. To thaw frozen groundnuts, leave them in the refrigerator overnight. You could also defrost them in the microwave for 5 to 10 minutes or put them in hot water until they soften."

      "title": "Remove the groundnuts from their shells for an easier time roasting them.",
      "content": "Remove the groundnuts from their shells for an easier time roasting them. Groundnuts are typically roasted after they have been deshelled. If you bought groundnuts that are still in the shell, crack them open to remove the nuts. You could also purchase shelled nuts, but get ones with the papery skin removed as well. [7] X Research source You can roast unshelled groundnuts if you wish, but it takes longer and you still have to crack them open later to eat them."

      "title": "Mix a spice blend if you plan on using one to season the groundnuts.",
      "content": "Mix a spice blend if you plan on using one to season the groundnuts. You can use a wide variety of different seasonings to flavor the groundnuts to your preference. One example is to make a chipotle mix. Combine about 1 ½ teaspoons (4.07 g) of chipotle chili powder, 1.4 of a teaspoon (0.68 g) of chili powder, ¼ of a teaspoon (0.82 g) of garlic powder, and ⅓ of a cup (68 g) of white sugar. Set the blend aside in a bowl. [9] X Research source If you’re planning on making chipotle honey groundnuts, coat them in a mixture of butter, honey, and salt before putting them in the oven. Add the spices after roasting them. If you’re not planning on using a spice blend, simply sprinkle the groundnuts with salt when you’re done cooking them."

      "content": "Roast the groundnuts for about 25 minutes, stirring them twice. Arrange the groundnuts in a single layer on a baking sheet and put them in the oven. While they’re there, stir them around on occasion to ensure they roast evenly. Plan on setting a timer for every 10 minutes to check on the groundnuts and stir them in the tray. Remove the groundnuts after they have turned golden-brown and you detect a strong peanut smell. [10] X Research source Keep in mind that unshelled groundnuts can take up to 1 hour to finish roasting. Roast them until they turn brown."

Keep tossing them in the blend until they are all coated evenly, then set them aside on a plate to finish cooling. [11] X Research source The groundnuts will be hot when they’re fresh out of the oven, so consider letting them cool down for at least 5 minutes so they don’t burn your fingers. You may need to roll the groundnuts in the spice blend a few times as they cool. The blend often doesn’t stick to the nuts at first, especially when they are warm."

When you notice a paint-like smell, throw them away. [12] X Research source You could also freeze them to keep them for at least 3 or 4 months. They will hold up pretty well without a significant loss of quality."

      "title": "Rinse the groundnuts under running water.",
      "content": "Rinse the groundnuts under running water. Groundnuts are often fried whole, so you don’t have to remove the shells. However, the shells will most likely have some dirt left on them, so take time to wash them. Clean each groundnut until you no longer see any debris coming off of it. If you plan on discarding the shells before frying the groundnuts, you don’t need to rinse them. Instead, crack the shells open to remove the groundnuts."

      "title": "Heat peanut oil in a pot to 350 °F (177 °C).",
      "content": "Heat peanut oil in a pot to 350 °F (177 °C). Add enough oil to a deep-fryer, Dutch oven, pot, or saucepan to submerge the groundnuts. For example, fill a pot until the oil is about 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) deep. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it bubbles. The amount of oil you need will vary depending on the size of the pot you’re using, but you could start with about 2 cups (470 mL) of oil. Add another 2 cups (470 mL) of oil or mix in 2 cups, or 380 g, of lard as needed to fit more groundnuts. [13] X Research source A basic recipe will accommodate about 2 cups, or about 250 g, of shelled groundnuts. You won’t be able to fit as many unshelled groundnuts in at a time, so consider frying them in smaller batches. Peanut oil is heat-resistant and sometimes adds to the flavor, so it’s a good choice for frying groundnuts. Canola oil can be used as an alternative, and lard also works well when mixed with oil. If you’re looking for a lighter option, add about 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of oil to a saucepan. Once the oil is hot, add the shelled groundnuts and cook them until they brown. They will be crunchy but not as heavy with oil compared to frying them. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Create a spice blend if you wish to add extra flavor to the groundnuts.",
      "content": "Create a spice blend if you wish to add extra flavor to the groundnuts. You can use all sorts of different spices to flavor the groundnuts. One example is to make a hot and sweet blend. In a bowl, combine about 2 tablespoons (27.52 g) of brown sugar and ½ of a teaspoon (3 g) of kosher salt. Mix it with 1 teaspoon (1.80 g) of cayenne pepper and ½ of a teaspoon (1.36 g) of chili powder. [15] X Research source The best time to mix the blend is while the oil is heating up. That way, it will be ready once the groundnuts have finished frying. Add additional seasonings to flavor the groundnuts to your preference. For instance, if you’re using a spice blend, make the groundnuts sweeter by rolling them in powdered sugar before frying them. Some alternative seasonings you could try include garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and dry mustard. If you like them simple, simply sprinkle the finished groundnuts with salt instead."

As they fry, you will soon be able to detect a strong peanut smell. Remove the groundnuts with a skimmer once they turn a golden brown color. [16] X Research source Note that shelled peanuts fry a little faster than unshelled ones. If the shells are on, the groundnuts could even take as long as 10 minutes to fry to your liking. Check them often to avoid burning them."

      "content": "Dry the groundnuts on paper towels for a few minutes. Line a plate with several paper towels. After scooping the groundnuts out of the oil, spread them out across the towels so the excess oil drains off of them. Give them about 2 minutes to fully drain and also cool down a little bit. [17] X Research source The groundnuts will be hot after they come out of the oil. Be wary of any oil dripping off of them and try to dump them directly onto the paper towels so you don’t have to handle them."

Make sure the container is labeled with today’s date before storing it. Another option is to keep the groundnuts at room temperature inside a sealed container on your countertop, such as a Mason jar. [19] X Research source Deep-fried groundnuts aren’t great when frozen since they soften and lose texture. They will stay fresh for several months when kept in a sealed container, however."
