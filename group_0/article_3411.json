When you apply for your position, the airline will perform a drug screening and take copies of your fingerprints so they can perform a thorough background check. If you can’t pass a drug screening, you aren’t eligible for ground crew. [5] X Research source If you don’t pass this background check, you can't get the airport security clearance badge required to work on ground crew.

This probably sounds a little scary, but it’s really important for airports and air travel to be safe for everyone."

[9] X Research source An unusual schedule doesn't have to be a bad thing, especially if you're a night owl or you love to work. If working odd hours doesn't appeal, ground crew may not be an ideal job for you."
