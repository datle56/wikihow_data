In a primary system, voters simply turn up at a polling place and cast their votes for a presidential candidate and delegates. While 13 states and territories still use the caucus system, most states now use a primary system to elect delegates. States and territories that still use a caucus system include: [3] X Research source Alaska Hawaii Iowa Kansas Kentucky (Republican only) Maine Nevada North Dakota Washington (Democratic only) Wyoming American Samoa Guam US Virgin Islands"
