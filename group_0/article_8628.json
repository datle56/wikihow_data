      "content": "Set out 4 boxes or bags and label “keep,” “donate,” “store,” and “trash.” Keep items are pretty self-explanatory—these are items that you still actively need or want, and plan on storing in your room. In the donate pile, set aside any gently-used items that you don’t want or need anymore. Use the “store” pile for items that can be moved into long-term storage. Then, dedicate the “trash” box to any junk or clutter that’s just taking up space in your room. For instance, a pair of winter snow boots might go in the “store” pile, while old candy wrappers would go in the “trash” pile."

      "content": "Go through each article of clothing and decide what you want to keep. If you like the clothing and it still fits well, keep it in your closet for another few seasons. If the garment is just taking up space, donate or toss it. [5] X Research source Ideally, it’s a good idea to go through your wardrobe twice a year."

      "content": "Sort your clothes from light to dark. Hang up your clothes in similar color groupings, placing the lighter garments on the left and your darker garments on the right. This will make your closet a lot easier to navigate! [6] X Research source Make the switch from plastic to velvet hangers. These take up less space, and prevent your clothes from slipping off.

      "content": "Place smaller items in the top drawers and larger items toward the bottom. You can store your socks and underwear in the upper drawers, then keep folded shirts and bottoms in the lower drawers. [8] X Research source Organize your clothes by type within each drawer so they're easy to find. For example, keep your socks and underwear separated if you're storing them in the same drawer. You can make your own cardboard dividers to help keep your underwear organized. Just hot-glue thin sections of cardboard together into diamond-shaped cubbies. Place the cubbies in your dresser drawer and slide your folded underwear into each cubby slot. [9] X Research source"
