      "content": "Yes– you can drive to Alaska! There are two highways that lead to Alaska—the Alaskan Highway and the Cassiar Highway. Both cut through Canada, so you'll need a passport to make the trip, however. You’ll have to drive through Canada no matter what. There are about 119 border crossings from the United States into Canada, although crossing into Canada north of Seattle, WA is the most popular option for those coming from the west coast of the U.S. Once in Vancouver, you'll be able to take a number of highways that all lead to the Alaskan Highway. [1] X Research source Travelers coming from the east can choose to enter Canada a variety of ways, with 17 border crossings in New York alone. However, most adventure-seekers choose to road trip from the east coast of the United States across the country, and enter into Canada at the Seattle border."

      "content": "Plan for a 5-10 day road trip. Most travelers will devote 5-10 days to the 1000+ mile trek across the Alaskan wilderness, which is a good chunk of time to take in the stunning raw nature, bustling wildlife, and charming local culture. Planning out your itinerary in detail is key, as services along the road once you finally get on it may be sparse. There are a few options as far as itineraries. For example, if you want to explore Alaska’s pristine coastal towns, you can begin your five-day trip in Anchorage, drive through Steward, and finally end up in Homer. Along the way, there will be tons of fishing, hiking, and sightseeing. [4] X Research source If you’d rather experience the south central area of our nation’s largest state, then perhaps a 7-day itinerary would be best. You can begin in Anchorage, pass through Seward and Homer, and then book a bear viewing trip in Kenai or Soldotna. You can end back in Anchorage with a visit to the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center for a meet-and-greet with grizzly bears, wood bison, and majestic bald eagles. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Take either the Alaskan Highway or the Cassiar Highway. Both of these roads are paved and well-maintained, getting you safely through the Yukon and north to Alaska. [6] X Research source The Alaskan Highway is the most popular route. Also known as the Alcan Highway, this highway can be accessed via the Sea-to-Sky Highway that begins in British Columbia, past Vancouver. The Alcan Highway spans 1,387 miles from Dawson Creek, British Columbia, to Delta Junction, Alaska. This way is the more frequented one, as it offers more services and sightseeing along the way. Travelers can also take Highway 5 in Vancouver, drive through Kamloops up to Alberta, and then take a blend of different highways to cross through British Columbia, ultimately reaching the Alaskan Highway. [7] X Research source Cassiar Highway is the road less traveled—literally. Also known as Highway 37, this path stretches from the Kitwanga Junction along the Yellowhead Highway to Junction 37 for about 450 miles, until it meets the Alaskan Highway. Visitors can take Highway 5 in Vancouver all the way to Yellowhead Highway, through British Columbia, and up toward the westward region of Watson Lake in the Yukon. This route will have less traffic, but there will also be less services available, so travelers should be prepared to stop whenever they can and/or opt to pack their own meals."

You could encounter a grizzly bear or a bison driving through the Yukon, while driving through Victoria could bring you up close-and-personal with a whale or a sea lion.

You can take the Alaskan Highway there, stopping for the hot springs and delicious roadside treats. And then, you can take the Cassiar Highway back, stopping to see glaciers and bears, which are more likely to frequent this area. When it comes to experiencing Alaska’s wild and untamed beauty, who says you can’t have it all? [9] X Research source Highlights of the Alaskan Highway include: Muncho Lake Park. This gorgeous park is home to mountains, wildlife, and blooming wildflowers. Moose and sheep are frequently sighted in the park, and there’s plenty of trout in the blue-green alpine waters of the lake if fishing is your thing. As an FYI for your future trip: Muncho Lake Park was open from May 1, 2024 to September 15, 2024. Plan accordingly! [10] X Research source Liard River Hot Springs. Canada’s second-largest hot spring, the Liard River Hot Springs offers visitors the opportunity to relax and unwind after long travel days. The pools are located in a beautiful, lust forest and are over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The park is open year-round, from 7AM-11PM daily. [11] X Research source Highlights of the Cassiar Highway: Bear Glacier Lagoon. An excellent spot for breathtaking beauty and water sports, Bear Glacier Lagoon is a highly recommended pitstop along the Cassiar Highway. A guided kayak trip might be a good idea, even for expert kayakers, as the lagoon presents a number of hazards, like icebergs and glacial lake bursts.
