      "content": "Remove stubborn dirt or debris with unscented baby wipes. Baby wipes are great for removing more difficult marks on the uppers of suede or nubuck Pumas. Simply take a fresh baby wipe and gently wipe away any dry dirt, mud, or dust that can’t be removed with a dry cloth. Unscented baby wipes are very gentle, which makes them suitable for more delicate materials such as suede or nubuck."

      "title": "Use a damp cloth to remove any water stains on the uppers.",
      "content": "Use a damp cloth to remove any water stains on the uppers. Water stains are an annoying part of owning suede or nubuck Pumas! Get a cleaning cloth and dampen it very lightly with warm water. Dab the cloth on the water stain and brush downwards, using very gentle motions. Then let your Pumas air-dry fully before using a suede brush or wearing them. Always use only the smallest amount of moisture on the cloth, as too much could cause another water stain. Don’t use any soap or cleaning agents, as these can damage the suede or nubuck."

Clean your shoes using a circular motion to gently scrub the dirt away. As you continue, rinse the cloth and wring it out when it becomes dirty. [5] X Research source Don’t use anything other than a soft cloth to clean your Pumas, as other materials may cause scratches. The cloth only needs to be damp, not saturated. If your shoes get saturated they will take a long time to dry."

      "content": "Let your shoes air-dry before you wear them. Once your Pumas are clean, place them in a well-ventilated spot out of the sun.

Let the laces dry completely in a well-ventilated area before you place them back on your Pumas. [7] X Research source It’s okay if the laces get saturated, as they won’t be damaged. It will just take them longer to dry."

Also avoid placing your Pumas near other sources of extreme heat like fires, radiators, and heaters. It’s best to dry them in cool areas out of direct sunlight."
