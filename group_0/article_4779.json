Popular truss bridges include the Pratt truss, the Warren truss, and the Howe truss. [3] X Research source Investigate a few designs on your own before choosing or inventing one. Generally, a truss bridge has: [4] X Research source Two long top and bottom chords Diagonal beams between the chords, usually in triangular arrangements Optional vertical beams between the chords for additional support Optional abutments at the ends Optional piers underneath Optional additional support beams"

      "content": "Determine the length of your bridge to know how many sticks you need. Consider how long you want to make your bridge before you go shopping for supplies. There are multiple different sizes of popsicle sticks available at your local grocery or craft store, or online. This tutorial uses about 90 popsicle sticks for the trusses and more for the deck. To get a good estimate of how many popsicle sticks you’ll need for your deck: Lay out a yardstick on your workspace. Note the approximate length of your bridge. Take the length of your bridge and divide it by the width of the average popsicle stick, since they’ll be laid lengthwise to create the deck. The average popsicle stick is 3 ⁄ 8 inch (0.95 cm) wide. If your bridge will be about three popsicle sticks long (13.5 inches (34 cm) using standard sticks), your deck needs 36 sticks. 36 + 90 = 126 sticks total. The average bridge requires between 100 and 200 popsicle sticks. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Lay out three rows of three popsicle sticks for each chord. The chords of a truss are the four long, horizontal beams that run along the top and bottom of your bridge. There are two on each side. To make a standard-sized popsicle stick bridge chord, follow these steps: Lay out three horizontal rows of popsicle sticks, with each row being three sticks wide. For the top and bottom row, place three sticks end-to-end. For the middle row, place two sticks end-to-end and two half-sticks along their ends. Each row should be equal in length. Discard bent or misshapen popsicle sticks. The sticks that form your bridge must be uniform and flat. Repeat this layout until you have four rows of three, which are the components of your four chords."

Start by gluing the middle row with the half-sticks on top of the top row. Next, glue the bottom row on top of that. Repeat four times to create your four, three-stick-thick truss beams. For best results, clamp your popsicle sticks together with binder clips as soon as the glue has been applied. If you don’t have clips, press the popsicle sticks together and apply firm pressure so your trusses are securely glued."

By allowing the glue to fully dry, you prevent yourself (or others) from knocking loose a popsicle stick from your truss. Other kinds of glue, like wood glue or general-purpose glue, should be allowed to rest for 15 minutes. If, when you touch your glued truss, the bond feels weak, tacky, or loose, allow the glue to dry for another 15 minutes."

Use your pencil and a yardstick or ruler to measure out regular intervals along the chords where the ends of your cross-bracing popsicle sticks will go. For the purposes of this model (a Warren truss), you use two sticks side by side in alternating diagonals, forming a W pattern. [6] X Research source Start by measuring near the end of the top chord. Measure three equally spaced intervals away from that end and mark them. Once done, two markings are at the ends of the top chord, and two are in the middle. Place two popsicle sticks over each marking, angling them to form one-and-a-half “W” shapes that connect the top and bottom chords. Repeat this for all four of your chords ."

Count out the appropriate number to have at the ready, then assemble as follows: Position your popsicle sticks along the truss beams before gluing to verify the final structure of the beams. Make sure each triangle in the “W” is equilateral, meaning each of its three sides are equal in length and all the interior angles measure 60 degrees. Check the angles of your triangles with a protractor. Use hot glue or another suitable glue to adhere the popsicle stick diagonal beams to the truss chords. Wait 10-15 minutes for the glue to dry. Repeat this for your right-side top and bottom chords and your left-side top and bottom chords. At the end, you have your bridge’s two trusses!"

Then, take your popsicle sticks and lay them crosswise (side-to-side) between your trusses. These sticks form the deck, or the road, that runs the length of your bridge between the truss walls. Make your deck stretch the distance of the trusses. Be sure that all of your popsicle sticks are even in length. Otherwise, the deck leading over your bridge may look irregular or uneven."

Larger-sized popsicle sticks provide more stability, but smaller popsicle sticks work fine if you don't have any larger ones on hand. Lay your sticks in a staggered formation lengthwise to join your deck into one, continuous piece. Use your hot glue gun or some other suitable glue to fasten your supports in place. Place about eight supports—three on the top, three on the bottom, and two along the center. If you are using wood glue or general-purpose glue, allow at least 15 minutes for the glue to dry before handling the deck."

Cut three or four popsicle sticks to the length you just measured. Glue them together, one on top of the other, to form a floor beam three or four sticks thick. Repeat to make four. If your popsicle sticks are too short, make a longer one. Cut two sticks and, with glue, join each by attaching another stick to the bottom for support."

[9] X Research source Film your bridge to capture it staying secure (or collapsing under the weight). Another option is to slowly increase the weight until the bridge breaks, helping you learn just how much it can bear."
