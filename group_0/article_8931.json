      "content": "Look for signs that your dog is facing vestibular disease. When a dog suddenly faces balance issues and dizziness, owners may worry their pet is suffering from a seizure or stroke. Vestibular disease, though, is often the culprit. Watch out for symptoms like staggering, stumbling, or falling. Symptoms typically appear quickly and also include: [1] X Research source Back and forth or darting eye movements (also called nystagmus) Head tilting or head shaking Nausea or vomiting Rolling onto one side [2] X Research source Walking in circles Standing with a wide stance"

      "content": "Take your dog to the vet for an official diagnosis. After your vet runs tests and examinations, wait to hear whether your dog is facing peripheral (inner ear) or central (brainstem and surrounding nerves) vestibular disease. Your dog’s diagnosis will probably include a cause for their illness. This could be anything from an ear infection to a head injury, so listen to your vet’s discovery. [3] X Research source Vestibular disease can also signal totally separate health issues, like hyperthyroidism. If your vet finds no cause, your dog will be diagnosed with idiopathic vestibular disease, or old dog’s vestibular disease. This is the most common diagnosis. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Work with the vet to create a treatment plan for your dog. Your dog’s recovery will depend entirely on the cause or underlying health issue that lead to their vestibular disease. For idiopathic cases, listen to your vet's orders. Treatment will likely just be lots of rest, love, and patience. The prognosis for those cases is excellent. Other treatments include: [5] X Research source Treatments to fight the underlying cause—so for instance, antibiotics for an inner ear infection Hospitalization and IVF if your dog is struggling to eat and drink Sedatives in the case of serious balance issues Medication if your dog suffers from related nausea or anxiety An exercise plan which may include physical therapy, guided movement, etc. A warning against exercise and movement (if your dog suffers from infection or inflammation, for example) [6] X Research source Surgical treatment in the case of serious underlying issues"

      "content": "Create a safe, enclosed space for your dog. While they're facing balance issues, create a hazard-free area that allows them to move freely and safely (if they've been cleared for regular movement). Use a pen, a small room, or even your own furniture to create an enclosed area. Clear their space of anything dangerous that they could trip into, fall down, or fall over, like: [7] X Research source Staircases Sharp edges Floor clutter Small furniture Electrical cords"

      "content": "Reduce your dog’s exposure to slippery floors. While your dog is facing balance issues, they're more likely to fall on hardwood or tile flooring. If your dog will be walking over a non-carpeted floor, lay down yoga mats, carpet runners, or rugs to offer them more traction. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Help your dog move with your guidance or a harness. If your dog is cleared to move freely but still has trouble, try holding them on each side of their body to keep them upright. Avoid holding your dog off of the ground though, because this will make it harder for them to reacclimate their senses and balance over time. [9] X Research source Additionally, buy your dog a harness or sling to help them move freely and practice balancing. Slings and harnesses can be found in pet stores or online shops. Ask your veterinarian for recommendations that suit your dog best. [10] X Research source"

Full-body balance issues may make it difficult for them to reach their bowls—or, depending on their illnesses' severity, even to lift their food to eat. Take steps to ensure that your dog is able to eat and drink freely. [11] X Research source Elevate your dog’s food and water bowls so that they don’t have to lower their neck to eat and drink. Place your dog’s food and water bowls against the wall and lean your dog against the wall as well. This will help them stay upright while they eat. [12] X Research source If they’re unable to move, bring their food and water bowls to them. Try hand feeding your dog if they’re struggling. [13] X Research source"

So, take steps to ensure their food and water are appealing and easy to digest. [14] X Research source Add chicken or veggie broth to your dog’s food or water to make them more appealing. Add warm water to their food. Moistening your dog’s chow will make it easier to chew (broth will achieve this as well). Roll wet, canned food into “meatballs” for an easy, hand-fed meal. Avoid their human-food favorites. Your nauseous dog may enjoy treats like this, but these foods will be hard to digest. This will worsen their illness. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Set up a soft, cozy bedding area for your dog. Your dog may feel uncomfortable, making it difficult for them to fall asleep. Make sure your dog has cozy, soft bedding while they struggle with vestibular disease. Your dog may also have a hard time rolling over, which could put them at risk for sores. If you’re able, flip your dog every four to six hours during the night. [16] X Research source Additionally, your dog may find it difficult to get up to use the bathroom at night. If they poop or pee in their bedding, clean it as soon as possible. Otherwise, they could suffer from painful urine scalding."

      "content": "Spend extra time with your dog to reduce their anxiety. To help your dog through vestibular disease, simply stay by their side. Speak to them in a gentle voice, pet them, and try to stay in the room with them, especially when they appear to be anxious. This isn’t to say that you need to put your life on pause entirely, but your presence can definitely be a source of comfort for your dog. [17] X Research source Depending on how your dog is feeling, they may also benefit from a food toy or puzzle to take their mind off of their balance issues and nausea. Additionally, if you worry that your dog is suffering from significant anxiety, speak to your vet about anti-anxiety medication."

With the approval of your vet, help your dog through strength building and coordination exercises to get them moving again. [18] X Research source Discuss whether or not your dog is cleared for movement given their vestibular disease's underlying cause. If your dog appears to be in pain at any point during an exercise, stop what you're doing immediately. If you feel uncomfortable walking your dog through exercises on your own, consult a physical therapist for help."

Using a harness, sling, or your hands, hold them upright in a standing position for just a few minutes at the start. Then, let them rest. As your dog gets more comfortable, keep adding more time. [19] X Research source If possible, maintain eye contact with your dog to encourage them on. Watch them closely during this exercise. If they begin to fall, make sure you're there to catch them."
