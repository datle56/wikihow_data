This ensures that the top row of your sheet remains locked into position, even as you scroll through your data. If your header row is in a different row, such as row 3, select Freeze Panes . This freezes the row above the cell you selected in Step 1. For example, if you selected A6 in Step 1, selecting Freeze Panes will freeze row 5, making it your header row. This row will always stay visible as you scroll through your data. The Freeze Panes option works as a toggle. That is, if you already have panes frozen, clicking the option again will unfreeze your current setup. Clicking it a second time will refreeze the panes in the new position."
