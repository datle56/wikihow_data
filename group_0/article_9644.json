      "content": "Master the formula for converting kilometers to miles. 1 kilometer is equal to 0.621371 miles (often shortened to .62). 1 mile is equal to 1.609344 kilometers. Thus, to convert kilometers to miles, simply multiply the number of kilometers by 0.62137. [1] X Research source For example, let's say you start with 5 kilometers. People are often interested in this conversion because they want to know how many miles are in a 5K run. The formula is 5 X 0.62137 = 3.1 miles. You could also divide the number of kilometers by the number of kilometers per mile, which is the above-mentioned 1.609 kilometers (rounded off for simplicity). For example, 5 kilometers divided by 1.609 kilometers per mile = 3.1 miles. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Convert kilometers to nautical miles. Regular miles are a land-based unit of measurement. However, perhaps you want to know the conversion for nautical miles instead. The conversion for nautical miles is different: Every kilometer is = to 0.5399568035 nautical mile. Nautical miles are based on the earth's circumference and is used for air and sea travel."

      "content": "Use a conversion chart or online calculator. The charts list the number of kilometers alongside the equivalent miles. The calculators allow you to plug in the number of kilometers to get the number of miles. [3] X Research source For example, a chart would show that 11 kilometers is equal to 6.84 miles. However, 11 miles is equal to 17.7 kilometers. If you know how to use Microsoft Excel , you could also use an Excel formula to do the conversion. To convert kilometers to miles in Excel, the formula is CONVERT(x,\"y\",\"z\"). In the formula, \"y\" is the original unit of measurement, \"x\" is the quantity of that unit, and \"z\" is the unit of measurement you want to convert to."

      "content": "Use an old trick to do the calculation. It’s too hard for most people to multiply any number by 0.62137119. There is a way you can do the calculation in your head. Let’s say the number of kilometers is 144. Halve it. That gets you 72. Then take a quarter of the half. That’s 18. Now, add the two together, the half and the quarter: 72 plus 18 in this case. You get 90. That’s the answer. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Use Fibonacci numbers to do the conversion.",
      "content": "Use Fibonacci numbers to do the conversion. This one's unusual, but it works. These numbers are a series of numbers in which each subsequent number is the sum of the two before. [5] X Research source Start with two consecutive Fibonacci numbers. For example, the numbers 5 and 8. There are 8 kilometers in 5 miles. To convert back, read the result in the other direction, as there are 5 miles in 8 km. This works as an estimate only. For example, take the consecutive Fibonacci numbers 21 and 34. This would tell you there are 34 kilometers in 21 miles and vice versa, when the exact answer is 33.79 kilometers. In order to convert a number that isn't a Fibonacci number, express the original number as a sum of Fibonacci numbers and do the conversion for each Fibonacci number separately. Say you want to convert 100 miles to kilometers. Number 100 could be a sum of Fibonacci numbers 89 + 8 + 3. The Fibonacci number following 89 is 144, the Fibonacci number following 8 is 13 and Fibonacci number following 3 is 5. So add 144 + 13 + 5 = 162 kilometers in 100 miles."
