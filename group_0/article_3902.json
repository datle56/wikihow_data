Coffee or drinks: “It could be one drink if it's not working out. If you're both having a good time, it could be a couple more.” Similarly, Shield advises modifying the classic, sometimes-dull coffee date: “Grab a cup of coffee and go for a walk to a neighborhood you've never [been] before or go to a museum and walk around… Laughing at the artwork is always fun.
