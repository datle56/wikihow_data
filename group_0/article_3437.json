Logging in as root is not recommended for regular use, as it is very easy to perform commands that will render your system inoperable, and it also poses a security risk, especially if you are running an SSH server on your machine. Only log in as root when performing emergency repairs, such as dealing with disk failures or restoring locked accounts. Using sudo or su instead of logging in as root will help prevent unintended damage while logged in as root. Using these commands gives the user a chance to think about the command before severe damage is done. Some distributions, such as Ubuntu, leave the root account locked until you manually unlock it. Not only does this prevent users from unknowingly doing too much damage using the root account. It also secures the system from potential hackers, as the root account is typically targeted first. With a locked root account, hackers aren't able to gain access to it. You will need to unlock the root account and allow root login before logging in to the root account."
