If they’re crying in public, they may feel more anxious or stressed, so offer to take them somewhere quiet, a safe place. Go to a bathroom, car, empty room, or even closet. Being somewhere private can help them feel safe and work through their emotions. Try saying something like, “Would you like to go somewhere more private?” or “Is there somewhere I can take you?”"

Crying leads to wet faces and wet noses, and offering a tissue is a sign that you want to help. If there are no tissues nearby, offer to get one for them. You can say, “Would you like me to get you a tissue?” Sometimes, giving a tissue may be perceived as a sign you want them to stop crying. Be careful how your actions may be perceived, especially when the person is upset or dealing with death or a breakup."

I’ll be by your side the whole way.” Build their confidence with this powerful statement. This is a great way to lift their spirits and let them know they’re not alone. “I know you’re having a hard time with this.” Share that you’re aware of their circumstances.
