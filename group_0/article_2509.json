      "content": "Choose a haircut you know will flatter you and that you feel confident in. To make a good choice, look up celebrities with a similar face shape as yours. Ask close friends and family if they think the haircut would look good on you, and get advice from the hair stylist as well. Bring a picture of that celeb or photos of your friend's hair-do next time you get your hair cut. Ask to get a similar cut while also seeking the stylist's input. Consider the effectiveness of having subtle highlights rather than bold streaks which look dated. Most hair colors could use a little warmth, so ask for a richer, subtle tone. That girl always has a brush to touch up her hair during the day, and for girls with straight hair with flyaways, consider putting hair wax on like Bella Hadid to control those pesky flyaways."

      "content": "Care for your skin . It is essential to create a near-flawless canvas – bad skin is every girl's worst nightmare. Ask your dermatologist for advice on products to try. Never go to bed with dirty skin and never apply makeup on dirty skin. Some good starting basics are a gentle bar soap to wash your face, micellar water as a makeup remover, and a face towel to wash your face with. Ask your parents to splurge on a clay mask with good reviews! Remember to look at reviews always, and seek out products that help with your particular skin problems (acne, hyperpigmentation, etc.) Don't worry if you're a teen or young adult with bad skin, your hormones may be acting up and it will pass with time and gentle care."

      "content": "Learn how to do makeup that suits you. The best tip is to buy the Sephora Beauty Guide and look up beauty influencers who have a similar skin tone. Remember - less is more. Some essentials of \"that girl\" makeup are liquid blush, glowy skin makeup (BB cream or sheer liquid foundation), highlight, bronzer, and nude lip color. You don't need expensive makeup to have good makeup, it takes a lot of practice so ask your mom, sister, or cousin to help you. If you're just starting with makeup, don't immediately dive into colorful eyeshadow and loud lip colors. Work on your basic 10-minute daily makeup routine. Natural blondes/redheads should stick to brown mascara unless their eyebrows are brunette."

      "content": "Start by building a wardrobe with staple pieces that you wear often. Search on Pinterest girls with your body type and see what works with them. You only need three pairs of jeans (black, medium wash, and light wash), a pair of black slacks, and cream or white linen pants. You need four pairs of shoes: white sneakers, comfy sneakers in a neutral color, black booties, and skin-tone flats. After, go shopping at an actual in-person store and try on blouses in every color of the rainbow they have in your size, as well as different styles. Take note of the colors that flatter you and those that don't. Then, try to buy blouses in colors that compliment you. Please don't be stuck in wearing the color black just because it's a comfortable and easy color to wear. We also suggest going through your closet and trying everything on, and getting rid of clothes that don't fit you or you don't see yourself wearing, by donating them. Once all the clothes in your closet are things you'd feel pretty wearing, you'll be so much more confident getting dressed in the morning."

      "content": "This is key. Be confident, but not in a \"look-at-me\" way. Don't put yourself down a lot as some girls do. If someone compliments you, say \"thank you.\" No need to compliment them back or deny it, as that is considered rude. Be polite to everyone, even people you don't like. \"That girl\" is an amazing friend and is the one who messages you \"happy birthday!\" at midnight. Surround yourself with people you genuinely like that don't bully others or use you for homework. A good tip is to never talk ill of others to try and gain popularity, as this will backfire eventually. Instead, speak well of others behind their back, and people will like and trust you more. Something small like \"Amanda is sooo nice, she did my hair for soccer practice.\""

      "content": "Look at every day as a bright, shiny new day. \"That girl\" is a morning person who gets excited that she has another day to do the things she loves. When you wake up, avoid looking at your phone for 15 minutes while you do a nice morning routine. If you lay out your clothes and shoes the night before, you'll have a much smoother morning. People gravitate towards happy people instead of miserable people who can't stop talking about how their life is so hard. Instead of venting to your friends, try listening to them or talking to them about your relationship or a funny TikTok."
