[1] X Research source Instead, embrace the figure and features you have and try to accentuate them as much as you can. For example, if your best feature is your eyes, then you can emphasize them with eye makeup. If your legs are your best feature, then opt for shorts or a short skirt to show them off. Try wearing a little make-up and see how it makes you feel. If you like it, then make it a part of your daily routine. Keep in mind that you do not have to wear much make-up to accentuate your best features. For example, you could try wearing a bit of brown mascara and clear lip gloss for a look that brings out your natural beauty."

      "content": "Try mirroring a guy when you talk to him. Mirroring is when you adopt a similar posture to the person with whom you are speaking. For example, if a guy leans in on his elbow, then you could lean in on your elbow as well. Doing this shows that you are interested and increases feelings of closeness. Try using mirroring when you are first getting to know someone. You may even start to do it without noticing if you are really enjoying the conversation. Don’t copy every move your conversation partner makes. Just mirror him occasionally."

If he ignores you or gives a curt answer with little or no facial recognition (no smile, no eye contact), then move on to someone else. Try asking a question to get a conversation going. For example, you could say something like, “Nice day today, don’t you think?” Or, “I love this café! Don’t you think they have the best coffee?” Try not to talk about yourself too much, or you might seem disinterested in the guy you're with.

Try repeating back what a guy says now and then to show him you were paying attention. Nodding. Giving an occasional nod will show that you hear and understand what he is saying.

      "content": "Ask open-ended questions. Asking open-ended questions will encourage your conversation partner to talk more than asking a closed question. Closed questions only require short answers, but open ended conversations invite the other person to elaborate. For example, you will get a yes or no response if you ask, “Did you have a good day?” Instead, try asking, “How was your day?” This question will show the guy that you want him to talk and that you want to listen."

You don't have to be cold or make him feel like his accomplishments are nothing to be proud of, but an excess of emotion may be a little overwhelming. Try to play it cool as much as possible. This will only increase your air of mystery and make him wonder if he really can win you over as his girlfriend. For example, don’t jump up and down and scream if he asks you on a date. Instead, try smiling and saying something like, “Sure, that sounds fun. What did you have in mind?”"

[10] X Research source You should think up a plausible reason for leaving beforehand so you're not scrambling to think of one off the top of your head when someone asks, \"Aw, why are you leaving?\" This can work well with your mystique, as you can allude to a vague appointment. Be polite, cheerful, and assure everyone you'll meet again soon. You could say: \"I promised a friend of mine I'd help her with a little project. Nothing serious, but really, it's kind of a long story. I hate to leave, but I'll see you soon, for sure.\""
