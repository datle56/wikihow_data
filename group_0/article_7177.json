      "content": "Find the processing times. The Department of Labor provides processing times here: https://flag.dol.gov/ . Click on the “Processing Times” tab. These times are updated once a month. Look for “PERM” under the Processing Queue column. To the right is the Request Date. This date reflects the month and year of the applications which the agency is currently processing. For example, the Request Date might read January 2017. This means that applications filed in January 2017 are being reviewed. If you filed in March 2017, then the department has not yet reached your application. Check the processing times every month to see how fast the department is moving."

      "content": "Choose a next step if your application is denied. If you’re denied, you’ll have 30 days to decide what you want to do. If you do nothing, then the denial becomes final. You should meet with an immigration attorney to discuss your best options, which will depend on the circumstances: Request reconsideration. You can ask the certifying officer to take another look and reconsider the denial. This is a good choice if you have extra evidence to present in support of your application. Your cover letter should explicitly state you want “reconsideration.” Request review. You can also ask the Board of Alien Labor Certification Appeals (BALCA) to review in the first instance by including the words “request for review” in your cover letter. Alternately, if your request for reconsideration is denied, your appeal will be forwarded to BALCA for consideration. File a new PERM application. Because BALCA rarely overturns a denial, you might want to go ahead and submit a new appeal. However, you generally must complete a new recruitment campaign unless you were denied shortly after applying. [1] X Research source Check with your attorney about the best choice for you. To file a new PERM application, you'll need to show the Department of Labor, through a series of tests, that there are no U.S. residents who are willing and able to do the job instead of your foreign beneficiary. You'll also need to demonstrate that your PERM certification won't negatively affect the U.S. economy."
