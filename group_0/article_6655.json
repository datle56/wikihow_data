If you want to fake your location quickly to watch YouTube videos that aren't available in your country, you could use a browser-based web proxy site that allows you to fake your location . Try https://www.proxfree.com/youtube-proxy.php , or visit https://proxy.org for a list of public proxies. [4] X Research source Free proxies can be slow to load YouTube videos and may also pose security risks. If you opt to use a web-based proxy service, avoid entering passwords while connected, as they could be intercepted. Your school or work network may block proxies and proxy listing sites. Visit the site at home and make a list of 10-15 proxy sites to try on the blocked computer. Proxies that are overused get noticed and blocked, so vary which ones you use on a day-to-day basis."

If you need to change your country to watch YouTube videos on a regular basis, it'll be best to subscribe to a VPN service . VPNs are more reliable than proxies, are generally faster, and are far more safe. VPNs also encrypt your web browsing so nobody will know that you're watching YouTube videos when you're connected through the proxy. Some popular safe VPNs that let you change your location are Private Internet Access, Express VPN, and NordVPN. There are some free VPNs, but they aren't reliable. Fortunately, paid VPNs are very affordable, and there are many to choose from ."
