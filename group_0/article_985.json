      "content": "Locate the air filter and remove it. On most cars, you'll need to remove the air filter to expose the carburetor and adjust it. Open the hood and make sure the engine is off before locating the air filter and removing the assembly. Unscrew the wing-nut and any other connectors, and then remove the air filter entirely. [1] X Research source Depending on your make and model and the engine type, the air filter could be in any number of different places on the engine. Consult the owner's manual or the shop guide for your vehicle. On most carbureted cars, the air cleaner housing is attached directly to the carburetor."

      "content": "Find the adjustment screws on the front of the carburetor. These often look like flat-head screws. There should be two screws on the front of the carburetor, which are used to adjust the air and fuel mixture . [2] X Research source These often look like flat-head screws, and you can use a screwdriver to turn them, adjusting the amount of fuel and air mixing in the carb. Some carburetors, such as the Quadrajet found in most GM vehicles, have a special screw and require a specific adjusting tool. The Quadrajet uses a Double \"D\" carburetor adjusting tool. Other carburetors may have a 4 corner idle mix adjustment and will therefore have 4 idle mixture screws."

      "content": "Start the engine and let it warm to normal operating temperature. Check the temperature gauge to know when it's at the appropriate running temperature. Then, listen to the sound of the engine to get some sense of the adjustments that need to be made. An engine that runs lean will ping at higher RPM (revolutions per minute) when the throttle is open, as if you were flooding a gear. In this case, more gas needs to be added to the mixture. An engine that runs rich won't necessarily make a change in sound, but you'll be able to smell it. In that case, reduce the amount of gas. An engine that runs too rich at idle will cause the plugs to be fuel-fouled, leading to a vehicle that is harder to start cold."

      "title": "Adjust both screws equally and find the right mixture.",
      "content": "Adjust both screws equally and find the right mixture. Adjusting the carburetor is a lot like tuning a guitar. Use a screwdriver to turn the screws equally, smoothly, and slowly until you find the sweet spot. Regardless of whether or not the engine is running too rich or too lean, bring it down to a very lean mixture by turning both screws a quarter-turn at a time, counter-clockwise, then slowly bringing them back up to an equal and smooth mixture. [3] X Research source Listen to the engine to know when you’ve found the right balance. The engine should purr smoothly once you’ve found the right mixture. Any raggedness or rattling is a sign of too lean a mixture. Keep turning until you find the sweet spot. Use a scanner to check the air-fuel mixture of the vehicle to help you get the right adjustment.

Consult you owner's manual for the number and consult the tachometer as you adjust. [8] X Research source"
