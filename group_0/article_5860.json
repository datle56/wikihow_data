      "content": "Keep your caption short and sweet to draw attention to your selfie. A picture is worth a thousand words, and when your selfie looks this good, you don’t need to say much. Caption your photo with an adjective or short phrase to describe your mood and let your followers focus on your beauty and grace: Rare. XOXO. Grateful. Genuine. At peace. 100% ME. Reset day. Sunkissed. C’est la vie. Be yourself. Checking in. Golden hour. Working hard. One of a kind. Feelin’ myself. Sunday funday. Bless this mess. Good vibes only. Be in the moment. A better me is coming. Good morning, starshine. Windows down, music up."

Instagram captions are the perfect place to showcase your personality and let people know you don’t take yourself too seriously. Caption your next selfie with a funny joke or meme to give all your followers the giggles: Take 739247. I have no selfie control. Hey Siri, skip to Friday. Reality called. I hung up. 50 shades of exhaustion. New look, same mistakes. One mental breakdown later… I put the “pro” in “procrastinate.” Mentally in the South of France. Looks like you’re lacking vitamin ME. A selfie a day keeps the doctor away. Life is short. Smile while you still have teeth. If you scroll past this, I didn’t do my job right. Another gorgeous day ruined by responsibilities. Maybe she’s born with it…maybe it’s the Paris filter. God knew I would be too powerful if I had social skills."

      "content": "Know your angles and find good lighting for the perfect selfie. According to professional photographer Crystal Bear, you can take better selfies by “facing the window with your phone slightly above eye level and looking down at you to make your chin look thinner.” Natural sunlight usually results in more flattering selfies, as long as you tilt the camera to avoid harsh shadows. You should also turn to the side to capture your “good side” and highlight your best features. Bear also recommends using the back camera and “putting it on a tripod” or “having someone else take a photo for you.” If you’re taking a selfie with a disposable camera, Bear says to“make sure that you’re facing away from the sun so your face is shadowed.”"
