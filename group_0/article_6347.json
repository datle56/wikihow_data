When trying to catch them, whittle down their health with any type, just not four time effective moves as they will usually kill before you can get the health bar down to yellow. Once the health is in yellow, use false swipe to get down to one health. Once their health is at one, use forty Dusk Balls, as they have max effectiveness, until turn 41ish, when Timer Balls gain a better chance."
