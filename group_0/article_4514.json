This doesn’t mean you have to look like a bodybuilder or a movie star or just someone who doesn’t feel like you; it means that you have to look and feel your best in order to get the confidence you need to make a move. Wear clothes that make you feel good about yourself, pay attention to your hygiene, and be well-groomed before you finally talk to that girl you’ve had your eye on. Of course, if you see a girl you like and don’t think you look your best, talk to her anyway! But if you’ve been working up the courage to talk to her for weeks, then you might as well look your best to give yourself the extra boost of confidence you may need to talk to her. It’s important to shower every day. You don’t want to distract the girl with your B.O. instead of focusing on all of the charming and funny things you have to say."

You’ll both begin to flirt more with each other as the conversation progresses, so you don’t need to force it too much at the very beginning. Be careful not to try an over-impress her.
