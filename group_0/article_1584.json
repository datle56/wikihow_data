Glycolic acid peels : improve acne, blackheads, and dark spots; can decrease the appearance of fine lines and make skin smoother; are a light peel with little or no down time, but are harsher than lactic acid Lactic acid peels : the best choice for hyperpigmentation, and good for first time users because it's the gentlest option; fades dark marks and smoothes skin; can be used on all skin types, and better than glycolic acid for dry skin TCA (trichloroacetic acid) peels : stronger and more painful, will cause peeling, and requires 7-10 days of recovery; can improve shallow acne scars, stretch marks, skin tags, sun damage, fine lines and wrinkles"

Leave the solution on for at least a minute before washing it off. Check the patch test after 24 hours to make sure your skin doesn't react negatively to the peel. [5] X Research source If your skin looks normal around the test area, proceed with your chemical peel. If your skin is irritated, red, or tender, lower the concentration of the active ingredient (glycolic, lactic or trichloroacetic acid) in the peel solution and try another test. If you get to the lowest concentration of chemicals and still see a reaction, do not do the chemical peel. If you have any signs of an allergic reaction, like itching or hives, do not use the chemical peel. Apply the peel with a cotton swab – using your fingers may make your fingers peel."

Most chemical peel kits recommend no more than 1 to 2 minutes, depending on the type of peel and the concentration of chemicals in the solution. Read the label before applying your peel so you know how long to wait. If your skin starts turning pink, wash the peel off. [8] X Research source Watch your skin for signs of irritation. While some burning is normal, if your skin begins to sting intensely, remove the peel solution right away. Use the spot test to determine how long to leave your peel on your face. If your spot test burns after two minutes, only apply it to your face for one minute."

      "content": "Remove the peel and apply a neutralizing solution. Many kits come with a neutralizing solution that stops the work of the chemicals so they do not continue to burn your skin. If your kit does not come with a neutralizer, that means your peel is designed to stop working as soon as it is washed off, and an additional solution is not needed. [9] X Research source Read the instructions in your chemical peel kit to confirm if a neutralizer is needed. To be safe, you can prepare your own mixture of water and baking soda to use as a neutralizer, in case the peel becomes too irritating. Mix this into a paste and apply it to your skin after you wash off your peel, if needed."
