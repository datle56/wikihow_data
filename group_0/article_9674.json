For image files you can also make the change manually by simply changing the name of the file with your keyboard (i.e. erasing the original extension and typing in another). This is typically a good idea if the current file extension is preventing you from accessing the file's contents (indicated by an error message like \"invalid file format\"). Your computer uses file extensions as shorthand to understand what software to use when opening files. Be cautious about changing these extensions manually and always back up your file before attempting. This method can reduce image quality. Using the image editing software \"Save As\" method is generally preferable."
