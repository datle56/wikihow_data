Like other cats on this list, Bengals are the result of intentional cross-breeding—typically, an Asian Leopard Cat mixed with a cat breed like an American Shorthair, Burmese, Egyptian Mau, or Abyssinian. Full of energy with intelligence to match, Bengals enjoy hopping up onto high surfaces and getting a good look at the world around them.

This exotic cat breed has existed for a very long time, and isn’t the direct result of cross-breeding—still, some people believe that this kitty might be connected in some way to the African Wild Cat. Don’t let their leopard-like coloring fool you, though. At heart, the Egyptian Mau is an incredibly sweet and domesticated kitty.

When an American cat breeder mated an Abyssinian and Siamese cat together, a kitten with a leopard-print coat appeared in the litter. The Ocicat breed was officially created when this exotic-looking kitty had litters with different domestic cats (like Abyssinians, American Shorthairs, and Siamese cats). Smart, lively, and very vocal, there’s never a dull moment when an Ocicat is around.
