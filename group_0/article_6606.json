There are a few varieties of tick speed in Minecraft: [1] X Research source Game tick: This is the fixed rate that Minecraft's programming loop runs at. Chunk tick: This is also a fixed rate that is part of the game tick. Random tick: For each random tick, the game randomly chooses blocks for an event or process to occur. This rate can be changed using an in-game command. Scheduled tick: Blocks that require something to happen at a specific time can request a tick to happen later."

      "content": "Note the aspects of the game that random ticks affect. These are events that occur when a block is randomly selected in a random tick. Increasing the random tick speed will increase the speed at which these events occur. Increasing the random tick speed too high can cause fires (which are based on random tick block updates) to spread quickly, destroying large areas in your world. A high random tick speed could also cause your game to lag. Here are a few other events that are affected by random ticks: [2] X Research source Plants growing : Crops, mushrooms , vines, and saplings will grow. Environmental events: Fire burning out or spreading, ice melting, farmland becomes dry, and grass spreads. Spawning: Zombified piglins may appear next to Nether portal blocks and turtle eggs can hatch."

[3] X Research source This number indicates the number of blocks that are selected to randomly update during each tick. For example, a setting of 6 means that 6 random blocks per subchunk will update each tick, essentially double the normal default speed of 3. This can always be changed later, so you can adjust the number until the speed feels right for your gameplay. [4] X Research source A subchunk is a 16 by 16 by 16 block area. These vertically stack to create 384-block chunks. In the Java version of Minecraft, 47.30 seconds is the median time between random ticks. You can set the random ticks to 0 in Java to deactivate block updates entirely. You can also use commands to teleport in Minecraft ."
