Whisk the ingredients thoroughly until they form a thick liquid. [1] X Research source Mince the garlic cloves by hand with a sharp knife, or use a blender or food processor to grind them into a paste. If you want to save a little time, throw the liquid ingredients and salt into the blender with the garlic and pulse the mixture until it takes on the desired consistency. Try rubbing your dry ingredients directly into the meat instead of putting them in a wet marinade to help prevent over-seasoning. Feel free to substitute any of your own favorite marinade recipes. For an average-sized cut of meat, you'll need to make about 1 cup (240 ml)."

      "content": "Perforate the steak with a meat fork or the tip of a sharp knife. Use the utensil to poke a series of small holes in the thickest part of the meat. Piercing the steak will allow more of the marinade to soak in, flavoring and tenderizing it from the inside out. This step is especially useful if you don’t have a lot of time to marinate your meat. Poking holes in your steak prior to adding the marinade isn’t strictly necessary. The acidic vinegar will gradually break down the tough meat even if it’s left intact."

      "title": "Cover the steak with the marinade.",
      "content": "Cover the steak with the marinade. Place the steak at the bottom of a large mixing bowl or inside a heavy-duty resealable plastic bag. Then, pour in the marinade slowly, making sure it touches every part of the meat. When you’re done, seal the bag or stretch a sheet of plastic wrap over the top of the mixing bowl to cover it. [2] X Research source For best results, the steak should be completely submerged. If it's not, try putting it in a slightly smaller container, or throw together enough marinade to make up the difference."

      "title": "Allow the steak to marinate",
      "content": "Allow the steak to marinate in the refrigerator for 4-24 hours. Ideally, it should be left overnight. [3] X Research source If that’s not possible, 4-5 hours should be enough time to infuse the meat with mouthwatering flavor, especially if you perforated it. The longer you let it sit, the more flavor it will absorb. If you’re marinating your meat in a plastic bag, flip the bag over every few hours to ensure that the marinade gets distributed evenly. Avoid letting the steak marinate for more than 24 hours, as this could cause it to become tough or give the outside an unappetizing mushy texture. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Preheat the broiler. Allow the broiler element to begin warming up as you finish preparing the meat.Most ovens only have \"On\" and \"Off\" settings for the broiler. If yours features “High” and “Low” temperature settings as well, make sure it’s set to “High.” [5] X Research source Always use an actual broiler pan rather than a baking pan when cooking with the broiler. Most broiler pans have built-in racks that prevent dripping liquid fat from becoming a fire hazard. Coat your broiler pan with cooking spray or line it with aluminum foil if you’re worried about the meat sticking."

In order for the meat to get done evenly, it will need to be heated for the same amount of time on both sides. [6] X Research source If you like your beef rare, aim for a total cook time of about 8 minutes (or 4 minutes per side). Steaks broiled for 10 minutes will typically come out medium-rare. For a medium-well finish, plan on leaving your London broil in for a full 12 minutes. Set a timer to help you keep track of how long the steak has been cooking."

Then, reset your timer for the same amount of time as the first side. This can be a good opportunity to baste your London broil with leftover marinade, if desired. Always grip the broiler pan with a potholder to protect your hands from the heat."

A deep red center indicates that it's rare, while a warm pink one may range from medium-rare to medium. A dry, brown center meant it's well-done. For a more accurate sense of when your London broil is ready to eat, use a meat thermometer to test its internal temperature. As a rule, red meat should be cooked to a minimum of 145 °F (63 °C).

This will give it a chance for the juices to settle and the meat to cool to a safe temperature. Avoid handling either the pan or the meat itself in the meantime, as they’ll both be extremely hot. [8] X Research source When it comes time to enjoy your London broil, carve it into thin slices against the natural grain of the meat, or cut a bite at a time the way you would an ordinary steak. If you end up with leftovers, place them in an airtight storage container and stash them in the refrigerator. When stored properly, they should keep for 3-4 days.

To make the best use of your time, allow the oven to begin heating up while you finish preparing the meat. If you decide to go with convection, reduce the temperature of the oven to 375 °F (191 °C) to account for the more efficient heating. That way, the outside of the steak won't get done before the inside."

      "content": "Wrap the marinated meat in aluminum foil and place it on a baking sheet. After draining the marinade from the steak, place it in the middle of a large sheet of heavy-duty foil. Fold both sides over the top to seal it up. This will create a small packet to trap heat and prevent the flavorful juices from escaping as the meat cooks. Make sure the packet is loosely bundled. While you want to lock in as much heat as possible, it’s important for air to be able to circulate inside the foil, as well. If desired, you can also add a small handful of chopped vegetables to the foil before closing it up. Sliced bell peppers, onions, and other veggies that cook relatively quickly make good choices."

      "content": "Cook the steak for 45-50 minutes. Slide the baking dish onto one of the oven’s center racks. Shut the door and set a timer so you’ll know how long the meat has been cooking. Since the oven’s conventional settings heat more evenly than the broiler, there’s no need to turn the steak as it cooks. After cooking for 45-50 minutes, you London broil will be about medium. Knock off 12-15 minutes if you'd prefer your meat a little rare, or add an extra 10-15 to get it closer to well done."

Carefully peel back one corner of the packet, lifting the foil towards you so that the steam escapes in the opposite direction. Once most of the steam has dissipated, finish unfolding the rest of the packet. Be careful when unwrapping the foil packet—the steam that escapes will be very hot. If necessary, grab a pair of tongs or a thick oven mitt to protect your hands. At this point, you can cut into the steak to make sure it's done to your liking."

      "content": "Preheat the oven to 325 °F (163 °C). For this method, you’ll start by browning the outside of your London broil in a hot skillet, then finish cooking it through in the oven. It’s a good idea to bring the oven to the correct temperature while you’re busy searing the meat. [11] X Research source For steaks thicker than about 1.5–2 inches (3.8–5.1 cm), bump the oven temperature up to 350 °F (177 °C). Dual-method cooking works especially well for thicker cuts of meat, as it reduces total cooking time. The less time the steak spends inside a hot oven, the juicier it will turn out."

Warm the skillet on the cooktop for 3-4 full minutes so that it’s nice and hot. When the oil begins to shimmer slightly, you can go ahead and add the steak. [12] X Research source For techniques like pan-searing that utilize intense heat, it’s best to pick an oil with a high smoke point, such as pure olive oil or canola. Note that Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) does NOT have a high smoke value."

Take a peek at the underside of the steak after the first 2-3 minutes to see whether it’s properly seared. Once it's taken on a deep reddish-brown color with a slightly crusty finish, turn it over and continue browning for an additional 2-3 minutes. To prevent splatters, allow the meat to reach room temperature before searing and lower it into the pan using a fork or pair of tongs."

Allow the meat to cook until it reaches the desired doneness. This shouldn't take too long, since you already got it started on the stove. [13] X Research source Check to make sure the skillet you’re doing your searing with is often-safe before you put it in. Not all cookware is designed to withstand the heat of the oven. Make a shallow cut near the center of the steak or use a meat thermometer to test its internal temperature. Anything below 140 °F (60 °C) is rare, while 155–160 °F (68–71 °C) is medium and 165 °F (74 °C) and above is well done."
