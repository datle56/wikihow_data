      "content": "Style your hair in a sleek and clean look. Hairstyles for preppy girls are easy whether your hair is straight, curly or somewhere in between. Make sure your hair is clean, and use hairspray and styling mousse to tame flyaways or frizz. For a plain, cute look, wear your hair down and natural with a barrette or bobby pin holding some hair off to the side. Accessorize a curled look with a statement headband. Plain headbands tend to blend better with the classic preppy stereotype. Bright, colored bands might be too much. Do sleek braids in your hair to keep it out of your face on days where you're busy. Pull your hair into a medium-height ponytail with a bow for a quick and simple hairdo."

If it does, select a mascara with a smoother formula or use a wand with smaller bristles. Use a light pink or red blush on the apples of your cheeks to give you a pretty glow.

      "content": "Keep your nails trimmed and wear nail polish if you're comfortable with it. Avoid bright colored nail polish because it can clash with different colors or prints in your outfit. Instead, pick light creams and pinks, or a French tip style that goes with any look. If you're not good at applying polish or trimming your nails, consider getting a basic or gel manicure once or twice per month. Avoid long acrylic nails, which can get dirty easily and tend to look less professional. Gel nail polish will last longer than a basic manicure, but tends to be slightly more expensive. For regular nail maintenance like trimming, filing, and cuticle care, you can get a manicure without polish or with clear polish."
