      "content": "Set up an equation. On the left side will be the unit proportion of cubic yards to cubic feet. On the right side will be a proportion representing the number yards you are trying to find. Create a fraction with an unknown number of yards in the numerator ( x {\\displaystyle x} ), and the number of feet you are converting in the denominator. For example, if you want to know how many cubic yards are in 600 cubic feet, your equation will look like this: 1 y d 3 27 f t 3 = x 600 f t 3 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1yd^{3}}{27ft^{3}}}={\\frac {x}{600ft^{3}}}} ."
