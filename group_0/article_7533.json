  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Name the author and the publication date in-text before a quote.",
      "content": "Name the author and the publication date in-text before a quote. To simplify the in-text citation, place the last name of the author in the text to introduce the quote and then the publication date for the text in parentheses. You can then leave the author’s name and the publication date out of the quote itself. [1] X Research source For example, you may write, “Gardener (2008) notes, ‘There are several factors to consider about lobsters’ (p. 199).”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Include the author’s last name in the citation if you don’t list it in-text.",
      "content": "Include the author’s last name in the citation if you don’t list it in-text. If you do not want to name the author in the text, start the citation with their last name in parentheses at the end of the quote or the information you wish to cite. If there is more than one author, list their last names, separated by commas. [2] X Research source For example, you may write, “‘There are several factors to consider about lobsters’ (Gardner, 2008, p. 199).” Or, “The paper claims, ‘The fallen angel trope is common in religious and non-religious texts’ (Meek & Hill, 2015, p.13-14).” For articles with 3-5 authors, write out the names of all the authors the first time you cite the source. For example: (Hammett, Wooster, Smith, & Charles, 1928). In subsequent citations, write only the first author’s name, followed by et al.: (Hammett et al., 1928). If there are 6 or more authors for the paper, include the last name of the first author listed and then write \"et al.\" to indicate that there are more than 5 authors. For example, you may write, \"'This is a quote' (Minaj et al., 1997, p. 45).\""

If you cannot find an author or an organization that published the paper, you can use the first 1-4 words of the title of the paper instead. [4] X Research source For example, you may write, “‘Shakespeare may have been a woman’ (“Radical English Literature,” 2004, p. 45).” Or, “The paper notes, ‘There is a boom in Virgin Mary imagery’ (“Art History in Italy,” 2011, p. 32).”"

      "content": "Determine that your source is published. There are a variety of ways to find out whether your source is considered “published.” One of the easiest is to look at the title page, header, or footer of the source for publication information. For example, if you’re citing a chapter from a book , check the title page for information about publishing company and the place and date of publication. Material on websites is also considered “published,” even if it’s not peer-reviewed or associated with a formal publishing company. While academic dissertations or theses that are print-only are considered unpublished, these types of documents are considered published if they’re included in an online database (such as ProQuest) or incorporated into an institutional repository."

H., & Hill, R. W.” If there is no author, you can list the name of the organization that published the research paper.
