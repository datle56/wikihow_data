      "title": "Pick a quality, high protein brand of food.",
      "content": "Pick a quality, high protein brand of food. Cats are obligate carnivores, which means that they need a diet based on meat. An ideal cat food is high in protein with a moderate amount of fat and few carbs. Read the ingredients to make sure the proteins come from animal and not plant sources. [1] X Research source Dry food is relatively inexpensive. It will not dry out, so you can leave out a bowl to let your cat eat as they want throughout the day. Canned food provides a good level of protein and fat for your cat. They are more expensive, but cats often enjoy them more. All cat food should contain taurine. Siamese cats are sometimes prone to eye problems. Taurine may help prevent genetic eye issues in Siamese cats. [2] X Research source"

Talk to your vet about how much to feed your cat, especially if your cat is overweight. An overweight cat may need a restricted diet for a set amount of time. Keep an eye on your cat's body shape. A healthy cat has ribs that can be felt but not seen. An underfed cat will have visible ribs while an overweight cat has a large belly that covers their ribs."

      "content": "Deal with noise issues. Siamese cats tend to be very vocal. They often meow to greet you or when they need food or water. If excessive noise becomes a problem, take steps to quiet your cat. [11] X Research source See if your cat actually needs something when they vocalize. If your cat is low on water, or if it's near dinner time, tending to the cat's needs can quiet meowing. [12] X Research source You should not give in to excessive meowing all the time, however. If a cat is meowing for attention, wait until your cat quiets down to acknowledge it. This will teach your cat excessive vocalization will not be tolerated."
