      "title": "CBA stands for “can’t be arsed” in British slang.",
      "content": "CBA stands for “can’t be arsed” in British slang. “Can’t be arsed” is a British slang phrase that means you can’t be bothered to do something or you aren’t willing to do something. You usually use this phrase to mean you’re feeling too lazy or tired to do something, but it can also simply mean you don’t want to do it. [1] X Research source Examples : “I CBA to go out tonight. I put on my jammies and now I’m too tired to leave the house.” “I really need to do my homework, but I CBA. I’m having too much fun playing this new game I just got.” CBA also means “can’t be arsed” in texting and on social media (Snapchat, Instagram, X/Twitter, etc). In British slang, “arse” means the same thing as “a**” in American slang. For instance, Brits say “arsehole” as an insult similar to “a**hole.” “Arsed” itself means “concerned” or “bothered.” [2] X Research source People in Australia and New Zealand also commonly say “CBA.”"

      "content": "CBA also stands for “can’t be asked,” which is a less vulgar variation. CBA is also an abbreviation for “can’t be asked,” which means the same thing as “can’t be arsed” (you can’t be bothered to do something). Some people use “can’t be asked” as a more polite alternative to “can’t be arsed” since “arsed” is considered a vulgar expletive. [3] X Research source Examples : “Would you get a takeaway on the way home? I CBA to cook tonight.” “I just blocked Nate. I CBA to text him back if all he’s going to do is lie.” In some British accents, “arsed” sounds like “asked,” so this phrase might have simply come from a miscommunication. Most people say “can’t be arsed” to mean “I can’t be bothered” instead of “can’t be asked.” [4] X Research source Some people consider “can’t be asked” the American version of “can’t be arsed” since it’s easier to pronounce with an American accent. So, you might be more likely to hear Americans say this."

      "content": "Use CBA to tell close friends that you don’t want to do something. Since “can’t be arsed” contains a curse word, it’s best to use CBA in casual conversations with close friends; your elderly family members might find it offensive while it's considered too vulgar and informal for the workplace. Simply text or message it to your friends to explain that you don’t want to do an activity or to vent that you’re too tired to do some task. “I guess I’m going to wear the same jumper as yesterday. I CBA to do a wash right now.” “I really CBA to go to Ramy’s party. Nobody fun is going, so it’s probably going to be boring.” “I fell asleep and CBA to finish the film. Can you just tell me what happened?”"

      "title": "CBA might come from the phrase “get off your arse.”",
      "content": "CBA might come from the phrase “get off your arse.” There’s no clear origin for the expression “can’t be arsed.” However, many Brits believe the expression comes from the phrase “get off your arse,” which means to stop being lazy and start doing something. So, “can’t be arsed” might be a short way of saying, “I can’t be bothered to get off my arse.” Some people believe that “can’t be arsed” comes from people mishearing others say “can’t be asked.” “Can’t be asked” might make more sense literally, as it means you’re so unwilling to do something that you can’t even imagine being asked to do it."
