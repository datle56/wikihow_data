Dab a little peanut butter on the inside of a very tall trash can (at least two feet high) and set the trash can next to a countertop that is taller than the trashcan. Crease an empty paper towel tube to create a flat tunnel and stick a little peanut butter on the inside at the end. Set this tube on the counter so that the end with the peanut butter hangs out over the trash can. If using a purchased live trap, be certain to follow the packaged instructions."

If you don't have a counter to use, you can create a ramp by propping up a small board. Place a bit of peanut butter on the end of the ramp.The mouse will still be able to get in the trash can, but won't be able to get out."
