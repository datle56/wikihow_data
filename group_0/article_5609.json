      "title": "Call the adhan before each of the 5 daily prayers.",
      "content": "Call the adhan before each of the 5 daily prayers. These prayers are the Fajr (before sunrise), Dhuhr (at noon), Asr (between noon and sunset), Maghreb (just after sunset), and Isha (before midnight). Your community will take more or less time to congregate based on its size, so consult your spiritual leaders to find out how long in advance you should perform the call. Specific times for each prayer varies by location, so use a tool like IslamicFinder to find the specific times for your location."

      "title": "Wash your hands, face, arms, and feet to prepare for prayer.",
      "content": "Wash your hands, face, arms, and feet to prepare for prayer. Before you pray, perform wudu to purify yourself—the adhan isn’t just a call to prayer, it’s a prayer itself. If you neglect to wash yourself earnestly and reverently, your prayer may not be accepted by Allah. Make your intention (niyyah) before you begin, resolving to wash and pray as best you can. [1] X Research source Gargle water in your mouth three times to remove remaining food. Inhale water into your nose to clear your breathing passages. Wash your face 3 times: use your hand to spread water from your right ear to your left ear, and then from your hairline down to your chin. Thoroughly wash your feet and your forearms – 3 times each. Clean your head and wash out your ears. Bear in mind that you must repeat wudu if you nullify it. Any form of body discharge (urination, defecation, gas, bleeding) invalidates wudu, as does a bout of deep sleep."

[3] X Research source Take a few moments to consider what this moment means to you, to your faith, and to the people who you are calling. Muffle your ears with your palms or index fingers index fingers. Muffling is optional, but traditional.

After you recite each sentence, the rest of the congregation ( jama'ah ) will softly answer every phrase that the mu'adhdhin recites – with one exception. After \"hayya 'alasalah\" and \"hayya 'alal falah,\" the others should answer with La hawla wala kuwata ila billah , meaning \"There is no Power or Authority except Allah.\" Followers of the Maliki Madhab say this line twice instead of 4 times."

[10] X Research source If you are a Sunni , say \"Assalatu khayru min an-naum\" here. This means \"Prayer is better than sleep.\" Only use this line when calling Fajr, the dawn prayer. If you are a Shia , say \"Hayya- al Khair al amal.\" This encourages worshipers to \"Hasten toward the best thing.\""

This last line translates to, \"There is none worthy of worship except God.\" Most mu'adhdhins only say this once, according to the 4 schools, although the Imamis say it twice. The Malikis and Shafi’is permit repetition of the last line, considering it sunnah: the adhan, according to them, is not invalid if it is recited only once, as the Imamis hold.

This is the second call to prayer before the beginning of salah once everyone has gathered, and is more or less a repeat of the adhan. The exact words and their repetitions will vary from school to school, so consider asking a respected member of your community about exactly what to say. Once you say the iqama , the prayer session can begin. [13] X Research source Say the iqama with a lower voice than you called the adhan , but so that those in the prayer space can still hear you. Recite the iqama quicker, as the prayer is going to start straight after you finish. The difference between iqamah and adhan is that during iqamah , after saying haya 'alal falaah , you say qad qaama tis-salaah (the prayer has begun). Some people say this once, others say this twice. This depends on the school of jurisprudence ( madhab ) followed. Saying it twice is sunnah according to a saheeh hadith. [14] X Research source"
