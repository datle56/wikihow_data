    {
      "title": "Have healthy regard for others' opinions.",
      "content": "Have healthy regard for others' opinions. If you can reduce the amount that you worry about what other people think about you, you'll be happier and less stressed. You'll also appear more normal because you'll be more confident about yourself. The less you worry about being normal, the more confident you will be (and appear). Further, this gives you more room to genuinely care about people rather than worrying about what they think of you."

      "title": "Use your body language to convey confidence.",
      "content": "Use your body language to convey confidence. Body language can make you appear confident and self-assured even when you're feeling shy and out of place. New evidence shows that striking a \"power pose\" can change your brain chemistry, releasing testosterone, which makes you feel powerful, and reducing cortisol, a hormone related to feeling stressed. [1] X Research source Confident body language means you \"open\" yourself up. Uncross your arms and legs, pull your shoulders back – don't assume the hunched or closed-off posture that increases your stress hormones. [2] X Research source Before entering into a situation that makes you feel nervous (a new social setting, a classroom, an interaction with people who have ridiculed you), go somewhere private and strike a power pose for at least two minutes. [3] X Research source Try the \"Wonder Woman\" pose: throw your shoulders back and place your hands on your hips, place your feet shoulder-width apart, and hold your head up high. Even imagining yourself in a confident, powerful pose can make a difference. Picture yourself sitting with your legs propped up on the table, leaning back in your chair with your hands behind your head. Try standing always with your shoulders back and a hand on your hip.

      "content": "Rationalize your choices. If you find yourself wondering, for example, if your cell phone holster is abnormal, step back and evaluate it. If it is a necessary evil for your job or lifestyle, it seems like a logical accessory to have. If you could just as easily keep your cell phone in your pocket, maybe it is not worth putting that out there for people to judge. These rationalizations will make you more deliberate in your habits and actions, and therefore more confident. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Be comfortable in the way you communicate.",
      "content": "Be comfortable in the way you communicate. You should be aware of the way you interact with others, but know that others are less aware of your idiosyncratic tendencies. As you are working on this, try to ask questions and let others do the talking. Tend toward conversation topics you are comfortable with, so you feel the spotlight less."

      "title": "Take care of your body.",
      "content": "Take care of your body. Indeed, you don't need to be tall and skinny to fit in. However, diet and exercise can go a long way towards improving the way your body feels and functions. The confidence that comes from feeling better will help you accept yourself and appear outwardly confident to those around you. Also, exercise improves your mental health and emotional wellbeing. [6] X Research source Eat healthy foods. Try to eat a healthy mix of proteins, carbs, fruits, vegetables, and fats every day. You don't have to be a health freak to be healthy – it's okay to eat a single ice cream cone or a bag of potato chips every once in a while. Just try not to overindulge. Your occasional treats will be more meaningful if you eat them sparingly. [7] X Research source Get plenty of exercise. If you spend lots of time watching TV, get off the sofa and get some fresh air! Ride your bike, swim, or take a walk. Physical activity will keep you healthy and in shape.

      "content": "Try new things regularly. Many people are resistant to change. However, trying new things is vital for expanding our horizons. Whether you end up liking it or not, you'll learn something about yourself and the activity. Try out a new hobby with a friend so you are more comfortable. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Find similar people. Especially if you are from another culture, you may have trouble establishing a support network when you are new to an area. Look for those who come from a similar background. While you acclimate to your new environment, you will benefit from being around people who know where you are coming from. This can help you feel normal, supported, and understood.

      "content": "Mirror the dress of those around you. Trying not to stand out negatively seems to have much to do with clothing. Beyond wearing the costume of the culture in which you live, try not to look more or less casual than those around you. This is especially important in the workplace, but advisable in social circles as well. [11] X Research source Mirroring can help build your self-esteem – when you see yourself reflected in the dress or behavior of someone you like and admire, it can increase your confidence and lessen your insecurities. [12] X Research source Until you start feeling confident and comfortable taking more risks with your wardrobe, the affirmation provided by mirroring can help you feel less vulnerable and more connected to your peers.

      "content": "Read your environment for context. Adjusting to your surroundings doesn’t only apply to new cultures, but everyday situations as well. When entering a room, observe others in the room. If everyone seems to be experiencing a strong emotion, don't do something typically associated with the opposite emotion. You can further upset and alienate a room of people crying by telling a lewd joke. Notice the body language and expressions of those in the room. Are they open and smiling? Or are they closed off and frowning? Do they appear relaxed and at ease, or rigid and tense? Are people speaking in hushed tones, at a normal volume, or shouting or laughing loudly?"

      "content": "Engage in similar behaviors and activities as those around you. Part of getting people to feel like you’re \"one of them\" is simply behaving similarly. Be careful with this, though. Just because an activity is a norm, it doesn’t mean that everyone is not in the wrong. Stay away from unsafe or unhealthy behaviors, like binge drinking, or doing illegal drugs, even if it means you don’t quite fit in.

      "content": "Participate in social activities. Paradoxically, you can stand out by avoiding social activities. Try not to lose friends or alienate coworkers by rejecting their invitations over and over again. Social outings can be intimidating, especially if they're with people you don't know well. You may not always be invited to participate in your idea of a perfect evening. However, the ability to take part in a wide range of social activities will make you seem more normal and approachable."

Strive to regulate your emotional responses to small problems and constructively express your feelings. Don't shout, throw things, curse, or become violent. Whenever possible, express your displeasure calmly, quietly, and politely.

      "content": "Moderate your opinions. It's normal to have intense opinions about certain things - political issues, for instance. It's even OK to engage in well-reasoned, sensible debates with other people about these things. However, if you frequently ridicule or attack people because their opinions are different than yours, you might quickly find yourself a bit of a social pariah. Instead, try to at least listen to others' opinions and be open-minded."
