      "title": "Bastet",
      "content": "Bastet Bastet is the ancient Egyptian goddess of cats, domesticity, women and fertility, and protection. She is typically depicted as having the head of a cat. She is the daughter of Ra, the sun god, and was one of the most popular deities in ancient Egypt because she was the protector of the home and family. [1] X Research source Bastet has had many names including B’sst, Ubaste, and Bast. While the exact meaning of her name is unknown, some believe it means “She of the Ointment Jar,” as she is associated with protection and protective ointments. Originally associated with the goddess Sekhmet, early depictions of Bastet show her with a lion’s head, but over time, she lost this association as the Egyptians began to view her as a daily companion rather than a savage warrior."

      "title": "Sekhmet",
      "content": "Sekhmet Sekhmet is the ancient Egyptian goddess of the sun, plague, chaos, war, and healing. She has the body of a woman and the head of a lion wearing a sun disk. The sun god Ra created her to destroy humans for their disobedience and not following the principles of Ma’at. [2] X Research source Sekhmet protected pharaohs and led them in warfare, and she was the patron god of physicians and healers because she could cure disease and prevent plague. When Sekhmet is calm, she takes the form of Bastet. The Egyptians often whispered their prayers into the ear of a mummified cat to offer them to Sekhmet. To stay on her good side, they offered her food and drink, burned incense, and played music for her."

      "title": "Mafdet",
      "content": "Mafdet In the Old Kingdom, the first dynastic period of Egypt, Mafdet was a lynx-headed goddess of justice and judgment, and she served as the right-hand and protector of Ra and the pharaohs. Other feline goddesses like Bastet and Sekhmet eventually replaced Mafdet and she was written out of history. [3] X Research source While most commonly depicted with the head of a lynx, sometimes Mafdet was shown with the head of a panther, lion, or leopard. Because cats protected ancient Egyptians from venomous snakes, they were highly revered and therefore portrayed as some of the fiercest goddesses. In turn, cats became sacred creatures and were worshipped in their own right."

She is one of the Heliopolitan Ennead, a group of 9 deities who were primarily worshipped in the ancient city of Heliopolis. She has the head of a lioness, and when angered, she brings droughts, heat waves, and bad harvests. [4] X Research source The ancient Egyptians believed that Tefnut and her twin brother Shu, the god of air, were created by the god Atum through self-creation. Tefnut and Shu were the parents of Nut, the sky goddess, and Geb, the earth god. Tefnut’s separation from Shu created the space between the sky and the earth. While Tefnut and Sekhmet both have lion heads, they aren’t the same goddess. Sekhmet is typically depicted with rounded ears, while Tefnut is depicted with pointed ears."

In some myths, the goddess Hera turned a serving maid named Galanthis into a cat as a punishment for being rude, and in turn, the cat became Hecate’s familiar. [5] X Research source In another myth, Hecate assumes the form of a cat so she can get away from the monster Typhon. Because cats weren’t domesticated in Greece, the ancient Greeks did not have a god or goddess of cats, but they did have several connected to cats or big cats through various myths."

It comes down from the heavens on a fireball and drags the bodies of the dead to the underworld for eternal damnation. [17] X Research source The kanji for Kasha literally translates to “fire cart” so it is sometimes depicted as a flaming cart rather than a cat. The myth of the Kasha arose during the Kamakura period in Japan, a time of great change and several new schools of Buddhism. Many people believed the period was the end of times. While the fire cart version of the Kasha came first, the myth might have developed into a cat because of the word akaneko, which is a slang term for fire meaning “red cat.”"
