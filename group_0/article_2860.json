Leave room for sexiness any time in your life, even if you're just having an ordinary dinner or watching a television show. Here are some ways to be spontaneously sexy: If you're feeling sexy, take the initiative. Even if you're not in the middle of a sexy activity, let your man know by kissing or touching him in a subtle way. And if subtlety fails, try for some dirty talk to let him know what's on the table. He'll be more than just pleasantly surprised. When he comes home from work, turn off all the lights, pull the shades, and lay naked on his desk. When he turns the lights on he will get a real surprise. However, do not do this unless you plan on further sexual activities. A guy is not going to be surprised by a naked girlfriend on his desk and then just walk away to read the newspaper. Surprise him in public. Though you don't have to go for it in the back of your car or some untoward place, a special touch or kiss at the right time can show him that you're ready for more. And if you're isolated and not offending anyone, you make time for romance. Remember that a good soldier is always prepared for battle. Be ready for sexy time--any time. Try to keep your legs shaved , your skin washed, and your breath nice and minty as often as you can so you'll be ready to get it on."
