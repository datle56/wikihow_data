Ruled by the moon (the planet of emotions in astrology), it’s no surprise that Cancers are one of the most sensitive signs in the zodiac. On the other hand, Capricorns prefer to stick to the logical, rational side of things, and they’re less comfortable with strong emotion. “Capricorn is not generally a ‘mushy’ sign—they are more practical about the people they love,” explains astrologer Stina Garbis.

Both are Cardinal signs , which means they're each pushy in their own ways, explains Eyedealism. “Cancer is a Cardinal sign of the water elements, so they're pushy about emotional matters. They’ll just keep pushing until they get somebody [to talk about their emotions],” she says. [5] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. Wednesday, February 22, 2023. Capricorn, on the other hand, can be pushy in logical matters, but they tend to keep their emotions more bottled up. Ultimately, a Capricorn leads with their head, while a Cancer leads with their heart, which can cause some communication issues. Capricorn can support Cancer by being a good listener and having patience when Cancer is experiencing intense emotions. Oftentimes, a Capricorn will want to jump in with practical solutions and advice when a Cancer isn’t actually looking for these things; they just want to vent and express their emotions, and they’re looking for comfort and affirmation. Cancer, on the other hand, can help Capricorn by giving them space to process their emotions instead of pushing them to be an open book. Capricorns often prefer to work through their feelings internally before sharing them with others, but if they feel safe and secure enough with someone, they’ll eventually open up."
