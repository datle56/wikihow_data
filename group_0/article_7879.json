Shoe Care Specialist Marc Sigal recommends pouring warm water into a bowl—no more than halfway to give yourself room to dip your rag—and adding 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of mild dish detergent. [1] X Expert Source Marc Sigal Shoe Care Specialist Expert Interview. 15 January 2020. Gently stir the detergent in with a spoon to ensure even consistency. [2] X Research source Be sure the consistency of your cleaning solution is slightly soapy without being overly sticky or frothy. Alternatively, you can use 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of mild laundry detergent or 1 tablespoon (15 mL) white vinegar with 3 tablespoon (44 mL) of baking soda. Use bleaching agents with caution and dilute it with water. Bleach can damage certain materials and cause discoloration when left for too long. Always test a discreet spot before proceeding.

      "content": "Remove your shoe's laces and stuff it with a cloth. After removing your shoe's laces, find a clean, absorbent cloth and stuff it into the shoe—this will absorb extra liquid that leaks in during cleaning and help keep its shape. It will also give you some resistance as you scrub the surface of the shoe. [4] X Research source Use microfiber cloths for the best absorbency. Stuff your shoes with a paper towel if you don't have an extra cloth. If your laces are dirty, soak them in a separate mixture of 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) dish detergent and warm water for 15 to 20 minutes. Afterward, scrub them clean with a soft-bristled brush.

Purchase some disinfectant cleaning wipes from a home improvement store and wipe the bottoms clean. Apply a firm amount of pressure and avoid touching the shoe's mesh surface with your wipes. [10] X Research source Never use cleaning wipes on the mesh surface of your shoes. If you don't have cleaning wipes, use a piece of paper towel wet with 3 to 4 drops of bleach. Sigal recommends using a magic eraser product if you have any. You can also purchase some from home improvement and big box stores.

After you remove your laces, stuff them into a sock—this allows you to clean them separately in the same load as your sneakers. Tie the end of the sock tightly with a lace or elastic band. [14] X Research source If your shoes have laces that feed through plastic loops that hold them in place, don't remove them."

Afterward, fasten the twisted end with a rubber band wrapped around it 2 times or more, depending on the size of the rubber band and the thickness of the twisted end. [15] X Research source Fold the twisted end in half before wrapping the rubber band around it to make it snugger. Usually, you can fit 2 to 3 pairs of shoes in a pillowcase. Put as many in as you want, but try not to stuff it too tight. Not all shoe materials can be washed in a washing machine. For example, Puma and Nike advise against putting their shoes in a washing machine. [16] X Research source Whereas Adidas running shoes can be.
