      "title": "Befriend as many people as possible.",
      "content": "Befriend as many people as possible. What prom queen boils down to is votes. If people don’t know and like you, they have no reason to vote for you. In the months (years, if possible) before prom, get to know all of your classmates; not just the cool kids. Each person is one vote, regardless of their status in school. While it’s important that they know you, it’s even more important that they like you. So be genuine! Put the time in and show them how great a person you are. And mean it; these relationships will last a lot longer than being prom queen will. Don’t drop these people after the voting is done, your reputation will turn sour as soon as the contest is over."

    {
      "title": "Involve yourself in different activities.",
      "content": "Involve yourself in different activities. To meet others, have things in common, and show the school that you’re well-balanced and talented, take up a few varied extra-curriculars. To be a shoo-in for prom queen, it’s wise to be an athlete and an artist. And it doesn’t hurt to be in the environmental club either. Sometimes the staff at your school can influence who makes it to the final nominations (yes, even high school can be rigged). The more they believe in you, the better your chances are to get through the red tape."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be a role model for the school.",
      "content": "Be a role model for the school. Many schools require that you have good grades, are an active participant in school activities, and that you’re a model student that others should be emulating in order to be prom queen. It’s not just recommended, it’s necessary. Is your school like that? If you don’t know, it’s about time you find out! This will establish a reputation for you as someone who would make a natural prom queen. After all, being \"queen\" is about leading your people, right? Show your school that you're a good leader and they'll be more inclined to vote for you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stay out of trouble.",
      "content": "Stay out of trouble. The absolute last thing you want to happen before prom rolls around is to get into trouble at your school. If you get suspended for any reason (poor grades or bad behavior), odds are you’ll be taken off any ballot, even if you were thought to be the clear winner. Don’t jinx yourself and make sure you’re on your best behavior; a real prom queen wouldn’t get into trouble anyway! Whether it's cheating on homework, getting caught climbing the school roof, or drawing an unfortunate picture of your least favorite teacher, don't do it. Right now, everyone else is your bread and butter. They've gotta be on your side, teachers included."

    {
      "title": "Be on the prom committee.",
      "content": "Be on the prom committee. You know how sometimes the staff have a say in who makes it onto court? Well, the prom committee has influence over their voters. They’re the ones that remind people how to vote and what kind of person to vote for. If you emphasize certain qualities that you have, you could subtly remind people how perfect you are for the job. It will also show everyone how much this means to you. When they see the amount of effort you're putting in, they may be more moved to vote for you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get nominated.",
      "content": "Get nominated. In most schools, someone needs to nominate you and then someone else has to second that motion. That means you need at least two people who believe in you so thoroughly that they’ll go out of their way to make sure your name is on the list. Who do you have that you can count on? Ask your best friends if they’ll do this for you, and make sure you repay the favor later! In some instances, you may have to trade a nomination for a nomination. This is only fair! Consider it friendly competition that will make the whole thing more fun and engaging."

    {
      "title": "Start campaigning.",
      "content": "Start campaigning. Especially in big schools, campaigning is key. It’s like marketing a business; if no one hears about it, no one will come. So get your name out there: have a stand at lunch, make posters for the hallways, even try to get your voice over the PA. The more people recognize you, the more you’ll be setting yourself up for prom queen branding. Make sure you're allowed to do whatever it is you're planning on doing. Some schools have strict policies on what posters you can put up where and when, where you can solicit their students, etc."

    {
      "title": "Get the word out everywhere!",
      "content": "Get the word out everywhere! You know all those friends you have? Now’s the time to make sure your name infiltrates even the deepest, darkest dungeons of your school. Ask Jessica from the Go-Green Club to put up flyers in their workspace after class. Talk to Paul about distributing cupcakes to the football team. You want no stone left unturned! This is when you should hit up all the new friends you've made over the last few months. Make sure they have t-shirts with your name on them, bracelets, keychains, and a baked good never hurts."

      "title": "Dress the part.",
      "content": "Dress the part. Last but not least, people have a certain image in their heads of what a prom queen looks like. In short, she looks good, she smells good, and she probably feels good. Here are a few ideas to be her: Shower daily and find yourself a “prom queen” worthy, signature scent to wear every day Piece together your fashionable outfits carefully and wear make-up that compliments your overall look. Keep your hair clean and sophisticated. Any style is good, so long as it’s clean and put-together."

      "title": "Find the perfect dress.",
      "content": "Find the perfect dress. A prom queen would be nothing without the perfect prom dress. Ideally it is great for your shape, your color, and no one else is wearing it. It doesn’t have to be expensive, it just has to be perfect for you. Consider getting a color that pops. You'll feel like the belle of the ball knowing all eyes are on you. Get a cut that flatters your shape. Take whatever body parts you're nervous about make them work for you, not against you. Get a dress that matches your personality. Who said you couldn't be a pig-in-a-blanket for prom?"

    {
      "title": "Get your hair and makeup just right.",
      "content": "Get your hair and makeup just right. More pictures will be taken tonight than any other night of the school year, so get your hair and makeup perfect for the memories that are about to be made. Pile on the hairspray, too; it's not going to be a short night. As for your makeup, it's no shame in doing it yourself. In fact, you probably know what looks better on you than a stranger does. Wear it a bit darker than what you normally wear. Smokey tones with light lips work great for prom."

    {
      "title": "Have a great time!",
      "content": "Have a great time! It’s the night you’ve been waiting for. Instead of spending the hours beforehand being so nervous you constantly need to pee, try to concentrate on this being one of the most exciting nights of the year. You’re going to have a good time and you know it. All your friends, food, and music; what's not to like?"

    {
      "title": "Be a gracious, deserving prom queen.",
      "content": "Be a gracious, deserving prom queen. If you win the title, remember that you’re prom queen; a prom queen is gracious, friendly, and humble. Show everyone how much you appreciate their votes and that this means the world to you. In other words, let them know they voted for the right person! Don't hesitate to thank those that you know voted for you. They'll know they made the right decision by how kind and genuine you are."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be gracious, whether you win or lose.",
      "content": "Be gracious, whether you win or lose. Regardless of the turnout of events, it’s important to be all smiles whether you win or lose; after all, this is your prom! It’s fun just being there, getting dressed up, and dancing with your friends. You'll remember this day whether or not the title is yours, and you'll remember it as a rocking good time. Besides, aren’t there a couple of other high schools’ proms you could crash? Hmm..."
