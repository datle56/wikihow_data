When talking to him between classes or during lunch, stand a little closer to him than you normally would. This sends the signal you like him back and enjoy being near him. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Make excuses to spend time alone with him. Solo time with your crush can help you assess if he likes you. It can also send the message you're interested in him as well. Try to find ways to get him alone so the two of you can have a chance to make your feelings clear. [2] X Research source For example, text him something like, \"I'm really craving a burger. Want to run and get a snack after class?\""

      "content": "Return flirtatious gestures. If he flirts with you, flirt back. Common flirting tactics include making eye contact, flashing a smile, flashing your eyebrows, and casual touching. If these gestures are coming your way, return them. For example, if your crush brushes your arm, wait a few moments. Then, do something like tussle his hair or place your hand on his knee."

      "title": "Be yourself.",
      "content": "Be yourself. Remember, if a guy already likes you, you don't need to change. Be your unique self around him and don't be afraid to let your inhibitions down. Feel free to get a little goofy or wild around him, as this is likely to endear you to him more. [4] X Research source For example, if you're a fan of a certain musical artist that's a little obscure, don't be afraid to talk about this in front of the guy. If you like a unique type of movie, invite him to watch these movies with you."

      "content": "Try to hang out in group settings. To send the signal you just want to be friends, keep the guy in question in your friends group. Avoid solo hang outs. When inviting him out, make it clear a whole group is coming and not just the two of you. [5] X Research source For example, invite him to a movie night with a group of friends. You can also redirect him if he asks you to go somewhere with him. For example, say he asks you to go to a party with him. Say something like, \"Oh, I'm going with a whole group of my friends. You're totally welcome to join.\""

      "content": "Avoid touch. Many people are casually touchy with their friends. You may hug friends hello or goodbye or casually pat friends on the shoulder during conversation. If you think a guy likes you, refrain from engaging in these rituals with him. This can easily send the wrong message. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Go easy on the compliments. It's normal to compliment your friends. However, you don't want to go overboard complimenting a guy you think likes you. This may make him think you're interested when you're not. [7] X Research source For example, say he's wearing a shirt you like. Saying something like, \"You look nice today\" could come off as flirtatious. Instead, find a less flirty comment. Say something like, \"Nice shirt!\" You could also forego commenting altogether, just to be safe."

If the guy, say, grins at you from across the room, return his gaze with a curt nod rather than smiling back. If a guy is persistently flirting with you in ways that make you feel uncomfortable, say something. For example, \"I really don't like you touching me all the time.\""

Say something that clearly indicates you don't feel the same way. For example, \"I'm not interested in you romantically.\" If you want to give a reason, that's okay, but be kind about it. For example, if you're not attracted to him, don't say, \"I'm not attracted to you.\" Say something like, \"I just see you as a friend.\""

Whether the feelings were returned or not, it can be awkward if you thought someone had feelings for you if they didn't. Make sure you have a plan to respond in this case. Accept his response gracefully. In either scenario, you can say something like, \"Oh, I guess I misread the signs. Thanks for being honest with me.\" It's okay to be sad if you were rejected by someone you thought liked you. Take some time to vent to friends and do something nice for yourself, like go see a movie or order take out. [10] X Research source"
