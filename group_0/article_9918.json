      "content": "Go to a butcher that sells specialty meat. Goat meat is not commonly available in Western supermarkets. You'll need to look for it through specialist butchers, online sellers from farms or gourmet food sellers, and in some Middle Eastern, Indian or Caribbean specialty grocery stores. Sometimes the words \"chevon\" (older goat meat), \"cabrito\" (younger goat meat) or \"capretto\" are used to denote that the meat is goat's. You can also ask your local butcher to source some goat meat if you'd like to try it."

      "title": "Cube the goat meat.",
      "content": "Cube the goat meat. In many cases you can buy goat meat that has already been cubed, or cut into bite-sized pieces. If your goat meat has not been cubed, use a sharp knife to slice it into 1-inch pieces that will break down easily in the stew. Any type of goat can be stewed. If you can't find pre-cubed goat meat, consider stewing a goat leg or goat steaks instead. You can stew a goat leg without cubing it. You need two pounds of goat meat, not including the weight of the bone."
