When you reach a person, immediately ask if you're speaking to the retention department; if they say no, ask to be transferred to retention. You'll most likely be encouraged to explain the nature of your call before proceeding. You may have to hold for 5 to 10 minutes, depending on when you call. Call during low call volume times, such as between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM on weekdays, to reduce the hold time."

      "title": "Explain to the representative that you want to cancel your service.",
      "content": "Explain to the representative that you want to cancel your service. Be honest, and be clear about why you want to cancel. No matter what you say, they will try to convince you to stay. The most important thing is that you are firm in your decision to cancel. Saying that you're moving to a different country will generally warrant mixed results, as your chosen country may have DIRECTV coverage. Implying that you're leaving to serve in the Peace Corps (or similar), however, is usually enough to render the customer representative's arguments invalid."

The exceptions are your satellite dish , cords, cables, splitters, and switches—you don't need to send these back to DIRECTV. Make sure to disconnect all receivers and remotes and collect them together. If you rented any other equipment, like a video recording device or an internet router, you’ll have to disconnect that as well. If your DIRECTV shipping box doesn't arrive within five business days, call them back and request another one, making sure to tell them to reset the 21-day clock for your equipment. Otherwise, you may be charged a fee for the equipment."

During the cancellation process, you will be prompted to explore alternatives to cancelation, such as pausing your service or switching to a different package. If you choose to pause your service, take note of the restart date, as you will be charged on that date for your next month of the subscription.

If you are not in a contract, you can continue watching DIRECTV STREAM content until the last day of the billing cycle, and you will not be charged again. [9] X Research source You may restart your DIRECTV STREAM service at any time, and your current service will remain available until your next billing cycle. If you enter your request later than 7:00 PM EST, your request will be processed on the next business day.

This will ultimately depend on your billing cycle, how long you've had your service, and when you're slated to renew your contract. [10] X Research source If DIRECTV informs you of a rate hike, they may also allow you to cancel your service without a fee. These hikes often occur in December. Cancel at the end of your contract. If you cancel right before your contract is up, there either won't be a fee, or it will be really small. Most contracts are one or two years long, so pay attention when renewal time comes around. Conversely, if you cancel before your term of service (typically 12 to 24 months) has elapsed, you must pay a prorated cancellation fee. This fee may be as much as $480, depending on the type of programming package and equipment you have."

This is important, as representatives (and their supervisors) may have discretion when it comes to waiving your cancellation fee. Ask them how they are doing when they inquire the same of you. Tell them \"thank you\" when appropriate. Don't groan, complain, use profanity, or insult the representative."

The supervisor might have abilities that the initial representative did not. Inform the supervisor that you enjoy DIRECTV's service and that you may sign up with them again in the future. If they tell you they can't waive the fee, ask them to reduce it. Inform the supervisor that the contract was confusingly worded. You can also threaten to contact the Better Business Bureau or the Federal Communications Commission about DIRECTV's misrepresentation of its service contract. However, this should be your last move since it negates any courtesy up to this point."
