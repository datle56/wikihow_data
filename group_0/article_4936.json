      "content": "Decide on how long you want your railway to be. Your railway can be as long as you want it to be, but you'll need to know roughly how many blocks it will traverse so that you know how many rails to create. Try walking from point A of your planned railway to point B. This will help you plan out your route as well as make you aware of any obstacles in your way."

      "content": "Know the components of a railway. There are four main items that you'll use to create your railway: [1] X Research source Minecart - The \"train\" section of your railway. This is how you will move from point A to point B. Rails - Basic rails on which your minecart will travel. Powered Rails - Rails activated by redstone that will speed up your minecart (or keep it moving). Powered rails that don't have redstone powering them will slow (and eventually stop) your cart. Redstone Torches - The power source for each section of 14 powered rails. Not necessary for regular rails."

To create a railway system, you'll need the following items: [2] X Research source Iron ingots - For each 16 rails that you want to make, you'll need six iron ingots. You'll also need five iron ingots to make a minecart. You can make iron by smelting iron ore in a furnace . Sticks - For each 16 rails that you want to make, you'll need one stick. You'll also need one stick per lever and redstone torch. You can craft four sticks by adding two planks (one on top of the other) to the crafting table interface. Gold ingots - Used to create powered rails. You'll need six gold ingots for each stack of six powered rails that you want to make. You can make gold by smelting gold ore in a furnace. Redstone - Mine redstone blocks with an iron pickaxe (or better). Cobblestone - You'll need one cobblestone per lever."
