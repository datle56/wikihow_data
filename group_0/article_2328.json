      "content": "Avoidance-avoidance conflict is when you’re faced with 2 unpleasant choices. When there’s a conflict, you essentially have to choose between 2 things. In avoidance-avoidance conflict (AV-AV), both choices are undesirable, meaning that you have to choose between the lesser of 2 evils. This can make decision-making difficult and often leads to conflict avoidance or procrastination (with the hopes that a better outcome will come about). Take a look at these examples: Getting diagnosed with breast cancer and having to choose between 2 treatment options that don’t guarantee remission: chemotherapy or a double mastectomy. Disliking a job and choosing between quitting and being unemployed or staying and getting paid.

As psychologist Liana Georgoulis says, “By shifting your thinking towards thoughts that are more positive, you will positively influence your emotions.” See conflict as an opportunity to learn something new, share your feelings, and connect with someone."

      "content": "According to Kurt Lewin, there are 3 types of conflicts. German-American psychologist Kurt Lewin came to the conclusion that there are 3 main types of interpersonal conflicts: approach-approach conflict, avoidance-avoidance conflict, and approach-avoidance conflict. These conflicts occur within you when you’re handed 2 options. Approach-approach conflict (AP-AP) occurs when you’re given 2 desirable options that you like equally. Avoidance-avoidance conflict (AV-AV) happens when you have 2 options you despise equally. Approach-avoidance conflict (AP-AV) is when you can clearly see a positive and negative option."
