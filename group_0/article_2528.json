      "content": "Practice good hygiene. Staying fresh and clean gives you the building blocks to work toward your best self. Develop a routine that leaves you feeling squeaky clean and smelling great. Remember to always scrub areas such as elbows, necks and knees due to the bacteria you bring home each day. The bacteria will cause your elbows to turn darker if you have a pale skintone. Shower daily. Pick out a body soap that appeals to you and scrub down! Don't feel obligated to wash your hair every day (in fact, that could dry it out), but do wash up regularly, especially after workouts. Pick out a shampoo and conditioner for your hair type. Use a deep treatment every so often to increase your hair's natural shine. Brush your teeth (and tongue!) at least twice a day for 2 minutes. Make it a habit when you get up and right before going to bed. A whitening toothpaste will make your pearly whites glisten even more. [1] X Research source While you're at it, floss and use mouthwash! Not only are they good habits to have, but they reduce your chances of gum disease and tooth decay. [2] X Research source Use deodorant. [3] X Research source Throughout the day, our body releases oils and odors that don't always help us look our best. Using deodorant regularly prevents any unnecessary smells from creeping out of nooks and crannies. Don't douse yourself in perfume or cologne. A light spray is a good idea, but smelling you from across the street, even if you smell like a field of daisies, is overpowering and less than ideal. Keep in mind that some people can be sensitive to smells from perfumes and colognes. A great alternative is a mildly-scented lotion. Reader Poll: We asked 160 wikiHow readers if they use conditioner every time they wash their hair, and 63% of them said yes. [Take Poll] Everyoneâ€™s hair is different, so find a wash routine that works best for your needs."

That means our skin is receiving the most nutrients it receives at night, preparing it to look healthier and glow. [5] X Research source Sleep and metabolism are controlled by the same areas of the brain. Studies have shown that participants who get more sleep lose more fat than their counterparts, who lose more muscle. Sleep allows our brains time to consolidate memories. Not only does a healthy amount of sleep make for easier recall, but the same restructuring of memories spurs the creative process. Our attention is sharpened, making it easier to focus (and get better grades!). Sleeping around 8 hours a night spurs athleticism, too. Athletes who slept around 10 hours a night experienced less daytime fatigue and faster running times."

Instead, develop your own style and set them yourself. Your money will last longer and you'll be happier being yourself. Wear clothes that fit and are appropriate.
