      "content": "Improve your posture . Having good posture is an important part of being classy. Make sure to keep your back straight, whether you're sitting down or standing up, and to avoid slouching at all costs. Slouching is a sign of laziness and bad manners, so make sure you keep your spine straight and your head up as much as you can. When sitting, don't cross one leg on the other. Instead, cross them at the feet and not behind the chair. [1] X Research source Try doing this when you're by yourself, too, so you get used to doing it in front of others."

This does not have to cost very much. Keep your clothes in good repair. Anything ripped, or revealing could potentially be seen as inappropriate although this depends on the event or the look you are going for. It is more important that the clothes fit you well, are wrinkle-free, appropriate for the occasion, and cover all the essential bits. [5] X Research source This means not wearing anything too short (short skirts or shorts), too translucent, or anything that exposes your belly. If you really wish to wear something a little revealing (deep neck, bare shoulders, or a high cut on the skirt), reveal one thing only. For example, an evening top with a low neck should be accompanied with a long skirt/trousers and have proper sleeves that cover the shoulders. Remember that, when in doubt, it's better to be a little bit overdressed than a little bit underdressed. If you're in doubt about what to wear to an occasion, it's better to look a little nicer than the other guests than to look like you didn't put as much time into your looks as the others."

A firm grasp on etiquette is also helpful if you get nervous in social situations, because you'll always know how you're supposed to act. Learn dinner etiquette, party etiquette, workplace etiquette, and dating etiquette to become more ladylike. Remember that it is really poor etiquette to comment on or make a fuss about other people's lack of etiquette or manners. Unless the situation really warrants it (their behavior may cause harm to themselves or others, or is on the way far side of moral and acceptable behaviour), graciously overlook their gaffes and shortcomings. Try to keep your hands out of your pockets while chatting with new people. Also, put lotion on your hands after you wash them so they won't be dry or rough.
