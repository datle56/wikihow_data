      "content": "Drain the water out of the swamp cooler. Open the drain plug if the swamp cooler has one. Allow the water to drain out. If there is no plug, siphon the water out with a hose . If you have a portable swamp cooler, make sure you drain the water outside and not inside your house. For window-mounted swamp coolers, you can leave it mounted in the window and let it drain outside the window. You may also choose to unmount it for maintenance and then put it back in the window."

      "title": "Brush out the inside of the swamp cooler.",
      "content": "Brush out the inside of the swamp cooler. Use a stiff brush or broom to sweep the inside of the swamp cooler. After you brush the debris and dirt loose, use a small vacuum that can be used on wet and dry surfaces to vacuum up the dirt. Debris can get inside the water pan. This can cause blockages that stop up the cooler, and may lead to unclean water cycling through it."

      "content": "Check the mechanical parts. While you have the swamp cooler apart, use a few drops of lubricating oil on the motor and fan. Use a few drops to lubricate the parts. You should also check the fan belt. Make sure there is tension and it is not sagging. The fan belt should only move about half an inch."

      "title": "Install fresh fiber pads.",
      "content": "Install fresh fiber pads. Cut new fiber pads from the padding roll using shears. Use the old fiber pads you pulled out at the beginning to cut the shape of the new pads. Install the pads in the same places you removed them."

      "content": "Check the pads every few months. Cooling pads may only need to be changed twice each year, once at the beginning of the season and once in the middle of the season. However, pads may wear out faster. If you swamp cooler smells bad, or if the local water quality is lower, you may need to replace the pads more often. Check the pads every few months to look for cracks and overall poor condition."

      "content": "Keep the tank off when not in use. During the colder months, you probably will not use the swamp cooler. Make sure when the cooler is not in use that you shut down the entire system. Turn off the cooler and unplug it. Cut off the water supply and then drain all the water. Store the swamp cooler in a cool, dry area in the original carton."
