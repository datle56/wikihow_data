      "content": "Put on a thin base of primer. Basic daytime makeup can be as simple and easy as applying a little foundation, concealer, and blush, or it can be as complicated as doing your eyes, lips, and brows as well. Primer isn't strictly necessary, but it will help make your cosmetics last longer if you plan to wear more than just basic daytime makeup.

Foundation will help even out your skin tone, create a smooth surface, and cover discoloration, and because it serves such a similar purpose to primer, the primer isn't always necessary.
