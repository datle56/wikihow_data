      "content": "Get a DJ controller (optional). While you can mix and blend songs using a computer alone, a DJ controller offers a tactile interface that includes a 2 to 4 channel mixer, volume knobs, EQ, a cross-fader, audio effects, and two simulated turntables called “jog wheels” that give you more control, especially in a live environment. [1] X Research source DJ controllers range in price from basic units that you can purchase for under $100 to high-end, expensive units that cost more than $1000. The average DJ controller costs between $200 and $400. When you get more experienced as a DJ, you may want to invest in a DJ Mixer. Unlike a DJ controller, a mixer does not require any computer software. You can use CDs for vinyl, and you get better quality sound. Most DJ controllers come with free software that works with the controller out of the box. For example, basic-tier Pioneer DJ controllers come with Serato Lite."

Radio mixes tend to be shorter with less consistent intros and outros. DJ mixes have longer intros and outros specifically made for mixing. [2] X Research source You can purchase DJ mixes from websites like Beatport , Traxsource , and Beatsource . You can also purchase a wide variety of mainstream music from iTunes and Apple Music."

Most DJ software applications have a browser that contains all the songs you have downloaded. Make sure you place all the songs you have downloaded into your browser folder. Most programs allow you to organize your tracks by genre, tempo, key, or other key features. You may want to create a playlist of the songs you want to DJ before a session."

      "content": "Pick two songs you think will blend well together. According to Linetsky, both songs should have similar tempo or BPM (beats per minute). If both songs are in the same key or a similar key, that is also a plus. Both songs should have relatively empty sections (such as an intro, outro, or breakdown) where you can mix the songs together.

      "content": "Listen to the songs individually. Familiarize yourself with the tempo and musicality of the songs you are trying to blend. Make a note of any specific parts of the song that you want to stand out. Pay attention to the intros, outros, and breakdowns to listen for sections you may want to loop and when you want to transition. Most DJ programs have a Deck A and a Deck B that mirror each other on the left and right sides. Both decks have a jog wheel and controls that are used to control the individual tracks. You can load a song into a deck by dragging and dropping it from your browser or playlist into the dock. Then, click the play button on the deck to play it."

      "content": "Switch between the two songs. In a good musical blend, the sound flows from one song to the next. Try to alternate starting and stopping the two songs to hear how they sound one after the other. Most DJ programs have a crossfader bar on the console between the two decks. This is what you use to switch from one deck to another. Slide the bar all the way to the left to listen to Deck A. Slide the bar all the way to the right to listen to Deck B."

      "title": "Listen to both songs together.",
      "content": "Listen to both songs together. You can use the crossfader bar to switch between decks. Place the cross-fader in the middle to listen to both decks at the same time. Listen to the sound of the songs together to make sure the songs mesh well. Consider the key of each song to make sure they are harmonized. If the key is different, make sure the songs don’t clash or sound dissonant. Listen for complimentary parts where both songs can be played together. This will often be the intros and the outros of the song. However, there may be breakdowns in the middle that can be sampled and mixed with another song. Some DJ programs, like Serato Pro, offer separate stems from songs. These are the isolated vocal, drum, or instrumental tracks. This gives you flexibility when blending parts of a song or the beats. You can even create mashups (i.e., placing the vocal track from one song over the instrumental section of another song. You can purchase stems from stores that sell DJ mixes, or use a stem extractor program that uses AI to separate the stems from songs. However, the quality of AI stem separators may not be as good."

      "content": "Match the tempos if needed. If the second song is slightly faster than the other, you will need to use the tempo slider bar to slow down or speed up the song. You can match the tempo in one of three ways. The first is by listening to both songs at the same time and using your ears to gauge the tempo. You can also use your eyes to gauge the tempo. Most DJ programs show you both audio tracks at the top of the screen. You may be able to see the drum beats in the save file and adjust them by sight. If you are new to DJing, start with songs that are the same tempo so that you can focus on beat matching rather than adjusting the tempo. According to Linetsky, if you don’t know the exact tempo of each song, you can use your ears to guess the tempo, or turn on the metronome on your DJ software and match the tempo with the metronome. Some audio software can figure out the tempo for you automatically. [4] X Expert Source Timothy Linetsky Music Producer & Instructor Expert Interview. 13 February 2019."

      "content": "Listen to the first song and count along to the beat. You can play the first song in either deck. Make sure the crossfader is set to the deck where the song is playing. Count along to the beat as the song plays. The beat is what you tap your foot to as a song plays. Most songs are in a 4/4 time signature. This means that the song has a count of 1 -2-3-4, 1 -2-3-4 with an emphasis on the first beat (or downbeat , as Linetsky says). [5] X Expert Source Timothy Linetsky Music Producer & Instructor Expert Interview. 13 February 2019. Each count of four is called a “bar.” Linetsky explains that there is usually a kick drum on the downbeat. The goal is to align the kick and snare drums for both songs.

You can fine-tune this using the jog wheels. [7] X Research source Use the sides of the jog wheels to temporarily speed up or slow down a song. Rotate the side of the jog wheel counter-clockwise to slow down the song. Rotate it clockwise to speed up the song. Rotate the jog wheel one and see if the beats are more or less in sync. If they are less in sync, rotate the side of the jog wheel in the opposite direction. Continue to do so until the beats match perfectly."

[8] X Research source Depending on the song, this may be a slow transition or a quick transition. If the songs have long intros and outros, you may be able to use a slow and smooth transition. If the second song has a quick intro, you’ll want to use a quick transition. Make sure you complete the transition before the verse of the second song starts. If you need to prolong the beat, you can do so by looping the track."
