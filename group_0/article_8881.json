      "content": "Find a surface to color on. If you are using a loose leaf coloring page you will need to find a hard surface to work on, while coloring books allow you more flexibility. When using on loose sheets of paper, you may want to cover your work surface in newspaper depending on the coloring utensils you’ve chosen (markers may bleed through your paper and leave behind marks). When using coloring books, you can use your lap as a coloring surface if you’d like to draw while in bed on the couch, for example. You may still find it easier to have a more flat and solid surface to work on, though."

For example, you might want to only use cool colors (blues, purples, and dark greens) or only use warm colors (reds, oranges, yellows, and light greens). Or, you might prefer to use all of the colors of the rainbow in your picture. Regardless of the colors you choose, having a rough idea of how you’d like your completed piece to look can help you create a picture you’re satisfied with."

If you think your utensils could smudge, either color the center of your picture first and work your way outwards, or to start at the top of your page and work your way down. If you are not concerned about smudging, you can begin coloring wherever you’d like."

Simply vary the amount of pressure that you are apply with your coloring utensil depending on how light or dark you’d like a given area to be. Pressure shading is easiest to do with pencil. While shading is completely optional, creating depth or shadows in your picture can make it appear more realistic and detailed."

      "content": "Blend colors and shades to create dimension. Another way to add depth is to blend different shades or colors together to achieve different values. Example: if you want to create the appearance of shadow, try using a deeper blue (or red, or yellow, etc.) to create darker areas and a lighter blue for highlighted areas. This method can work with pencils, pens and markers."

Crosshatching is done by drawing overlapping sets of lines at right angles (this pattern should look mesh-like). For darker areas, draw these lines closer together. To create highlights, leave more space between each line, or don’t draw any lines at all."
