[1] X Research source If your Swiffer is pre-assembled, you may need to pull the handle to extend the pole. Listen for a click. Once the pole is extended, it is permanently extended."

      "content": "Insert batteries. Your Swiffer will generally require four AA batteries. To remove the battery panel, click the notch inside the area that holds the cleaning supply. Open the cover and insert the batteries. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Insert cleaner.",
      "content": "Insert cleaner. Your Swiffer should come with liquid cleaning supply. To insert the liquid, turn the Swiffer upside down. The flat side of the cleaner should fit flush against the pole of the Swiffer. Once the cleaning bottle is aligned, firmly press it up into the Swiffer holder. You should hear a click once the liquid is inserted correctly. [3] X Research source Older models may need the lid of the cleaning solution to be turned slightly. In current models, there is a seal that will be broken by the Swiffer. If you suspect you have an older bottle, try turning the lid a quarter turn."

    {
      "title": "Put on a cleaning pad.",
      "content": "Put on a cleaning pad. While looking at the cleaning pad you will see two strips of paper. These will need to be removed to allow the sticky adhesive to seal onto the Swiffer itself. Once removed, line the adhesive up with the bottom of your Swiffer. Put the Swiffer down onto the pad and hold for three seconds and the pad should automatically stick on. Swiffer pads have an extra-tough-spot cleaning strip that is textured. It can be found on one side of the mopping pad. When applying the pad to the Swiffer, put the tough-side at the back end of the mop. Swiffer pads come in many styles with different cleaning products. If you don’t like the initial choice, don’t be afraid to go back and exchange your Swiffer for a new style."

Gently press the button on the handle to release the cleaning liquid. Mop the Swiffer back and forth to clean the liquid.
