      "content": "Carefully pinch off the skins. Grip each almond between your thumb and index finger and pinch. The almond should slide right out of its skin. You can prevent the almond from flying across the room by using your opposite hand to form a shield and catch the slippery little almond! Sometimes the skin won't come off so easily and you'll have to you your thumbnail to scrape off any remaining skin."

      "title": "Leave to dry.",
      "content": "Leave to dry. Depending on the recipe you're using, you may need to leave the blanched almonds to dry. If this is the case, simply lay them on a baking sheet for a few days, shaking the pan to turn them occasionally. Avoid drying the almonds in the oven, as this will end up roasting the nuts, which is not what you want."
