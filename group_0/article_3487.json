      "title": "Earn good grades in high school.",
      "content": "Earn good grades in high school. If you know as early as your high school years that surveying is the profession you wish to enter, you should work hard to earn good grades. You will likely need a college degree, so doing well in school will help you gain access to the college or university of your choice. You should begin to focus on math and science courses, as these will be most directly related to your future work. A strong background in reading, writing and analysis will also be helpful."

      "content": "Earn a degree from a reputable college or university. To get a job as a surveyor, you will need a college degree. In some cases, you may be able to get what you need with a two-year associate’s degree, although a four-year bachelor’s degree would be preferred when looking for work. A good program is one that will include in-depth study in advanced math, technical drafting, writing, physics, and technically advanced computer program use. The guidance counselor at your high school should be able to help you research colleges and universities that have strong programs that can lead to a career as a surveyor. If you are already out of high school, you may try calling the guidance office of the high school in your area to see if they could help you anyway. You might also check with the reference librarian at your public library or at an area college library. For licensing purposes, some states require that your degree come from a school or program that is accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). Before you apply to any school, you should ask an admissions officer if they have this accreditation."

      "title": "Select a field of study.",
      "content": "Select a field of study. The general category of surveying involves many smaller categories, which you may wish to choose as a specialty for your studies in college. You will want to research these topics before enrolling in a college or university program, so you can best tailor your studies. Some of the topics related to surveying include: Geomatics. This is a fairly new science that includes the collection, interpretation and reporting of geographical data. Geodesy is the science of geographical measurement and representation. It measures such things as the gravitational fields of the earth, tectonic plate movements, polar ice shifts, and tidal phenomena. Photogrammetry is the science of acquiring geographical data from photographs and photo images. This field includes studies in aerial photogrammetry and close-range photogrammetry. Land management is the study of the way land is used, to best take advantage of its geological structures."

      "title": "Participate in a quality internship.",
      "content": "Participate in a quality internship. Many university programs will help you get involved in an internship as part of your program while you are attending classes. An internship is a placement with an actual surveyor, so you can learn real, on-the-job techniques and business practices, in addition to your classroom education. If you do well in your internship, it can also lead to full-time employment beyond your college degree. Many states may require that you spend time in an internship under a licensed surveyor before you are even eligible to sit for the licensing exam."
