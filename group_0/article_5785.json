If you haven’t used your state’s online EBT portal before, visit the USDA directory at https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/state-directory . Click on your state and click the website link that pops up. [2] X Research source If you just want to get this done quickly, call the number that pops up alongside the website URL. It’s faster to do this over the phone than online. Some states do not allow you to cancel your benefits online. Some require you to call, while others require you to mail a form to their office. There’s no way to know without going to your state’s portal, though."

Every state’s website is different, but if you’re able to cancel your benefits online, there should be an option to do so in your account profile. If you can’t find this option anywhere, go to the portal’s frequently asked questions page. This is a very common process, and there should be information on how to cancel your benefits on this page. [5] X Research source Some states require you to explain why you want to cancel your benefits. Others don’t ask. If you are asked to provide a reason, don’t worry about going into specific detail if you’re uncomfortable doing so. States normally just request this information for data-collection reasons."
