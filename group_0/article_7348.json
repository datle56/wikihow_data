      "content": "Choose snacks that are high in protein. Protein is an essential part of a healthy diet.

Try low-fat or non-fat greek yogurt with granola and fruit, hard-boiled eggs, Justin’s peanut butter packets, cheese sticks, edamame, or whole-grain protein bars. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid drinking your calories.",
      "content": "Avoid drinking your calories. Soda, juice, and smoothies are chock full of sugar. Limit or exclude soda completely. Make or buy all-natural juice that has no added sugar.

      "content": "Be prepared to spend more money. The unfortunate truth is that organic, sugar-free, and low-fat items are generally more expensive.

      "content": "Read and compare the labels. If you want a packaged snack, make sure to read the ingredients on the label. A label that claims it has all-natural ingredients does not always mean it is a healthy choice. A common example is all-natural fruit juice, which is actually high in sugar. [11] X Research source"
