      "content": "Know your height and size measurements. Depending on what kind of modeling you plan on doing, i.e., print, runway, fit modeling, the ideal height and size measurements will vary. For print modeling, models are usually 5’8” and up, and are sizes 12 to 18. For high fashion or runway modeling, models are usually 5’9” and up, and sizes 10 to 20/22. For fit modeling, models are usually 5’5” to 5’9” and size 18. And for commercial modeling, models can be any height, and are sizes 12 to 18. Although these height and size measurements may seem rigid, there are always exceptions. If you don’t fit these criteria, commercial modeling, fit modeling, parts modeling, and modeling for local and specialty boutiques are good alternatives. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Take care of your body. Models need to have healthy skin, hair, teeth, and nails. Plus sized models’ bodies also need to be toned and in shape. Take care of your body by drinking plenty of water, getting regular exercise, and eating healthy. It is recommended that you drink eight 8 oz. glasses of water per day, i.e. 2 liters (0.53 US gal) or half a gallon. It is recommended that you get either 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week. Examples of moderate exercise are brisk walking and swimming. Examples of vigorous exercise are running. Or, aim for a combination of both moderate and vigorous exercise.

      "content": "Be body confident. Having confidence is crucial to being a successful plus size model. You need to know your body shape, and you need to be comfortable with your body and its size. If you are uncomfortable with your appearance, it will show, and becoming a plus size model will be much more difficult. Be body confident by practicing positive self-talk. Remove negative self-talk, such as “I am fat” or “I am not good enough” with positive self-talk, such as “I love my body,” “My body can do amazing things,” or “I love my curves.” [3] X Research source Focus on the things that you love about yourself. Pick a body part; it could be your hands, breasts, thighs, or even your freckles. Then, talk out loud about that body part in a complementary way, such as \"I love my thighs in these jeans.\" You can also focus on what your body parts allow you to accomplish versus how they look. For example, instead of talking about how bad or good your legs look, be grateful that your legs allow you to walk, exercise, dance, and can take you from place to place."

      "title": "Do your research.",
      "content": "Do your research. Find out what agencies there are that contract plus size models. Not all agencies do, but it is becoming more commonplace for agencies to have plus size model divisions. For example, modeling agencies Ford and Wilhelmina have plus size modeling divisions. Additionally, look into the plus size models they have already contracted and make a log of their statistics, i.e., height and measurements, in order to see if the agency is right for you. It doesn’t hurt to study and learn about the top models, photographers, and stylists in the industry. For example, learn about the world’s first plus size model, Melissa Aronson. By having this knowledge, you will have a clearer picture of what the industry looks like. This also shows the agencies that you are serious about modeling and that it is something you have taken the time to look into. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid scams. Always make sure that the agencies you are looking into are reputable agencies. Visit the websites of top agencies to get a feel for what a reputable agency is like. If someone wants a payment upfront in order to see you, this is a red flag, and most likely a scam agency. Never pay a manager or agent to be a part of a \"Lookbook\" or to find work for you. Agencies that are legitimate work on commission and receive their commission only after they have booked a job for you. Beware of talent promoters and internet agencies online who say they will promote you or list you on their website for free or for money."

      "content": "Develop a quality modeling portfolio . As an aspiring plus size model, photos are your resume. Be sure to get some quality testing photos. Testing is when a model has a photographer take photos for their portfolio. It is also recommended that you have a professional make-up artist and hair stylist for the photo shoot. [5] X Research source Depending on the photographer, it will cost around $200 to $500 dollars to develop a quality modeling portfolio. You need to have two main photos: a headshot and a body shot. A headshot is photo of your shoulders and your head. You can have bare shoulders in the shot, or you can wear a simple tank top, lightweight cardigan, or button down shirt. [6] X Research source A body shot is a full-length shot that shows your figure. You should wear clothes that accentuate your figure, as well as your hair and skin tone. Your policy on deciding what to wear in these shots is simplicity. Your outfit should be simple, i.e., one solid color and no logos. You hair and make-up should also be very simple and natural.

      "title": "Practice.",
      "content": "Practice. Before going to an open call or taking photos for your portfolio, you need to practice. In order to practice, you need to know your body shape and how to move. You need to find out what your good sides are, your good angles, and the shapes that accentuate your body. Your mirror and lighting are your best friend here. Stand in front of the mirror to learn how your body shapes so you can perfect your poses. Play with different forms of lighting, i.e., bright, dim, incandescent, and color, in order to see which lighting brings out your skin tone. Also, play with angles, i.e., above, below, front, to the side, in order to see which angle accentuates your facial features. [8] X Research source Remember to always hold your limbs slightly away from your body in order to create a separation. This will create the illusion that your limbs are slim and toned. [9] X Research source Remember to elongate your neck, angle your jaw toward the camera, and learn how far you can turn your head before your nose \"breaks\" your cheeks. Practice these poses in front of the mirror regularly until they feel natural."

      "content": "Attend an open call. Find out if the agency has open calls or castings and attend one! Additionally find out what the specific requirements are for that agency, i.e., what you need to bring and what you need to wear. For example, wear your best outfit. It could be simple jeans and a tank top or a simple dress. Try to avoid anything too loud. The agency might ask you to bring two or three of your best outfits. They also might ask you to bring various copies of photos. Never give them your original photos however, because you usually do not get the submitted photos back."

      "title": "Contact the agency through e-mail.",
      "content": "Contact the agency through e-mail. If the agency does not have an open casting, then you will most likely submit your portfolio online or through email. You usually only need to submit a couple pictures, your measurements, and how you can be contacted. Remember to include your name, height, weight, bust, hips, and waist size, age, hair color, eye color, and contact information (phone number, e-mail, and address) on the back of your photos."

      "title": "Network.",
      "content": "Network. If you are really serious about becoming a plus size model, networking is a key asset. Try to attend recruiting events or conferences where top agencies will be attending. You can introduce yourself to their representatives and get a feel for the agency. Networking will also enable you to meet other plus size models. If you are able to establish connections with other models, then you can possibly establish connections with other agencies, and get insider tips on how to succeed in the industry. Always be professional when you speak with an agency or its representative. Introduce yourself and tell them a little bit about yourself, for example \"Hello, my name is Jennifer Owens. I have been in the modeling industry for a year already, but I would like to take my vision in a different direction. Your agency seems to fit my profile. Can I leave my information and photos with you?\" Or, \"Hello, my name is Jennifer Owens. I have heard great things about your agency (you could possibly name some photographers and stylists the agency works with here), and I would love to have the chance to work with this agency. Can I leave my information and portfolio with you?\""
