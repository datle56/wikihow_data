Downloaded Program Files are the program installers you've downloaded from the internet. These are usually not needed after you've installed the file unless you plan to install it again. Temporary Internet Files are the cached files from browsing with Internet Explorer. Windows error reports are log files that contain errors that occur as you use your PC. DirectX Shader Cache are cached graphics used to make images on your PC load faster. They aren't required for operation and are safe to delete. Delivery Optimization files are previously downloaded files used for installing updates on your network and are safe to delete. Recycle Bin is a folder that contains the files you've deleted. You should only select this option if you are sure you won't need to restore files from your Recycle Bin later. Temporary files are simply temporary files created by various apps on your computer. They are not meant to be permanent, so don't worry about losing anything by deleting them. Thumbnails are cached images of pictures and videos on your computer that appear when you browse for files. Deleting them is fine; they'll be automatically created again when necessary. Microsoft Defender Antivirus are noncritical files used by Windows' built-in antivirus protection and can safely be deleted. Windows Update Cleanup files can take up a significant amount of space and are only used to install Windows Updates. Windows will automatically download the latest update files in the future, so you probably won't need to keep these older ones unless instructed by an admin. Device driver packages, Language Resource Files , and Temporary Windows installation files are all meant to be temporary and can be deleted without issue."
