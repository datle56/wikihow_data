      "content": "Choose your retailer. Almost every major gas station offers gift cards. To decide which station’s card you want to buy, ensure that the person you’re buying the card for has a gas station of the corresponding card nearby. For instance, if you buy the card for your son who moved away, you might not know what gas stations he has nearby. Use an online map system like MapQuest to look up gas stations near him. If you aren’t trying to make a big surprise of the gas gift card, you could just ask the person you’re buying the card for what gas station they usually go to. The major players such as Exxon and Shell are great choices as are 7-11, QuikTrip and RaceTrac convenience stores. Just check to be sure they are in the right area. All gas stations are basically the same. The only “wrong” choice is buying a card for a gas station that is inaccessible to the person you’re buying the card for. A child headed to college will be using one of the stations around their college. Know which gas station they prefer when choosing what card to buy."

      "content": "Look for a retailer that offers perks. Some gas stations offer special savings when you use a gift card. For example, Walmart offers a savings of $0.03 per gallon off the price of gas per gallon when you use their gift card at the gas pump. Look for similar deals that give you a little extra mileage for your money when deciding which card to buy."

      "content": "Think of the right occasion. [1] X Research source Gas cards are good for certain situations where you’re obligated to give a gift but don’t know someone well. For instance, if you have a gift exchange at your workplace, or want to distribute a little something extra to a departing employee, student, or client. Of course, giving a gas gift card isn’t limited to these situations. Since gas gift cards are useful for anyone who drives, you could also give a gas gift card to a friend or close family member. Family members who are making a long drive to visit you might appreciate a gas card as a going-away gift. Gas gift cards make great stocking stuffers. You could tuck a gas gift card inside a birthday card."

      "title": "Choose the amount.",
      "content": "Choose the amount. Gas gift cards usually come in predetermined amounts. Multiples of $5 and $10 are common. For instance, you might find gas gift cards available in amounts like $25, $50, $75, and so on. Decide how much you want to spend on gas gift cards before making your purchase. If you are unable to find the exact amount you want, buy more than one gas gift card. For instance, if you want to give your friend $35 in gas gift cards, you might need to buy a $10 and a $25 gas gift card. It’s usually better to buy a card with a value of at least $25. Not only is a full tank of gas rarely less than $25, but values of less than that often require a surcharge of $0.25 or $0.50. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Buy the cards at a gas station.",
      "content": "Buy the cards at a gas station. The easiest and most direct place to buy the gas gift card is at the gas station. Buying the card this way ensures that the gift card for that station will be available (unless they’re sold out), and you won’t have to go out of your way to hunt it down at a big-box retailer or other store."

      "title": "Buy the cards online.",
      "content": "Buy the cards online. Another convenient way to buy your gas gift cards is online. Most major gas stations offer online gift card purchases. Additionally, you can often find discounted gift cards online at sites like Gift Card Granny. [3] X Research source These sites offer, for instance, a $100 gift card for $99 or less. Look for good deals online and buy your card there to save."

      "title": "Buy the cards at a store.",
      "content": "Buy the cards at a store. Many big-box retailers and grocery stores offer gas cards for sale. If you’re shopping at a store that sells gas gift cards and you want or need one, choosing to buy one at one of these stores can be convenient. Be sure you know what gas station the person you’re buying the card for patronizes before making your purchase. Sometimes you can “buy” a gas gift card by spending a certain amount of money at a given store. For instance, sometimes grocery stores offer free gift cards in $10 amounts if you purchase $50 worth of groceries. If you’re going to buy groceries anyway, you might as well get the gift card along with everything else. Buy canned goods that won’t spoil if you’re having trouble hitting the minimum purchase price. Check to see if there is an extra charge on top of the cost of the actual money you’re putting on the card. Usually, there isn’t unless the card is of a low (less than $25) value. If there is, shop elsewhere for the gas gift card so you don’t have to pay the extra fee."

      "title": "Order by phone.",
      "content": "Order by phone. Most gas stations offer a phone number you can call to order a gift card. The number is usually listed online through the gas station’s website. You might be able to obtain the phone number from employees at your local branch of the gas station, too. If you want to buy your card from home but don’t feel comfortable making a purchase online, this is probably the way to go."

      "title": "Review the rules of gas gift cards.",
      "content": "Review the rules of gas gift cards. Different gas stations have different rules regarding when and where you have to use the card. For instance, some cards have an expiration date. Others are tied to only one geographic area. Certain cards charge a small monthly fee, deducted from the card’s total balance, for each month the card goes unused. The Conoco, 76, ExxonMobil, Choice, Phillips 66, Sunoco, Chevron and Texaco gas gift cards do not have expiration dates or non-use fees. Familiarize yourself with the fine print of your gas gift card to use it effectively. Details (terms and conditions) are usually on the back or obtainable by visiting the gas station’s website."

      "content": "Check your balance. You don’t want to go to gas up and realize that you don’t have enough money left on your card. You can usually see your balance at the bottom of your receipt after gassing up. You can often check your balance by looking up your card number on the gas station’s website, or by calling the number on the back of the card. Use this function to track your remaining balance.
