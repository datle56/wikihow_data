[2] X Research source Alternately, dampen a sponge with some lemon juice directly, then use it to wipe the tile down. Rinse the tile off with a sponge or cloth dipped in warm water. If you wish, you could sprinkle your bathroom tile with a thin coat of baking soda before spraying it with lemon juice or wiping it down with a lemon juice-soaked sponge."

While the exact technique for applying the car wax varies with the specific wax you've chosen to utilize, you can generally dab a clean cloth in the tub of wax, then rub it in a thin layer across the bathroom tiles after cleaning. After applying the wax to bathroom floor tile, buff it down to prevent the bathroom tile from being too slippery."
