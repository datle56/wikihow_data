With the Programmable Search Engine, you can specify what websites can be searched by the engine. One of the biggest reasons people create custom search engines is to search a particular site, such as their own. However, you don't have to use the Programmable Search Engine on your own site. If you do want to add your search engine to your website, however, we cover that below ."

If you only want to show search results from the region you selected, toggle on Region restricted results . Sites to exclude: If there are sites you never want to be searched with your search engine, add them here the same way you added sites to search when creating the search engine. Upload/download XML files: If the control panel doesn't give you enough flexibility to customize your search engine, download the XML files, edit them, and upload them to change your CSE. You must know XML to edit these files. Look and Feel: Click All Look and Feel settings to change your search engine's layout, theme, fonts, colors, and more. Members: Add owners and administrators who can access your search engine's settings. Ads: Remove ads with an API key. You must either pay for this (click \"Programmable Search Engine Paid API\" in the control panel) or get a free ad-free search engine if you're a qualifying organization.

If you want to build your own search engine because you have concerns about Google and its privacy, safety, or censorship, you should try a different search engine first. Even though Google is the ubiquitous search engine, there are many other search engines to try: DuckDuckGo is a search engine that focuses on privacy. DuckDuckGo claims not to track you and is one of the most well-known \"alternative\" search engines. Most of DuckDuckGo's search results are sourced from Bing's index. StartPage is another privacy-focused browser that claims not to track users, nor does it keep a search history. Most of StartPage's search results are sourced from Google's index. Brave is yet another private search engine, though they do collect private user metrics to track the search engine's activity and performance. Unlike DuckDuckGo and StartPage, Brave has its own search index—but will fall back against Google or Bing if needed. Brave also has its own browser, if you want to use that instead of a traditional browser like Edge, Chrome, Firefox, etc."
