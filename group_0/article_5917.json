      "content": "Plant Flaming Katy in a pot with well-draining soil. Plant your Flaming Katy in a pot of well-draining, loamy or sandy soil as soon as possible after you purchase it. In general, it’s best to use a special succulent or cactus soil tailored to meet the needs of water-retaining plants. Make sure the pot has a drainage hole, as well, as Flaming Katy doesn’t do well in wet conditions. [1] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source If you’re planting your Flaming Katy outdoors, a loamy or sandy soil is best. Indoor plants do better with a well-draining porous blend, like a 50% potting soil and 50% cactus mix, or 60% potting soil and 40% perlite . If you plan on keeping your Flaming Katy outside, make sure you live in a suitable USDA zone. Flaming Katy can usually thrive outdoors year round in zones 10-12, but will need to be kept indoors throughout the winter in colder climates."

      "content": "Place Flaming Katy in bright, indirect sunlight for 6-8 hours per day. Direct sunlight can burn Flaming Katy’s leaves, so it's best to plant it in indirect sunlight. Place indoor Flaming Katy plants in an area with bright but indirect sunlight (usually an east or west-facing window), and plant outdoor plants in an area with partial shade where it won’t be exposed to direct midday sun. In general, the plant needs 6-8 of light per day. [2] X Research source Corelitz says to keep your plant no more than “three feet from a window.”"

      "title": "Water Flaming Katy only every few weeks.",
      "content": "Water Flaming Katy only every few weeks. Flaming Katy is a succulent, so it does not tolerate a lot of water. [3] X Research source Watering too much or too frequently can lead to root rot, so make sure the top 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) of soil is dry to the touch before watering. Typically, you’ll only need to water once every few weeks. Even if you keep Flaming Katy outdoors, it’s best to plant it in a pot rather than directly in the ground. This way, you can move it if you’re expecting a lot of rain. Corelitz says, “For indoor plants, I generally suggest watering succulents from the bottom—like filling a baking tray full of water, setting the pot in it and allowing the water to soak up till it's moist at the top. That assures that all of the roots are getting saturated without getting the actual leaves wet.” Baur adds that keeping pots on drainage trays is “really important for protecting your home while keeping the roots with the right amount of water that they need.”"

[10] X Research source Bauer says, “Mealy bugs look like white little puffs of cotton. They'll gather at the crevices of plants, in places where they can most easily burrow. They bite into the plant and slowly drain the sap.” Bauer adds that spider mites “will make webs around parts of the plant and basically eat away at those leaves.”"
