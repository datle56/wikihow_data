      "content": "Talk to your guidance counselor. The minute you start thinking about changing classes, head to your guidance counselor’s office. Not every class can be changed because of high school graduation requirements or policies. Your guidance counselor will know what you can and can’t do and help guide you toward the best solution. Consider asking your counselor some of these questions: What classes are required for me to graduate? [1] X Research source What do I have to do to switch classes? Are there any other classes that fit my schedule and school requirements? Is there another class I can take that’ll challenge me?

Talk to friends when you get your schedule to get an idea about the class’s difficulty level and teacher’s teaching style. Check your class schedule and transcript to see if your classes match your school’s requirements."
