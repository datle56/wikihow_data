If the detergent compartment fills up before using all the vinegar, pour the rest into the pre-wash or fabric softener compartment. If you want to leave a more pleasant smell inside the front load washer, add about 10 drops of lavender essential oil to the vinegar before pouring it in."

As an alternative to vinegar and baking soda, toss a washing machine cleaning tablet into the drum before the cycle to break down residue. If your washer has a cleaning cycle, the owner's manual may list specific instructions about when to add the vinegar and baking soda. Be sure to read through the manual so you clean your machine properly."

If your machine is very smelly or if you see large mildew stains, load 2 cups (470 ml) of bleach into the dispenser drawer’s bleach compartment. Run the hottest wash and rinse cycle available on your machine. If it’s possible, pause the cycle after the machine fills with water and let it sit for 30 minutes. Let the cycle finish, and run one more hot rinse cycle to get rid of any residual bleach or mildew. [3] X Research source Avoid combining bleach with vinegar since it could create toxic chlorine gas. [4] X Research source If you already used vinegar, run an additional rinse cycle before adding bleach."

      "content": "Remove any foreign objects or debris stuck in the gasket. Open the door to your washing front-loading washing machine and locate the ring-shaped rubber gasket that runs along the edges of the opening. Peel apart the rubber flaps to check for any objects that got stuck between them. Common objects you may find include loose hairs, bobby pins, coins, paper clips, and even socks. Scoop the items out and dispose of them properly so they don’t damage the gasket or washing machine during the next cycle. [5] X Research source While you’re sorting your laundry , check and empty the pockets on your clothes so it’s less likely for items to get stuck in the gasket. Put on a pair of rubber gloves if you don’t want to touch any residue or mildew with your bare hands. Avoid pulling the gasket apart with a lot of force so you don’t accidentally damage the seal."

Spray the cleaning solution directly onto the gasket, making sure it gets between the flaps of rubber. Then, wipe the cleaner up with a towel or cloth. [6] X Research source You may need several cleaning cloths if the gasket is coated with slimy mildew. Just keep spraying and wiping the gasket until your cloth comes away clean. Mildew grows on the gasket when it isn't getting dry enough between uses or when your soap leaves behind too much residue."

Put on a pair of rubber gloves and dip a clean cloth into the bleach solution and wipe it over the gasket. Make sure to work the solution in between the flaps of the gasket. After that, dry the gasket off with a fresh cloth. [7] X Research source If you've already cleaned the gasket with vinegar, rinse it out thoroughly to remove any residue before using bleach—mixing the two can create a toxic gas. Don’t forget to wipe the inside of the washer’s door to remove stains and mildew from the window glass. If you notice black mold spots that are stubborn and stuck in your gasket, put on a face mask and scrub the area with a toothbrush in a solution dipped in your bleach solution."

Let the excess water drain out into the dish. Then, pull the filter out and rinse it under running water.
