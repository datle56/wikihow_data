Every morning when you wake up and at night before you go to bed, wash your face to remove acne-causing dirt and oil from your skin. Gently pat your face dry with a soft cloth, then apply a thin layer of a lightweight facial moisturizer to keep your skin looking hydrated and vibrant. [3] X Research source Be sure to use a cleanser that’s specifically made for use on the face. The skin there is more sensitive than the skin on your body, so regular body soap can be too harsh. Choose a cleanser and moisturizer that are formulated for your skin type. For instance, if you have oily skin, you might use a foaming cleanser and a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer. If you have dry skin, you might use a hydrating gel cleaner and a rich cream moisturizer."

[5] X Research source If your teeth are yellow, ask your dentist whether they recommend a whitening toothpaste or at-home whitening strips. You can also talk to your dentist about in-office whitening options. Tip: instead of chugging your iced coffee, black tea, or soda, slurp it through a straw!
