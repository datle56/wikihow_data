      "content": "Surf to the Seafoam Islands. Starting from the east coast of Cinnabar Island, use a Pokémon to Surf along Route 20 until you reach a cave entrance with a trainer standing nearby. Head into the entrance of this ice-filled cave—you’re now one step closer to catching Articuno! [1] X Research source Prepare to fight a few Pokémon trainers along the way if it’s your first time heading down Route 20. You’ll likely bump into some Water-type Pokémon, too. To save some time, stick a Grass- or Electric-type Pokémon at the head of your team (or a Pokémon with a Grass or Electric move). You can also fly to Fuchsia City, surf down Route 19, and then Surf along Route 20 to reach the Seafoam Islands. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Head to the lowest floor of the ice cave by solving the boulder puzzle. Articuno appears on the lowest level of the cave—to get there, use a Pokémon with the Strength HM to push all the cave boulders into the right openings on the floor. After pushing the last boulder, drop down the same opening to reach the lowest floor—you’ll automatically land in the water and use Surf. [3] X Research source The boulders help block off the rushing current flowing through the bottom level of the cave, which allows you and your Pokémon to Surf. It can take a little bit of trial and error to solve this puzzle. Don’t give up!"

      "content": "Locate Articuno and save your game file. Surf north from where you’ve landed; in no time, at all, you’ll see Articuno (a large, blue bird) sitting on a nearby section of ice. Save your game as soon as you spot the Legendary Pokémon—that way, if anything goes wrong, you can redo the battle. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Get Articuno down to low health and use an Ultra Ball to catch it.",
      "content": "Get Articuno down to low health and use an Ultra Ball to catch it. Treat this battle as you would any other Pokémon battle—just remember, your goal is to get its down as much as possible without making it faint. To boost your chances of a successful catch, fight Articuno with a Pokémon that can paralyze the Legendary bird or make it fall asleep. [5] X Research source Be patient, as it might take a lot of tries before Articuno is finally caught. All 3 Legendary birds (including Articuno) spawn at level 50, so make sure your Pokémon are at least level 55 before the battle starts. [6] X Research source Pokémon like Seel and Dewgong may be helpful additions to your party, since their “Thick Fat” passive grants them extra immunity to Ice-type moves. [7] X Research source This is especially helpful, considering that Ice Beam is Articuno’s only attacking ability. [8] X Research source Make sure that you have plenty of Ultra Balls before you enter the fight, which are 2 times as likely as regular Pokéballs to land a successful catch. You could also use multiple Timer Balls, which have a higher catch rate the more times you use them. [9] X Research source A Master Ball has a 100% catch rate, but you can only get one in the game. Choose wisely before you use it! [10] X Research source"

Once you’ve arrived on the island, follow Kindle Road, a straight route that takes you directly to the base of Mt. Ember. Use Surf to get across the last ocean section of the road. [11] X Research source Be prepared to fight plenty of trainers and wild Pokémon on your way over. [12] X Research source Make sure you’ve beaten the 7th Gym on Cinnabar Island first—you’ll need the Volcano Badge from this Gym to get the Tri-Pass, which lets you use the ferry.

Work your way up the mountain—you’ll need to fight a few trainers before reaching the cave system that takes you to the summit. [14] X Research source Once you make it through the cave, head up the nearby staircases and rearrange the neighboring boulders to find Moltres. [15] X Research source Set a Water-type Pokémon at the head of your party before you enter the cave, which makes it easy to clear through any Rock-type Pokémon that you encounter."

      "content": "Use an Ultra Ball to [ Moltres ] after lowering its health. Save your game as soon as you spot Moltres—that way, you can restart the battle later on, if needed. The most successful way to catch this bird is to get its health into the red, and then give it a status condition like Freeze, Sleep, or Paralyze. Once you have weakened Moltres, keep tossing Ultra Balls at the bird until it's caught. [16] X Research source Pro tip: Bring along a Pokémon with the Flash Fire ability, which makes your Pokémon immune to Fire-type attacks. Pokémon like Vulpix, Ninetales, Growlithe, and Arcanine can all have this Ability. [17] X Research source Moltres' only two attacking moves are Fire-type so it won't be able to hurt you at all!

Work your way around the Power Plant in a counterclockwise direction until you reach the northwest corner. Look for Zapdos, a large yellow bird Pokémon, sitting in the center of the room.

      "content": "Lower the Zapdos’s health and try to catch it with an Ultra Ball. This fight will be a struggle, but you can do it! Once you find the legendary bird, make sure to save before you battle it. In the fight, bring the bird's health into red, then inflict it with a weakening status condition like Sleep, Paralyze, or Freeze. Once the bird is weak, keep throwing Ultra Balls until you catch it! [21] X Research source Always save after the battle. You don’t want all of your hard work to be lost! Pro tip: Battle Zapdos with an Electric-, Rock-, or Steel-type Pokémon, which take less damage from Flying-type moves. [22] X Research source Drill Peck (a Flying-type move) is the only attacking move that Zapdos uses, so a resistant Pokémon on your team will make the fight much easier. A Pokémon like Geodude or Graveler is a great choice, especially if you have it use Defense Curl several times."
