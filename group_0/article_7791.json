So, basically, you want a shade that’s just a more polished version of your natural nail color—so pale pink, beige, cream, cocoa, and caramel shades are popular colors for the clean girl look. [1] X Research source Clean girl manicures are typically short or medium in length with a rounded or almond shape. [2] X Research source Like clean girl makeup, clean girl nails emphasize a healthy look and impeccable grooming via cuticle care and neat polish application. Some nail artists add a French-style tip or nail art to give a clean girl nail look more detail. [3] X Research source You can go for bolder base colors like black and red—as long as your manicure still has the glossy, minimalist appearance central to the clean girl aesthetic.

Pour a quarter-size dollop of clear nail polish on your surface and pour a small pile of glitter nearby. Load the brush up with clear polish and a small amount of glitter. Coat each nail with one coat, letting the glitter spread around. After this coat dries completely, repeat the brush-loading steps, but only add more glitter to the tips of your nails to create an ombre or gradient effect. [16] X Research source"

Then, use a nail clipper to cut your nails to your desired length before shaping them with a file—clean girl nails are usually short or medium in length. File your nails into a round or almond shape, depending on your preference. [17] X Research source Trim any hangnails with your nail clipper as well. When filing your nails, move your file in one direction the whole time and lift the file away from the nail in between each stroke to prevent filing in both directions. Avoid sawing back and forth or up and down, which can cause damage to your nails. [18] X Research source To file your nails into a rounded shape , hold your nail file at one of your nail’s two corners at a 45-degree angle to the nail bed (the bottom of the nail where the cuticle is). Gently file the corner of the nail, rounding as you go. [19] X Research source Stop when both corners are rounded and smooth with no sharp edges remaining. To file your nails into an almond shape , you’ll need to start with a longer nail. Visualize the center of the tip of the nail: This will be the ‘point’ of your almond shape. File the upper corners of the nail to round them, alternating back and forth to create an even shape. Stop when the rounded shape resembles the point of an almond—your nail should be widest at the cuticle and taper to a rounded point at its tip. [20] X Research source"

Then, use a cuticle pusher to gently push back your cuticles. [21] X Research source Finally, apply a nourishing lotion to your hands and nails to ensure your skin is moisturized and supple.

[22] X Research source Buff each nail for 6 to 8 strokes. After you buff, wipe the nails once more with a cotton pad. Now you’re ready to apply a base coat: position the brush at the middle of the nail and swipe the base coat up toward the tip. Repeat on both sides so the base coat covers your nail completely. Let dry (usually 1-2 minutes) before moving on. [23] X Research source Buffing smooths your nails so the polish will apply evenly to the surface. Be careful not to buff them too much, or nail polish may slip off your nails. [24] X Research source Base coat may also help prevent your polish from chipping and staining."

Wait at least 2 minutes between coats to ensure that the first layer has had adequate time to dry. Repeat until you’re satisfied with the saturation of your nail shade. Optionally, add nail stickers to create small, delicate designs. Just keep these add-ons to a minimum—the clean girl aesthetic is all about less-is-more details.
