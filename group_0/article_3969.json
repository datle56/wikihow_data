However, they show an essential mismatch that might not be easily resolved. Opposite political views can show a deep difference in core values and belief systems. Opposite lifestyles—let’s say he spends every morning at the gym while you enjoy staying up late watching your favorite romantic comedies—can be incompatible. To be clear , you can work on these compatibility issues in a relationship. But it will take open communication and a patient understanding of each other’s perspectives. [1] X Research source"

Even if you’re not at the point of a relationship to be sharing finances, be cautious of someone who seems to spend recklessly outside their means. This behavior tells how your finances will be affected when sharing a bank account, buying a house, or raising children."

      "title": "He is rude to strangers.",
      "content": "He is rude to strangers. Even if your man is nice to you, it’s just as important that he treats everyone else with kindness. When you’re out on a date, does he condescend to service workers or refuse to leave a tip? If this is how he treats strangers and other people in his life, it likely won’t be long until that behavior turns to you. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "He’s disrespectful to his family members. If he’s unkind to his parents, siblings, or children and animals in his family, this says a lot about his character. This behavior shows his true colors and his lack of consideration for others. Eventually, he will be equally disrespectful toward you (if he hasn’t already). [3] X Research source"

      "title": "He talks about others behind their back.",
      "content": "He talks about others behind their back. If he’s constantly putting people down or telling you bad things about his family and friends, proceed with caution. Does he seem to have a problem with everyone in his life? Does he tell you secrets about people he was probably told in confidence? Chances are, he’s speaking to others about you similarly.

    {
      "title": "He doesn’t have long-term friends.",
      "content": "He doesn’t have long-term friends. A lack of long-term friends can show his inability to form deep and enduring relationships. This may stem from communication issues, inability issues, or unhealthy behaviors pushing others away. Regardless, your man having very few close or lifelong friends may be a clue to the longevity of your relationship. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "He says all his exes are crazy.",
      "content": "He says all his exes are crazy. In most break-ups , both parties somehow contributed to the relationship’s end. A guy who refers to all (or most) of his ex-partners as “crazy” shows that he can’t own their mistakes or take accountability for their actions. [6] X Research source We all probably have some not-so-nice things to say about our exes, but we should also have some perspective on what went wrong in a relationship—and our role in it."

      "content": "He brings up his exes a lot. It’s normal to get an idea of each other’s romantic history. But a man who constantly talks about his ex-partner may not be over them or feel bitter. He may also compare you to his ex, which may also damage your self-esteem. [7] X Research source On the flip side, a guy might also ask you about your previous partners and how he compares to them.

      "title": "He leaves you out of plans and conversations.",
      "content": "He leaves you out of plans and conversations. He never brings you around his friends or family or invites you to important events. He might purposely exclude you from in-person conversations or always leave the room when speaking on the phone. Clinical psychologist Asa Don Brown explains the damage that being left out causes, leaving “a deep impression upon your heart and mind. [Being left out] commonly leads to someone feeling isolated, abandoned, and detached.” Dr. Brown continues to describe the results of being left out, like “negative thoughts, desires, and perceptions. It’s normal to feel upset, agitated, and frustrated when you have been left out.” Reader Poll: We asked 1014 wikiHow readers who've been in a situationship, and only 12% of them said they noticed red flags because their partner hasn’t introduced them to friends and family. [Take Poll] If your partner hasn’t introduced you to their family, talk to them about it. There could be all kinds of reasons it hasn’t happened yet, so don’t automatically assume it’s a red flag before having a conversation."

      "title": "He gives you backhanded compliments.",
      "content": "He gives you backhanded compliments. If your partner insults or condescends to you but tries to pass it off as a compliment or joke, this is a huge red flag. Not only is he insulting you, but he’s also dismissing your feelings by saying he meant it as a nice thing or he was teasing. [9] X Research source Some examples of backhanded compliments are “You look good for your age” or “I didn’t think so when I first saw you, but you’re actually really intelligent.”"

      "title": "He never plans dates.",
      "content": "He never plans dates. A good partner should be excited to plan dates to get to know you better and spend quality time with you. If a man is putting little to no effort into planning dates, it may be a sign that he’s not that invested in the relationship. Dates can be as simple as a picnic in the park or a walk around a new neighborhood, so there’s no excuse to put in no effort or thought. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "He’s unreliable.",
      "content": "He’s unreliable. A man being consistently late, not showing up for dates, or disappearing for days at a time is a huge red flag. Things come up, but your significant other should value your time and feelings enough to let you know if he needs some space or needs to raincheck. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "He avoids committing to your relationship.",
      "content": "He avoids committing to your relationship. Relationship counselor Jason Polk advises asking yourself if your potential partner is “honest? Is he forthcoming? Is he straight up? Do you feel like you're making excuses?...do you feel like a part of him is trying to avoid commitment? And then, if so…that can be…a very important red flag.” Common signs of commitment-phobic people include very short past relationships, exclusively making plans at the last minute, refusing to make definite commitments to parties or events, and struggling to say I love you or call someone their boyfriend or girlfriend. [12] X Research source Lack of commitment is a common sign in determining if you’re in a situationship ."

      "content": "He gets serious too fast. We all know what it feels like to fall hard, but an excessive amount of affection, gifts, or even an “I love you” at the start of a relationship can be a red flag. This behavior, known as love bombing, shouldn’t happen only a few weeks or months into a relationship. [13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This person may try to get you to develop feelings quickly so you’ll ignore other red flags or future behaviors."

      "title": "He doesn’t take your safety seriously.",
      "content": "He doesn’t take your safety seriously. Your partner should always care about your safety and try to protect and look out for you. Especially in heterosexual relationships, a man should understand if you don’t want to meet up late at night or somewhere unfamiliar when you’re first getting to know each other. Someone arguing with you over or dismissing these concerns is a huge red flag. [14] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "He doesn’t compromise with you.",
      "content": "He doesn’t compromise with you. A healthy partner should listen to you and show interest in your thoughts and feelings. Even if you don’t want or believe the same things, your partner should be able to compromise with you. Be wary of someone who makes no effort to see your perspective or always has to have things their way. [15] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "He never apologizes.",
      "content": "He never apologizes. An inability to say sorry shows a lack of accountability, consideration of others, and willingness to handle conflict maturely. These qualities are likely to show up again and again when you encounter conflict in your relationship. [16] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "He avoids communicating about conflict.",
      "content": "He avoids communicating about conflict. He may ignore you, give you the silent treatment, or hang up on you if he’s not getting his way. [17] X Research source As psychologist Asa Don Brown explains, “it is not unusual for couples to disagree, bicker, or fight, but…conflict should never be avoided, denied, opposed, or subjected to hateful rhetoric.” Dr. Brown warns how “avoiding communication about touchy subjects will only cause an individual to feel at odds. While it may be challenging to have varying points of view, it is important to actively listen to the opposing viewpoint. As such, an opposing viewpoint might help stimulate conversations, ideas, and a deeper understanding of your partner.”"

    {
      "title": "He doesn’t respect your boundaries.",
      "content": "He doesn’t respect your boundaries. Setting boundaries is a healthy act of self-love and self-respect. If someone violates your boundaries after you’ve set them, this is a major red flag. [18] X Research source On a first date, violating a boundary may look like telling a guy that you need to head home early, and he tries to convince you to stay. This also may look like pushing physical boundaries, like your partner being unwilling to listen when you say you don’t feel like cuddling or need personal space.

      "content": "He doesn’t set boundaries with his mom. A man may be “overly concerned with…upsetting [their] mom,” explains relationship counselor Jason Polk. As a result, “a part of him…is going to struggle with 100% commitment to you because he… [has] a Disloyalty Bind with his mom.” A Disloyalty Bind usually results from a man having a mom who is overly involved in his life. As a result, he works hard to please his mother and feels like he’s betraying her by engaging in other relationships. [21] X Research source This dynamic is most common in heterosexual relationships between male and female romantic partners."

      "content": "He lacks emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is required in a relationship to set boundaries and have healthy attachments to others. Also known as EI, emotional intelligence is a counter to academic intelligence, and it is often learned (or not learned) as we watch adults interact with the world as children. [22] X Research source A low EI often revolves around traumatic or negative childhood experiences. While you can work through this with your partner, he needs to be willing to work on himself and possibly see a therapist ."

      "title": "He isn’t honest with you.",
      "content": "He isn’t honest with you. Honesty is one of the main factors in any healthy relationship. Be wary if your partner is acting secretive about their past, trying to hide information from you, or lying about who he is with or where he’s going. While a white lie every once in a while is human, a pattern of lying is a big cause for concern, as you’ll start to doubt how much you can trust them when big problems arise. [23] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "He cheats on you.",
      "content": "He cheats on you. If your partner cheats on you, that’s an obvious red flag and often a deal breaker. Your partner has betrayed you without concern for how their actions made you feel. Even if you work through infidelity issues with a partner, their actions could hint at a pattern of dishonest behavior and disregard for your feelings. [24] X Research source"

      "title": "He doesn’t celebrate your successes.",
      "content": "He doesn’t celebrate your successes. He should be genuinely happy and excited when you hit major goals and do whatever he can to support you in reaching him. If a man doesn’t celebrate you or support you in your career or other parts of life, it may indicate that he is jealous of you or feels intimidated—which shouldn’t be an issue with a healthy partner who cares about you.

      "title": "He tries to control you.",
      "content": "He tries to control you. Some common signs of controlling behavior are telling you how to dress and act. He might constantly monitor where you are and who you are with or text you nonstop to see what you’re doing if you're out with friends.

      "content": "He has mood swings. Mood swings may look like anger outbursts or sudden irritability. One minute, you may be the apple of his eye, and the next, he’s ripping you apart and calling you names. Not only can mood swings lead to physical aggression, but they also show that he can’t handle his emotions maturely. [29] X Research source This behavior may have you feeling constantly anxious or like you’re walking on eggshells around him, waiting for the next time his mood turns on a dime."

Red flags can come in all shapes and sizes, and there’s no comprehensive list of every red flag you might experience in a relationship. But, these warning signs are always “behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions that are toxic,” as defined by clinical psychologist Asa Brown. Dr. Brown goes on to define red flags as “any behavior that is unwarranted, inappropriate, and incongruous with your perspectives on a relationship…physical manipulation, aggression or coercion; behaviors that are controlling, manipulative and punitive; extreme jealousy and suspicion; an unwillingness to compromise or concede; a lack of empathy; gaslighting; emotional instability; and a lack of healthy and open communication.” Red flags typically don’t happen just once; you’ll see a pattern of the same behavior repeating itself.

Red flags toxic behaviors, “not personal quirks, such as an individual’s particular desires, tastes or interests,” as described by psychologist Dr. Asa Don Brown. Yellow flags are low-level irritations, like loud chewing, clingy behavior, or not being a dessert person (oof). You can pump the brakes a bit, but no need to cut off the relationship just yet. [36] X Research source Remember that none of us are perfect—we all occasionally display toxic behaviors (red flags) or annoying habits (yellow flags). What you need to watch out for are repeated and unresolvable behaviors that cause harm in your relationship."

      "content": "Address red flags when you notice them. Rather than letting things slide, call out his behavior when you see it. Be honest with your partner about the issues you see without being cruel. Although these conversations can be difficult, you need them to move forward—with or without your relationship. Ignoring or not addressing red flags will cause more problems down the road with your significant other and potentially put you in harm's way. As psychology expert Asa Don Brown puts it, “red flags may be your personal fire escape, providing you an exit out of this potentially hazardous relationship. Never ignore or dismiss red flags.”"

      "content": "Communicate effectively with your partner. Concentrate on the major problem instead of bringing up several small problems. Talk about the problems that hurt your feelings, using “I feel” statements instead of “You are” statements. For example, say, “I feel hurt when you don’t invite me to spend time with your friends” instead of “You are so selfish and don’t care about me.” [37] X Research source Use neutral language rather than inflammatory language. “You were texting me all night and bothering me about where I was” can be rephrased as “I wanted to enjoy my night out with my friends. Could you help me understand how you were feeling?” If your partner refuses to communicate with you, verbally attacks you, or doesn’t attempt to empathize with your feelings, this may indicate the end of a relationship."

Break up with your partner if he isn’t putting effort into changing, or if his behavior is abusive and controlling, or you always feel like you're walking on eggshells around him. Make sure to end the relationship without sacrificing your safety. Talk to your partner publicly and keep your conversation short. Relationship counselor Jason Polk recommends a neutral statement like, “I can honor our relationship and the experience. But I have decided that part of my values is that I decided I want to go.” Expert psychologist Asa Don Brown advises that “if you know that your partner has a volatile personality, such as displaying excessive jealousy, outbursts, frequent lying, and inability to self-regulate, then you will have a greater understanding of how they may react. The end of a relationship may have dug up raw emotions for your partner. They may feel unsure of how to make sense of these emotions or they may be totally out of touch with their emotions altogether. Either way, it is important that you are safe in your approach to your ex-partner.”"

If you are struggling to leave a relationship because your partner won’t accept or pay attention to your wishes, this may place you in a dangerous situation. If you have broken up with your partner and they won’t accept it, this is extremely concerning behavior that you need support with. In this scenario, clinical psychologist Asa Don Brown advises you to “seek out professional guidance. Requesting professional guidance is as much about your safety as it is others. When an ex begins displaying behaviors that are overtly jealous, obsessive, possessive, and fixated on the former relationship, you may have a pathological issue in the development.”"
