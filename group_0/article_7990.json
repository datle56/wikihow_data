      "title": "Prepare some soapy water.",
      "content": "Prepare some soapy water. You will want to use lukewarm water, as warm or hot water may damage the leather soles of your Rainbow sandals. Add a drop or two of dish soap and stir to combine."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wipe your shoes down with a damp cloth.",
      "content": "Wipe your shoes down with a damp cloth. Dip a corner of a clean rag into the soapy water, and squeeze it a bit to get rid of excess water. Gently dampen and wipe off dirty areas with small circular motions. [1] X Research source If there are any particularly dirty areas that are too much for the wet cloth to handle, a soft bristled brush like an old toothbrush can come in handy. [2] X Research source Take care only to rub hard enough to dislodge dirt, without damaging the leather."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dry them off.",
      "content": "Dry them off. Using a clean paper towel, wipe off any dampness on your sandals. Make sure to do a thorough job, as soap residue can damage the leather. [3] X Research source It’s a good idea to let them air dry in the sun before you wear them again, just to be sure they have totally dried off."
    },
    {
      "title": "Leave them out in the sun.",
      "content": "Leave them out in the sun. Before you move on to more involved methods, try taking a hiatus from wearing your Rainbow sandals, and just leave them to dry in the sun for a few days. If they are just beginning to smell, the ultraviolet rays and fresh air may be all they need. [4] X Research source Even if it doesn’t totally solve the problem, it’s a good idea to make sure your sandals are totally dry before you try cleaning them."

    {
      "title": "Use rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Use rubbing alcohol. Highly concentrated alcohol can help eliminate unwanted odors. Wet a couple paper towels with rubbing alcohol (they should be damp, but not soaking wet), and drape them over the parts of your sandals that come into contact with your feet. Let them sit for a couple hours, or until the paper towels dry out. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Spritz them with vodka.",
      "content": "Spritz them with vodka. Like rubbing alcohol, this can help neutralize bad smells. Put a little bit of vodka in a spray bottle, and mist your sandals with it. Let them air dry in the sun for several hours. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply baking soda.",
      "content": "Apply baking soda. This substance is highly effective at absorbing all sorts of unwanted odors. Put your Rainbow sandals in a 1 gallon (3.8 L) ziplock bag, and pour in a half cup of baking soda. Seal the bag and shake it vigorously, coating the sandals thoroughly. Leave them in there for a couple days before you remove them. [7] X Research source It may take a little effort, but you should be able to get all the baking soda off your shoes by banging them together and wiping them off with a clean rag."

    {
      "title": "Wash your feet thoroughly.",
      "content": "Wash your feet thoroughly. Having clean feet will go a long way to ensuring that your Rainbow sandals stay clean and odor-free. Keep a bar of deodorizing soap in the shower, and use a washcloth to vigorously scrub your feet. Not only will this remove dirt and grime that can stain your sandals, but it will also slough off the dead skin cells that contribute to smelly shoes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dry your feet off well.",
      "content": "Dry your feet off well. When you get out of the shower, don’t stop drying yourself off when you get to your ankles. Do a thorough job of toweling off your feet, including between your toes, to discourage any fungi from setting up shop. If you have trouble with foot fungus, you may want to consider using a daily foot powder."

    {
      "title": "Spray on some foot antiperspirant.",
      "content": "Spray on some foot antiperspirant. This is a good idea if you have particularly sweaty feet. While foot powders absorb sweat, antiperspirants actually stop your feet from sweating to begin with. If you find yourself constantly sweating into your sandals, spraying some on in the morning could go a long way to keeping them cleaner."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give your feet some sun.",
      "content": "Give your feet some sun. Odor-causing fungus thrives in damp, dark areas, like the soles of your shoes. Try to spend some time every day barefoot, ideally outdoors, with your feet up and the sun shining on them. Just make sure you give your feet a good rinsing and drying off if they get dirty."
