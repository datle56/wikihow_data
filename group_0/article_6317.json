      "content": "People's throat muscles get tight when they're nervous. If a liar is feeling under pressure, they’re more likely to clear their throat as a way to relieve muscle tension. You might also notice their voice sounds a little creaky or is cracking more than usual.

      "content": "A high-pitched voice is another sign of stress (and potential dishonesty). Liars tend to sound higher-pitched due to all the stressful tension that builds up in their throat. [2] X Research source Compare the other person’s voice to how they usually sound if you know them well.

      "content": "When people tell complex lies, they have to take time to think up a story. As a result, they’ll hesitate before answering questions, and they might pause in the middle of a fake explanation. [5] X Research source Is the potential liar taking a while before they answer your question? Are they speaking slower than normal? A complex lie involves having to make up a big explanation about why something happened or describe a series of events. A simple lie (that won’t cause liars to hesitate as much) could involve lying about what someone looked like or the food someone ate. Conversations between two cooperating people tend to fall into a comfortable rhythm. Trust your gut if you feel like someone is taking just one or two beats too long to respond—they might be lying!"

[9] X Research source Pay attention to whether the potential liar seems comfortable using people’s names, describing activities, and giving timelines. A liar might even get so vague they avoid using personal pronouns like “I” or “me.” [10] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source For instance, if you ask your partner, “What were you doing Friday night?” and they respond “We went out,” that’s a suspiciously short answer.
