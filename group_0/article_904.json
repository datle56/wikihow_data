      "title": "Use \"The Honorable\" on the envelope.",
      "content": "Use \"The Honorable\" on the envelope. \"The Honorable\" is a title typically given to elected officials. When writing to a senator, start with the title and then type the senator's first and last name. Proper form also typically includes the senator's middle initial. [2] X Research source For example, if you were writing to Utah Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, you would address the letter to \"The Honorable Orrin G. Hatch.\" Directly under the senator's name, type \"United States Senate.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Include official titles.",
      "content": "Include official titles. If the senator you're writing is the president of the senate, or the chairman of a committee, type the full title under the senator's name in the address block. Check the senator's web page if you're unsure about any titles you need to include. The committee title should be directly under the senator's name, above the \"United States Senate\" line. You can leave out the title of a committee chair if you're writing for a reason unrelated to that committee's work. However, always include the title if you're writing the president of the senate."

    {
      "title": "Use the senator's surname in the salutation.",
      "content": "Use the senator's surname in the salutation. If you're sending a formal business letter , the address block at the top of the letter will be the same as the address block on the envelope. You'll open the letter by writing \"Dear Senator\" followed by the senator's last name. [3] X Research source For example, if you're sending a letter to Senator Orrin Hatch, your salutation would read \"Dear Senator Hatch.\" Follow the salutation with a colon and double-space before starting your letter."

    {
      "title": "Keep the same form of address with former senators.",
      "content": "Keep the same form of address with former senators. Even if a senator retires or is defeated by another candidate, they retain the title of \"Senator\" and the honorific \"The Honorable.\" It isn't proper to add \"Former\" in front of \"Senator.\" [4] X Research source If a senator resigned or was removed from office (not simply voted out), you should still address them as \"Senator,\" but you would no longer use \"The Honorable.\" In writing, the same form of address and honorifics are also used for state senators. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Call a senator by their title and surname.",
      "content": "Call a senator by their title and surname. In a face-to-face meeting with a senator, address them as \"Senator\" followed by their surname the first time you speak. After that, you can simply call them \"Senator\" without their surname, or use \"sir\" or \"ma'am.\" [6] X Research source Although you'll typically be fine addressing a senator this way, exceptions exist. For example, if you're testifying before a committee, you typically would address the committee chair as \"Chairman.\" If you're not sure how to address a senator in context, pay attention to what other people say."

      "content": "Use \"The Honorable\" when making a formal introduction. You may be called upon to introduce a senator, typically in front of a large group of people or at an event. A formal introduction uses \"The Honorable Senator\" with the senator's surname, followed by the senator's elected position. [7] X Research source For example, if you were introducing Senator Orrin Hatch, you would say \"The Honorable Senator Hatch, Senator from Utah.\""

When you're at a gathering where both state and U.S. senators are present, refer to state senators as \"State Senator\" followed by their surname when you first greet them. [8] X Research source If you address them again, use \"Mr./Mrs.\" or \"sir/ma'am,\" rather than the title \"Senator\" with state senators."

      "title": "Adjust to the senator's personal preference.",
      "content": "Adjust to the senator's personal preference. While you'll never get in trouble for being too polite, some senators aren't comfortable with a formal address. If a senator asks you to call them a different title, or to call them by their first name, follow their preference. [9] X Research source For example, Senator Bill Frist, also a medical doctor, preferred people to call him \"Dr. Frist\" rather than \"Senator Frist.\""
