    {
      "title": "Lit",
      "content": "Lit One of the most common Atlanta slang words (and probably the most exported as well), something that's lit is something that's really awesome. Probably derived from the fact that awesome events used to be called hot , and a fire is hot, and a fire must be lit . [1] X Research source In a sentence: \"Did you see the bands playing at the block party next weekend? It's gonna be lit!\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Fye",
      "content": "Fye This word is just fire without the final r sound. It might just be the Atlanta accent or it might be intentional. Either way, this is the word of choice for Atlantans who want to talk about how something is really cool or amazing. Just remember: a fye is always lit . In a sentence : \"Yo, I'm checking out that BBQ tomorrow for real, it's gonna be fye!\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Dat way",
      "content": "Dat way Literally a stylized version of \"that way,\" this phrase is used to mean that you agree with someone. You can also use it for emphasis after you say something, similar to how you might say \"right\" or \"you feel me.\" At the same time, it's kind of a filler phrase that doesn't really have a specific meaning, so don't be surprised if you hear it in a lot of different contexts. [2] X Research source In a sentence : \"I wanna go to the meetup, dat way, but I gotta wash my car first.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Finesse",
      "content": "Finesse When you finesse something, it means you were smooth. The word implies that you played someone, but in a totally mutual way. You got a deal, they know you got a deal, and they were happy to give you a deal. If you finesse a lot, people probably talk about how charming you are, too. In a sentence : \"How'd you finesse backstage passes? This show's been sold out for months!\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Juug",
      "content": "Juug You can think of juug as the dark side of finesse —if finesse is charming someone into freely giving you something, juug is the same but without bothering to charm them first. It's basically taking or snatching, but it implies that you're in the right to do so. You can also use it for people, if you're trying to get someone out of a tough situation. [3] X Research source In a sentence: \"Like my new hoodie? Somebody left it on the bus and I juuged it.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Shawty",
      "content": "Shawty The spelling reflects the Southern pronunciation of the word shorty . When you hear this in Atlanta, it's typically a young man talking about a young woman. More generally, you might hear friends calling each other shawty . It's a term of endearment. [4] X Research source In a sentence : \"Hey shawty, you wanna come over to my place tonight?\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Skrrt",
      "content": "Skrrt This word comically mimics the sound of tires screeching on pavement, and it's meant to compliment someone's physical appearance. It's as if the person was driving, saw this person, and had to screech to a stop so they could look at them longer or maybe even talk to them. You'll often hear someone skrrt more than once—and the number of skrrts might indicate how attractive they think the person is. In a sentence : \"Skrrt skrrt! You see that shawty over there?\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Trap",
      "content": "Trap A trap is a place (usually an abandoned house) where people sell illegal drugs, as well as a type of hip-hop music. Along the way, the word came to take on a sort of metaphorical meaning as well, referring broadly to the act of hustling, or doing something you don't particularly want to do just to get some money. [5] X Research source In a sentence : \"They finally tore down that trap at the end of the road. I'm so glad we don't have to worry about that anymore.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Bando",
      "content": "Bando This word is short for \"abandoned,\" as in an abandoned home or building. In Atlanta, a bando is typically also a trap house .

    },
    {
      "title": "Yeen",
      "content": "Yeen When Southerners speak more quickly, like they tend to do in larger cities, they start to lose some of the consonants and words get blended together. A word like yeen is sometimes the result—officially, it stands in for \"you don't.\" It's sort of the counterpart of ion , which stands in for \"I don't.\" Atlantans tend to soften or eliminate hard vowels, so this is also particular to that part of Georgia. In a sentence: \"You think they're going to win the championship this year? Shh, yeen e'en know.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "12",
      "content": "12 The number 12 is nearly universally understood in the city of Atlanta to mean cops , although no one seems to know where it comes from. Generally speaking, it's a word that developed so that you could shout a warning to comrades about the presence of police. But people also use it when they're referring to the police in any context. [7] X Research source In a sentence : \"That party was pretty lit until 12 rolled up.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "No cap",
      "content": "No cap Saying \"no cap\" to mean \"truth\" or \"no lie\" spread throughout the United States thanks to Generation Z, but Atlantans claim it and have been saying it for decades. You'll hear cap all by itself too, and it usually means true –not a thing you wear on your head. [8] X Research source In a sentence: \"You really got tickets to the game, no cap?\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Slime",
      "content": "Slime This word is loosely related to the Young Thug trial, which ended up being the longest trial in Georgia history.

[9] X Research source A slime in this context refers to someone who's your ride-or-die, your homie. Your slime is your family. In a sentence : \"Oh, I've known him a long time—we're slime.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Slaps",
      "content": "Slaps This one is pretty straightforward and easy to pick up. If something slaps , that means it's great, awesome, excellent, or really cool. This versatile word can be used to describe everything from music to pizza, so it's really going to come in handy. In a sentence : \"Bro, have you heard their new album yet? It really slaps!\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Twin",
      "content": "Twin When you say someone is your twin , you're not saying that you look alike. Rather, this means that you consider the person to be your best friend or very much like you. The twinness comes from your vibe, not your appearance. You can also refer to your pet as your twin. In a sentence : \"Where've you been, twin, I need to rant about the latest team drama.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Munyun",
      "content": "Munyun It seems like there's a new slang word for money every few weeks, and in Atlanta munyun has become the word of choice. This one is fine to use in any context, although people might not understand what you mean in more bougie settings. In a sentence : \"You can't have any funyun without munyun.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Trim",
      "content": "Trim This is a shortening of the word tripping that only makes sense if you're really familiar with the Atlanta accent.

That suit looks amazing on you!\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Patna nem",

      "content": "ITP (Inside the Perimeter) A native Atlantan will typically tell you that you only live in Atlanta if you live inside the boundary created by Interstate 285, which rims the city.

[11] X Research source In a sentence : \"You should look for something ITP, that commute is killing you!\""
    },
    {
      "title": "OTP (Outside the Perimeter)",
      "content": "OTP (Outside the Perimeter) The suburbs of Atlanta tend to each have their own character and reputation, attracting different types of people at different stages of life.

      "content": "Spaghetti Junction Interstates 85 and 285 intersect along with quite a few other major and minor roads in a pile of overpasses and ramps that bend and curve over and around each other.

    },
    {
      "title": "A-town/The A",
      "content": "A-town/The A Atlanta has gone through a lot of nicknames in the past 50 or so years, with A-town or The A seeming to replace ATL as the slang of choice (although people still use ATL). If you're going to stick to the official name of the city, though, at least drop the last t and pronounce it Atlannuh like a true local. In a sentence : \"Whenever I go out of town I always wear my gear to represent A-town.\" One nickname you definitely don't want to use is Hotlanta . Nobody knows for sure where this nickname originated, but it's always been hated by locals.

    },
    {
      "title": "Get to Gettin'",
      "content": "Get to Gettin' If you're not from Atlanta specifically or the South generally, this one is a bit hard to understand. You've got the verb \"to get,\" which in the South can also be used to mean \"to leave\" (as in \"go on, get\"). Southerners also use the verb \"to get\" as a sort of preparatory word you can slip in when you're almost, but not quite, ready to do something. Put all of that together, and the result is get to gettin' , which roughly means \"start to make our exit or take our leave.\" In a sentence: \"Is it already 11:30?
