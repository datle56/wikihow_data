      "content": "Calculation Use the formula q = Cp * m * (delta) t to calculate the heat liberated which heats the water. [3] X Research source The specific heat Cp of water is 4.18 J/g C Mass of the water is 100g Delta t is the difference between the initial starting temperature and 40 degrees centigrade. Subtract the initial temperature of the water from 40 C. Substitute it into the formula and you will get the answer q in J. Convert into kJ by dividing q by 1000. Find the amount of substance burned by subtracting the final mass from the initial mass of the substance in g. Divide q in kJ by the mass of the substance burned. The answer is the experimental heat of combustion in kJ/g."
