      "content": "Place a warm, damp cloth on your face to loosen any mucus. Soak a washcloth in warm water and wring it out. Then, lay it over your face and nose and leave it on for 5 minutes (or until the cloth gets cold). The heat will warm your sinuses and loosen the mucus, making it easier to clear them. [3] X Research source Make sure the water is hot but not so hot that you burn your skin. Repeat this process as often as you want to help relieve sinus pressure. Similarly, you can boil some water in a pot and set it on a level surface, then position yourself over the pot and drape a towel over your head. Carefully lift the lid of the pot to let the steam out under the towel so you can breathe it in.
