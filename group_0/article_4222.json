[1] X Research source Gunpowder cannot be crafted, and must be found by defeating certain enemies that have a chance of dropping some, or looking in certain chests that have a chance of holding some: Defeating creepers (before exploding): 66% (1-2 gunpowder) Defeating ghasts: 66% (1-2 gunpowder) Defeating witches: 16% (1-6 gunpowder) Opening desert temple chest: 59% (1-8 gunpowder) Opening dungeon chests: 58% (1-8 gunpowder)"

      "content": "Use flint and steel to light a TNT block. This is the simplest way to detonate TNT. [6] X Research source See Make Flint and Steel in Minecraft for instructions on crafting it. Walk up to the TNT with flint and steel equipped to light it. (You can also a fire charge, a natural lava pool or a fire source nearby or a redstone signal) The TNT block will begin flashing when lit. Make sure to back up to a safe distance before it explodes (4 seconds after being lit). TNT has an explosive radius of about 7 blocks."

[7] X Research source You can enchant your bow with flame to make them shoot flaming arrows by using an enchanting table. See Make an Enchantment Table in Minecraft for instructions on creating an enchantment table and using lapis lazuli to enchant items. You can also light an arrow by shooting it through fire or lava. So you can build a fire in front of your TNT block and shoot an arrow through it to light the arrow and detonate the TNT."

      "content": "Use a fire charge to light the TNT. You can create a fire charge by placing a charcoal in the center of the grid, a blaze powder to the left of it, and a gunpowder below it. Fire charges are not as efficient as flint and steel, as you lose the charge that you throw. [8] X Research source Throwing a fire charge at the TNT will light it. You can throw the fire charge by selecting it in your inventory and then using the item. Putting a fire charge in a dispenser will cause it to shoot out as a fireball when triggered. This is not as useful for TNT since the fireball shoots at a random angle."

Unlike TNT you light, which always explodes after 4 seconds, TNT hit by an explosion will detonate after 0.5-1.5 seconds. [9] X Research source Since the explosion does not produce an exact radius, make sure your TNT is well within the explosion, no more than 3 or four blocks from the original TNT."

      "content": "Gather redstone dust. Redstone dust is used to create the redstone circuit and transmit power. For a basic circuit, you can have a trail of up to 15 blocks of redstone dust. Longer trails require redstone repeaters. [11] X Research source Redstone ore can only be found on layers 0-15, with the most abundant amount found between layers 4-13. You'll need to mine down to the bedrock layer and then begin your hunt for a redstone vein. You need an iron or diamond pickaxe to mine redstone ore. One block of redstone ore can be crafted into 9 piles of redstone dust. You usually get 4-5 redstone dust per redstone ore you mine. You can find redstone dust in dungeon chests and stronghold chests. Witches may drop redstone dust when defeated. Jungle temples spawn 15 redstone dust for the trap. They also spawn a few more for the secret chamber."

      "content": "Make a switch mechanism. There are several different mechanisms you can use to trigger your redstone circuit: [12] X Research source Button - This item is placed on the side of a full block, and provides redstone power when pushed. You can make a stone button by placing a single stone block in the center of the crafting grid. You can make a wood button by placing any wood planks in the center grid. Lever - A lever is placed on any solid surface, and can toggle redstone power on and off. You can make a lever by placing a stick in the center of the crafting grid and a cobblestone block underneath it. Pressure plate - This is a button that is pressed automatically when you stand on it. The major difference with a pressure plate versus the other two is that monsters can activate the pressure plate, making it perfect for traps. You can make a pressure plate by putting a stone or wood block in the center of the grid and an identical block to the left."

Now that you have your redstone powder and a switch mechanism, you can create your basic circuit: [13] X Research source Place your switch mechanism somewhere that you can use it. This will be your blasting remote, so make sure you can see the explosion. Place redstone powder in a trail towards where you want to put the TNT. The first piece should be adjacent to your switch mechanism. You can place redstone powder by looking at a block and right-clicking while it's equipped. Redstone ore can connect one level up or down, and the total length must be 15 blocks or less."
