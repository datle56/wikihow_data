      "content": "Cost of goods now/cost of goods before x 100 = consumer price index (CPI). The CPI formula is relatively straightforward. Simply divide the cost of goods and services now by the cost of goods and services in the previous period. Multiply this number by 100 and you’ve got the CPI. [1] X Trustworthy Source US Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. government agency that collects and reports labor-related information Go to source What time periods do you use? You can use literally any time period you’d like if you’re calculating your own CPI numbers. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the department that measures CPI in the United States, uses a monthly time frame. Many economists will look at yearly CPI changes when assessing larger trends. For example, the BLS might use the following formula to find the CPI in March of 2025: cost of goods in March 2025 divided by cost of goods in February 2025 x 100 = CPI. Which goods and services are measured? Nearly all consumer goods are measured. The BLS divides these goods into 8 groups which are tracked independently: food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation, medical care, recreation, education and communication, and other goods and services. Things not covered by CPI include stocks, bonds, property, insurance, and utilities."

If you are using a record of your own purchases and are trying to determine the general trend in prices and not merely the change of a single item, you may want to exclude those items that are only occasional purchases."

[4] X Research source If you are using a relatively small sample of items, you may be able to find the prices in flyers sent out by retail stores. It may be useful, for the sake of comparison, to make sure the prices used are based upon the same brands and from the same retailer. Because of the price differences at each store and from brand to brand, the only way to track the change of prices over time is to minimize these variables."

[10] X Research source It’s why a gallon of milk cost $1.30 in 1970 but $4.10 in 2024. There are a lot of ways to track inflation, but the Federal Government and the Federal Reserve (which sets interest rates) pay the most attention to CPI, which makes it uniquely important. [11] X Research source How do interest rates impact inflation? The higher interest rates are, the less likely you are to spend money (it costs more to borrow money for things like a mortgage or vacation, and you get rewarded more for saving money at the bank when interest rates are high). If consumers spend less money, inflation can go down as there are fewer buyers pushing prices up. [12] X Research source Is inflation bad? No, not necessarily. In fact, deflation—where goods and services lose value over time—is much, much worse. Inflation isn’t necessarily a problem if people can still afford goods, but an excessive amount of inflation can be painful for consumers. [13] X Research source"

It doesn’t actually tell you how fast or slow the cost of things is changing, though. For that, you need the inflation rate. The formula for inflation rate is as follows: Inflation Rate = ((Current CPI - Previous CPI) / Previous CPI) x 100 . [15] X Research source What is a “healthy” rate of inflation? The world’s central banks have generally agreed upon 2% being a good yearly rate of inflation. So, in a perfect world, $100 would have the spending power of $98 after a year. [16] X Research source"

PPI looks exclusively at prices that businesses pay to import the goods they need to do business. This is an important measurement because it indicates where inflation is happening. If CPI is high but PPI is not, it means businesses are raising prices. If PPI is higher than CPI though, it just means businesses are passing on increased costs to consumers. [17] X Trustworthy Source US Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. government agency that collects and reports labor-related information Go to source As an example, CPI might measure the cost to buy a toy truck. However, PPI will measure the cost of all the plastic or metal imported by the toy company to make that truck. 0"
