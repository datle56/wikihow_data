      "content": "Choose a mild or natural cleaner. Petrified wood should never be cleaned with chemicals. When cleaning petrified wood, opt for a mild cleanser or a natural one. Mild hand soaps and apple cider vinegar are good options to clean petrified wood. These should be enough to remove dirt and grime from your wood and leave it looking clean and fresh. [1] X Research source If your wood is not very dirty, opt for warm water alone. In rare cases, when stains are heavily set-in a pH-neutral all-purpose cleaner is appropriate for petrified wood. You can use deionized water. It is a great cleaning agent. It's chemical-free, does not damage any finish, and dries super fast."

      "title": "Use stronger grit pads to smooth down the wood's surface.",
      "content": "Use stronger grit pads to smooth down the wood's surface. To start polishing your petrified wood, you need to remove any scratches from the wood's surface. Start with stronger grit pads of 50, 120, or 150. You can purchase these at a hardware store. Rub down the wood gently, targeting any scratches or uneven portions. Make sure to rub out any uneven areas, as this will leave your wood looking shinier and softer when you're done. Make sure you have a good grasp on the wood when you're sanding it. If you have a clamping device, use that to secure the wood."

      "title": "Check the surface carefully for scratches.",
      "content": "Check the surface carefully for scratches. Wipe off any residue from the wood after sanding it. Examine the wood very closely for any lingering scratches or rough patches. Use your grit paper to remove any scratches you missed the first time around. It helps to work in a room with good lighting so you can easily see any scratches."

      "title": "Add polish with a finer grit pad.",
      "content": "Add polish with a finer grit pad. Use a finer grit pad to add polish to your wood. Opt for a pad of 400, 800, 1800, or 3500 grit. The higher the number, the more luster you'll add to your wood. Gently rub down the wood with your finer grit pad until the wood is at your desired level of shininess. If you want very shiny petrified wood, you can use a grit pad of 8500. This is an extremely fine grit pad and will result in very shiny wood."
