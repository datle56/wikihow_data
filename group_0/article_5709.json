Just keep in mind that at least one study showed no significant difference between participants who used the device and those who didn't.

A massage can occasionally spike your fever or make you feel worse—but more importantly, you don't want to pass on your illness to the massage therapist. If you have injuries, tell your massage therapist so they'll know how to deal with the injured areas. Massage therapists also typically won't massage areas where the skin is damaged, such as from sunburn or rash. Generally, tell your massage therapist if you have any of the following types of conditions: [9] X Research source Circulatory system issues Digestive or gastrointestinal issues Musculoskeletal conditions Nervous system issues Pregnancy"
