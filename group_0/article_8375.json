Either run your Keurig’s Descale setting or press the “Brew” button so the solution goes through the machine. Some models, such as the Keurig Slim, require you to press and hold certain buttons or find the Descale option in a menu. If you’re not sure if your coffeemaker has a descale setting, check the official support page for your specific Keurig model. If you’re manually pressing the Brew button, use the largest mug setting. Once it finishes, empty the mug and run additional brew cycles until the reservoir empties. Descaling a Keurig typically takes between 20–45 minutes, but it may vary on the model you have.
