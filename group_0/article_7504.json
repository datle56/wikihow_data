[11] X Research source For a paginated manual, place a comma after the year of publication, then add \"p.\" and the page number. For example: (Life Fitness, 2006, p. 13). If the manual isn't paginated. Use a heading or section name instead to direct your readers to the area of the manual where the quoted material can be found. For example, if the Life Fitness manual wasn't paginated, you might use this parenthetical: (Life Fitness, 2006, Specifications section). You can also count the paragraphs in the manual and use a paragraph number (after the abbreviation \"para.\"). Typically, this works better for manuals that are only a page or two long. Keep in mind that if you have to count the paragraphs, your readers will too. For example: (Life Fitness, 2006, para. 4)."
