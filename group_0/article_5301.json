      "content": "Look up the price of vehicle rentals where you’re going. If you aren’t driving your own vehicle for travel, you’ll need to rent one. Look online or contact vehicle rental companies where you’re traveling so you can find out their rates. Then, multiply their rate by the number of days you need to use the vehicle to find out how much you need to budget for it. [3] X Research source For example, if a rental company charges $50 a day, and you need to rent a vehicle for 3 days, then you’ll need to budget at least $150 for rental costs. If you’re traveling far, choose the vehicle with the best mileage so you can save on fuel costs."

      "content": "Incorporate additional transportation you’ll use into your costs. Research the location you’re traveling to and any neighboring areas you plan to visit. Determine if you’ll be traveling by boat, plane, train, car, or even rickshaw so you can account for all of your travel expenses. [4] X Research source Search online to determine the type of travel you’ll use. Find out the costs of using the transportation, whether it’s a rental fee or a ticket price, and estimate how much you’ll need to budget for it. For example, if you plan to take a ferry to visit a remote island at least 4 times, and the ticket prices are $5 per trip, then you can budget $20 for ferry tickets. If you’re unsure of how to arrange for transportation at your destination, contact a travel agency and ask them to assist you. You’ll have to pay them for their services, but they’ll be able to fully assist you!"

[9] X Research source For example, if you’re going to Kansas, you plan to drive a total of about 200 miles (320 km), and your rental car gets about 20 miles (32 km) per gallon of fuel, then you’ll need to purchase a total of about 10 gallons (38 L) of fuel in order to get around."
