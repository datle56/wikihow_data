While it’s good to learn from past mistakes and reflect on your behavior, it can become overwhelming when your thoughts and feelings live more in the past than the present. When ruminating, you may have a more difficult time forgiving yourself or other people or harbor negative feelings.

Instead, determine to let the event change your future behavior. Rumination is linked to depression.
