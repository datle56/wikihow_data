What did you like about my performance? What did you dislike? Overall, did it feel too long or too short? Did anything look unpolished?"

Many clowns start out in the world of freelancing, but, eventually, clowns either focus on freelance work or try to start performing with a circus. Decide which of these options is for you. Do you want to stay in one place to do freelance work, or would you travel with a circus? Freelance clowns have more flexibility in their schedules, but they do need to market themselves extensively so that they keep getting gigs. If you are an established circus clown, it may be easier to get more freelance gigs. Consider joining a circus for a couple of years and then settling into freelance work. Circus clowns need to audition and travel with the circus. However, unlike freelance clowns, they do receive health benefits. Many people cannot be circus clowns for their entire careers because the travelling is challenging. Circus clowns may do 500 shows in one calendar year! [8] X Research source"
