      "content": "Camo Joggers & Cropped Hoodie For a moment, camo-print cargo pants were the must-have street-style bottoms. The pants remain a classic way to add a dynamic print to an otherwise simple silhouette. Pair camo joggers (in green, black-and-white, or a brighter hue) with a cropped black hoodie for a casual baddie outfit that will turn heads. [1] X Research source Complete the look with black sneakers. Since this baddie outfit is casual, you can keep your hair and makeup lowkey. Try sleek, flowy hair (or your everyday ponytail) and minimalist makeup. Add false lashes for a glam vibe. Make this baddie outfit school-appropriate by choosing high-waisted joggers that will cover your midriff. Or, wear a black camisole under the hoodie to have the same effect."

      "content": "Gray Sweat Set Nothing says sporty-chic like a cute pair of sweatpants and a matching sweatshirt. You can go oversized for a truly effortless look or find something fitted to show your figure—the baddie philosophy is choosing whatever option makes you feel the most confident. Let your impeccable skincare or flawless makeup be the star of this look. Pull your hair back into a slick bun—it’s an easy hair-do that still looks polished. If gray is too understated for you, there are plenty of colorful sweat sets out there. Plus, tweak the look for colder days by adding a puffer vest. Wear a fitted tank underneath so you can take off your sweatshirt during warmer days. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "High-Waisted Jeans & Cropped Tee",
      "content": "High-Waisted Jeans & Cropped Tee Baddies love high-waisted jeans because they create the illusion that you have longer legs. Plus, they make crop tops slightly more modest—whether you choose a fitted baby tee or a baggy cropped shirt. Complete the look with your favorite chunky sneakers and a subtle pair of earrings. If you want to make this baddie outfit a little extra, swap the sneakers for heels and the subtle earrings for bold hoops. If you’re wearing distressed jeans, consider layering fishnet tights underneath for added visual interest."

      "content": "Monochrome Co-ord Skirt & Top This baddie outfit has a feminine flair. It’s also versatile: choose a short skirt set (pleated for a sporty vibe) when you’re going to the gym or to hang with friends, and a long skirt set in a knit fabric for a low-key date night. Co-ords (matching sets) are a baddie staple for a reason: they’re easy to style but look thoughtfully put together. [4] X Research source When choosing a mini-skirt, fabric is important. Celebrity stylist Kalee Hewlett says she tells clients to choose skirts that have “a little bit of stretch because it's really challenging to walk when it’s that tight and the fabric doesn't breathe.” As for fabric type, she recommends authentic leather, stretch denim, or heavy stretch knits. Monochrome means one color, but that color is up to you. A warm burgundy or brown set is perfect for autumn. A white or gray set might be better suited for summertime."

[6] X Research source For a birthday night out with the girls, however, a dress with side, back, or stomach cutouts could be the move. Find a fitted dress with cutouts in one color that you feel sexy and confident wearing. Pair with simple heels in the same color. Finish the look with your favorite hoop earrings. Stylist Christina Santelli advises you to pick one curve to highlight and cover up elsewhere for a balanced, classy look. “Every woman has a part of their body, curves-wise, that they love. I would stick with [showing] that, [...] whatever it is.” Want to go bolder? Add sparkly gladiator heels to your look like fictional baddie Maddy Perez does in the show Euphoria .

A colorful body-con dress (one that fits very closely to your body) lets you show off your curves. [7] X Research source Adding a neon hue or vibrant pattern into the mix guarantees you’ll turn heads on a girls’ night or at your birthday dinner. Look for heels in a similar color to the body-con dress to avoid your footwear clashing with your outfit. Or, make the look comfortable with slim-fit sneakers and ankle socks."

Go for bright colors like pink, red, and blue—or interesting materials like velour, lace, and mesh. Finding a form-fitting jumpsuit that’s exactly your size and shape can be a challenge.
