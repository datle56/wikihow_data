      "content": "These signs have their differences, but they can make it work. Cancers are often sensitive and in touch with their emotions. As a Cardinal sign, they crave control, consistency, and stability in their home life. A Sagittarius loves to travel and learn new things. As a mutable sign, they want spontaneity and constant change in life. To forge a healthy relationship, the two signs will have to learn from each other's different lifestyles and find a compromise. Cancer is ruled by the Moon, the planet of instincts, emotional needs, and family. This influences most Cancers to be interested in committed relationships and even starting a family. [1] X Research source Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter, the planet of growth and change. This compels them to be drawn to adventure and the unknown. If they're in a committed relationship, they'll still need opportunities to explore and try new things. [2] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 326 wikiHow readers and 91% of them agreed that Cancers are generally family-oriented . [Take Poll] While many Sagittarians will want to settle down eventually, family is typically not their top priority."

      "content": "Cancer and Sagittarius process emotions differently. As a water sign, Cancers feel their emotions intensely. They may be a little moody sometimes, and they desire a stable partner to help ground them. Sagittarius is a fire sign, which makes them passionate, independent, and even a little impulsive. They prefer to cool off and process their emotions on their own first. To make things work, the two will need to understand and accommodate each other's emotional needs. [3] X Research source A Sagittarius can give their Cancer partner a little more reassurance every now and then. Encouraging words and expressions of commitment will give a Cancer the stability they're looking for. A Cancer can work on respecting a Sagittarius's need for independence. Allowing them space to process their emotions will make a Sagittarius feel more comfortable in a committed relationship."

      "content": "A Sagittarius may be a little more adventurous than a Cancer. People born in the sign of Sagittarius are often up for trying new things in the bedroom. They enjoy experimenting and might even be more open to non-monogamous relationships. Cancers are very loving and generous partners, but they might crave more traditional arrangements. The two can bring out the best in each other in the bedroom if they learn from each other's different styles. A Sagittarius can learn from Cancer's connection to their emotional side in the bedroom. A Cancer can take inspiration from a Sagittarius's adventurous nature and open their mind to trying new things."

      "title": "These signs need to communicate carefully to make things work.",
      "content": "These signs need to communicate carefully to make things work. Sagittarius is known for their frank and honest communication style, and Cancer is often referred to as one of the zodiac's most sensitive signs. If the two aren't careful, this combination can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings. They'll have to understand each other's different communication styles to get on the same page. [4] X Research source A Sagittarius can work on thinking before they speak, especially in conflict, to avoid hurting their Cancer partner's feelings. A Cancer can learn to see the benefits of Sagittarius's honesty. They'll always know what they're thinking, for example, and can be pretty certain that their partner is always telling the truth."

      "title": "They may need to work hard to establish trust.",
      "content": "They may need to work hard to establish trust. A Sagittarius loves making new friends and building connections everywhere they go. This might make a more traditional Cancer uneasy, as they may worry about being cheated on or left behind. To find a compromise, the pair will need to set boundaries that they're both comfortable with in a committed relationship. Once they do that, they can learn to trust and relax with each other. [5] X Research source A Sagittarius can make a Cancer feel more comfortable by assuring them that they're a priority. Setting a weekly date night and sending them thoughtful, affectionate texts will make them feel more at ease. A Cancer can learn to trust a Sagittarius by taking their need for new connections less personally. It doesn't mean that they don't care deeply about their partner; they just love meeting new people, too!"

A Sagittarius's fun-loving way of life can bring a Cancer out of their shell and help them remain open to new experiences. A Cancer's emotional intuition and caring nature can encourage a Sagittarius to explore their deeper feelings and get vulnerable. Together, they can strike the perfect balance between adventure and stability. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Cons: These signs have pretty different values when it comes to relationships. Once a Cancer finds love, they usually want to settle down and spend most of their time with their partner. Unlike their Cancer partner, a Sagittarius will always want to make new friends and experience new things (even if they've found the love of their life). They'll have to talk openly about their expectations in a committed relationship so that both partners can feel fulfilled and secure. [7] X Research source"
