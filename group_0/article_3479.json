      "content": "Plan to live in California for at least 9 months of the year. When you move to California, you can immediately begin establishing your status as a resident. However, you will not be considered a legal resident in the state unless you live there at least 3/4 of the year. If you have homes in more than one state, your California home should be your primary residence. If you are trying to establish your residency in order to qualify for state tuition, you must live in California for more than a year (at least 366 days) directly before the residence determination date. To get state tuition you must also come to California with the intent to live there, not just to go to school."

Save copies of this paperwork, as you’ll need it to demonstrate that you do in fact live in California now."

Depending on where you move from and which bank you are using, you may or may not be able to simply change your address. Oftentimes, your bank must transfer your accounts to your new state. This is because states can have different banking laws and some banks have regional systems. If your bank account has been at a local bank, close out your old account and open a new account at a California-based bank. To transfer your account at a national or international banking institution, you may have to meet with a branch representative in-person, but some banking institutions allow you to call to arrange to have your accounts moved to the new state.

You can attain residency status if your parents live in the state, but if they live outside the state, you must be financially independent.

You must also be unmarried and not claimed as a dependent on anyone else’s tax return. You must have supported yourself financially for two years before applying for residency status. Your money can be earned or borrowed, but loans must be in your name only. You must show documentation of where your money came from, such as pay stubs, loan documents, and bank statements. You cannot have been claimed as a dependent on another person’s taxes during the two years you supported yourself. Free room and board, even if gained through barter, does not count as self-sufficiency.
