But when you have a plan in place, all you need to do next time the thoughts come is pull out your plan and start going down the list. Keep completing each step on the list until you've reached a point where you feel safe again. Here's an example of a safety plan: [8] X Research source 1. Read my list of Things I Love. Remind myself of the things that have prevented me from taking my life so far. 2. Read my list of Good Distractions. Distract myself from my thoughts with anything I can do that helps. This could be taking a walk in my neighborhood or watching my favorite movie, for example. 3. Read my list of People I Can Call. Add friends and family that deeply care about me. Call the first person on the list to talk. Keep calling people until I reach someone who can talk to me for as long as I need to talk. 4. Delay my suicide attempt and make my home safe. If I have a suicide plan, promise myself that I'll wait at least 48 hours before I take action on my plan. In the meantime, get rid of pills, sharp objects, and other items that could affect my safety. 5. Call someone to come stay with me. If no one can stay, call my therapist or a crisis number. 6. Go to a place where I feel safe, like my parents' house, a friend's house, or a community center. 7. Go to the emergency room. 8. Call the Emergency Services ."

[9] X Research source All feelings are fleeting and fluctuate over time, just like sometimes you are hungry or sad or tired or angry, your suicidal feelings and thoughts will pass.

If the first alternative method of achieving your goals in a more healthy way doesn’t work, try something else. [11] X Research source Remember that not everything can be achieved overnight. Your goal may take time to be realized. If you are suffering from severe depression, this kind of goal-oriented approach may not be your best option, given that people suffering from major depression tend to ruminate and have impaired problem-solving abilities.
