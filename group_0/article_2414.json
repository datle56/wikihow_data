      "content": "Scrub the potatoes. Turn the cold water on at the sink, and hold the potatoes under the running water. Use a vegetable brush to scrub at the skins to remove any dirt and debris. Pat the potatoes dry with a clean kitchen towel or paper towel. [1] X Research source Large russet potatoes work best for baking, so be sure to choose the largest available. If you notice any blemishes in the potatoes' skins, use a paring knife to cut them away."

      "content": "Rub the potatoes with olive oil. Drizzle the clean potatoes with olive oil, using approximately 1 tablespoon (15 ml) for every potato that you're baking. Use clean hands to gently rub the oil into the potato skins, so they’re evenly coated. [2] X Research source The procedure for baking russet potatoes in the oven is the same whether you’re making 4 potatoes or just a single potato, so adjust the recipe based on how many people you’re serving."

      "title": "Prick the potatoes with a fork.",
      "content": "Prick the potatoes with a fork. Steam can build up inside the potatoes as they cook, so it’s important to make sure that it can be released to prevent the potatoes from exploding. Press the tines of a fork into the potatoes 8 to 12 times to ensure that there are holes on all sides. [4] X Research source Make sure that you push the fork into the potatoes, so the indentation is at least 1 ⁄ 2 inch (13 mm) deep."

      "title": "Place the potatoes on the middle rack.",
      "content": "Place the potatoes on the middle rack. Using the center rack ensures that the potatoes cook evenly. You can place them directly on the rack, but oil and moisture may drip off during baking, so setting a baking sheet on the rack beneath it helps keep your oven from getting too dirty. If you prefer, you can also place the potatoes on a foil-lined baking sheet and set it on the center rack. [6] X Research source Placing the potatoes directly on the oven rack creates a crispier skin. You can also wrap the individual potatoes in foil and place them directly on the oven rack if you prefer. However, the skins can sometimes get soggy because of the trapped steam inside the foil."

      "content": "Bake the potatoes for 50 to 60 minutes. Allow them to bake until the skin is dry and the insides are soft. You can test for doneness by piercing the potatoes with a fork -- if the tines easily press into the flesh, the potatoes are done baking. [7] X Research source While the potatoes are cooking, it’s a good idea to turn them every 20 minutes for even baking."

Set them down on a plate, and allow them to cool for about 3 minutes. [8] X Research source If you baked the potatoes on a baking sheet, remove them from the sheet to set them aside for cooling. If you wrapped the potatoes in foil for baking, carefully unwrap them for cooling. Be sure to use an oven mitt or potholder to remove the foil because it will be hot."

Heat them on high until they feel soft when you squeeze them. [11] X Research source If the potatoes are still hard after another 5 minutes, continue heating them in 1 minute increments until they’re done. Be sure to use a pot holder to handle the plate and a pair of tongs to turn and squeeze the potato because they'll both be very hot."

Because the slow cooker uses such a low temperature, the potatoes will take longer to bake than in a conventional oven. Check on the potatoes to see if you can pierce them with a fork after 8 hours. If they’re still hard, they may need up to 10 hours of baking. [15] X Research source Avoid opening the slow cooker while the potatoes are baking because you may increase their cooking time."
