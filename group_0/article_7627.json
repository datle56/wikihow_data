      "content": "Open the windows and doors in the area for ventilation. When using bleach, it's always a good idea to create good ventilation. Try to open as many nearby windows as you can, particularly if there's one in the bathroom. If there's not a window in the bathroom, place a fan blowing air out of the bathroom toward an open window."

      "content": "Put on gloves and goggles. Choose gloves that won't let the mold through, such as rubber cleaning gloves or latex gloves. Don't touch the mold with your hands. Similarly, goggles are a good idea, as you don't want to flip mold spores into your eyes accidentally.

These precautions will also protect you from the bleach."

      "content": "Mix 1 cup (0.24 L) of bleach into 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Measure out the water first, and then pour the bleach into the water. Use a spoon or a paint stick to stir it together so it is well mixed. Try not to splash it as you're stirring. Make sure you never mix bleach with ammonia, as it creates toxic gases. If you prefer, you can start out with an antifungal cleaning solution that doesn't contain ammonia, then follow up with bleach after you get most of the mold off. [2] X Research source If you donâ€™t have bleach, 3% hydrogen peroxide can also kill mold. Reader Poll: We asked 357 wikiHow readers which chemical solution they prefer to use to clean mold, and only 10% of them said 3% hydrogen peroxide. [Take Poll] While peroxide can be effective at removing mold, bleach may work better."
