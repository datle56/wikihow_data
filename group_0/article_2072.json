      "title": "Humor and intelligence are huge turn-ons for a Sag man.",
      "content": "Humor and intelligence are huge turn-ons for a Sag man. He enjoys fun, lighthearted conversation and loves to laugh. Hook him with a few good jokes and a friendly demeanor. If he likes talking to you and you can match his jokey intellect, you’ll have no problem moving things to the bedroom."

      "content": "A Sag guy loves to solve puzzles thanks to his ruling planet, Jupiter. Whether you’re telling him about your personal life or your wildest sexual fantasy, leave a few things to his imagination. He’ll love picking up the breadcrumbs and piecing together what you’re all about. Make sure to eventually let him in, though—he’ll be majorly attracted to you if he feels like he’s “solved” you. Try playful comments like: “Maybe I’ll tell you about my wildest fantasy…later.” “I’m always well-behaved when I go out! Or am I?” “Oh, I’ve had my share of crazy nights. That’s a story for another time, though.”"

      "title": "His fire sign nature wants to get busy now.",
      "content": "His fire sign nature wants to get busy now . Send him a text or call him over as soon as you’re ready to get it on. If he’s free, you’ll be treated to some fun instant gratification. If he’s occupied, you’ll both be in for a treat—his intense desire will build up until he can release it in a fiery burst of passion later. The longer you can playfully hold him off, the more worked up he’ll get. This could be a fun game since a Sagittarius man loves to chase and pursue. If you’re texting him, don’t hesitate to send some sexy snapshots or nudes (if you’re comfortable). There’s a good chance he’ll ask to see some anyway."

      "title": "Your Sagittarius man won’t hesitate to fulfill your deepest desires.",
      "content": "Your Sagittarius man won’t hesitate to fulfill your deepest desires. In fact, he’ll make it his mission to satisfy you better than anyone has before. Tell him every detail about what you want him to do—the dirtier, the better. He’s an ambitious guy and once you give him a goal to hit, there’s nothing he won’t do to accomplish it. A Sag man doesn’t respond well to gushing or flowery language. Get right to the dirty details (he’ll appreciate the down-to-business attitude)."

      "title": "A blunt Sag man needs someone to match him.",
      "content": "A blunt Sag man needs someone to match him. A confident sexual partner who knows exactly what they like and is down to try new things is very attractive to him. He’s not usually one for guessing games in bed either, so be clear about what you want—the payoff will be worth putting yourself out there! State things simply, like: “I like it when you touch me there.” “Do that again!” “Put your hands around my waist while you do that.”"

      "title": "A Sagittarius guy goes wild for a sexy outfit.",
      "content": "A Sagittarius guy goes wild for a sexy outfit. Ask him if you can model the new underwear or sexy lingerie you just bought and you’ll have 100% of his attention (and his jaw open all the way to the floor). If you really want to play with him, text him about how you can’t wait to show off for him when he gets home. He’ll burst through the door like a wrecking ball to see what you’ve got. Try a lap dance or a strip tease to really get him excited. Wear something skimpy and don’t take too long to take it off—a Sag man isn’t super patient when he’s in the mood. Ask him to pick out new lingerie for you to wear. The question “What do you want to see me wear?” is an instant attention-grabber (and huge turn on)."

      "title": "The hips and thighs are erogenous zones for a Sagittarius man.",
      "content": "The hips and thighs are erogenous zones for a Sagittarius man. Run your hand along his thighs (inner or outer) to instantly grab his sexual attention. Try placing his hand on your hip or thigh too, since these are parts of you he’ll want to explore. He’ll waste no time whisking you away to the bed after this, so make sure you’re prepared for a fast turn around! Emphasize your own thighs and hips with sexy stockings, garters, or fishnets. He’ll love the look (and the chance to take them off later). Play with positions in bed where he can stroke or kiss your thighs and vice versa. A daring Sag man is attracted to any kind of public touching. Take a risk and squeeze his butt or inconspicuously graze the front of his pants while you’re out"

      "title": "A Sagittarius man is naturally dominant in the bedroom.",
      "content": "A Sagittarius man is naturally dominant in the bedroom. He’s super attracted to anyone that likes a submissive role and is probably eager to try any bondage or S&M ideas you might have. Tell him not to hold back—he’ll jump at the invitation to let loose and explore a new dimension of your sexual relationship. Reassure him during sex that he’s doing what you like. He’ll be highly attracted to you when he knows he can give you what you need. If you’re exploring domination or BDSM for the first time, have a conversation beforehand about each other’s limits and boundaries so the experience is enjoyable and safe for both of you."

      "title": "Your Sag man needs to explore new things in and out of bed.",
      "content": "Your Sag man needs to explore new things in and out of bed. Show him you can be adventurous in everyday life with impromptu dates, exciting outdoor activities, or last-minute trips out of town. In bed, surprise him with new toys, positions, or sexy outfits. He seeks novelty and wants to try everything at least once! [1] X Research source New locations are a big attraction to him. Pull him aside at a party, pull over on the side of the highway, or drag him to a secluded outdoor space. He’ll love it. Routine and monotony are some of his biggest turn offs. The fresher things are, the more attracted to you he’ll be. He’ll suggest new things to you too and might feel put off or disappointed if his ideas are turned down. Communicate to find a good balance between his wants and your boundaries."

      "content": "A Sag man mostly views sex as physical and athletic. His dream partner is someone who brings a fun, excited energy to the bedroom and doesn’t take things too seriously. Keep things light and don’t be afraid to laugh or crack a joke mid-sex. It’ll make him feel more comfortable and attracted to you. A Sag man has a fear of commitment, and too much emotional exposure right off the bat can push him away."

      "content": "Sagittarius men need freedom in and out of the bedroom. Let your man have plenty of alone time to explore his interests, socialize, or travel. His wanderlust and sense of adventure are his most defining traits, and he’ll be attracted to anyone that understands this about him. If a Sag man thinks you’re controlling or you want too much from him, he’ll take off. If he chooses to stick around and engage in intimacy, that’s a huge sign of interest! [2] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 December 2021. Show him that you need space too by not being instantly available when he asks. He’ll be attracted to someone who has their own life to live (and will be turned on by the chase)."
