In most cases, you'll have to press (or press-and-hold) a button on the speaker until you hear a sound or see a light flash. If the speaker is battery-powered, make sure the batteries are charged before attempting to pair. If it requires a power source, plug the speaker in securely and turn it on. Consult the user's manual or manufacturer's website of your Bluetooth speaker device to learn how to put it in pairing mode if you can't find this button."
