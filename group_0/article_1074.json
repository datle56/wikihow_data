      "title": "Spray your aluminum with bleach.",
      "content": "Spray your aluminum with bleach. Wear a mask and protective gloves when working with bleach. Do this in a well-ventilated area so fumes can easily disperse. Put regular bleach in a spray bottle and spray it onto the aluminum. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Let the aluminum sit in the sun for a few hours.",
      "content": "Let the aluminum sit in the sun for a few hours. Set the aluminum outside in the sun for several hours. The sun speeds up the process and helps the bleach distress the metal. Soon, the chemical reaction will create an aged look on your aluminum. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Rinse off the bleach.",
      "content": "Rinse off the bleach. Use running water to rinse the bleach off the aluminum, or soak the aluminum in a container of water for a few minutes. If your aluminum piece has electronic parts or other things that would prevent you from rinsing or submerging it in water, use a clean, white cloth to wipe the bleach off the surface of the aluminum."

      "title": "Wrap your aluminum piece in aluminum foil.",
      "content": "Wrap your aluminum piece in aluminum foil. Place your aluminum piece on a sheet of aluminum foil with the shiny side facing away from the aluminum piece. Fold the foil over so it covers the aluminum piece but is not sealed. The aluminum foil creates distortions as well as a rainbow pattern on the aluminum due to the heat and chemical reaction.

      "title": "Load your aluminum pieces in the dishwasher.",
      "content": "Load your aluminum pieces in the dishwasher. Keep the open ends of the aluminum foil facing upwards so that the water can run down into the package. Stack your pieces in the dish rack of the washer. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill the dispenser with powdered dishwashing detergent and TSP. Add powdered dishwashing detergent, like Cascade Complete or Finish Dishwasher Powder, to the dispenser. Then, add 1 teaspoon of trisodium phosphate (TSP) to the dispenser. [6] X Research source TSP can be found at your local hardware or home improvement store."

Sprinkle a few tablespoons of an oxygen-based cleaner (like Oxi-Clean, Clorox Oxygen Action, All Oxi-Active, or Shout Oxy Powder) in the bottom of the container. [10] X Research source You can make your own oxygen cleaner by combining 1 part sodium percarbonate (dry, powdered hydrogen peroxide) and 1 part sodium carbonate (washing soda or soda ash). [11] X Research source Take care not to confuse either of those powders with sodium bicarbonate (baking soda)."
