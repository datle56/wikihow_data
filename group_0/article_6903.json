A common name, like DoeHome, can invite hackers to use common passwords to crack that locked network (using, for example, the Does' pet's name or the street they are on).

Resetting your router will change the network's name back to the name (or \"SSID\") printed on the back or bottom of the router. If you reset your router, you'll need to reconnect manually every Internet-connected item in your home to the router."
