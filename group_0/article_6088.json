      "title": "Follow your sewer pipe to locate your septic tank.",
      "content": "Follow your sewer pipe to locate your septic tank. Look in your basement or crawlspace for your sewer pipe. Follow the direction of the sewer pipe to identify the general location of your septic system. Go back outside and look around in that area to identify your septic tank. Find a pipe that you know is a drain, such as a pipe coming from a toilet or a sink, and follow it until it connects to a larger pipe. The larger pipe is your sewer pipe. Once you locate your septic tank, draw a map of its location so you can find it in the future. Typically, septic tanks are at least 15 ft (4.6 m) away from your home.

      "title": "Remove the dirt covering the top of your tank.",
      "content": "Remove the dirt covering the top of your tank. If your tank is buried underground, you'll need to expose the top of it so you can inspect and access it. Use a shovel to remove enough dirt to allow you to see the top of the tank and the manhole. Be careful not to drive the blade of the shovel into the septic system when you dig. Uncover the tank just enough to inspect it so you can bury it again when you're done so it isn't visible."

    {
      "title": "Check for any cracks or damage to the septic tank.",
      "content": "Check for any cracks or damage to the septic tank. Whenever you expose the top of the tank, look over the surface of it. Look for rust, dents, cracks, or any other signs of damage to the tank. Serious damage will require an inspection and possibly repairs from a septic tank specialist. [2] X Research source Lots of corrosion and rust could mean it's time for you to replace your tank."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flush a toilet to make sure the tank is working properly.",
      "content": "Flush a toilet to make sure the tank is working properly. A simple way to test if your plumbing is working correctly and traveling all the way to the septic tank is to check the connections by running water through them. Stand near the tank, have someone flush a toilet, and listen for the water traveling to the tank. [3] X Research source If you see water bubbling through the ground or a crack in the system, your tank is in need of a repair from a septic tank specialist."

      "content": "Cut 6 inches (15 cm) off of a 10 ft (3.0 m) PVC pipe . In order to measure the scum level in your septic system, you need to create a measuring stick out of PVC pipe. Use a saw or a pipe cutter to remove a small section from the larger pipe. PVC pipe is relatively cheap and can be found at home improvement stores and online. Use sandpaper to smooth the edges of the cut pipe if necessary. Cut the pipe evenly to form a straight edge that will fit into an elbow joint."

      "content": "Glue the smaller segment to the larger pipe with an elbow joint. Take a PVC elbow joint and insert the smaller section into it. Apply glue to the pipe and joint to seal them together. Then, insert the larger pipe into the joint and apply glue to connect them. You can find elbow joints that will fit your PVC pipes at hardware or home improvement stores. Use superglue and use enough to create a tight seal."

      "content": "Place plastic caps on both ends of the pipe. Use plastic caps designed to fit over PVC pipes and seal both ends of the “L” shaped pipe with them. They should snap securely into place to create a seal. You can find plastic caps for PVC pipes at hardware and home improvement stores, or online."

      "title": "Insert the pipe into the septic system until it contacts the scum.",
      "content": "Insert the pipe into the septic system until it contacts the scum. You need to measure 2 levels to find the depth of the scum in your tank. Insert the short end of the “L” shaped pipe into the manhole of your tank until it makes contact with the top of the liquid in the tank with the long side sticking straight up. This is the top of the scum layer. [4] X Research source Allow the pipe to float on the top surface for an accurate measurement."

      "title": "Use a marker to mark the pipe at the top of the manhole.",
      "content": "Use a marker to mark the pipe at the top of the manhole. To take your first measurement, mark the pipe where it's even with the top of the manhole as a reference point. The pipe should be floating on top of the scum layer. [5] X Research source Make sure the line that you mark is straight and even. Use a black marker so it's easier to see against the white PVC pipe."

    {
      "title": "Push the pipe through the scum then mark it again.",
      "content": "Push the pipe through the scum then mark it again. After you've taken your measurement of the top layer of the scum, push the pipe down through the scum until it contacts the bottom of the dense layer of scum and reaches the wastewater layer. Then mark the pipe where it's even with the top of the manhole. [6] X Research source Keep the pipe still while you hold it against the bottom of the tank so it doesn't move when you mark it. The wastewater layer will have much less resistance and will tell you that you've reached the bottom of the scum layer."

If the scum layer is within 6 inches (15 cm) of the bottom of the outlet baffle, or the pipe you can see in the opening of the manhole, your tank needs to be pumped.

      "content": "Wrap a white towel around 1 end of the pipe. You need a white cloth or towel to use to measure your sludge level so you can easily see the stain marking that the sludge will leave. Wrap the towel around 1 end of the pipe and then wrap tape around it so it's tight and secure. You can use any type of tape, but be sure to use enough to secure the cloth to the pipe."
