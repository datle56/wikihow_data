      "content": "The vast majority of Kennedy half dollars are not worth much. Kennedy 50-cent pieces have been printed for a long time. The US Mint has released them every year from 1964-2002, so there are a lot of them floating around. Some special misprints, proofs, and rare print runs are worth some solid money, but the vast majority of them are worth $0.50-3. [1] X Research source Why were the Kennedy half dollars made? In 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald. The country was shocked and devastated. The US Mint planned to release the half dollars starting in 1964 to honor Kennedy’s memory. Kennedy half dollars will likely fetch more money in the future. The US Mint has officially stopped making these coins, so they’ll only become more rare with each passing year. If you own any of these coins and you don’t need the money now, consider holding on to them. They might be worth a lot later!"

Most of the Kennedy half dollar printings were either 40% silver or 10% nickel. These are highly reflective metals, which gives the vast majority of the mint and uncirculated coins a reflective sheen that is especially bright for a half dollar. If your coin is bright, clean, and well-defined, it's probably worth more. [3] X Research source If you do have an especially high-quality coin and it isn’t protected, get a coin case or coin sleeve to keep it safe."

It’s not usually much of a difference, but the Kennedy half dollars that were minted in San Francisco are slightly less common than their Denver or Philadelphia counterparts. These coins are stamped with an “S,” short for San Francisco. [4] X Research source Where are the mint stamps on Kennedy half dollars? Look below the right claw on the eagle for older coins. For newer coins, look below the neck on the front of the coin. P stands for Philadelphia. D stands for Denver. S stands for “San Francisco.” No mint mark means the coin was minted in Philadelphia."

The initial print run depicted JFK with very defined hair, but Jacqueline Kennedy (the president’s widow) didn’t like the way the hair looked and asked for a new design. As a result, these coins fetch a special premium. [5] X Research source How much are they worth? These are especially rare, so they can fetch up to $156,000 if they’re in good condition."

These coins are known as the “accent hair” version because they have an odd and distinct hair pattern—there’s an extra tuft of hair above Kennedy’s ear that looks kind of out of place. The “I” in “LIBERTY” is also missing a serif on these coins. [7] X Research source How much are they worth? Regular coins are worth up to $3,000, while the cameos can fetch up to $20,000."

Millions of these coins were printed to accommodate demand at the Denver mint, but the supply has dwindled over the years and now they’re considered relatively rare if they’re in mint condition. [8] X Research source How much are they worth? If they’re worn to bits, they’re only worth face value. However, certified mint coins from 1976 regularly fetch over $5,000, with one coin collecting $10,000 at an auction."

That’s because 1971 is the year the Mint changed the composition of the coin, going from 89% silver to 40% silver. Less than 500 mint-condition coins from this run exist, making them especially valuable. How much are they worth? Up to $13,000."

[9] X Research source Are they worth anything? Like Kennedy half dollars, most Franklin half dollars are worth $0.50-3. However, the 1953-S and 1955 mints are sought after, and can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars depending on the condition. What’s the most expensive Franklin half dollar? That prize goes to the 1963 FBL (full bell line) strike, which sells for as much as $89,000."

Barber), the Barber half dollars depict “Liberty” wearing a Phrygian cap and a laurel wreath on their head. These coins were circulated from 1892-1915. [10] X Research source Are they worth anything? Barber half dollars consistently fetch $20-300. Extremely high quality copies and uncirculated coins can cost $500-$2,000. What’s the most expensive Barber half dollar?

They show “Liberty” in stride carrying a giant pine branch (weird, right? It was supposed to represent America). Unlike Barber half dollars, these coins fluctuate wildly in value depending on the year and condition of the coin. [11] X Research source Are they worth anything? These coins usually fetch $10-20 for circulated coins, although higher-quality specimens may cost anywhere from $200-10,000 depending on the year and version.

Only 5,000 of them were printed back in the 17th century, and collectors assume they’ve all been lost to history. [12] X Research source How much are they worth? The “arrow” version of the coin regularly fetches $1,000-10,000, so it’s safe to say the no-arrow version would fetch exponentially more. It’s theorized they’d be worth at least $1,000,000!"

Due to the metal composition of these coins, most of them have developed an absolutely beautiful patina that collectors love. How much are they worth?

The thing about rare coins is that they tend to appreciate in value the longer they’ve been out of circulation, so consider holding on to your Kennedy half dollars and waiting to see what happens to the price!
