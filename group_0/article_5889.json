[7] X Expert Source Janet Miranda Professional Hair Stylist & Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 11 February 2021. If you are trying to let your hair grow out, nip the damaged and split ends for health just the same. You will still gain length! Hair that is allowed to grow untrimmed will eventually start to break at the ends from wear, and you will lose hair faster than it can grow. Short hair should be trimmed every 4-8 weeks to maintain your style and cut. [8] X Research source Medium length hair should be trimmed 6-12 weeks. [9] X Research source Long hair should be trimmed every 8-12 weeks. [10] X Research source"

Thicker hair types should choose to maintain long hairstyles at least below your shoulders, as short cuts can poof out and appear frizzy. You should also ask your stylist for long layers around your face to create a flattering shape. [11] X Research source Thin hair should avoid layers and embrace an easy one length cut. Any length is fine, but make sure you don't add bangs! [12] X Research source If your hair is curly, opt for an angular lob that is longer in the front than in the back. You should also ask your stylist for layers to thin out your hair. [13] X Research source Wavy haired styles can go either any length. Just make sure to ask for layers and touch up any frizz with your favorite styling product. [14] X Research source For straight hair, well-blended layers and long locks are your best friends.

      "content": "Use conditioner and moisturizing products liberally. If your hair is very dry, lacks oils, and extremely unmanageable, you do not need to use shampoo. If you use shampoo, choose a sulfate-free shampoo and concentrate on lathering it onto your scalp. Allow it to rinse off to the ends of your hair. If your hair ends up being over-hydrated and greasy, decrease the amount of and frequency of conditioner. [19] X Research source Apply deep conditioner to your hair once a week before you shower. Protect it with a shower cap. The steam from the shower will be enough. [20] X Research source Move on to wash your body, shave, and whatever else you need, then rinse out your hair with cool water as normal. Instead of drying your hair after your shower, apply conditioner in your hair while you're still in the shower. Comb your hair afterwards, and don't rinse the product out. [21] X Research source"

      "content": "Straighten your hair minimally, and reduce heat exposure. Ironing causes a circular problem. You may desire to straighten it, but the heat causes even more frizz. If one section of your hair is more curly than the rest, like your hairline, try to straighten only the \"problem\" areas. Use a good ceramic round brush to straighten the rest to minimize heat exposure. Invest in good straightening tools. Ensure that your flat iron has a thermostat, and use minimum heat to straighten your hair. Stay in a range of 200-350 degrees. [28] X Research source Do not straighten the same parts over and over again. Section out your hair, and use clips to stay on track. [29] X Research source"
