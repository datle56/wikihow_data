      "content": "Take a few deep breaths to calm yourself before you ask. It can be really hard to admit your feelings to someone that you like a lot. It’s a big step! Calm yourself by focusing on your breathing, or even just by focusing on what’s going on around you instead of what you’re about to do. [1] X Research source If you think you’re getting cold feet, try to remember that you’re crush is just a person, like you, and they get nervous too sometimes. If you can't bring yourself to do it, set yourself an incentive. Say, \"I need to ask them out before Friday, or else I can't go to the party on Friday night.\" Give yourself a reason to cut through your hesitation."

      "title": "Be direct about your feelings to make your intentions clear.",
      "content": "Be direct about your feelings to make your intentions clear. Instead of dropping hints and hoping they get the message, just tell them how you feel. Being vague might make them think you just want to be their friend instead of go out with them. It might be scary, but it also makes things so much more straightforward. Start with something like, \"Hey, I like you a lot, and I want to spend more time with you.\" Avoid dramatic statements like, “I think I’m in love with you,” which might be too much, too soon. [2] X Research source Putting your own feelings out there first can be intimidating, but making that first move and showing vulnerability makes it much easier for the other person to be vulnerable, too. Who knows, they might even be hoping that you’ll ask them out!"

[3] X Expert Source Collette Gee Relationship Coach & Certified Violence Prevention Specialist Expert Interview. 1 May 2020. Suggest something fun and cheap that you'll both enjoy, like going to a movie, a hike, a museum, or a school event. You might also ask them to hang out at your house, or to have a picnic together at the park. If there is a school dance coming up, ask your crush to go as your date.

      "content": "Go on a couple dates before you ask them to be your partner. Asking them to be your girlfriend or boyfriend right off the bat might be a little intimidating for them, or make them too nervous to say yes. [4] X Research source Enjoy your time together, and if things are great after 2-3 dates, then ask them for something a little more serious. Say something like, “I’ve really liked hanging out, and I want to be more than friends. Do you want to be my partner?” or, “Can I ask you out on the next date as my boyfriend [or girlfriend]?”"

      "title": "Respect a rejection, and don’t take it too hard.",
      "content": "Respect a rejection, and don’t take it too hard. Rejection happens sometimes, and it hurts, but what matters is that you put yourself out there. After you do it once, it’ll be easier the next time, when you know a little more about what to expect. [5] X Research source It doesn’t mean you’re any less worthy, and you can never know for sure what the other person is thinking. If you’re turned down, be proud of yourself for taking that step, and know that you’re in good company—pretty much everyone who’s ever dated has been turned down at some point. Also, don’t push the subject if you do get rejected. Pushing them to say yes only creates more distance between you, and makes it hurt longer for both of you. There are plenty of other fish in the sea. Pick yourself up after a rejection by spending some time with your close friends or doing things you enjoy to take your mind off of it, or write your feelings in a journal to get them out. Remember that you’re totally awesome, even if they don’t see it!"

      "content": "Ask them in-person to show off your confidence. It’s tempting to shoot them a text so you don’t have to say it to their face—and if that’s how you roll, go for it!—but an in-person exchange is much more personal and comes off as more confident and self-assured. Plus, when you do it via text, it’s way too easy to tap out a long message that you worry over for hours before sending. In person, it’s more like ripping off a bandaid, but a bandaid that could pay off big time. [6] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 November 2019. Make sure you look presentable! No need to pop on a suit and tie, and go ahead and stick to your personal style.

      "content": "Talk to them when they’re relaxed to catch them in the right mood. Find a time when neither of you has anywhere else to be, and when neither of you are stressed or in a rush. If possible, pick a place where you're both comfortable, and where you would normally hang out or run into each other, like at school or a friend’s house, to make the vibe as laid-back as possible. A group hang-out is a great opportunity, since they’re already having fun with their friends. Or, just pop the question during your regular day, like between classes, where they’re comfortable in their routine. Be patient! If something comes up, or your best friend cuts into the conversation, try again some other time. A more careful and relaxed opportunity is better than getting the question out in a hurry or while you’re distracted."

      "content": "Ask them when you’re alone to give your crush some privacy. Many people get nervous when put on the spot, especially in front of their friends or other people, and might say no just because they’re embarrassed. Instead, wait for a moment where you’re both alone to relieve some pressure. [8] X Research source Try to ask them in a context where they could exit the situation if they feel uncomfortable, like during lunch or after school, rather than when they’re sitting next to you in class. Ask them to take a walk with you: home from school, between classes, or around the block. Or, ask your crush to step outside with you for a second. Say, \"Can I talk to you alone for a minute?\" or, \"Want to walk to class with me?\" Or, invite them on a group activity, like an outing to the zoo or the park, then wait until you’re alone together—ask them to accompany you on a side-trip, like to a particular exhibit or to duck into a store together, away from the group."

      "title": "Introduce yourself if you haven’t already.",
      "content": "Introduce yourself if you haven’t already. It’s way easier to ask them out if you know each other a little better, and they’re more likely to say \"yes\" if you’ve had a few conversations already. Start just by introducing yourself and paying them a simple compliment, like, “I love your shoes!” Or, ask them to do a small favor for you as an excuse to talk to them, like reminding you of what you have to do for homework that night.

If you’re in a club together, ask them how long they’ve been interested in the club’s theme."

You don't need to be best friends, and you don't need to tell each other everything, but getting to know them a bit better helps you bond, which in turn makes the asking easier. [11] X Research source Ask them what sort of movies or books they like, or just what they do in their free time. You might find that you share some interests, and if you don’t, ask them to tell you more about the things they’re into. Also, try walking to class with your crush, or invite them to a group activity, like bowling or just a hangout with your friends, where you can learn more about them with lower stakes than a full date. Asking what the highlight of their day was is a great way to find out more about things they might not otherwise talk about.

They might be off-put if you ask their friends for that info, and just scrolling their profile and liking their posts will only get you so far. Asking for a number is no big deal, and shows how confident you are, in the process. Say something like, “I like talking with you, can I get your number to keep the convo going?” or, “I want to let you know when the group is hanging out! What’s your contact info?” Once you have their number, shoot them a text like, “Hey, it’s [your name]! Can’t wait to hang out again :)”"
