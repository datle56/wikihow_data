      "title": "Smudge herbs to smoke-cleanse your home.",
      "content": "Smudge herbs to smoke-cleanse your home. Open all the doors and windows and light a bundle of sage, palo santo , or lavender—all herbs renowned for their cleansing abilities—to smudge your house . Walk through your home with the herbs and let the smoke touch every space and corner before snubbing the herbs in a fireproof bowl. [1] X Research source White sage is a great cleanser, but almost everything on the market has been illegally harvested from indigenous (Native American) land. If you want to use this herb, consider growing the sage yourself. Pay extra attention to highly trafficked areas, like bathrooms, hallways, and doorways, as they can trap extra energy."

    {
      "title": "Write the name of the person you’re banishing on a slip of paper and burn it.",
      "content": "Write the name of the person you’re banishing on a slip of paper and burn it. Light the paper over the fireproof bowl and throw it in. While it’s burning, think of the relief you’ll feel after the person is gone from your life. These spells are meant to be done without the intention of hurting someone else. If you’re being bullied or harassed by someone, seek external help to get them to stop ."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dispose of the ashes far away from your home.",
      "content": "Dispose of the ashes far away from your home. To complete the spell and remove the energy from yourself entirely, bury the ashes at a crossroads, scatter them in the wind, or just throw them away in a distant trashcan. [2] X Research source Wait until the ashes are entirely cool to dispose of them. Burying something at a crossroads symbolically disperses the energy, while throwing something to the wind takes it far away."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shower and light a white candle immediately after getting home.",
      "content": "Shower and light a white candle immediately after getting home. After the ritual is over, leave your shoes at the door and refresh yourself with a shower. This is thought to help prevent the negative energy from clinging to you. Light a white candle , symbolizing protection, and repeat positive affirmations, such as “I am at peace” or “[Person] is gone from my life”."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do a smoke cleanse.",
      "content": "Do a smoke cleanse. Open the doors and windows of your home to allow negative energies to disperse. Light incense or a smudging stick and walk through your home, taking care that the smoke gets into every corner. Good herbs to use for cleansing are sage, palo santo, and lavender."
    },
    {
      "title": "Light a black candle and ask whatever’s bothering you to leave.",
      "content": "Light a black candle and ask whatever’s bothering you to leave. Sometimes all you need to clear negative energy is to just ask! Light a black candle and tell the energy to leave your home. For example, say: “It’s time for you to move on; this is no place for you.” [3] X Research source Black is associated with banishment and is often used in these kinds of rituals."
    },
    {
      "title": "Concentrate on how you’ll feel when the energy is gone.",
      "content": "Concentrate on how you’ll feel when the energy is gone. Let yourself be washed with relief and peace, and visualize what your life will be like after the energy is banished. Meditate on this feeling until the candle burns out. [4] X Research source The flame is the energetic source of this spell, so blowing it out will dampen it. Instead, let it go out by itself. If you need to extinguish it for safety reasons, use a candle snuffer or a large glass to smother the flame."
    },
    {
      "title": "Close the doors and windows and sprinkle salt in front of them.",
      "content": "Close the doors and windows and sprinkle salt in front of them. Salt is considered a purifying agent in many magical practices. By lining the entryways to your home with salt, you create a protective barrier (so nothing comes back in!). This spell is on the lower end of potency and best used for minor problems."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write the person’s name on a slip of paper and burn the edges.",
      "content": "Write the person’s name on a slip of paper and burn the edges. Use a black candle (for banishment) to singe the edges of the paper. Burn as much as you can, all the way up to the name, if possible. To keep everything safe, burn the paper over a fireproof bowl."
    },
    {
      "title": "Focus on what you want while the paper burns.",
      "content": "Focus on what you want while the paper burns. Whether you’re being micromanaged or someone has an unrequited love for you, use your mind to tell the person what you want to happen. Say something like: “I am burning away the feelings you have for me.” [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Bury the paper near the place you see them most.",
      "content": "Bury the paper near the place you see them most. If you’re in the same space as this person regularly, like at work or school, you’ll probably not be able to get rid of them entirely. Instead, this spell acts as a ward to keep them minding their own business around you. [6] X Research source If you’re doing this spell for someone you don’t see in person (like an internet troll), you can combine it with the balloon spell to metaphorically send the message to them. Spells are thought to work on various levels. If you’re being harassed by a stranger the spell is more likely to completely banish them than if someone is leaving mean comments on your Instagram posts. Instead, it’ll help decrease the frequency of your interactions."
    },
    {
      "title": "Light two black candles on either side of a spell cloth.",
      "content": "Light two black candles on either side of a spell cloth. Lay a spell cloth out on a table and set the candles on either side. If you don’t have a spell cloth you can paint symbols like pentagrams, moon phases, and the sun on a black cloth. This spell uses black candles to symbolize banishment. Since they get infused with the energy of your spell, use candles that have never been lit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a doll to symbolize the person.",
      "content": "Make a doll to symbolize the person. Put your doll-making material between the two candles on the cloth, and start thinking about how much you want the person out of your life. Tuck a picture of them into the middle of the doll, and visualize being at peace when they’re gone. Use whatever material you like, such as cloth, clay, twigs, or wax. You can make this spell more powerful by adding a few guava leaves in with the photo."
    },
    {
      "title": "Singe the back of the doll with a candle.",
      "content": "Singe the back of the doll with a candle. Give the person some encouragement to beat it by heating things up. Don’t set them on fire though, just give it a little burn on its backside. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Dispose of the doll out of town.",
      "content": "Dispose of the doll out of town. Get that doll as far away as possible—for best results, bury it outside your city limits. This is a stronger spell, especially with the guava leaves. Only use this if you want someone to skip town!"

      "title": "Think about how you’ll feel when the person is out of your life.",
      "content": "Think about how you’ll feel when the person is out of your life. Imagine a weight being lifted from you, or your cares flying away. Concentrate on the feeling of relief that will come from the person’s banishment."

      "title": "Draw a pentagram (five-pointed star) with a circle in its center.",
      "content": "Draw a pentagram (five-pointed star) with a circle in its center. The pentagram calls upon the help of the five Wiccan elements, earth, water, fire, wind, and spirit. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Draw three arrows coming off the points of the pentagons. Draw the sides of the arrows with their ends curving up, like checkmarks. These arrows are representative of pushing away the energy."

    {
      "title": "Use the sigil in other banishment spells.",

To use it in a banishing spell, carve it on a black candle and say: “Begone, clinging energies, past tasks and situations, and all that lingers after their time is up”. [13] X Research source Let the candle burn down entirely. You can dress the candle further by anointing it with lemon , stinging nettle or mullien essential oils. Use this spell to neutralize energy in a space or object, but never on organic beings (humans, pets, etc). [14] X Research source It’s a strong spell meant to clear the energy out of something, and doing that to a living thing can get a little funky."
