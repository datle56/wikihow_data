      "content": "Scrape up solids and blot spills immediately. Wool naturally deters liquids from absorbing into its fibers, but that doesn't mean you should let spilled food or drink get a chance to stain. Scoop up solids without letting them dig deeper into the carpet and blot—don't rub—spills with a dry paper towel. [2] X Research source"

Fill a water bottle with warm water, spray a little on the spill after you have blotted all that you can up. Lightly rub the water onto the stain with a soft cloth or sponge and blot any excess water up with a dry cloth or paper towel."

Mix 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of wool detergent, 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of white vinegar, and 4.25 cups (1.01 L) of warm water.

      "content": "Steam-clean your carpet at least once a year. Wool is great at hiding dirt, but that doesn't mean it's not still there. Trapped sand and dried mud can wear out the fibers on a wool carpet the more you walk and rub your feet around on it. Steam clean at least once a year to remove all trapped dirt and consider cleaning it twice a year on highly used carpet. [5] X Research source"
