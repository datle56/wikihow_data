      "content": "A beta female is gentle, nurturing, and empathetic. Similar to the beta male, pop culture suggests that beta women value deep, personal connections with people more than power and attention.

They exude femininity and their endless well of compassion reminds a lot of people of their moms and sisters.

      "content": "Beta women can maintain a calm demeanor, even in arguments. Beta women aren’t the type to raise their voice at those they love, even if they’re angry. They try to use their empathy and patience to understand their partner's point of view, even if it differs from their own. They’re much more interested in fixing the core problems of their relationship than proving they’re right. [7] X Research source Beta women are all about communicating as effectively as possible . Easy ways to improve your communication with/as a beta woman include: being attentive when you speak to your partner, regularly using verbal affirmations like “I see,” and asking specific questions to demonstrate you understand where the other person is coming from.

Easy ways you can make a beta woman feel loved and trusted include: sending her a good morning and good night text each day, telling her secrets, or surprising her with small gifts every so often.

      "title": "Beta women use their compassion and ambition to help their partners.",
      "content": "Beta women use their compassion and ambition to help their partners. According to pop culture, betas are arguably the most helpful personality type out there. Betas will spend countless hours trying to better their partner’s life , be it through small habit changes like eating healthier or exercising more, or large shifts like overhauling their self-image or finding them a more fulfilling career. [10] X Trustworthy Source Mind U.K.-based mental health charity focused on providing advice and resources to anyone facing mental health problems.

      "title": "Put yourself out there every once in a while.",
      "content": "Put yourself out there every once in a while. If you’re a beta female, odds are you’re more comfortable in the background. However, if you don’t step into the sun, you risk other people overshadowing you or taking credit for all your wonderful qualities. Your relatability and skill at making others feel heard means you can probably get attention fairly easily already. Just avoid deflecting next time someone gives you recognition, even if it feels uncomfy at first. [14] X Research source Use your natural sense of fashion to stand out more too. Consider wearing a statement piece a few times a week to draw more eyes. Looking the part can boost your confidence."

      "content": "Learn to stand up for yourself when conflict arises. Get comfortable being more assertive next time you find yourself disagreeing with someone.

Remember: you can be gentle and uncompromising at the same time. [15] X Research source Start small when it comes to sticking up for yourself. For example, next time someone gets your order wrong (no matter how small), send it back. Then, work up to bigger disputes like work conflicts and family drama."

      "title": "Prioritize your own needs and peace as much as you prioritize others.",
      "content": "Prioritize your own needs and peace as much as you prioritize others. Your endless well of compassion likely means you’ll work tirelessly to make someone feel happy and appreciated. However, if you don’t feel that way yourself, your selflessness becomes harmful. Allocate a certain amount of time per day to helping others and don’t exceed it. In addition, set firm boundaries and express to others when you need time to replenish your mental and emotional energy.

Their loyalty and graciousness make them great friends and romantic partners. However, while betas prioritize personal relationships, deltas like to spend their time harnessing new skills.

      "content": "Gamma women are much more flamboyant and goofy than betas. Gamma women don’t have a whole lot in common with betas. They value action and are quick to make plans, while betas tend to hang back and assess the situation first. Plus, while beta and gamma women both have lots of friends, gammas are the life of the party and connect with their boisterous, fun-loving senses of humor rather than their gentle compassion.

They’re pragmatic and introverted, and they love learning new things, much like betas do. However, while betas love deeply connecting with people through shared feelings and personal experiences, omegas prefer to keep them at an arm’s length. They retreat into their books and ideas often.
