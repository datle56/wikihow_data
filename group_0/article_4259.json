      "content": "Print your boarding pass and check your luggage. Although many airlines allow you to check in and print your boarding pass online (if you’re not checking luggage), you can also choose to do so in person at the airport. Enter the airport in the section of your airline carrier, and locate their counter. When you get to the front desk, simply tell them your name and give them ID, and they should automatically print your boarding pass and ask about checked luggage. [1] X Research source If you have multiple flights due to layovers, ask the attendant to print your boarding passes for all flights. Some do this automatically, but it is good to ask if they don’t. Checked luggage must typically weigh less than 50lbs and costs about $25 to start. This varies from airline to airline though, so check your specific airline's requirements online. If you don’t want to worry about checking bags, you are allowed one carry on item and one personal item - one that goes under the seat in front of you, and one stored in the overhead bins above your seat. Ask the gate attendant if your bags are small enough to bring with you as carry-ons. If you print your boarding pass online and are not checking luggage, you can bypass stopping by the airlines counter. Reader Poll: We asked 268 wikiHow readers how far in advance they like to get to the airport, and 47% of them said 2 hours. [Take Poll] Get there early if you're not pre-printing your boarding pass at home."

      "title": "Head to security.",
      "content": "Head to security. If you have your boarding pass in hand and your carry-on luggage prepared, you can head to security. Have both your boarding pass out and a form of ID - either your driver’s license or your passport (it must be your passport if you’re heading out of the country) - readily available. A TSA agent will check your boarding pass to your ID, and then you must successfully pass through the security check. All of your belongings will need to be placed in bins and sent through an x-ray machine while you are being checked over in a separate machine that is able to scan the body or being examined by a wand scanner (for those with known medical devices). [2] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Transportation Security Administration U.S. government agency responsible for ensuring safety by setting and enforcing travel protocols Go to source Airports are very picky about security, but they will also be very vocal about it. Check for signs about what to do in order to successfully pass through security, and if you’re still not sure ask someone for help. Liquids and laptops must be in their own bins separate from other items. Any items (including gum and unused gum) that are found in your pockets must be placed in the bins to be scanned by the x-ray. Also, all airports will want you to place any metal objects in the bins as well (and that includes metal earrings and jewelry). Some security checkpoints require you to remove your belt, shoes and jackets; look for signs to see if your airport does as well. Some airports may ask you to remove your socks as well, but this varies. A TSA agent will guide you through the process if there happens to be an issue with something in your luggage or on yourself. If you have TSA Precheck printed on your boarding pass, visit the TSA PreCheck security line instead.

      "content": "Find your gate/terminal. Get your bags re-packed and put your shoes back on so that you can go wait for your plane in the correct terminal! Check your boarding pass for your terminal (typically a letter) and your gate (a number). There should be plenty of signs directing you to this area, but if you can’t seem to locate your gate and terminal, simply ask an airport or airline employee for help. [4] X Research source If your boarding pass does not have the terminal number (and very few don't these days), find a monitor with the flight schedules and check that instead."

      "title": "Hang out and wait for your plane.",
      "content": "Hang out and wait for your plane. It’s always good to arrive at the airport early so that you have time before boarding the plane, just in case you need it. Run to the bathroom, grab something to eat, or use your last few minutes of freedom to connect to the airport Wi-Fi. Boarding the plane typically begins half an hour before takeoff, so you may have plenty of time to kill. Be careful not to stray too far from your gate so that you don’t miss an important announcement about your flight or early boarding opportunities. If you want, you can speak to a flight attendant at the counter of your gate about changing your seats. This is the only opportunity you have to grab a different seat or to upgrade to business or first class. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Wait for the announcement to board.",
      "content": "Wait for the announcement to board. About half an hour prior to takeoff, the gate attendant will announce the boarding time. Boarding is done in sections, either by group/sections (designated with a letter) or by rows/seats. Check your boarding pass to see if you belong to a group, and if not, wait for your row or a section of rows to be called. First class always boards the plane first, followed by business class and people with disabilities or infants. Although it is not always the case, it may be beneficial to try to snag a place in line early on so that there is still room in the overhead bins for your luggage. Otherwise, if storage space runs out your bags will have to be checked."

If you are flying nationally, hand your boarding pass to the gate attendant who will scan your boarding pass in (by placing it down on the terminal), but you will not need your ID out at this point. If you are flying internationally, you will need to show your passport again at this point. Keep your boarding pass out after having it checked, as you may need to show it to an additional flight attendant on the plane."

Check your seat to make sure you are headed in the right direction, and keep a lookout for your row number. If you need help finding your seat, ask others around which seats are for which row and later which seat letter is for which seat (there is no \"one size fits all\" for explanations here). Most flight attendants are busy getting their supplies ready for your flight. If you still require more help finding your seat, step into an open seat near the row and once the flight attendant comes around to check on your seat belt, you can ask them then.)

This isn’t always the easiest task, so turn to a flight attendant for assistance in searching or placing your bag if necessary. When you’re finally able to get in your seat, place your smaller carry-on under the seat in front of you. [7] X Research source"

Any other questions can be directed towards flight attendants."
