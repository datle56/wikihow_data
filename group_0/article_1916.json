For example, don’t tell your doctor all about your day leading up to your health problem. They don’t need to know that you got on the bus late that morning.

Try asking questions like: \"What types of work would you not want to do in this position?\" This question reveals weaknesses that you can expect. \"How do you think this job will have to change in the next 5 years? 10?\" This question reveals how they respond to change and whether they can plan ahead. \"When is it okay to break the rules?\" This question is great at evaluating their ethics and whether or not they can adapt to complex situations or remain rigid."

As a member of the public or a student in class, you are seeking information, not a roasting. Back down and thank them.
