      "content": "Broskis are close friends. Broski, like bro, is a term of endearment that comes out of “bro culture.” [1] X Research source Broski can refer to a single person or a group of tight-knit friends—broskis. Bro culture bros (distinguished by their frequent use of bro) may use this word interchangeably with “dude” to refer to someone without actually commenting on their relationship. Broski is less popular than the word bro and is a loose synonym for dude, brother, or buddy. Some alternate spellings are broskie and brosky. What’s up broski, haven’t seen you in a while. The broskis and I are going out for drinks tonight. Pour me a beer, broski. Hey broski, take it easy. I’m just trying to have a nice time here. Don’t worry, he’s cool. He’s my broski.

      "content": "A “broski” can be a person of any gender. While it originally referred only to males, bro, and therefore broski, has become so popular that anyone and everyone can use it. Some people may not want to be called it, however, so only use it with people who are cool with being a broski. Make sure your friends don’t feel like you’re making fun of them when you use this term. Due to the connotations of bro culture (stupidity, misogyny, etc.), you may want to ask before using it and explain that it’s a term of endearment."

      "content": "Broski is a variation of the word “bro,” and means \"brother.\" Bro, short for brother, dates back to the 16th century, although it may have only been used as an abbreviation in writing. Bro, as we know it today, comes from African American English and has been used in black churches for at least two centuries. [2] X Research source In many churches, most notably black churches, men are often referred to as “brother,” shortened to “bro.” Due to the destruction of black historical documents and a lack of access to the tools needed for written records, the abbreviation could have been used much earlier than the 1800s. “Bro” and “ bruh ” were originally used as prefixes, like Mr."

Whatevski, let’s hit the store."
