Deep \"belly breathing\" that visibly moves your abdomen in and out helps strengthen this muscle and improve your endurance.

      "title": "Find a breathing pattern.",
      "content": "Find a breathing pattern. Most experienced runners coordinate their breath with their steps, such as the popular \"inhale for three steps, exhale for two\" (or simply \"3–2\"). This helps you breathe more consistently. You may also be forced to switch to a different pattern (such as \"2–1\") at higher speeds, which helps you keep track of the intensity of your run. [5] X Research source There are several popular alternatives to these patterns, such as \"2-2\" or \"2-3.\" Experiment with different breathing patterns to find the right one for you.

[9] X Trustworthy Source American Lung Association Nonprofit health organization dedicated to improving lung health through education, advocacy, and research Go to source Practice taking deep breaths from your diaphragm while sitting still or lying on your back. Put your hand on your abdomen to make sure it moves up and down with each breath. Count to 8 for each inhale and exhale. Repeat for 3-5 minutes. Swimming regularly can also improve lung function over time, because the exercise places an emphasis on breathing. It will also help you learn how to pace your breathing, because you must learn to coordinate your breath with the strokes you take."
