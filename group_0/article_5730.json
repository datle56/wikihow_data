      "content": "You shouldn't—your hair won't hold the style unless it's damp to begin with. You may have heard people say they use their Airwrap on dry hair to get loose waves, but Dyson advises against styling dry hair. This is because the tool works by setting your hairstyle as it dries the hair. [1] X Research source The Airwrap doesn't use the same extreme heat that a traditional curling iron does. Instead, it uses moderate heat and jets of air to style your hair. Dyson attachments like brushes are designed to work on wet hair while the barrels are best with damp hair."

      "content": "It can—the Airwrap curls your hair without extreme heat. Again, start with damp hair and attach one of the 2 barrels that came with your Airwrap. Turn the settings to high heat and full power and wrap a section of hair around the barrel. Then, bring the Airwrap toward your scalp without twisting it. Hold it in place for 15 seconds so your hair dries. [2] X Research source If you want to set the curls so they last longer, use the cold shot setting for 5 to 10 seconds before you release your hair from the Airwrap. You can also spritz some hairspray for extra hold. Your Dyson Airwrap comes with 1.2 in (3.0 cm) and 1.6 in (4.1 cm) curling barrels. Use the narrower barrel for tighter curls or the larger barrel for looser waves."

      "content": "Yes—attach the pre-styling dryer tool and direct it toward your roots. Work your fingers through your hair as you move the tool from your roots to the tips. This gives you a loose, wavy look. If you want a smooth, polished style, swap the pre-styling dryer attachment for a smoothing brush and work that through your hair as it dries. [3] X Research source Keep in mind that the Airwrap isn't as powerful as the Dyson Supersonic hairdryer which dries hair much faster."

      "content": "Towel-dry your hair and push the smoothing brush attachment onto the styler. Divide your hair into manageable sections and clip them in place. Brush the Airwrap through 1 section at a time, starting near your scalp and working down to the tips. The Airwrap dries your hair as it straightens it, so you'll get smooth hair with lots of volume. [4] X Research source If you've got fine hair, use the soft smoothing brush. For coarse or curly hair, use the firm smoothing brush."

      "title": "Although this is totally an opinion, many people say yes!",
      "content": "Although this is totally an opinion, many people say yes! It's easy to set up—just push an attachment onto the styler until they click and it's ready to use. If you're using the smoothing brush attachment, just brush it through your hair to get a straight, smooth look. For the curling barrels, it can take some getting used to letting your hair wrap itself, but you'll get the hang of it. [5] X Research source People like the Airwrap since it speeds up drying and styling time, especially if you're used to blowdrying, then curling or straightening your hair."

      "content": "You can, although it's still a heat tool that can damage your hair. Traditional curling irons can heat up over 400 °F (204 °C)! The Dyson Airwrap doesn't heat up over 302 °F (150 °C) so it's much gentler on your hair. [6] X Research source It's completely up to you whether or not you want to use the tool every day. If you have fine, heat-damaged hair, you may want to wait a day or two in between uses."
