[6] X Research source Place the heat on low to simmer the sauce. Stir the sauce until a thick mixture forms. Add salt to taste. Remove the pot from the heat. Pour the cranberry sauce in a plastic container and let it cool, about ten minutes. Once the sauce has cooled, place it in the fridge. Serve cool. For an alternative cranberry sauce, use 2 large Valencia or navel oranges, 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 12 ounces fresh or frozen cranberries. Zest and juice the oranges. Peel off a 1-inch thick strip of orange peel from one orange and set aside. Halve, then juice the oranges into a measuring cup, removing seeds; this will make about 1 cup, if not, add water to make up. Simmer the juice, sugar and peel in a small saucepan, bring to medium-high heat. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Add the cranberries and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer uncovered until the cranberries are tender and pop open and appear glossy. This will take about 11 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat, discard the peel and pour into a bowl. Allow to cool; for looser sauce, serve warm; for thicker, refrigerate overnight."
