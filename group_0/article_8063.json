Then, slowly pour in a ½ cup (188.29 mL) of white vinegar. This is optional, but the fizzing can help clean your silver faster. [3] X Research source The vinegar will cause the baking soda to fizz slightly. Pouring the vinegar in slowly helps prevent the mixture from fizzing over. Only add enough vinegar to get a slight fizzing effect. Add lemon juice to the mixture for more cleaning power."

Check them regularly until most dirt, debris, and tarnish come off. [6] X Research source After soaking the pieces, remove them from the hot water with tongs to avoid burning yourself. Set them on an absorbent surface, like a paper towel. [7] X Research source Alternative option: Line the bottom of a small pot with aluminum foil. Put the silver, water, baking soda, and salt into the pot. Place the pot on high heat to bring the water to a boil. Allow it to boil for about 4 minutes."

Always use soft cloths and gentle detergents when cleaning your silver to preserve the finish. [19] X Research source However, sterling silver is stronger and more durable than pure silver and can stand up to mild cleaning. If you’re working with antique silver pieces, use soapy water for cleanings. Consider leaving tarnish on antique pieces, as it can give them character and definition. If you do decide to remove the tarnish, consult a silver conservator to determine the best way to do so. [20] X Research source ."

      "title": "Does removing tarnish with baking soda damage sterling silver?",
      "content": "Does removing tarnish with baking soda damage sterling silver? Pure silver is a relatively soft metal that is easily scratched. However, sterling silver is combined with a small amount of copper (and possibly other metal alloys) to make it more durable. Since baking soda is a mild abrasive, it’s safe for sterling silver. [21] X Research source Using the baking soda and aluminum method to remove tarnish relies on a chemical reaction and doesn’t use the baking soda as an abrasive. However, when placing silver on the aluminum, be gentle to avoid creating surface scratches on your silver with the sharp edges of the foil."

      "title": "How do baking soda and aluminum remove tarnish from silver?",
      "content": "How do baking soda and aluminum remove tarnish from silver? Tarnish forms through a chemical reaction when sulfur in the air combines with silver to create a thin layer of black silver sulfide. The baking soda and aluminum cleaning method creates a mild electric charge that transfers the tarnish to the aluminum foil. [22] X Research source"

      "title": "How can you tell if your silver is sterling?",
      "content": "How can you tell if your silver is sterling? Look for a stamp or marking to identify real sterling silver . This stamp indicates the silver’s purity level. Sterling silver has a purity rating of 925 or higher. Or, check to see if a magnet sticks to the piece. Silver is non-magnetic, so if the magnet firmly sticks to the piece, it’s not sterling silver. [23] X Research source Sterling silver has a small amount of other metal to make it harder, so there may be a light magnetic effect."
