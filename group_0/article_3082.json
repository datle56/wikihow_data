What are the things your partner is hoping you will keep up with in the home? What are their responsibilities in the home? If you are primarily responsible for keeping the house clean, your partner may take responsibility for cleaning up after him or herself: putting dirty laundry in the hamper, putting dishes in the dishwasher, etc. If you are also caring for young children or special needs children or adults during the day, you may be surprised by how difficult it is to also keep up with household tasks.

Make sure you're bathing regularly and wearing clean clothes. This is really about showing your partner that you still respect yourself....and you should respect yourself enough to take care of yourself! If your partner often tells you they like it when you wear a certain garment or outfit, by all means, take the hint."
