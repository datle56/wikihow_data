      "title": "An Aquarius man and a Leo woman make a great (and intense) match.",
      "content": "An Aquarius man and a Leo woman make a great (and intense) match. These two are the social butterflies of the zodiac. Always ready for a night on the town, they have no problem planning date nights and having a good time. But while their passionate natures can make them an ideal pair in many ways (including in bed), it’s also those very natures that can cause these two fixed signs to clash on occasion. As long as they maintain good communication and keep their egos under control , Aquarians and Leos are a match made in heaven. [1] X Research source As opposites on the zodiac wheel, Leo (born July 23 to August 22) and Aquarius (born January 20 to February 18) are natural complements. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Aquarius men and Leo women are very sexually compatible.",
      "content": "Aquarius men and Leo women are very sexually compatible. Both signs are great in the sack, and they only bring out the best (and most erotic) in each other. Leo’s creativity, physicality, and passion make her a very sensual lover, while Aquarius’s tendency toward experimentation is sure to keep his Leo partner aroused. [3] X Research source While Aquarius men (whose element is air) have a habit of being too in their head, the passion of a Leo lover (whose element is fire) will bring out her Aquarius’s animal side. An Aquarius man’s penchant for exploration, kinkiness, and risque behavior is guaranteed to pair well with Leo’s high sex drive. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Their sexual chemistry won’t fade in a hurry.",
      "content": "Their sexual chemistry won’t fade in a hurry. Aquarians and Leos share an innate understanding of both how to be intense and how to inspire intensity in others, meaning their sex life is bound to stay passionate long after the honeymoon phase is over. Aquarius men respond to uniqueness and people who know how to present themselves, and presentation is a Leo woman’s forte. Proud Leo, represented by the lion, is famous for showing off and being the center of attention, making her the perfect sign to catch an Aquarius’s eye."

      "title": "Aquarius and Leo can be a bit too competitive.",
      "content": "Aquarius and Leo can be a bit too competitive. As fixed signs, Aquarius and Leo are both known for their courage and boldness—and for their occasional pigheadedness. For a Leo and an Aquarius to maintain a successful relationship, they’ll have to put compromise to keep the peace. [5] X Research source Aquarians and Leos’ shared attributes are a double-edged sword. Their intensity and competitiveness are probably what made them stand out to one another in the first place, but fighting to be number one all the time is sure to sour a relationship quickly."

      "title": "Aquarius and Leo have a lot to teach one another.",
      "content": "Aquarius and Leo have a lot to teach one another. A Leo woman, being one of the most emotional signs in the zodiac, can be a good sounding board for an Aquarius man as she'll help him let loose and feel the emotions he's been bottling up. Aquarius can help give Leo the grounding she lacks so that she can gain better control of her emotions. When these two signs see their differences as inspiration for personal growth rather than impetuses to fight, their relationship thrives."

      "title": "Both signs are good at separating sexuality from friendship.",
      "content": "Both signs are good at separating sexuality from friendship. Despite their intensity in the bedroom, Aquarius and Leo are both able to move fluidly from sex to friendship. This makes Leo and Aquarius ideal friends with benefits, though there is still strong potential for a committed relationship. [6] X Research source If a Leo woman wants to establish a relationship with an Aquarius man, she must be his friend first—just be careful not to get stuck in the friend zone, as the lines between friendship and romance blur easily for Aquarians. Their status as fixed signs also makes them fiercely independent, which means their relationship won’t suffer from either partner being overly anxious or watchful. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Aquarius’s intellectualism can come off dismissive of Leo’s emotions.",
      "content": "Aquarius’s intellectualism can come off dismissive of Leo’s emotions. But to be fair, Leo’s intensity and passion can make her prone to overreaction at times. Though Aquarius men are generally well-spoken and good communicators, the two signs may struggle to understand one another without lots of patience. [8] X Research source Aquarians and Leos are naturally distrustful signs. In order to overcome their trust issues, they will have to have many open conversations with one another about their fears and insecurities, and explicitly state their needs so that their partner can meet them. As long as the two practice patience with one another and resist their urges to be the center of attention or have the last word, they will do well."

    {
      "title": "Aquarius men and Leo women share compatible values.",
      "content": "Aquarius men and Leo women share compatible values. An Aquarius man values independence, loyalty, and care—all qualities of a Leo woman. An Aqua guy won’t settle for anything less than a partner who loves him ferociously, which is what Leo does best. And a Leo woman values creativity, charisma, and honesty—qualities of an Aquarius man. His charm and unique way of viewing the world are a Leo magnet. [9] X Research source Both Aquarius and Leo are very independent, meaning there’s no danger of either of them losing their identities in the relationship. [10] X Research source While Aquarius values loyalty, he struggles to commit himself. He will appreciate her fierce commitment to him—but may struggle to return the devotion in equal measure.

      "title": "A Leo may grow frustrated with her Aquarius partner’s need for space.",
      "content": "A Leo may grow frustrated with her Aquarius partner’s need for space. Though both signs are highly independent, Aquarius men can become distant, even from people they care for. A Leo woman, as the most affectionate zodiac sign, will have to be patient with her Aquarius man and give him the space he needs, but the Aqua guy will have to tune into his Leo’s emotional needs to be sure they are being met. While Leos are big on personal displays of affection, Aquarians don't like feeling controlled or pressured to commit. They can find a middle ground through experimentation: private displays of affection or subtler public affection may satisfy Leo without overwhelming Aquarius. It may behoove an Aquarius and Leo to schedule quality time, as well as alone time. Couples therapy may also help these two intense signs thrive in their relationship."

      "title": "Both signs will have to curb their ego.",
      "content": "Both signs will have to curb their ego. Ego and competitiveness are often the result of insecurity: both signs may worry that their partner's \"victories\" will diminish their own. Discussing insecurities openly with one another or with a therapist will reduce competitiveness and strengthen the relationship. [12] X Research source Leo's and Aquarius's passion and independence are two attributes that draw them together, but the dark side of these qualities is stubbornness and competitiveness, which can spoil their relationship. If they keep on top of their egos and don’t let it overtake their partnership, they will be happy together for a long time."
