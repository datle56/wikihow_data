Wrap the excess rope around the cleat in a figure-8 pattern before tucking it under itself to secure the flag at the top. [4] X Research source If you’re hanging your flag off of your home, get an American flag with a mounting rod and simply slide it into the bracket on your porch or home. You can buy a flag pole bracket online or at a construction supply store and drill it into your porch post or siding. If you’re hanging your flag vertically , display it wherever you’d like so long as the fabric doesn’t brush against anything else. Hang it with the blue and white stars in the top left. Try to avoid letting your flag touch the ground while you unfold it and hang it."
