If two (or more) pieces of data in one column are the same, find the mean of the ranks as if those pieces of data had been ranked normally, then rank the data with this mean. In the example at right, there are two 5s that would otherwise have ranks of 2 and 3. Since there are two 5s, take the mean of their ranks. The mean of 2 and 3 is 2.5, so assign the rank 2.5 to both 5s."
