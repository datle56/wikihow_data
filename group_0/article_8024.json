    {
      "title": "Wipe away visible dirt.",
      "content": "Wipe away visible dirt. If the mushrooms are still caked with dirt or other debris, gently remove it by hand. Use a clean cloth, dry paper towel, or soft-bristled brush if you prefer. Don’t worry too much about getting every bit of dirt. [1] X Research source There are kitchen brushes designed to help clean delicate foods, such as shiitake mushrooms. While these can be helpful, they are not necessary. Often, a quick rub with a dry paper towel is sufficient."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse minimally.",
      "content": "Rinse minimally. It’s true that mushrooms will absorb a bit of moisture, so you don’t want to expose them to too much water. However, a quick rinse will not noticeably affect their composition. Simply run the faucet with cold water and hold your shiitakes in the stream for a few moments. [2] X Research source Some chefs prefer not to rinse shiitakes. If you know your mushrooms are free of chemicals, consider foregoing the use of any water at all."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shake or spin them dry.",
      "content": "Shake or spin them dry. Shake the mushrooms by hand or spin them in a salad spinner to remove residual water. If water remains caught on the underside of a particular mushroom, hold it by the stem and shake more vigorously. [3] X Research source Rinse again if visible dirt remains. It's important to make sure the mushrooms are completely dry before cooking them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pry off each mushroom’s stem.",
      "content": "Pry off each mushroom’s stem. While keeping the stem is a matter of personal preference when preparing many mushrooms, shiitake stems should always be removed. To remove a shiitake stem, tightly pinch it right where it meets the cap. Then slowly pry the stem away from the cap in the opposite direction the stem is leaning. For instance, if you’re holding the mushroom upside down and the stem is leaning towards you, pry the stem away from you. Discard the stems or save them for use in soups and stocks."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove dried mushroom's stems before re-hydrating.",
      "content": "Remove dried mushroom's stems before re-hydrating. Dried shiitake mushrooms aren't quite as flavorful, but they can be good to keep on hand because they last a long time and are especially useful in some dishes. They do require a bit more prep work, however, as they need to be soaked in water prior to cooking. Just be sure to snap off the stems first, as it's much easier to do while they're still dry. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Slice from the top of the cap.",
      "content": "Slice from the top of the cap. Depending on how you wish to use your shiitake mushrooms, you may wish to cut them up. Thin slices are recommended. Place a cap right side up on a cutting board and carefully cut it into thin slices. [5] X Research source If you’re comfortable doing so, you can stack one shiitake mushroom cap on top of another and slice them simultaneously in order to save time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Select shiitakes from loose bins.",
      "content": "Select shiitakes from loose bins. Whenever possible, opt for mushrooms sold out of loosely packed bins, as opposed to plastic-wrapped containers. This will allow you to select the cleanest and best-looking individual mushrooms. [6] X Research source Look for the mushrooms with the thickest caps."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose firm, dry shiitakes.",
      "content": "Choose firm, dry shiitakes. Both the stem and the cap of the mushrooms you select should be firm and dry to the touch. Mushrooms with domed caps that curl under are especially fresh. Avoid shiitakes that appear shriveled, or feel soft or slimy to the touch. [7] X Research source The gills on the underside of the mushroom’s cap should be dry and firm too. Dark spots or a wet appearance indicate that a mushroom is past its prime. This evidence will first show itself on a mushroom’s gills."
    },
    {
      "title": "Store mushrooms in the fridge.",
      "content": "Store mushrooms in the fridge. Refrigeration can help keep your mushrooms fresh. Keep them in an open plastic bag, as they need access to air. If you purchase them fresh, they will last for a few days. [8] X Research source If you want to preserve shiitakes in the fridge for a bit longer, cut off their gills. This will keep the rest of the mushroom fresh for about a week."
