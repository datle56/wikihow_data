Don't be afraid to be yourself and set your own standards. [36] X Expert Source Alice Wu Image Consultant Expert Interview. 12 June 2020 Remember that true beauty comes from the inside and uniqueness is also beautiful. If you've only believed that beauty was physical before, redefine this idea and contemplate the possibilities. At the same time, try to set realistic expectations. For example, instead of drastically trying to change your figure, skin color, or hair, try to accept the way you look first. Take good care of your hair and skin and focus on the parts you do like about yourself (such as your eyes or your curly hair)."

You may even stop focusing on your flaws (such as that annoying pimple that keeps popping up) and start seeing the good things about yourself. Here are some ways you can be more positive: If something doesn't turn out the way you liked, try to find something good about the situation. You can also consider what you can do to improve the situation next time. Oftentimes, the lesson you take away will be more valuable than a favorable outcome. By focusing on the benefits, you can strengthen your perspective. In unforeseeable circumstances, see if you can adapt to the situation and make the most out of it. For instance, if it rains on the day of the picnic you spent all week planning, see if you can bring it inside. You could even set up a movie or bring out a few board games to play with your friends. If your friend is really excited about something, try to share their excitement. You can also ask them questions about it to show that you are interested. If your friend is really good at something, try to encourage them. For example, if your friend is good at drawing, tell them that their drawing is really good and that you really like their style."

In reality, the more you make fun of others, the worse you will feel about yourself. Sometimes, the bullying might even come back to you. You could really hurt someone, and make them feel really bad about themselves. Instead, ask yourself what it is that would make you consider bullying or participating in it -- are there internal issues you may need to work through? Are you trying to feel accepted by the bully? Is the person being bullied or their actions symbolic of something or someone that you dislike? Perhaps they reflect a quality about yourself that you neglect or wish could be better."
