      "content": "Get your props. The materials you use depend on what kind of clown you want to be. However, there are some general props that are used by many clowns, such as balls for juggling, balloons for making balloon animals, magic trick props if you're doing tricks, and any other silly props you can think of. You can start off with the traditional tools and become more original as you discover who your inner clown really is. Get your music together if it's part of your act. Part of your act may include putting face paint on children. If ventriloquism is part of your act, then get yourself a dummy."

      "content": "Get a clown costume. You can buy authentic clown costumes from clown suppliers, but they can be a bit pricey, so you can start off with some colorful clothes, Halloween clown costumes, a colorful set of pajamas, or any funny-looking items you can find in a Goodwill or a thrift store. The expensive items can come later, once you are more established, so don't worry about those for now. [1] X Research source You'll need a clown costume along with a pair of big, floppy shoes.

      "content": "Put your makeup on. Contrary to popular belief, not all clowns wear face paint. Clowning is a style of comedy, not a style of makeup. Most clowns use greasepaint for their faces, since this kind doesn't wash off as easily as water-based paint or Halloween paint. If you do put on makeup, there are a variety of makeup styles you can try: [2] X Research source Whiteface clown paint. This is the traditional face paint that you may think of when you want to look like a clown. Auguste clown paint. This type of clown wears makeup that is a bit more flesh-toned. Tramp or hobo clown paint. This face paint is a bit darker and sooty looking, because this type of clown is down on his luck. Character clown paint. What kind of clown do you want to be? Mad scientist? Keystone cop clown? Your character will determine the color and style of makeup you use."
