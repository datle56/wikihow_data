      "content": "Get tomato cages that are at least 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall. 5-foot cages will support most tomato varieties. If you're growing a shorter tomato variety, like Santiam or Siberia, you can choose a shorter cage. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Make your own tomato cages using concrete reinforcement wire. You can find some at your local hardware store. Make sure you can fit your hand through the openings in the wire so you're able to harvest the tomatoes. Cut 3 feet (.9 meters) of wire for every 1 foot (.3 meters) in diameter you want each cage to be. Attach each end of the wire to a stake and stake the cage in the ground around one of your tomato plants."

      "content": "Place a cage directly over one of the tomato plants. Whether the plant is potted or in the ground, you want it to be in the center of the cage. The walls of the cage should be close to the plant; it's normal if some of the plant's vines and leaves extend outside of the cage. [3] X Research source Avoid damaging the plants' roots by caging them immediately after transplanting them."

      "content": "Push down on the cage so the stakes at the bottom go into the ground. Keep pushing down until all of the stakes are fully buried in the soil. If you’re having trouble getting the cage to push down, try lightly pounding it down with a mallet or hammer. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Check to see if the cage is sturdy. Put your hand on the cage and gently push and pull on it a little bit. If it feels like the wind could pull it out of the ground, attach a couple stakes to the bottom of the cage and pound them into the soil for extra support. [5] X Research source Attach the stakes to the outside of the cage so they don't damage the roots when you push them into the soil."

      "content": "Cage the rest of the tomato plants in the garden. Repeat the same process, making sure all of the cages are firmly staked in the ground. If you’re planting and caging new tomato plants, try to place them at least 4 feet (1.2 meters) apart. [6] X Research source"

You can use something like floss or rubber bands to tie the vines to the cage. If you’re tying the vines, make sure they’re not too tight or you could injure the plant. [7] X Research source"
