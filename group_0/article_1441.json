If you notice any stray eyebrow hairs, or hairs that are growing outside of the shape of your brows, pluck them with tweezers.

Using the short side of the brush to lead, make a defined stroke across the bottom of your eyebrows, going from the inside dot you made to the outside dot you made. [11] X Research source A brush made from natural hair works best. Keep the line light. Use soft strokes, as harsh lines can look unnatural. You basically want the powder to look like a shadow."
