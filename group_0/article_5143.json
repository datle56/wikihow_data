[1] X Research source This includes physical or digital gift cards. While Amazon has not explicitly stated why you cannot use your Amazon gift balance to buy other gift cards, most retailers in general will not accept gift cards as payment for other gift cards as this is commonly used in scams and money laundering schemes. [2] X Research source Previously, you could purchase gift cards using an Amazon gift balance. However, this is no longer possible. You also cannot transfer your Amazon gift card balance to another account or to your bank."

      "content": "Use your Amazon gift card balance on other purchases. Amazon has a lot to offer, which may be overwhelming. Here's a few suggestions on what you can buy instead: Household essentials. If you're running low on essentials like toilet paper, paper towels, cleaning products, batteries, deodorant, or first aid supplies, stock up on Amazon. Use Google (or your favorite search engine) to compare prices with local stores to make sure you're getting the best deal. Whole Foods groceries. With Amazon Fresh, you can use your Amazon gift card balance to get groceries from Whole Foods. You can even get same-day delivery of your groceries right to your doorstep, or you can choose to pick them up yourself from a Whole Foods location. Pet supplies. If you have a pet, you know that they can be surprisingly expensive. Use your Amazon balance to stock up on your pet's food and favorite treats, or surprise your pet with some toys and a new collar (or a full outfit, if you prefer to dress your pet up). Items for a new hobby. If you've been thinking of starting a new hobby but you haven't because you didn't want to buy all the materials, consider using your Amazon gift card balance to pay for it. Just be sure to read reviews before you buy to make sure the items you're getting are good quality and actually work. A splurge item for yourself. If you've got a pretty big gift card balance, consider treating yourself to something you wouldn't normally buy because of the price, such as a gaming console, high-quality headphones, a fancy kitchen appliance, or a designer pair of sunglasses."

      "content": "Buy essentials on Amazon and use your cash on hand for something else. For example, if you wanted to buy a Doordash gift card with your Amazon gift balance so you could use your own money for other purchases, consider flipping the situation around: use your Amazon balance to buy some groceries or other essentials, and use your own money to buy something on Doordash. Make sure to set aside the amount of money you would have spent on the gift card to avoid overspending. If you have a separate savings or checking account, you could move the money to that account to keep it separate and organized. Alternatively, buy the gift card with your own money instead of earmarking it in your bank account."

      "content": "Try to avoid Amazon gift cards if you purchase gift cards often. If you don't really use Amazon for much besides purchasing gift cards, it's best to avoid getting Amazon gift cards altogether. Here are some ways to avoid getting them: Check your refund method: If you're getting an Amazon refund, make sure the refund method is set to go back to your bank. By default, Amazon will suggest getting any refunds to your Amazon gift balance, so you may have to manually choose for a refund to go back to your bank account. Turn down payment by Amazon gift card: If you are being paid in Amazon gift cards, ask the person paying you if they wouldn't mind giving you a different form of payment. However, be aware that most retailers will not accept gift cards as a valid payment for other gift cards, including Visa or MasterCard gift cards. Trade or sell existing gift cards: Before you decide to sell or trade an Amazon gift card, just be aware that this is against Amazon's gift card terms of service. [3] X Research source If you decide to sell or trade your gift card, be aware that Amazon could take action on your account. Digital gift cards: Use the gift card to purchase something for someone else, then have that person reimburse you for the cost of the item. Make sure to do this with someone you trust, as there's no way to get your money back if the other person takes the item but doesn't pay you back. Physical gift cards: Sell or trade the gift card with someone you know for the value of the gift card. Gift card marketplace: If no one you know wants to buy the gift card, you could try selling it online on a gift card marketplace like Gameflip. However, be aware that you'll likely have to sell the gift card at a slightly lower value than what it has on it. If the gift card is physical, you'll need to mail it to the buyer. If the gift card is digital and you haven't redeemed it, you can sell it on a marketplace. If you have redeemed it, you won't be able to sell it and will instead need to try the suggestion for digital gift cards above."
