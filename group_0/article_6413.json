      "content": "Wear white or yellow colored clothing. After your bath, it is custom to dress in these hues to perform the puja.

[3] X Research source Typically, those performing the puja dress in 1 of these colors, rather than dressing with some hues of both. For example, you may dress head-to-toe in white linens or you may adorn yourself in yellow clothing. Yellow is the color of knowledge and learning in Hinduism.

      "title": "Clean your home the day before you perform the Saraswati puja.",
      "content": "Clean your home the day before you perform the Saraswati puja. Before you perform the puja, clean your house thoroughly. Tidy up your spaces, and in particular, arrange all of your books upright on your shelves. Use a natural cleaning product like castile soap, vinegar solution, or essential oil to clean your tools, computer, and laptop. [4] X Research source If you can’t clean the day before, do this after you purify yourself. If you are performing the puja as part of your Navratri celebration, everything must be cleaned by the 8th day of Navratri. If you can't use natural cleaning products, you can use an all-purpose cleaner. Natural cleaning products are safer for the environment and more pleasing to Goddess Saraswati than harsh chemicals. Since Saraswati is the Goddess of learning, it is suggested that she appreciates arranging your library properly."
