      "title": "Use a suede brush or toothbrush to remove dirt and debris.",
      "content": "Use a suede brush or toothbrush to remove dirt and debris. If your slippers don’t have any set-in stains, a suede brush or clean toothbrush should be all you need to keep the outsides looking new. Gently brush any dirt and debris off of your slippers with the brush. The brush will help raise the nap on your slippers so any dirt and debris stuck inside comes out. The nap is what the tiny fibers on suede are called. Remember to brush your slippers gently. If you brush too hard, you could actually push dirt and debris further into the nap."

      "title": "Avoid machine washing or spot-cleaning your slippers with water.",
      "content": "Avoid machine washing or spot-cleaning your slippers with water. Water can actually damage the nap on suede and leave stains behind. If your slippers are dirty, brushing them clean and using methods that don’t involve water to remove stains is your safest bet. [1] X Research source Also avoid putting your suede slippers in the dryer. High heat can damage suede."

      "title": "Apply suede protector spray to your slippers to help keep them clean.",
      "content": "Apply suede protector spray to your slippers to help keep them clean. Suede protector spray repels dirt and water so your slippers stay clean for longer. To spray your slippers, first make sure that they’re dry and clean. Then, spray an even layer over the outside of each slipper. Be careful not to saturate the suede. Let your slippers air dry in a ventilated area before wearing them again. You can find suede protector spray online or in some shoe stores."

      "title": "Clean your suede slippers as often as you can.",
      "content": "Clean your suede slippers as often as you can. Dirt, dust, and debris build up in the nap of suede slippers over time. The longer you go without cleaning your slippers, the more likely mattes and stains are to form. Try to get in the habit of routinely cleaning your slippers with a suede brush or toothbrush to keep them looking new. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Try using baking soda to remove fresh stains on your slippers.",
      "content": "Try using baking soda to remove fresh stains on your slippers. If you’ve spilled something on your slippers and the spot is still wet, gently blot up as much as you can with a paper towel. Then, sprinkle baking soda over the wet stain and let it sit overnight. The next day, brush out the baking soda and any remaining stain. [3] X Research source Baking soda works for fresh stains because it absorbs liquids that are trapped in the nap on your suede slippers."

      "title": "Use an eraser to buff out stains that have already set.",
      "content": "Use an eraser to buff out stains that have already set. Take a suede eraser (or a pencil eraser if that’s all you have) and gently rub it back and forth over the stain on your slippers. Continue gently buffing until you’ve removed as much of the stain as you can. [4] X Research source You can find specialty suede erasers online or in some shoe stores."

    {
      "title": "Apply white vinegar to extra-stubborn stains.",
      "content": "Apply white vinegar to extra-stubborn stains. Unlike water, small amounts of white vinegar shouldn’t stain or damage your slippers. Dip a clean cloth into white vinegar, and gently rub the stained area with it. Continue applying more vinegar until the stain is gone, and then let your slippers air dry. Vinegar is acidic, which makes it an effective stain remover. It also evaporates faster than water, so it’s not as likely to stain or damage suede."

      "title": "Try using white chalk or cornstarch to remove grease and oil stains.",
      "content": "Try using white chalk or cornstarch to remove grease and oil stains. Gently color over the stain with white chalk so it’s completely covered, or sprinkle a liberal amount of cornstarch over the stain. Let the chalk or cornstarch sit overnight, then brush it off in the morning. Chalk and cornstarch both absorb oil, so the stain should be faded or completely gone. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a commercial suede stain remover if other methods aren’t helping.",
      "content": "Use a commercial suede stain remover if other methods aren’t helping. There are a variety of suede cleaners available on the market. Some are sprays and others are liquids you apply directly to stains. If home remedies like baking soda, white vinegar, and erasers aren’t cutting it, a commercial suede stain remover may be more effective. You can find suede stain removers online or at some shoe stores."

      "title": "Take your slippers to a cobbler if you can’t get the stains out on your own.",
      "content": "Take your slippers to a cobbler if you can’t get the stains out on your own. Cobblers have experience working with finicky materials like suede, and they’ll be better able to remove stubborn stains on your slippers. If all else fails, bring your slippers to a local cobbler and ask them to restore the suede as much as possible. Having your suede slippers cleaned by a cobbler can cost around $50."

      "content": "Wipe down the inner lining of your slippers with a baby wipe. The inner lining of your suede slippers can get dingy over time. Take a baby wipe and wipe down the inner lining of each of your slippers, getting all the way inside so you’re cleaning the lining around the toe box too. Baby wipes contain detergent that will help clean any dirt and grime inside your slippers, and they won’t soak the inner lining and damage it."

      "content": "Sprinkle baking soda inside your slippers to get rid of bad odors. The furry lining in your suede slippers can start to smell bad if you wear them a lot.

      "content": "Spray a commercial deodorizer inside your slippers for stubborn smells.
