      "content": "Build confidence. Even if you may feel insecure, appearing self-assured of yourself increases the chances of gaining attention, approval, and perhaps admiration. Small changes, such as straightening your posture and walking with long, quick strides, can transform your appearance and cause you to appear confident. When speaking to others, you can maintain eye contact and speak in a slightly firm voice. If others attempt to bully or demean you, give them an assertive, polite response. For instance, if a classmate calls you ugly, you can tell them something along the lines of, \"Thanks for sharing your opinion!\" or \"You can think whatever you want about me.\" A great way to build confidence is calling a friend or loved one and asking them what they like about you and what they think you best traits are. Hearing those positive reinforcements can really help you feel confident and great about yourself."

Although it may not be possible to become close friends with everyone, you can try to at least be on amicable terms with the majority of your class so that they think of you in a positive manner. Even if you dislike someone, remain polite and neutral so that they cannot accuse you of being negative. When maintaining friendships, remember to be realistic and avoid overwhelming yourself with too many meetings and events. Depending on how many friends you have, you may not be able to see them every day, so do your best to spread your time among them. If you cannot spend a lot of time with certain friends, be sure to at least stop and ask how they are doing so that they do not feel abandoned or left out. Use these friendships to build a healthy support system for yourself, which can help you feel more fulfilled, happy, and balanced. Family members, therapists, and coaches can also be a part of this support system."

Try not to become absorbed by social media or allow your life to revolve around it. Allow yourself to take a break from it, and avoid spending too much time with the camera.

Furthermore, remember that your pictures represent your personality, affect your reputation, and can be spread by others. Do not allow unknown people to follow you, especially if they do not attend your school."
