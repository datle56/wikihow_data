      "content": "Vacuum it. Regularly vacuuming your furniture is the easiest part of keeping your furniture clean. Make an effort to clean the cracks and crevices of your furniture between cushions, like the areas where the arms of a sofa meet the back. Take the cushions off, too, and vacuum all sides of them. The fiber density of microfiber furniture makes them stain-resistant, and lets the majority of dirt and debris be easily brushed loose. Give it a brushing before you vacuum. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Check the tags for guidance. If your furniture needs a solvent-based cleaner, you’ll want to purchase and utilize that; if your furniture calls for water-based cleaner, you can easily make that at home. If you no longer have the tag, consult a professional. [2] X Research source W means: Use water-based detergent. S means: Clean with a water-free product, like dry cleaning solvent. WS means: Either a water-based cleaner or a water-free cleaner is appropriate. X means: Professionally cleaning only, though feel free to vacuum it. Keep this is in mind when purchasing furniture. Reader Poll: We asked 215 wikiHow readers how they prefer to clean polyester, and only 3% of them said a professional upholstery cleaner. [Take Poll] There are lots of simple DIY methods that can effectively clean polyester and other upholstery instead."

A capful of white vinegar and a few pinches of baking soda in the mix will combat odor. Shake it up well. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Test the detergent mixture in an inconspicuous spot. Dip a sponge into the detergent mixture and rub some of it onto the back or underside of the upholstery - somewhere where it is not likely to be seen. Wipe the spot dry with a cloth and then let it air dry completely. If any discoloration occurs, don't use the detergent mixture. Consider instead having the furniture cleaned professionally."

      "content": "Blot future spills quickly. [4] X Research source The best way to avoid extensive cleaning sessions in the future is to act quickly when spills occur, treating them before they stain too severely. Always blot liquids, as opposed to scrubbing or rubbing. Vigorous movement can work the liquid further into the furniture at this stage, so the aim is to absorb as much liquid as possible before it soaks in."

      "title": "Use mild dish soap and water to clean dirt and minor stains.",
      "content": "Use mild dish soap and water to clean dirt and minor stains. Mix about 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of mild dish detergent into a small bucket of warm water. Then, dip a clean cloth in the soapy water and wring it out so that the cloth is just damp. Next, wipe down the dirty areas of your furniture. Finally, pat the furniture dry with a clean cloth. Always start with the mildest cleaning solution, then use a stronger cleaner if the dirt or stain remains. If mild soap doesn't work, you can use vinegar."

      "title": "Clean your furniture with a vinegar mixture if soapy water doesn't work.",
      "content": "Clean your furniture with a vinegar mixture if soapy water doesn't work. In a bucket, mix equal parts vinegar and water. Soak a rag in the liquid, wring it out so that it’s damp but not soaked, and wipe down your furniture. Rinse out the rag often, to avoid spreading dirt, and follow back after your work with a dry cloth. [5] X Research source Equal parts lemon juice and cream of tarter is an ideal spot cleaner for white or beige furniture. Rub the mixture into the stain, and let it sit. After 10 minutes, wipe any residue away with a clean cloth. Rubbing alcohol, applied by cotton swab, works wonders for ink stains and mildew. Work it in, and then dry the area with hot air from a blow dryer. [6] X Research source"

Then, buff it out with a cloth. Multiple buffs may be required. [7] X Research source As another option, apply a leather cream to your furniture after you clean it to re-moisturize the leather."

      "content": "Keep leather out of the sun to avoid cracking and dryness. [8] X Research source Constant exposure to direct sunlight is bad for leather, even with diligent upkeep. Consider rotating armchairs or couches away from open windows, or ensuring that your blinds or drapes are closed when you’re not in the room. Keep leather furniture at least two feet away from heat sources in your home. Constant exposure can cause the leather to crack and age."

      "content": "Determine the finish used on your furniture. If you’re unsure, the correct procedure is beginning with mild cleaner, then moving successively toward stronger cleaning methods depending on the furniture’s reaction (or lack of one). [9] X Research source If you know that your furniture is stained, painted, etc., then you should employ a method appropriate to that finish. As a general rule for cleaning wood furniture: don’t use much water, and when you do, don’t leave it on the table for long. Water can cause the wood to warp and crack."

Dip your cleaning cloth into the soapy water, then wring it out so it's just damp. Then, wipe the wood furniture down with the cloth. Next, dry the furniture with a clean cloth. Try mild soap and water before you use other cleaning products, as it's gentler. If the dirt or stains remain, clean the wood with mineral spirits."

Pour the spirits into a rag, and gently rub your furniture. Work in a well-ventilated space when using mineral spirits. Wipe up any residual cleaner with a damp cloth. [11] X Research source Though safe for most wooden furniture, you should test an inconspicuous area (like an underside, or chair leg) to make sure your furniture doesn’t react poorly to the cleaner."

      "content": "Work the turpentine mixture into the wood. Pour some on top of the table, then some onto a steel wool pad. Rub the mixture in along the grain. Once finished, polish with a soft rag. This mixture works very well on both finished and unfinished wood. It will increase the gloss and durability of finished wood, and it will prevent drying and cracking in unfinished wood. Rub the oil in thoroughly and allow the furniture to air dry. Using steel wool might sound severe, but the finish on most wooden furniture is thick enough to protect the wood itself from damage."

Mix one part ammonia to two parts water in a bucket , then give it a good squirt of bleach-free dishwashing liquid. A brush is an ideal cleaning implement, but cloth can work. Ensure you're in a well-ventilated area before mixing chemicals, and use gloves when handling ammonia. Do not lean over the bucket. Bleach-free is important here. Ammonia and bleach together produces incredibly toxic fumes. [18] X Research source If you ever feel light-headed or nauseous while mixing your cleaners, get fresh air immediately. Wicker furniture should always be handled delicately, even during cleaning. Stiff brushes (and anything more abrasive) can cause extensive damage to your furniture and require the intervention of a professional. [19] X Research source For paper and grass wicker furniture, you can forgo the cleaning agents and simply wipe the pieces down with a damp cloth. [20] X Research source Wicker furniture only needs this thorough cleaning once or twice a year. [21] X Research source"

When wet, the cane, grass, and bamboo can slowly revert to their original (non-wicker) shapes. Wicker furniture must always be thoroughly dried, and care should be taken to avoid saturating it with water while cleaning. [22] X Research source Never sit on wicker that isn't dry. Wicker furniture should not, however, spend the entirety of its time in the sun. Chairs and tables that spend a lot of time in the sun should be rotated throughout the year to prevent the material from splitting."

      "title": "Keep it out of humid areas.",
      "content": "Keep it out of humid areas. Even though wicker \"likes\" humidity, the humidity will promote mold growth and shape distortion in wicker furniture. [23] X Research source Store your furniture in climate-controlled areas of your home if you'd like to maintain it longterm. Unless you live in the desert, the porch will not be kind to your wicker furniture. If you do live in the desert, though, give your wicker an occasional wipe-down with a damp cloth. Dry climes can, like direct sunlight, cause wicker to crack without proper care."
