Since a regular hexagon is comprised of six equilateral triangles, the formula for finding the area of a hexagon is derived from the formula of finding the area of an equilateral triangle . The formula for finding the area of a hexagon is Area = (3√3 s 2 )/ 2 where s is the length of a side of the regular hexagon. [1] X Research source"

If you don't know the length of a side but know the length of the perimeter or apothem (the height of one of the equilateral triangles formed by the hexagon, which is perpendicular to the side), you can still find the length of the side of the hexagon. Here's how you do it: If you know the perimeter, then just divide it by 6 to get the length of one side. For example, if the length of the perimeter is 54 cm, then divide it by 6 to get 9 cm, the length of the side. [2] X Research source If you only know the apothem, you can find the length of a side by plugging the apothem into the formula a = x√3 and then multiplying the answer by two. This is because the apothem represents the x√3 side of the 30-60-90 triangle that it creates. If the apothem is 10√3, for example, then x is 10 and the length of a side is 10 * 2, or 20."

The sides of a 30-60-90 triangle are in the proportion of x-x√3-2x, where the length of the short leg, which is across from the 30 degree angle, is represented by x, the length of the long leg, which is across from the 60 degree angle, is represented by x√3, and the hypotenuse is represented by 2x. [6] X Research source The apothem is the side that is represented by x√3. Therefore, plug the length of the apothem into the formula a = x√3 and solve. If the apothem's length is 5√3, for example, plug it into the formula and get 5√3 cm = x√3, or x = 5 cm. By solving for x, you have found the length of the short leg of the triangle, 5. Since it represents half the length of one side of the hexagon, multiply it by 2 to get the full length of the side. 5 cm x 2 = 10 cm. Now that you know that the length of one side is 10, just multiply it by 6 to find the perimeter of the hexagon. 10 cm x 6 = 60 cm"

If you know you're working with a regular hexagon that is missing one or more of its triangles, then the first thing you need to do is find the area of the entire regular hexagon as if it were whole. Then, simply find the area of the empty or \"missing\" triangle, and that subtract that from the overall area. This will give you the area of the remaining irregular hexagon. [14] X Research source For example, if you've found that the area of the regular hexagon is 60 cm 2 and you've found that the area of the missing triangle is 10 cm 2 simply subtract the area of the missing triangle from the entire area: 60 cm 2 - 10 cm 2 = 50 cm 2 . If you know that the hexagon is missing exactly one triangle, you can also just find the area of the hexagon by multiplying the total area by 5/6, since the hexagon is retaining the area of 5 of its 6 triangles. If it's missing two triangles, you can multiply the total area by 4/6 (2/3), and so on."
