      "title": "Accept that loneliness is not a fact, but a feeling.",
      "content": "Accept that loneliness is not a fact, but a feeling. Loneliness can trigger feelings of abandonment, forlornness, or isolation. Recognize when these emotions are triggered, and remember that having a feeling doesn’t necessarily make it fact. You are not bound to feeling lonely. [3] X Research source Feelings can change quickly based on circumstances and attitudes. All these feelings are perhaps like bubbles in a pond which come and go. You may feel lonely one moment, then realize that you’d rather be by yourself than be with friends, or you may receive a phone call from a friend, relieving loneliness."

      "content": "Embrace your feelings. Don’t ignore your feelings; they can be important signals on what is going well or poorly in your life. As with all feelings, allow yourself to feel loneliness. Pay attention to how you feel when loneliness creeps up. Your body may feel heavy, or you may have an urge to cry. Allow yourself to feel the physical and emotional associations, and allow yourself to cry. [4] X Research source Don’t instinctively run from loneliness. Many people choose to distract themselves from loneliness by turning to T.V, work, projects, or other activities to avoid feeling the pain of loneliness. Instead, stay aware of your feelings (and the ways you cope) and determine to honor your body and emotions. Discard ignorance accept that you are lonely and try to find a solution, analyze your own self. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Change your attitude. When the thoughts “I’m lonely” or “I feel all alone” come across your mind, chances are you have a negative association with these feelings. It’s easy to spiral into negative thoughts from here: questioning your self-worth, feeling somehow less valuable or feeling emotionally or physically drained. Before heading down this rabbit hole, consider changing your attitude. Instead of labelling your experience as “lonely”, adopt the mindset of having solitude. Embrace having the opportunity to experience solitude as peaceful and restorative. [6] X Research source When you learn to cherish your solitude you'll be able to handle the times when it’s just you. Use your time to get to know yourself better: start a journal, meditate, and read books that interest you. Sometimes having more alone time is inevitable, such as when moving to a new city or country. Embrace the moments you have to experience solitude, and know that they will not last forever. Cherish the time you have to have a new experience."

      "content": "Practice compassion. Realize that loneliness is a universal experience that affects every individual at one time or another. Loneliness is part of the human experience. [7] X Research source Imagine having a friend tell you that she feels lonely. How would you respond? What would you say to her? Practice this same compassion toward yourself. Allow yourself to reach out to people and ask for support. Loneliness is not shameful or embarrassing; it is a part of everyone’s life at some point, and there’s no need to feel bad about feeling lonely. Express compassion toward yourself, and express compassion toward other people who may feel lonely around you."

      "content": "Question what may be missing from your life. Loneliness can be a tool to show you what may be missing or what you may want more of in your life. [8] X Research source You may be surrounded by people and social events yet still feel lonely. Loneliness may not be a lack of social contact, but a lack of intimate connections. [9] X Research source Take some time to reflect upon what you would like to have in your life. Write down times when you feel lonely. Maybe you feel most lonely during large social events or when you are home alone. Then, consider what might alleviate that loneliness; maybe it would be having a friend go to events with you, or calling over your sister to watch a movie when you feel lonely at home. Come up with realistic solutions that you can enact (don’t make the solution to have a boyfriend or girlfriend to solve all of your loneliness)."

      "content": "Overcome shyness and insecurity. Remember that nobody is born with social skills, and that they are skills , not superpowers. Much of shyness/insecurity comes from false beliefs or fears about social performance. Your thoughts about being unlikeable or weird do not reflect reality; it is one perception. And remember, you don't have to be perfect in order to be likeable. When you feel socially insecure, start paying more attention to your external environment instead of your internal thoughts and feelings. Focus on the person/people you are talking to, and focus your attention on understanding and hearing out your company instead of yourself.

While this experience was painful, remember that not every friendship you have will betray you. Keep trying. Not every rejection you experience reflects a rejection of you as a person.

[12] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source If you’re in a new situation, reach out to someone else and start a conversation. Say “I’ve never been here before, have you? What’s it like?” Either the person can help you or you can find comfort in doing something new together. Remember to communicate openness through body language. By hunching your shoulders, looking down, avoiding eye contact and crossing your body, you appear unapproachable. Smile, keep your posture open (uncross your legs or arms), lean in, and face the person who is speaking. Look for things to affirm in others. Don’t just compliment someone’s appearance (\"I like your sweater\"), but instead say \"You always take the time to put together just the right accessories.\" If you know someone well enough, compliment them on their kindness or intelligence.
