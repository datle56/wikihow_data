[4] X Expert Source Moshe Ratson, MFT, PCC Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 7 August 2019. Although the occasional failure to follow through may not seem like a big deal; repeated failures can add up. Over time, people in your life may come to see you as less trustworthy."

Current directions in psychological science, 16(5), 264-268. Thus, when you make someone a promise, you must keep it. If you truly cannot keep a promise you've made, explain face-to-face why you cannot do as you said you would. Especially if your promise was a major one, an explanation might not be enough. You may need to make a new promise to make it up to that person. Be sure to keep this new promise, no matter what! Do not belittle the original promise. However small and insignificant a promise may seem, realize that the other person may place great significance on it. Any lack of follow through could be hugely disappointing."

      "content": "Be consistent. An important part of the definition of reliability is following through with your word many times over an extended period. By definition, someone reliable is someone you can almost always count on. Keep in mind that doing what you say only once or twice won’t build the solid foundation of trust in your relationships that you want. [6] X Research source Simpson, J. A. (2007).

While there are some situations where telling the whole truth as you see it might not be the most ethical choice, [8] X Research source Plante, T. G. (2004). Do the Right Thing. Living Ethically. in most cases, honesty really is the best policy. Perhaps the most important time to tell the truth is when you would benefit from a lie. [9] X Research source Simpson, J. A. (2007). Psychological foundations of trust. Current directions in psychological science, 16(5), 264-268. If you can be truthful at your own expense, you show that your relationship with another person is important. You also show them that their well-being is more important than your own. [10] X Research source Simpson, J. A. (2007). Psychological foundations of trust. Current directions in psychological science, 16(5), 264-268. For example, imagine your friend loans you a book and you spill coffee on it. You could say that you lost the book. Or, you could try to find another copy and pretend nothing happened. But it is important to tell your friend what really happened. A damaged book may not be a big deal, but the risk of the truth emerging (or the risk of your friend perceiving the lie) will fracture trust."

      "content": "If you do lie, admit to it . Sometimes it feels unavoidable to lie. Sometimes it happens without even thinking. If you do lie to someone, it is best to confess to your lie as soon as possible. Then, explain your motives and be sincere about your remorse. [11] X Research source If you get caught, don't deny it. That is simply another lie, and it will further erode trust."

      "title": "Speak from the heart.",
      "content": "Speak from the heart. When you feel like lying to someone, either to spare their feelings or to spare yourself from their unfavorable response, find an anchor point to focus on. Choose something good about that person and emphasize this in your communication. Speak to that anchor of goodness, rather than overplaying the bad news you need to convey. Be sure to offer your willingness to listen. It can be helpful to offer phrases like “It seems to me,” or “I believe that,” emphasizing that this is your perception of the truth. [12] X Research source Knapp, M. L. \"Lying and deception in human interaction.\" (2008). This shows you're open to other points of view, and can help preserve trusting relationships. Here's an example: If you need to tell a friend that she has made a mistake, explain what went wrong in neutral and non-judgmental language. Focus on her strengths, her value to you as a friend and, if possible, how she can redeem the situation. Then ask for her side of the story and listen intently. But, don't tell her everything is fine if actually is not. The conversation might go like this: \"Beryl, I believe you made a significant mistake on our report. I can see that you’ve been under a lot of stress with this new project. I know the mistake doesn’t reflect your talent or abilities. But, I think we should tell the client immediately and offer them a new report.\""

      "content": "Express your feelings. People who only convey hard facts come across as cold and distant. This does not encourage trust. You may think it's easier to just regurgitate the facts as they happened, according to you. But, without a layer of compassion and understanding, people may think you are relishing another person's distress."

[13] X Expert Source Moshe Ratson, MFT, PCC Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 7 August 2019. It's often a good idea to volunteer information to show that you aren't withholding information. [14] X Research source Here's an example: In a new one-on-one relationship, one partner might ask the other: \"How was your day?\" The response might be: \"It was alright.\" This does not build trust, because you haven't shared any real information. Now imagine another response to the question: “Well, I had a doctor’s appointment today. I thought it would be routine, but the doctor suspects that I might have a heart murmur. She said that she didn’t have any conclusive information, but she wants me to come in for more tests next week. I don’t know if I should be worried about this.\" This response suggests openness, and builds trust. In this case, your new partner would be upset to not know about the doctor’s news, even though you aren’t certain of the results yet. Omission would hurt the closeness of the relationship. This is because you might be worrying about the test all week, but your partner wouldn’t know why you were anxious. He or she would also probably want to know in case there was anything they could do to help you."

      "content": "Don't omit important details. The main reason it is best not to omit important details is because it is hard to stay consistent in what you share. People will start to notice contradictions in your stories, and you will lose credibility, even if you are only omitting a little. If you really want to build trust, tell people things they need or want to know."

Remember, everyone feels they have a right to control their personal information. [15] X Research source Petronio, S. (2013). Brief status report on communication privacy management theory. Journal of Family Communication, 13(1), 6-14. The key to being trustworthy while also maintaining your privacy is to make your boundaries clear. For example, you might tell someone: \"I am not ready to share my feelings about that right now. But, I promise you have nothing to worry about.\" This gives your listener a chance to prove that he or she is understanding and patient. Most importantly, it also gives your listener a sense of security. It is a better choice than being vague or dishonest to avoid talking about something private."

The tendency is to let things slip when you are under pressure, tired, or not thinking clearly. If this happens, own up to it quickly, and apologize. This way, the person won't find out from someone else that you have shared their private information. It also gives you a chance to help minimize any damage you may have caused."

Trust becomes solid when a person knows he or she has your loyalty. You can also build trust by putting the interest of another person or your relationship with that person ahead of your own. [16] X Research source Simpson, J. A. (2007). Psychological foundations of trust. Current directions in psychological science, 16(5), 264-268.

It is hard to trust someone who's emotions are unpredictable or volatile. A study of Fortune 500 executives found that those who regulated and appropriately expressed emotions were more likely to gain trust than those who did not. [17] X Research source Goleman, D. (1998). Working with emotional intelligence. Bantam. For example, try not to blow up at people when they make small mistakes. This will diminish their trust in you. If you feel overwhelmed by emotion, be aware of signals you are sending. Try to diminish those signals. Unclench your fists, relax your jaw, and release tension in your muscles. Focusing on your breathing can help you manage your emotions. Try to focus your attention on the feeling of your breath. You don’t need to think about the breath or try to change it, just experience the sensation. If you notice yourself getting distracted, gently redirect your thoughts back to your breathing.

For example, imagine your neighbor is playing music too loudly. An aggressive approach would be to go over to his house and yell: \"Turn that racket down or I'm calling the cops, jerk!\" An assertive approach would be to knock on his door and calmly say: \"Hey, it's getting late, and I need to go to bed soon. Would you please turn your music down a bit?\" This lets your neighbor know he's causing a problem without being insulting or threatening."
