While your breasts themselves do not have muscles in them, toning the underlying muscles might still help them resist the pull of gravity. Try to do weight training at least twice a week.

Lie on your back on the floor with a weight in each hand. Your elbows should be touching the floor with your forearms straight up in the air. Push the weights straight up until your arms are extended. Lower back to the starting position. Repeat.

      "content": "Wear a well-fitted sports bra during exercise. During exercise your breasts may bounce between 4 and 15 cm. This strains connective tissue that attaches your breasts to your chest and the skin that covers your breast tissue. A properly fitted sports bra can hold your breasts in place, reduce the bouncing, and prevent the skin and ligaments from stretching. A sports bra fits properly when: The underwire does not move around when you run and jump. But it shouldn’t be so tight that it restricts your breathing or hurts. This is where most of the support comes from. The cups should be fitted around the breasts with no areas where your breasts are spilling out. The material should also not be loose. You should completely fill the cups. The shoulder straps should not slip off your arms when you move nor press painfully into your skin. The band band should be even all the way around the body. No part of the band should be higher or lower than the rest of the band. If the bra has an underwire, it should be underneath the breast without pressing on the breast tissue."

      "content": "Preserve the youth and elasticity of your skin by not smoking. Nicotine constricts the blood vessels in your skin causing it to get less oxygen and nutrients. Other chemicals in cigarettes harm the collagen and elastin in your skin making it weaker and less stretchy. This causes wrinkling and sagging. As the skin of your breasts loses elasticity, your breasts will sag even if you are still young. If you already smoke, quitting will still help. Many resources are available to help you quit, including support groups, hotlines, and nicotine replacement therapies."

      "content": "Protect your breasts from skin damage. Low V-neck shirts are cool and sexy during the hot summer months, but they also expose the skin above your breasts to harmful ultraviolet radiation. UV rays damage the collagen and elastin which are vital to the skin’s connective tissues. This makes the skin less supple and prone to sagging. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Apply sunscreen when you will be outside for long periods of time, even if it is cloudy. Clouds do not prevent you from being exposed to UV rays. Avoid dark tans. While tanning might help protect you against sunburns, your skin is still absorbing UV rays and sustaining damage."

Keeping your skin soft and supple will prevent skin damage and help it heal quickly. If you are outside a lot, look for moisturizers with sunscreen in them. If you live in a very sunny place or near the equator, it may be possible to get burned through light layers of clothing."

      "content": "Keep your skin resilient by eating enough protein. Your body uses protein to heal, and this includes damage to the skin, connective tissues, and muscles which help your breasts resist gravity. [7] X Research source The average adult should eat two to three portions of a protein-rich food per day. This can be meat, milk, fish, eggs, soy, beans, legumes, or nuts. Lean meats and low fat dairy products are good because they won't simultaneously increase your fat intake."

Complex carbohydrates take longer to digest and provide you with energy for a longer period of time than simple sugars do. [8] X Research source Excellent sources of complex carbohydrates are beans, peas, lentils, peanuts, potatoes, corn, green peas, parsnips, and whole-grain breads. Simple sugars should be avoided and are found in candies, pastries, cake, soda, cookies, and table sugar. Carbohydrates should make up approximately half of the calories you consume each day."

      "content": "Avoid putting on and losing weight too quickly. Most women will gain and lose weight from their breasts as well as other body areas. Such rapid changes can cause your skin to stretch as you gain weight faster than your body can handle. Similarly, when you lose weight too quickly, you can wind up with excess saggy skin. [9] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you plan to gain or lose weight, see a nutritionist so you can plan to do it slowly and steadily to prevent your skin from stretching. Avoid becoming overweight. As you do, your breasts will become larger increasing their weight and making them more likely to sag over time. Avoid yo-yo dieting. Major weight fluctuations — going from very heavy to much lighter and then back to your original weight — is another way your skin can stretch out. Try to lose weight by losing 1 to 2 lbs. per week (cutting about 500 calories from your daily calorie intake), and make lifestyle changes to keep the weight off. Fad diets may cause you to lose weight rapidly, but it rarely stays off."

This stretches the ligaments, leaving lasting sagging. This sagging will happen regardless of whether you breastfeed and breastfeeding will not make it worse."
