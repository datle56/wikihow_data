Like all water signs, Pisces women are emotional, intuitive, and sensitive, and they're often ruled by feelings, rather than logic. They're also compassionate and understanding, mainly because they're so empathetic.

However, Pisces is also the sign of duality, explains Eyedealism. [8] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 13 January 2022.

However, since she’s so kind and giving, she’s also liable to be taken advantage of, so it's important to be conscious of this. When you ask her for a favor, she’ll always try to say yes, even if she’s already spread thin, so avoid taking advantage of her kindness and asking her for too much. She’ll also be slow to reach out for help, so try to do thoughtful things without her even having to ask. For example, if she’s having a rough week at work, surprise her with a delicious dinner and a fully-cleaned house when she gets home."
