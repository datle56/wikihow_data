The '80s continued a trend that had begun in the '70s—rock and roll kept splintering off into different groups, or subgenres. The subgenres differ in terms of their tone, style, and lyrical content—although in practice, a lot of bands could fit comfortably in several different subgenres. [63] X Research source For example, post-punk developed out of punk music and features a more polished, layered sound. Gothic rock, in turn, developed out of post-punk and features songs with gothic or macabre content. As artists began listening to and experimenting with different styles of music, various subgenres emerged. Pioneering bands were often just experimentalists who happened to do something people liked that no one had ever done before."

On the heels of videos and the usual concert merch, the idea of the band as a brand was born, with bands slapping their logo on anything that people might buy.

Before the '80s, rock and roll had been all about organically produced sounds—the vibrations created by guitars and drums connected to amplifiers. Post-punk, new wave, and related genres embraced synthesizers, drum machines, and sampling. [66] X Research source Bands in the '80s were able to integrate these elements into their music gradually, while still keeping the instruments people were familiar with. This technology, in turn, allowed musicians to further experiment with layering sound. Musicians also used technology to make their music much louder and much clearer than ever before—a trend that would continue through the following decades. Technology also gave listeners new, portable ways to listen to music. Having music with you all the time meant you needed more of it. It also meant that you felt closer to the bands you listened to."
