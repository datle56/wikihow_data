Scrub gently, rotating the brush and pinching the bristles so the water hits all sides. [4] X Research source Always hold the brush bristle side down when cleaning it. This way, water won’t travel up the bristles into the brush handle. [5] X Research source The water pressure helps dislodge paint that you may not have been able to clean just from wiping the brush. Coye suggests using a brush comb during this step to help get every chunk of paint off of the bristles. [6] X Expert Source Patrick Coye Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 22 July 2020."

Use your fingers to massage the soap into the brush. [7] X Research source If you are washing a big brush, make sure you are massaging the soap into the inner and outer bristles. It's important to work the soap into the place where the bristles meet the ring around the stem of the brush, which is called the ferrule . [8] X Research source Neglecting to clean the area of bristles around the ferrule can cause the bristles to harden, altering the shape of the brush."

Soap and water alone won’t get dry paint off a paintbrush (which is why it’s important to always wash your brush right away). The key is to break down the dried paint and soften the brush’s bristles . Rather than throwing a brush away, many artists will use these products and methods to remove dried-on paint: [13] X Research source Murphy’s Oil Soap: Let the bristles rest in the oil for 1 to 2 days, then wash as normal. Hand sanitizer: Swirl the bristles in hand sanitizer, massaging gently before washing as usual. Window cleaner: Spray the bristles with the cleaner, massage gently, and then wash. Isopropyl alcohol or nail polish remover: Dip the bristles in the chemical, then rinse and wash as usual. Vinegar: Heat vinegar on the stove, remove from heat once boiling, and carefully pour over brush in an aluminum baking pan. Let sit for at least 10 minutes before washing. [14] X Research source"

While cleaning a paintbrush is relatively easy, there are a few tools out there that can help the process, especially if you don’t like getting your hands dirty. Here are the best artist tools you can use to clean your brushes: [16] X Research source Brush tubs or basins are designed to hold your paint water and wash your brush all at once. These small buckets typically have 2 sides: one for dirty water and one for clean water. They also feature ridges and grooves to help knock paint off bristles. Brush mats can be used in or out of the sink. They have bumps, ridges, and grooves that can help gently pry paint off of brushes. Brush washers are similar to brush tubs, but many even have a clean water reserve and automatic water swirler. Some also have a special place to hold your brushes while they dry."

Dipping your paintbrush into water after each use is a great way to prevent the paint on the bristles from hardening.

When painting, you may be tempted to dip the bristles of the brush completely in the paint so the entire head of the brush is submerged. However, doing this can get paint around the ferrule of the brush, making it extremely difficult to clean. Over time, this can damage the brush and splay the bristles.. [20] X Research source Instead of dipping the brush in the paint up to the ferrule, dip only up to ¾ of the bristles. Remember, the ferrule is where the bristles and the brush handle meet.
