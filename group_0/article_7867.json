      "title": "Check your bag’s care label for cleaning instructions.",
      "content": "Check your bag’s care label for cleaning instructions. Lululemon Everywhere Belt Bags are often made out of waterproof fabric, so they have special cleaning requirements to keep them in good shape. Check the label inside your bag to find Lululemon’s specific recommendations, and proceed with caution if your bag is hand-washed or spot-clean only. Spot cleaning is generally safe (although some products may have different detergent requirements), but Lululemon doesn’t recommend machine washing for all bags. However, many people have had success with this method."

      "content": "Empty your bag, put the belt inside of it, and zip it up. To protect the strap, disassemble your belt bag and zip the loose parts inside of the pouch. Other than that, totally empty the bag before you wash it."

      "title": "Wash your bag in a garment bag on a gentle cycle with cold water.",
      "content": "Wash your bag in a garment bag on a gentle cycle with cold water. Use a thick mesh garment bag that’s about the same size as your belt bag (the large belt bag is 8.3 × 2.2 × 5.7 in (21.1 × 5.6 × 14.5 cm)). [1] X Research source Set your washing machine to “gentle” or “hand wash” and run it on cold."

      "title": "Use a gentle detergent and no fabric softener.",
      "content": "Use a gentle detergent and no fabric softener. Harsh products can damage the fabric of your bag and strip the waterproofing, so only use gentle detergents that work well for activewear, like OxiClean . [2] X Research source Harsh products (like bleach and alcohol) can strip the protective coatings, and fabric softener can get gummed up in the weave."

      "title": "Wash the bag in a small load with like colors.",
      "content": "Wash the bag in a small load with like colors. To prevent dyes from bleeding and transferring onto your bag, wash it with like colors. Avoid washing it with abrasive fabrics or items that tend to accumulate lint (anything that gets really staticky) to prevent minor breakage in the knit. You can wash it alone if you want, but putting a few other objects helps cushion the harder parts of the bag, like on the strap."

    {
      "title": "Lay your bag on a towel to air dry.",
      "content": "Lay your bag on a towel to air dry. Immediately take the bag out of the wash once it’s done to prevent wrinkling. Lay it out flat on a towel and let it dry completely; it may take up to 24 hours. Skip the dryer for this one—heat can damage your bag and warp it out of shape."

      "title": "Check for stains, then reassemble your bag.",
      "content": "Check for stains, then reassemble your bag. Once it’s dry, look over your bag to see if there are any remaining stains—if there are, you may want to try spot cleaning or taking it to a dry cleaner. Once you’re satisfied, take the belt out of the bag and put everything back together."

      "title": "Read the care label for cleaning instructions.",
      "content": "Read the care label for cleaning instructions. Some Lululemon bags can be damaged if washed incorrectly or if they come in contact with the wrong products. Follow the recommended cleaning instructions on the inside of the bag."

      "content": "Mix a gentle detergent and warm water in a bowl. For the Everywhere Belt Bag, Lululemon suggests spot cleaning with a little soap and water. Mix 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of a gentle, fabric softener free detergent into 16 fluid ounces (470 mL) of warm water. Let the detergent fully dissolve."

      "content": "Wipe down your bag with a microfiber cloth dipped in soapy water. Use a clean, dry, microfiber cloth to wipe all the loose dirt and dust off your empty bag, inside and out. Then, dip another clean cloth into the detergent mixture, and gently dab the stains. Test a hidden area first to be sure the detergent won’t cause discoloration. Wring out the cloth so it’s damp, not soaking wet."

      "content": "Wash off the detergent with lukewarm water and a cloth. Dip another clean cloth into fresh, lukewarm water, then press it to the area you just cleaned. The towel can be slightly more wet so it can saturate the area. Keep rinsing the towel and dabbing at your bag again until the detergent is all gone. [3] X Research source"
