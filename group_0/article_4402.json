When you check your phone later, you’re surprised to find a string of angry messages saying you “clearly don’t care about them\" because you didn't respond immediately. Your partner’s behavior has roots in two aspects of their BPD diagnosis: stress-related paranoia and fear of abandonment.

They crave evidence of your love, so they provoke, manipulate, and test you to gauge your loyalty. [9] X Research source Your reaction is seen as evidence of how much–or how little–you value them. [10] X Research source You might feel confused by their muddy logic and frustrated that you have to jump through hoops to show you care. Imagine that your partner with BPD begs you to cancel your plans with friends so the two of you can watch a movie together instead. If you agree to cancel, it’s proof that you love them. If you choose to hang out with your friends, it’s perceived as utter rejection. One symptom of borderline personality disorder is constant feelings of worthlessness.

Learning how to cope with small failures leads to greater success overall. [32] X Research source For example, instead of telling your partner with BPD to stop texting you at work, schedule times throughout the day to catch up with them, such as during lunch and breaks.
