      "title": "Clean the return tube and gas entry port.",
      "content": "Clean the return tube and gas entry port. Use carburetor cleaner and a small-bristled brush like a wire brush, toothbrush or pipe cleaner to clean off the carbon from the metal exhaust gas return tube and the gas entry port on the valve (usually the smaller hole with a spring-loaded pin, or “pintle”). If there is a lot of carbon build up around the EGR valve, you may also want to just save yourself some time and replace it with a new one."

      "title": "Clean out the entry port.",
      "content": "Clean out the entry port. The entry port is where the valve tubes connect to the engine (usually the intake manifold) while the EGR valve is off."
