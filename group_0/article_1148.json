      "content": "An alpha female is a strong and successful woman, typically in a leadership role. Alpha females are talented and ambitious women who publicly embrace their leadership skills. These women usually occupy positions of authority in their communities and workplaces. A high level of confidence is this woman's defining trait and it allows her to lead with ease. [1] X Research source In this context, \"alpha\" refers to the highest-ranking individual in a social hierarchy. The term was first used by research scientists as a way to describe animal behavior—an alpha is the leader of the pack. When \"alpha\" is used to describe human behavior, though, the word is more cultural than scientific. [2] X Research source If you fit into the “alpha woman” category, then it sounds like you’re super strong and successful—we love that! Hierarchical thinking can be empowering, but some feel that this kind of rigid type-casting is limiting and can leave people feeling like they have to change to fit in (which absolutely isn't true—you're great just the way you are)."
