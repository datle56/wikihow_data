To heal from this wound, try viewing your struggles and challenges through a more collective lens. You don’t have to worry about failure when you’re working as a team! Example: You’re trying to be the best-performing employee at work, but you’re terrified of falling short. Instead of competing against your coworkers, work with them to make your workplace as efficient and pleasant as possible."

      "title": "Chiron in Taurus (aka 2nd House)",
      "content": "Chiron in Taurus (aka 2nd House) Taurus is a very sensual sign, and Chiron in Taurus is no exception. Taurus finds a sense of pride and self-worth in the amount of money they have—but you can break this cycle by using your money and resources to help other people. Example: You’re hoping to buy this brand new video game system, but your friend needs help covering an emergency vet bill. Put your personal purchase on the back-burner and loan your friend enough money to cover their bills."

Put yourself and your personal healing first by developing and prioritizing friendships that make you feel happy and fulfilled.

      "title": "Chiron in Virgo (aka 6th House)",
      "content": "Chiron in Virgo (aka 6th House) To a Chiron in Virgo, there’s no such thing as “good enough.” Everything has to be absolutely perfect, even if it takes more blood, sweat, and tears than it’s worth. Take a step back from this paradigm and dedicate more time to the process rather than the final result . Example: You’re trying to clean your bedroom, but none of your efforts feel good enough. Instead of stressing about the present moment, focus on how much progress you’ve made since you first started."

      "title": "Chiron in Libra (aka 7th House)",
      "content": "Chiron in Libra (aka 7th House) Abandonment is never an easy pill to swallow, but it’s especially tough for people who have Chiron in Libra. They might second-guess the relationships they have, or worry about being left behind by their friends and loved ones at a moment’s notice. While there’s no easy or instantaneous way to heal from abandonment struggles, it can help to focus on strengthening your relationship with yourself. Example: Your friend recently ditched you to spend time with a new friend group, which really stings. Instead of thinking about the loss, focus on your defining traits and what makes you special."

    {
      "title": "Chiron in Scorpio (aka 8th House)",
      "content": "Chiron in Scorpio (aka 8th House) People with Chiron in Scorpio really struggle with the concept of control, whether it’s controlling someone else or being controlled themselves. Although it may be tough at first, the easiest way to heal from this type of wound is by empowering yourself and realizing your own authority over your life. Example: Your partner makes a lot of comments and suggestions about how you dress, and it’s making you really upset. Instead of dwelling on those feelings, take time to explain how you’re feeling and set boundaries."

    {
      "title": "Chiron in Sagittarius (aka 9th House)",
      "content": "Chiron in Sagittarius (aka 9th House) The bright and bold Sagittarius loves to explore new horizons—but someone with Chiron in Sagittarius is afraid of those new horizons leading them in the wrong direction. Combat these fears and insecurities by living life with your own rules and mindsets rather than doing what’s expected of you. Example: Your family really wants you to go to a specific school for college, but you aren’t sure if it’s the right path for you. Instead of going with what they want, choose an education or career path that makes the most sense for you and your goals."

    {
      "title": "Chiron in Capricorn (aka 10th House)",
      "content": "Chiron in Capricorn (aka 10th House) People with Chiron in Capricorn are often ambitious and wound themselves through a need for respect and approval. Free yourself from this burden by approaching work (and life!) in a more balanced way. Example: You just got promoted at work, but you’re worried about gaining the respect of the people you manage. Focus instead on being the best leader and worker you can be rather than seeking out other people’s approval."

    {
      "title": "Chiron in Aquarius (aka 11th House)",
      "content": "Chiron in Aquarius (aka 11th House) Individuals with Chiron in Aquarius are deeply wounded by isolation and may struggle to connect and bond with others in an effective way. Tap into Aquarius’s natural desire for social justice to network with and surround yourself with plenty of like-minded people. Example: You just started attending a new school, but you’re having trouble finding a place for yourself in a friend group. Create your own “group” by starting a club dedicated to recycling and saving the planet."

    {
      "title": "Chiron in Pisces (aka 12th House)",
      "content": "Chiron in Pisces (aka 12th House) Nobody likes to be picked on, but people with Chiron in Pisces are especially sensitive to the barbs and cruel words of other people. You can heal from this wound over time by incorporating your strong feelings and reactions into your day-to-day experiences. Example: Someone is picking on you at school, and you can’t help but feel hurt whenever they speak to you. Instead of bottling up your emotions and feeling them only in moments of intense pain, let yourself feel happy, sad, angry, and everything in between during the school day. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "A Chiron Return occurs around the time when you turn 50.",
      "content": "A Chiron Return occurs around the time when you turn 50. The Chiron planet typically spends multiple years under each zodiac constellation, so it doesn’t “return,” or cycle back to the position it was in at your birth, for around 50 years. [6] X Research source Since Chiron’s orbit falls between Saturn and Uranus, you can expect your Chiron Return to happen sometime after your Saturn Return and sometime before your Uranus Return. Most people experience just 1 Chiron Return in their lifetime—but if you make it to your 90s or 100s, you might just experience 2! Chiron Returns last for however long the planet stays under a specific constellation. People with Chiron in Aries or Pisces tend to have a slightly longer Return."

    {
      "title": "A Chiron Return offers opportunities for reflection and healing.",
      "content": "A Chiron Return offers opportunities for reflection and healing. During the Return, focus on the major wound that you’ve struggled with. How have you healed and learned from your pain? What lessons have you applied to your life since then? Use the time during your Chiron Return to really meditate on how you’ve dealt with this wound over the past few decades. [7] X Research source It’s okay if you find that you haven’t healed from or addressed your wound “perfectly.” What matters most is reflecting on the journey that’s brought you this far, and understanding yourself from a broader perspective."
