      "content": "AnyDesk doesn't give anyone access without a code. AnyDesk is legit software that tech support utilizes to take control of another device in the business or organization to troubleshoot and solve tech issues; [1] X Research source However, many scammers use this software to steal money from you. Since AnyDesk exposes your personal information, like your passwords, banking information, and other sensitive information, it's not safe to download and use unless you aren't using your own device (like in a business) or if you trust the other party."

      "content": "Phishing messages from fake tech support agents. You might get emails or texts from major brands (think Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple) that your device has a problem and you need to download AnyDesk so they can fix it. These texts or emails can claim that your phone, tablet, or computer has any number of viruses or malware detected. Scammers sometimes use real tech support numbers so Googling the number doesn't immediately let you know it's a fake number or a scam. If you're not sure if the text or email is real, go to the company's site that contacted you, like https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ if the text or email is from Microsoft, call their fraud department, explain what happened, and ask how to proceed to avoid becoming the victim of a cybercrime . They will let you know if the text or email was legitimate or a scam."

      "title": "Fake work-from-home job offers.",
      "content": "Fake work-from-home job offers. You'll see listings of WFH jobs and the recruiter asks that candidates download AnyDesk as a part of the hiring process. The job offer is an immediate red flag (might be fake) if they say that they saw your resume from a staffing agency that you don't recognize. If the recruiter says they found your resume on social media, consider how much of your resume is online and if you've posted about a new resume at all. They might be honest or completely lying. Since AnyDesk does offer software for companies providing work-at-home positions, you want to ask as many questions as possible about your job duties to see if the job offer is legit. Fake job offers usually are vague about what the position includes. A real recruiter should be able to answer all your questions about the job and responsibilities."

Protect yourself from these scammers by knowing when your data was leaked so you aren't tricked into a scam. These warnings can mimic the tech support approach where the scammer needs to access your computer with AnyDesk to remotely \"protect\" your leaked information."
