This means you should always choose one match per day to apply for. If you don't receive tickets for a certain match day, you can always apply during a later application period for a different match. Since millions of people apply for the tickets, it is a good idea to have 15 to 20 matches listed in order of priority."

      "content": "Decide what category and price point you will apply for. You can't choose the exact seats you would get; however, you apply for categories according to price and proximity to the pitch. Apply for category one to sit in the prime areas of the stadium. They are along the length of the pitch on either side. Prices are between $175 and $1,000 per match, increasing in price according to the tournament stage. Apply for category two to find a less expensive ticket in the corners of the stadium. Tickets are approximately $135 to $650, increasing in price according to the tournament stage. Apply for category three for a lower cost ticket behind the goals. Ticket prices are between $90 and $450 per match. Disabled access tickets are also at this price point. Apply for a category four only if you are a Brazilian resident. These are sections behind the goal and in the upper section of the stadium. Brazilian residents over the age of 60, students and welfare recipients will be able to apply for half price tickets."
