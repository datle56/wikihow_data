      "content": "Buy a lot of Poké Balls because you'll probably need extras. Eevee has a low catch rate, so you’ll want to have spare Pokeballs just in case the first one doesn’t catch them. If it's night, bring Dusk Balls to use as well. Try using a Quick Ball on the first turn if you have some. Quick Balls work best at the beginning of the battle. If you've already caught an Eevee, use a Repeat Ball. You know you've caught it when there is a Poké Ball next to its name."

[6] X Research source It is disheartening, but don't give up. It may take a while but you will eventually find one. Only then will you be able to catch it. You can only find it at level 18 and higher."

You're unlikely to catch it the first time, so be patient. An Ultra Ball gives a higher catch rate than an ordinary Poké Ball. [7] X Research source Have a Pokémon with a move that inflicts a status effect such as paralysis or sleep. This will make it easier to catch. Don't use moves that poison or confuse the other Pokémon or it could die by accident."

After you make it through the prompts, Amanita will grant you an Eevee with its hidden ability. This hidden ability carries over even if you evolve the Eevee. [9] X Research source Eevee’s hidden ability is Anticipation, which will make it shudder if an opponent uses a high-damage ability. This gives it a better chance of survival."
