      "content": "Cook or kill the lobster . Most people boil the lobster alive or immediately after death, with no prepping in advance. Transfer it to an ice bath as soon as it's done cooking, and you're ready to process it. If your recipe calls for raw lobster meat, instead put the live lobster on its belly and kill it humanely with a small, sharp knife where the head meets the body. Clean the raw lobster as described below, but do it over a bowl to catch raw juices, and rinse the meat before cooking it. [1] X Research source See these instructions for frozen lobster."

      "content": "Harvest the claws. Twist the claws off of the lobster or bend them back until they snap. If you have a hard shell lobster, break off the tip of the claws with a nutcracker, scissors, or the back of a heavy knife. [2] X Research source Push the meat out from the hole you made down through the \"wrist\" opening. If you have a soft shell lobster, just extract the meat with your finger. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove the tail. Uncurl the tail and flatten it out. You can remove by twisting the tail and body in opposite directions, or by pulling the tail back toward the head until it snaps off."

      "title": "Pick out the lobster's tail flippers.",
      "content": "Pick out the lobster's tail flippers. The fan at the end of the lobster tail consists of five flipper-like segments (a central \"telson\" and four \"uropods\"). Pull these segments off or cut them off with a chef's knife. There's a tiny bit of sweet meat inside each one, which you can get at with a lobster fork or by breaking the shell.

      "content": "Push out the meat from the tail. Removing the tail fan leaves a narrow hole at the tip of the tail. Push your finger or a lobster fork into this hole to push the meat out the other end, where the tail once met the body. Alternatively, put the tail upside-down on the table. Slice through either side of the shell with a pair of shears or strong scissors. Peel off the underside of the shell and remove the meat. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Collect the roe. If you have a female lobster, you might see roe — eggs — inside the tail shell. This turns pink when cooked, which gives it the name \"coral.\" Raw lobster eggs are black. Steam them for a couple minutes until they turn pink before eating. [8] X Research source"

Not everyone finds this appetizing, but some people add it to sauces or spread it on bread. [12] X Research source However, if the lobster's diet includes toxins, they accumulate in this organ. If you want to stay on the safe side, limit adults to one lobster's tomalley per day, and keep it away from children. [13] X Research source Discard the tomalley if there is a shellfish ban in your area due to PSP (paralytic shellfish poison). If the lobster consumed toxic shellfish, the poison accumulates in the tomalley, but the meat is safe. If you are harvesting a raw lobster, the tomalley will be grey and very perishable. Keep it ice cold and cook it as part of a sauce within a few hours of killing the lobster. [14] X Research source"
