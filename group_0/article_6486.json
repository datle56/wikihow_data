      "content": "You or a parent cannot change your birthday. Because of COPPA regulations, accounts under the age of 13 cannot change their birthday. For example, if you put your birthday as March 30, 2014, you need to wait 3 more years until the account ages to 13 before you can change the birthday. If you are actually over 13 and the birth date on your account is wrong, you may be able to use Roblox's new Age ID Verification feature to update it. [1] X Research source If you see a link that says Verify My Age under your birthday in Settings > Account Info , click on it and follow the instructions. You'll need some form of government ID, like a driver's license or a passport. You'll also need to send in a well-lit selfie. If you don't see the Verify My Age option, you may be able to get your age corrected by contacting someone in Roblox's Support department. [2] X Research source"
