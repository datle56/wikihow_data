      "content": "Boil a pot of water and add the dumplings. Use a large pot and fill it with water so it's two-thirds full. Don't add the dumplings before the water starts boiling. Once you've added the dumplings, stir them quickly so they don't stick to each other. [1] X Research source If you don't want your dumplings to be mushy, make sure to partially thaw them before boiling. Letting them sit at room temperature for 15 minutes should be enough."

      "title": "Add cold water and wait for it to boil again.",
      "content": "Add cold water and wait for it to boil again. Do this right after you've added and stirred the dumplings. If you've filled two-thirds of a large pot, you should add another 1.5 cups (350 mL) of water. Once you've done this, the water in the pot will stop boiling. Make sure you've brought it to a boil again before continuing. [2] X Research source Adding more water is done to prevent you from undercooking the filling. The filling and the dough in a frozen dumpling usually don't take the same amount of time to cook. By adding cold water, you slow down the cooking process and make sure both parts of the dumpling are cooked perfectly. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Add more water and boil it for the third time. Once again, pour 1.5 cups (350 mL) of cold water into the pot. Wait for the water to boil and then check if the dumplings are cooked through. They should be done when they start floating, but if they're not, simply boil them for another 2 to 3 minutes. [4] X Research source If you want to be sure the dumplings are cooked through, take one out of the pot, cut it in half, and try it. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Heat oil in a nonstick pan. Use a large pan since you'll need to arrange the dumplings neatly. Adding 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of vegetable oil to the pan should be enough to keep the dumplings from sticking. Heat the oil over moderate heat to avoid burning the dumplings. [6] X Research source When steam-frying the dumplings, you don't need to limit yourself to vegetable oil. You can use corn oil as well, or any other type of oil you normally use.

      "content": "Add partially thawed dumplings. Before arranging them onto the pan, you should make sure the dumplings aren't completely frozen. Simply let them sit at room temperature for 15 minutes before you start to prepare them. Arrange the dumplings in a single layer and try to keep them from touching each other.

Swirl the pan while the water is evaporating to give the dumplings a nice crust. The dumplings should now be ready to eat. [11] X Research source"

You should also oil a nonstick pan and place it over medium heat. It should be hot when you start frying the dumplings. [15] X Research source Let the dumplings sit for 15 seconds after microwaving and before frying them. Some of the water from them will evaporate, so when the dumplings come in contact with hot oil, there won't be any splattering. [16] X Research source If you're not in a rush, you can leave the dumplings to sit overnight. The colder the dumplings, the better the taste after they've been fried. [17] X Research source"
