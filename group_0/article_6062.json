      "content": "Pick a spot that provides bright but indirect light. Placing the tree in full sun might cause the leaves to burn. To avoid this problem, put the plant in front of a north-facing window and near either a west- or-east-facing window. Your tree shouldn’t be too close to a south-facing window. [5] X Research source If the colors on the leaves begin to fade, your plant isn’t getting quite enough light. If this happens, move it in front of the east- or west-facing window and keep an eye on the leaves. Burnt leaves will appear brown and dry on the tips. [6] X Research source"

Fill a houseplant container that’s double the size of your root ball halfway with potting soil that drains well. Center the tree in the container, then fill the rest of the pot with the soil. Use distilled water to thoroughly moisten the roots. [7] X Research source You may have bought your plant in a container from the nursery. You can leave it in there until it’s ready to be repotted!"

If the surface and several inches (or centimeters) of soil feel dry to the touch, water the plant with distilled water until the soil completely re-moistens. Keep an eye on the soil to prepare for the plant’s next watering. [8] X Research source Luckily, the leaves will tell you if you’re over or underwatering! If the leaves are falling off and turning yellow, you probably need more water. If they’re only yellowing at the tips, it’s more likely that you’re overwatering. When the leaves towards the bottom of the shoots brown or fall off, this is natural. It’s just the old leaves making way for new ones!"

Snip the ends off the roots to stimulate growth in the new pot. [18] X Research source Your new pot should also have drainage holes, and you should fill it about halfway with well-draining potting soil before placing the transplanted tree inside. Then, fill the pot with more soil and moisten with distilled water. If the tree doesn’t want to come out, straighten the coiled roots with your fingers. You can also tap the bottom and sides of the pot gently, then reposition it on its side. Wait at least a month to fertilize your repotted tree."

If the hole drains in under 15 minutes, your soil has good drainage. If the hole takes more than an hour (especially if it takes longer than six hours) to drain, you’ve got slow-draining soil. If the drainage doesn’t need to be adjusted too much, you may just be able to add some compost and well-rotted manure to improve it.

[26] X Research source If you’re experiencing extremely dry conditions, you may need to increase your watering. Look for leaves that are yellow at the tips to see if you’re overwatering. If the leaves are falling off, water the tree a bit more. If the leaves are only browning or yellowing and falling off at the bottom of the stems, this is just natural growth.
