      "content": "Hold the strip lash up to your eyelid to see if it's the right size. Before you apply any eyelash strip adhesive, check to see that the strip lash is the right size for your eyes. Hold the lash strip up to your upper eyelid and place it against your lash line so it's right on the edge of your eyelid.
