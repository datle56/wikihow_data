      "content": "Drinking 3-5 cups a day may increase the fat your body burns. Green tea is loaded with antioxidants that are good for your health in general, but it also contains a compound called EGCG, which can help reduce fat absorption from your diet. Green tea can also help increase the fat that your body burns. Ditch the coffee and reach for the green tea if you need a little pick-me-up. [1] X Research source Green tea does have some caffeine in it, which is great if you need a little energy burst, but may cause you to have trouble getting to sleep if you drink it late at night."

      "content": "Studies suggest it can help you lose weight. Your body naturally makes vitamin D from sunlight, but you can’t get any from your diet. Vitamin D helps boost the effectiveness of a hormone called leptin, which tells your brain that you’re full when you’re eating. Take a daily vitamin D supplement to give your body a boost and make sure you have enough.

      "content": "You don’t have to spend hours to get a good workout in. Life can get hectic! Between work, cooking, cleaning, and managing your household, it can feel almost impossible to squeeze in time to exercise. Start small and make it a priority to get at least 20-30 minutes of physical activity 2-3 times a week. The more you do it, the easier it’ll become as you develop a new habit. [4] X Research source Find a time that works best for you and stick to it. For instance, if you have a little bit of free time after you drop the kids off at school, get some exercise! You can also try to start early in the morning or right after work—whatever is most convenient for you."

Walking is easy, free, and you don’t need any special equipment. Take a walk around your neighborhood or find a scenic place such as a park to get out and stretch your legs.

      "content": "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) burns fat and builds muscle. HIIT workouts alternate between short bursts of intense exercise and brief periods of rest. You can do HIIT workouts at home with little to no equipment. HIIT actually triggers your body to burn more stored fat and activate muscle-building hormones at the same time. It’s the best of both worlds! [6] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source You can create a simple HIIT workout by choosing a few of your favorite exercises such as jumping jacks, squats, pushups, or situps. Do as many as you can for 20 seconds, rest for 10 seconds, and then repeat the exercise for 4-5 rounds before moving to a different exercise."

      "content": "Use muscle-building exercises to help boost lipolysis. Lipolysis is the process of burning fat for energy and cardio alone won’t help you get rid of more stored body fat. Lifting weights builds muscle which means your body will burn more fat to fuel your muscles. Get yourself some free weights and mix in 2-3 muscle-building workouts a week. [7] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Some of the classic lifts like the deadlift, squat, and bench press are classics for a reason—they work. Work with a trainer or an experienced partner to make sure you use the right form when you do them. If you’re new to weight lifting, take it slow. You’ll get better (and stronger) in time, and you don’t want to injure yourself by using poor form and technique."

It’ll keep your muscles confused and working hard and it’ll help keep your workouts from becoming boring. [8] X Research source For instance, if you’ve been doing an HIIT workout with lots of pushups and squats, try swapping them out for something like pullups and lunges. Change up your weight lifting exercises, too. For example, try switching from flat bench press to incline bench press to keep challenging your muscles."

If you’re anxious and ready to start burning fat, it can be tempting to want to drastically cut back your calories. However, it could actually make your body store even more fat because it thinks it’s starving. Instead, make slow, gradual changes and try to cut about 500 calories a day. [9] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source For example, instead of completely cutting out all carbs, try switching to healthier sources such as brown rice and sweet potatoes so you aren’t starving yourself."

      "content": "Avoid eating 2-3 large meals to keep your metabolism up. While it’s traditional and common to eat three meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), if you’re trying to burn fat by following a healthier diet, your body can actually try to store more fat if there’s too much time in between meals. Spread out your daily food into 6 smaller meals spaced out throughout your day. That way, you’ll always have fuel and your metabolism will keep firing away.

It helps break down the food so your body is better able to digest it, plus it slows you down while you eat, which can help you feel fuller faster. Take your time and chew each bite well.
