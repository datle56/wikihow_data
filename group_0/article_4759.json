      "content": "Match the bat box to the species in your area. Just like there are different species of birds, there are also different species of bats! They can be large or small, and they vary in dietary needs as well. Try to look up the species in your area to see how large they are, where they’re coming from, and what kind of food they like to eat. [2] X Research source Traditional bat boxes are great for larger bats; smaller bat species might need a rocket box instead."

      "title": "Boost the bat population in your area with a bat box.",
      "content": "Boost the bat population in your area with a bat box. Bat numbers have been steadily declining, especially in cities and populated areas. Since bats rely on dead trees to roost and catch food, they often can’t find good spots to hang out in. By mounting a bat box, you can give them a home and a safe spot away from predators so they can eat, sleep, and be merry. [3] X Research source At least 13 types of bats in the United States are endangered, and more are threatened every day. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Use bats to eat insects and pests. Hate getting eaten up by mosquitoes every night? Bats are great natural insect hunters, so they can actually cut down on the flying pests that plague your yard. One bat can eat up to 1,000 insects a night, so using them in your yard can really help you out!

      "content": "Dedicate a few hours to your bat box. While the plans are relatively simple, cutting out and installing your bat box can take up to 2 hours of your time, or more if you aren’t working with power tools. Try to set aside an entire afternoon to create your masterpiece so you can make sure it’s safe and secure for the bats in your area. [6] X Research source Using a circular saw can really help speed up the process."

      "title": "Measure and cut 2 side panels out of untreated wood.",
      "content": "Measure and cut 2 side panels out of untreated wood. Bats are sensitive to chemicals and smells, so make sure you’re using untreated wood (wood that hasn’t been processed with chemicals). Then, use a measuring tape to mark out 2 side panels that are both 150 millimetres (5.9 in) wide, 140 millimetres (5.5 in) tall on one side, and 200 millimetres (7.9 in) tall on the other side. [7] X Research source You can save wood by cutting the side panels right next to each other at a diagonal. Find untreated wood by looking for lumber that has the Forest Stewardship Council (or FSC) logo of approval on it."

      "title": "Cut out the front, base, lid, and back.",
      "content": "Cut out the front, base, lid, and back. Using the same piece of wood, grab your tape measure again and mark out the next 4 pieces. Then, use a saw to cut them out. The measurements are: [8] X Research source Front piece: 150 millimetres (5.9 in) wide by 140 millimetres (5.5 in) tall. Back plate: 150 millimetres (5.9 in) wide by 330 millimetres (13 in) tall. Base piece: 150 millimetres (5.9 in) wide by 90 millimetres (3.5 in) tall. Lid piece: 150 millimetres (5.9 in) wide by 200 millimetres (7.9 in) tall."

      "content": "Pain on 2 coats of water-based stain to the inside of the wood. To protect the wood while it’s outside, grab a can of water-based stain and open it up with a screwdriver. Use a paint brush to paint a thin layer onto all of the sides of the wood that are going to face inwards; let it dry for about 1 hour, then paint on another layer. [9] X Research source Adding a stain before assembling the pieces is much easier than waiting until after, and it will help keep your bat box around for a long time. You can find wood stains at most hardware stores."

      "content": "Screw the sides to the back plate. Line the side plates up with the center of the back plate, leaving an equal amount of room on the top and the bottom. Angle the diagonal sides of the side plates toward the top so they slope downwards toward you, then use 1 in (2.5 cm) screws to attach the side pieces to the back plate. [10] X Research source You’ll need to use about 4 screws per side piece."

    {
      "title": "Attach the front and the base.",
      "content": "Attach the front and the base. Connect the front piece by lining it up with the flat part of the side pieces, then use the 1 in (2.5 cm) screws again to attach it in place. Set up the base piece so it connects with the front and sides, but leave a 15 millimetres (0.59 in) gap between the back plate and the base. Then, use your screws to attach it on the 3 sides that connect with the rest of the box. [11] X Research source The small gap between the base and the back plate is super important, since this is where the bats will enter and exit the box."

      "content": "Press the lid on top of the front plate and screw it down. The lid is for viewing and cleaning purposes only, so it’s made for you to use. Set your lid piece on top of the front plate and angle it so it hits the top of the back plate, then use nails to attach the lid to the front. [12] X Research source Make sure the top of the lid fits snugly against the back plate to protect from rain, wind, and snow."

      "content": "Cut the front and back pieces out of 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) thick plywood. Start by measuring out a front and a back piece that are both 36 inches (91 cm) tall and 6.125 inches (15.56 cm) wide. When you reach the top 5 inches (13 cm) of each piece, cut it into a point at the end. You’ll end up with 2 boards that are pointed at the top like fence posts."

Working with the same piece of plywood, mark out 2 side panels that are both 31 inches (79 cm) tall and 5.125 inches (13.02 cm) wide. Then, mark out 2 roof panels that are 5 inches (13 cm) tall and 7 inches (18 cm) wide. Use your saw to cut these pieces out and set them aside."

      "content": "Assemble the pieces by nailing together the front, back, and sides. Now it’s time to create your rocket! Line up the front, back, and side pieces with the pointed tops facing upwards. This will create a shape that’s like an old-fashioned rocket (hence the name). Nail those boards together with 1 in (2.5 cm) nails on all 4 sides. [13] X Research source There will still be an opening at the top of the box since you haven’t attached your roof plates yet."

      "title": "Angle the roof plates on top and nail them down.",
      "content": "Angle the roof plates on top and nail them down. Grab the other 2 panels that you have left and attach them to the top of the pointed pieces with nails. Make sure all your joints are super airtight to keep out the wind and rain. If you notice any gaps, use caulk to fill them before you move on. Making the box airtight will keep the bats warm and safe during bad weather."

      "content": "Roughen the outside of a 4 by 4 ft (1.2 by 1.2 m) wooden post. Grab an untreated wooden post that you can use for mounting that’s at least 5 feet (1.5 m) tall. Then, use sandpaper to roughen the outside of it so the bats have something to cling onto to get inside of the box. Make sure the wood you’re using is untreated, meaning it doesn’t have any chemicals in it. Bats are sensitive to chemicals and smells, so they may avoid your box if it’s been treated."

      "content": "Mount the rocket box onto the top of the pole. Cut the top of your untreated wooden pole into a triangle so your box can sit on top of it. Slide the rocket box up over the top of the pole, then use nails to attach the top of the box to the top of the pole on the inside. Make sure there is a space around the pole on the inside of the box so the bats can climb underneath and inside. [14] X Research source This is a super cozy way for bats to stay warm and hang out during bad weather."

      "title": "Paint the exterior of the box to protect the wood.",
      "content": "Paint the exterior of the box to protect the wood. If you want to keep your bat box around for a long time, slap a few coats of paint on the outside and wait for them to dry. You can also stain your wood to keep the natural color while protecting it at the same time, but this step is optional. [15] X Research source Don’t put any paint on the inside of the box, as the smell can irritate the bats."

      "title": "Pick a spot that gets a lot of sunlight.",
      "content": "Pick a spot that gets a lot of sunlight. Bats are warm-blooded, but they can get pretty chilly during cold weather. It’s important to let your bat house warm up during the day, so try to pick an area that gets around 5 to 6 hours of sunlight for the best positioning. [16] X Research source Bats let their body temperature drop when they aren’t moving to conserve energy."

      "content": "Mount your bat box at least 12 ft (3.7 m) above the ground. If you built a rocket box, you can mount your untreated pole to a second, longer pole and use that to put your box into the ground. If you made a standard box, try to find a building or a tree nearby where you can hang your bat box up high and away from predators. [17] X Research source While 12 feet (3.7 m) above ground is fine, 15 to 20 feet (4.6 to 6.1 m) is better! Wood and stone buildings tend to heat up during the day, which makes them ideal locations for a bat box."

      "title": "Hang your box by late winter.",
      "content": "Hang your box by late winter. Bats will find your bat box on their own, and they’ll usually come looking for one in the springtime. Try to make sure your box is mounted and secure by late winter so the bats feel safe and secure hanging out there. [18] X Research source It may take a few years for the bats to find your box, so don’t get discouraged if they don’t use your bat box right away. While hanging a bat box can attract bats to your property, it isn’t a guarantee that they’ll feel safe there. If there are predators in the area or too many other bats to compete with, they might not use your box (so it’s nothing personal)."
