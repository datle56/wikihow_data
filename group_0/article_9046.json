      "content": "Grab a partner and tell them to close their eyes. The Concentrate Game is only played with 2 people. One person does the talking, and the other is the victim, who just listens. Grab a friend and have them turn around and close their eyes. Stand behind them and position them in front of something soft (like a bed or a pile of cushions) but don’t tell them why. It also helps if you turn out the lights, and play this game after dark. Other people can be in the room for the game, but nobody can speak but the person reciting the lines."

      "content": "Recite the ritual’s chorus while pounding the person’s back lightly. The Concentrate Game works like a song. There are verses and a chorus you repeat after every verse. Start with the chorus, and while you recite it in a sing-song voice, make both your hands into fists and pound the victim’s back lightly. The chorus goes like this: [1] X Research source Concentrate. Concentrate. Concentrate on what I’m saying. People are dying. Children are crying. Concentrate. Concentrate. Concentrate on what I’m saying."

      "content": "Say the first verse while tapping on the victim’s head. While you recite the second verse, tap 3 times on the victim’s head with your fist, then run the fingers of both your hands down either side of their head, like pretending you’re cracking an egg. Remember to go back to the chorus afterward! The first verse goes like this: Crack an egg on your head. Let the yolk run down. Let the yolk run down. Crack an egg on your head. Let the yolk run down. Let the yolk run down. Repeat the chorus before moving to the next verse."

      "content": "Recite the second verse while squeezing the victim’s shoulders. This time, squeeze and twist their shoulders with your hands, like you’re squeezing oranges, then graze your fingers down both their arms, as you recite the second verse, which goes like this: [2] X Research source Squeeze an orange on your shoulder. Let the juice drip down. Let the juice drip down. Squeeze an orange on your shoulder. Let the juice drip down. Let the juice drip down. Repeat the chorus before moving to the next verse."

      "content": "Say the third verse while poking their sides. Use your pointer finger to lightly jab the victim’s sides, as though you’re poking them with a needle, then run your fingers down to their waist while you say the third verse, which goes like this: Stick a needle in your sides. Let the blood drip down. Let the blood drip down. Stick a needle in your sides. Let the blood drip down. Let the blood drip down. Repeat the chorus before moving to the next verse."

      "content": "Say the fourth verse while lightly pounding their back. Now, as you recite the fourth verse, lightly tap the victim’s back with your fists, like you do during the chorus, which is supposed to feel a bit like being stabbed. This time, though, trickle your fingers down their back, too. Stab a knife in your back. Let the blood drip down. Let the blood drip down. Stab a knife in your back. Let the blood drip down. Let the blood drip down. Repeat the chorus before moving to the next verse."

Once you shout the word “Pull!” in the fifth verse, yank your fist upward. Wrap a rope around your neck. Wrap it till it’s tight. Wrap it till it’s tight. Wrap a rope around your neck. And… PULL! Repeat the chorus before moving to the next verse."

As you do, whisper the final verse. Once you reach the last words, push them forward with your hands onto a bed or a pile of cushions. [3] X Research source You’re standing on a building. You’re out on the ledge. You’re feeling very dizzy. And you’re close to the edge. And someone… PUSHES YOU!"

      "content": "Ask the victim what color they saw to reveal how they’ll die. It’s said that when you push the victim to their pretend death, a color will flash behind their closed eyes. People say that the color you see foretells how you die. Ask the victim what color they saw, then declare their cause of death: Red: Stabbing Blue: Drowning Yellow: Poisoning Orange: Burning Green: Falling (onto grass) Purple: Suffocating Brown: Buried alive Gray: Illness Black: Old age, and sent to hell. White: Old age, and sent to heaven."

      "content": "People say the Concentrate Game predicts how you’ll die. At the end of the game, when the victim is “pushed” off a pretend building, it’s said that they’re supposed to see a color. The color the victim sees is supposed to tell them how they’ll die. Spooky! Of course, the game can’t actually tell you how you’ll die. It’s just for fun."

      "title": "No, the Concentrate Game is only pretend.",
      "content": "No, the Concentrate Game is only pretend. The Concentrate Game won’t tell you how you die. It’s just an urban legend! It’s hard to say where it started, but it was probably thought up by someone just like you, looking to have a fun and frightening time. They got what they wanted, and the game spread, so now you can have a fun time with your own friends while staying totally safe. The Concentrate Game tricks your body into feeling things that aren’t real—sort of like you’re being hypnotized. As the victim, you become relaxed and able to focus on what’s being said to you. You eventually focus so much that the things start feeling a little real, like a rope around your neck or falling off a building. That’s a form of hypnosis! [4] X Research source This is part of the fun of the game: feeling spooky things that aren’t actually happening."
