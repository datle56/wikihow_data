      "content": "Soak the broccoli rabe in cool water. The best way to clean a leafy green like rabe is to give it a cold water bath. Fill a large bowl with cool water. You can also use a clean sink if you prefer. Dump the rabe in, separating the leaves as you go so dirt can shake loose. [1] X Research source Alternatively, you can wash the greens under cold, running water. However, submerging them is a safer bet for getting out all the dirt and grit."

      "title": "Swish the greens around.",
      "content": "Swish the greens around. Once you have the greens submerged, you need to agitate them, much like a washing machine does. Move them around in the water so that the dirt comes away form the leaves and into the water. [2] X Research source Wash all the crevices in the rabe, including in and around the small buds."

      "title": "Let them sit.",
      "content": "Let them sit. Once the you've agitated the rabe for a few minutes, walk away and let them soak. The greens should float to the top, while the dirt should sift to the bottom. Five to ten minutes is sufficient time for them to soak. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Give them another rinse.",
      "content": "Give them another rinse. If the greens are extra dirty, they may need another rinse. Scoop them out, and refill the water. In fact, the rule of thumb used to be three rinses.

      "title": "Dry the greens.",
      "content": "Dry the greens. Unless you're blanching or boiling the broccoli rabe, dry it before cooking. You can place the greens in a salad spinner to dry them off. Do it in batches if you need to. An overfilled salad spinner won't get the greens dry. [6] X Research source You can also lay them on a paper towel for drying and pat the top with more paper towels."

      "title": "Slice off the ends of the stems.",
      "content": "Slice off the ends of the stems. As with many vegetables, the cut ends of the broccoli rabe may have turned brown in the time the vegetable was in the store. Cut off about an inch of each stem before you start cooking. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut off any bad parts. If you notice any parts of the broccoli rabe look bad, don't be afraid to cut that part out. Look for brown or discolored areas, for instance. It's better to throw out areas that you're unsure about, as they can harbor bacteria.

Also, have a bowl of ice water ready for after you cook the broccoli rabe. [9] X Research source Many recipes call for the rabe to be blanched before other methods of cooking. The main purpose is to cut some of the bitterness."
