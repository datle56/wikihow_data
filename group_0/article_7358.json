      "title": "Go for nude shades if you have a light or medium skin tone.",
      "content": "Go for nude shades if you have a light or medium skin tone. Nudes tend to work best for light-coloured or medium-coloured skin. Lighter skins benefit from a pinkish nude. Avoid beige if you have pale skin, as it could create a yellow undertone. If you have medium-coloured skin, you can go for either beige nudes or nudes with a pinkish undertone. Both will look great on your skin. [1] X Research source Dark skin tones don't look as good with nude shades, but if you want something lighter and less noticeable, try pastels."

      "title": "Choose a pink shade for any skin tone.",
      "content": "Choose a pink shade for any skin tone. If you love pink, you'll be happy to know it works for every skin tone. Pale skin tends to look great with any type of pink, from soft baby pinks to bright fuchsias. Peachy shades of pink look great on medium skin tones. Dark skin looks great with very bright, vibrant pinks. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick blue for any skin tone.",
      "content": "Pick blue for any skin tone. Blue is a universal colour that looks great on pretty much any skin tone. If you have pale skin, played down blues like navy blues look great. Medium skin tones look good with sky blues or pastel blues. Vibrant shades, like cobalt blues, look good on dark skin. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Experiment with purple.",
      "content": "Experiment with purple. Purple looks good on pretty much any skin tone, but different shades match better with different tones. If you have a pale skin, opt for lavenders. For medium skin, go for a pastel shade with hints of gray. For dark skin, both pastels and brighter shades of purple look great.

      "title": "Choose the best red for your skin tone.",
      "content": "Choose the best red for your skin tone. If you have pale skin, go for a bright, classic red and avoid sheer tones. For medium skin, red-orange shades look great. For dark complexions, go for a deep wine red. [5] X Research source If you have pale skin, hold up a bottle of red polish to the light when shopping. If you can see through the polish, it's too sheer for your skin."
