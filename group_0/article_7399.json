      "title": "Keep it short.",
      "content": "Keep it short. Generally speaking, the number one rule of dealing with thinning hair is to not let it get too long. This applies to men with both straight and curly hair, and anything in between. Close-cropped cuts will give your hair a more uniform appearance and make inconsistencies in fullness less noticeable. [1] X Research source For most hairstyles, a length of about an inch or less will work best for minimizing the appearance of thin patches. Trying to compensate for hair loss by leaving hair longer in certain areas usually just highlights the thin spots. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Go with a combover.",
      "content": "Go with a combover. Smooth your hair in one direction so that it lays over spots with the most thinning. This technique will be especially useful if most of the thinning is concentrated around the crown. Combover styles are versatile because they allow you to slick your hair back, part it to one side or brush it down for a more tousled look. [3] X Research source Comb overs can be done on both long and short hair. A combover won’t always be able to hide everything. If bare patches are still peeking through, it may be worth it to give a more subtle style a shot."

      "title": "Style it up for added height.",
      "content": "Style it up for added height. Work a little low-hold product into your hair, then comb or tease it with your fingers until it comes to a subtle point over the crown. By drawing the hair inward toward the center, you can conceal bald spots and create the illusion of height and thickness. Just use a comb to coax the hair upward before sweeping it over. [4] X Research source Piled-up styles will look best with cuts that preserve a little length on top while keeping the hair short on the back and sides. Gathering the hair in the middle will be especially useful for men with fine, straight hair , which tends to have a harder time providing coverage over the scalp. [5] X Research source Use a temporary colored-hairspray that matches your natural color to style your hair. The color in the hairspray can help fill in thin spots so they look fuller."

    {
      "title": "Shave it off.",
      "content": "Shave it off. If the thinning is already fairly advanced, or if you’ve begun balding all over, the best solution may be to just take a trimmer to what’s left. A buzzcut will help make bare patches less obvious by bringing the hair closer to the scalp all over. Less hair means less cutting, grooming and styling to deal with. [6] X Research source Buzz thinning hair down to a quarter inch or shorter, or go all the way and shave all the way down to the skin. [7] X Research source Many men prefer the freedom and ease of upkeep that shaved hairstyles offer. If you shave your hair off and you don't like the way it looks, you can always wear a hat until your hair grows out."

    {
      "title": "Grow your hair out.",
      "content": "Grow your hair out. When you first notice your hairline starting to recede in front, it will help to put on a little extra length. You can then slick the hair back, presenting a full, sleek look. As an added bonus, slicked hair will naturally appear thicken when it’s laying in the same direction. [8] X Research source Though most style experts advise against longer cuts on men with thinning hair, with the right length and arrangement they can work wonders. Just be careful not to let the hair get too long, or you could end up looking like you’re trying to overcompensate."

    {
      "title": "Comb it down.",
      "content": "Comb it down. Arrange your fringe so that it drapes over your forehead. The result is a casual mid-length style that neutralizes a retreating hairline without being too conspicuous. Men with straight hair can stick with a modest length, while those with wavy and curly locks should plan on going a little longer to make the most of the screen that the added volume provides. [9] X Research source Like piled-up styles, this look will be most successful with hair that’s longer on top and shorter on the sides. Work with your natural part or let the hair come together in a precise point rather than simply letting it hang in your face. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Try out an undercut.",
      "content": "Try out an undercut. Undercuts are a throwback style for men in which the hair on the sides is closely cropped or buzzed, leaving all the length and thickness on the crown. This may be just what you need to fight back against a hairline that’s receding at the temples. Undercuts draw the eye to the fuller hair on top while making thinner areas look intentional. [11] X Research source High blended hairstyles are also a popular choice among many actors, models and celebrities, making them a timely and fashionable solution. As an alternative to a more exaggerated undercut (which can look somewhat dated), consider a close and clean military-inspired high-and-tight."

    {
      "title": "Cut your hair in uneven layers.",
      "content": "Cut your hair in uneven layers. Trim the hair in sections along the crown and let them fall loosely together. The overlapping layers will help reinforce thickness in places where it’s needed most. Textural depth is also useful for making hair appear more plentiful. [12] X Research source The basic idea behind layers is that they “stack” on top of one another, enhancing volume. Layered cuts will work best for a more playful, casual aesthetic, as they can be tough to style neatly for dressed-up situations."

    {
      "title": "Wash your hair every other day.",
      "content": "Wash your hair every other day. Natural oils and residue from styling products can weigh the hair down, causing it to look flat and lifeless. Regular rinses with shampoo will strip away this buildup and give thinning hair some much-needed lift. Start shampooing three to four times a week (about every other time you shower), assuming you don’t already, and finish with a blow dryer to give your hair an extra fluffy texture. [13] X Research source Choose shampoos and conditioners that are formulated to make hair more voluminous. You can also find shampoos and conditioners designed specifically for thinning hair. [14] X Research source Avoid oversaturating newly-washed hair with greasy products. These will reduce volume and leave it limp."

      "title": "Shave patchy balding spots.",
      "content": "Shave patchy balding spots. No combover is going to cover a crown with an erratic balding pattern. Keep your hair short and neatly groomed to prevent pervasive hair loss from commanding too much notice. Use a razor to do away with stray tufts that stand out on darker colored hair. [15] X Research source Multiple small bald spots can be even more noticeable than one big one. If you’re balding all over, including the back and sides, you may have little choice but to opt for a short buzz or clean-shaven cut."

      "title": "Grow out your facial hair.",
      "content": "Grow out your facial hair. A fashionable mustache, goatee or beard will call attention away from flagging head hair and instead complement your other features. This can suggest a graceful maturation in the way you present yourself. Well-kept facial hair also tends to make older men look more distinguished, showing that you take your appearance seriously. [16] X Research source Sprout a layer of thick stubble for youthful, rugged air, or play up your masculinity with a full beard. [17] X Research source Facial hair is always in style, and can stand on its own no matter how much (or little) hair you have on your head."
