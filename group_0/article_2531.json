      "content": "Compare assertive and passive behavior. Assertiveness is not the same as arrogance. A passive person often allows his/her own rights to be violated by agreeing to things even when s/he does not want to do them, refusing to make her/his own decisions, being overly self-effacing, and refusing to communicate about thoughts and feelings honestly. [1] X Research source An assertive person is not afraid to say “no” to inappropriate or unfeasible requests and is confident in appropriately expressing her/his feelings, needs, and reactions to others. Assertive individuals do not allow their own rights to be violated, and they do not violate others’ rights or feelings in order to express their own. Assertive individuals feel a strong sense of internal confidence (i.e., a feeling that you are acting according to your personal values and that you are doing your best). Assertiveness enhances emotional honesty, directness with others, and interpersonal relationships. If you do not stand up for yourself or you rely on others to make all of your decisions, your interpersonal relationships are not as likely to be satisfying. Non-assertive individuals generally experience lower levels of well-being and emotional security. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Recognize assertive behaviors. Assertive behavior is as much about how you say something as what you say. Assertiveness does not mean hurting or belittling another person; instead, it is about expressing your own right to have thoughts, needs, and feelings. The following are some examples of assertive behavior: [3] X Research source Expressing your feelings clearly. Telling others of your needs in a non-threatening manner. Avoiding name-calling, swearing, and other inappropriate expressions Communicating honestly and directly Recognizing others’ rights in communication Using cooperative statements and seeking others’ opinions An example of assertive behavior would be to tell the person who cut in front of you in line at the store in a calm voice, “I was next in line. I don’t appreciate that you cut in line like that.” If the situation were reversed and you accidentally cut in line, an assertive behavior would be to accept responsibility and apologize: “I’m sorry, I didn’t see you standing in line. I’ll go behind you.” Asserting responsibility doesn’t mean you have to grovel or demean yourself, just that you recognize others’ needs as well as your own."

While some people seem born more confident than others, communicating assertively and appropriately is a skill that requires time and practice to develop. This is especially true for women, who often face social and cultural pressures to refrain from using assertive behaviors and communication. Apologizing and taking responsibility is a healthy, helpful response to a failure to communicate appropriately. This helps keep the door open for future communication."

Social and cultural pressures may encourage you to believe that you don’t have the right to say “no” in certain circumstances, such as at work or with friends. If you are a woman, you may face social stigma if you behave assertively, such as being called “shrill,” “pushy,” or “angry” [4] X Research source . However, it is important to recognize that nobody deserves to feel worthless or intimidated. You have the right to have needs, thoughts, and feelings, and the right to express them appropriately."

      "content": "Recognize where you need to make changes. If you routinely feel pressured into agreeing to things at work or with friends, or if you feel depressed and powerless in your interactions with others, you probably need to work on your assertiveness in those areas. Remember that passivity isn’t actually doing anyone a favor; it can make you feel unappreciated or overlooked, and it isn’t honest with others. Try keeping a journal of times when you feel intimidated, coerced, pressured, passive, or timid. This can help you determine what areas pose the greatest problems for you, and where you should focus your assertiveness training."

      "content": "Ask for help. If you know you have a problem responding assertively to situations, it’s a good idea to ask for help from someone you trust. This could be a friend, a partner, a boss, or a counselor. Describe the situation and the problem as specifically as possible, and then describe the changes you’d like to make in your behavior. For example, if you know you have a problem agreeing to doing extra projects at work without compensation, you could talk to a trusted co-worker about strategies for you to assert yourself the next time you’re asked to take on extra work. You can also practice your assertive responses with these trusted individuals before putting them into play in the problem situation. Rehearsing the situation will help you figure out how to approach the situation appropriately and may help alleviate anxiety."

It takes time and practice to become a skilled assertive communicator, and it can be very anxiety-provoking for individuals who aren’t accustomed to asserting themselves. Try out your skills in situations where you can practice assertiveness safely and without too much weight attached to the interaction. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, if you routinely have difficulty asserting your preferences, the next time your order is taken incorrectly at a restaurant or coffee-shop, politely clarify the situation and ask that it be addressed: “I asked that my steak be cooked medium.

      "content": "Check the context of situations. Sometimes, passive or aggressive individuals may think you are being arrogant when you aren't. It's important to recognize when critiques represent a misinterpretation of your behavior, and when they might be valid. To respond to these critiques, try emphasizing that you want to cooperate and collaborate, not dominate. Passive people might misinterpret assertiveness as rude because they are not used to speaking up for themselves. A passive person might see the direct, open style of assertive communication as different from how they behave and judge it incorrectly. [6] X Research source Individuals who are passive-aggressive express their thoughts and feelings indirectly, often by attempting to mask their real feelings and punishing others through withdrawal, sulking, etc. [7] X Research source Passive-aggression is very damaging to relationships and communication. Because they are used to hiding their feelings and expressing them indirectly, passive-aggressive people might see the honesty about your feelings that comes with assertiveness as rude or hostile. Aggressive people may be upset that assertive communicators stand up for themselves, rather than cowing to their demands. [8] X Research source They may be accustomed to thinking of communication in terms of only what they want and need. They may even interpret assertive communication as hostile because they are used to valuing themselves more than others and expect others to treat them that way. In some cases, others may judge your behavior incorrectly due to their own prejudices or perceptions. Racism and other forms of prejudice and bias may encourage people to judge your behavior by standards that are neither accurate nor helpful. For example, in American culture the pervasive, hurtful stereotype of the \"angry black woman\" might encourage some to interpret any assertive communication by African American women as aggression. Women in Western societies are often expected to be \"nurturers,\" and may be judged harshly for being assertive communicators. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source Unfortunately, there is not a lot you can do to change others' minds if they are set. Imbalances of power in situations can also foster misinterpretations. For example, if you are a manager of a team, it may be easier for the individuals working under you to view your actions as demanding and selfish, rather than assertive. Focus on collaboration, paying attention to others' feelings and needs, and encouraging others to express themselves. Being aware of those around you is a key way to keep your behavior assertive, rather than letting it lapse into aggression.

      "content": "Be an active listener. Letting people know your boundaries and feelings while at the same time allowing them space to talk, discuss, and open up about their feelings is important. Ask follow-up questions during conversations and use affirmations such as nodding, gestures, and agreements. [12] X Research source Look directly at the person who is speaking. You needn't stare at him or her, but you should try to maintain eye contact for about 70% of the time you are listening. This helps communicate to the speaker that you're interested and paying attention. [13] X Trustworthy Source Michigan State University Extension Extension program of Michigan State University focused on community outreach, education, and engagement Go to source It can be easy to slip into thinking about what we will say in response to someone else's statement before the other person's even done talking. For example, if a friend is telling you about her awful day, you might begin to think about how you will tell her about your terrible day while she is still talking. Doing so means you are not focusing on the other person. If you're having a hard time concentrating on what the other person is saying to you, try mentally repeating or summarizing what they're saying to you. This will force you to pay more attention. When it is your turn to speak, try asking questions or using phrases to clarify what you heard. For example, if you have been listening to your partner explain something you did that frustrated him or her, you should clarify what you heard: \"What I heard you say is _____. Is that right?\" This helps keep you from jumping to conclusions or misinterpreting."

      "content": "Be humble and modest. Assertiveness and humility make a fine combination. An assertive person doesn't need to shout \"Me, me, me, look what I did!\" from the rooftops. It is perfectly healthy to accept praise for a job well done or remind others that you made a contribution, as long as this doesn’t become boastful or focused on belittling others to prop yourself up. Showing humility doesn't mean that you are being weak or demeaning yourself. Celebrate your successes and congratulate yourself when you have done something well. Just don't put down others to lift yourself up. For example, if someone tells you that you did a great job on a presentation, don't feel as though you should reply by saying something like \"Oh, it was nothing.\" Such a response minimizes your true effort and accomplishment. Instead, try an assertive reply that acknowledges your own effort while staying humble: \"Thank you! I worked really hard on it and had some great help.\""

Statements that focus on what ‘’you’’ are feeling, thinking, or experiencing communicate your needs without blaming others or “mind-reading” (assuming that you know what others are thinking or experiencing). You can state feelings, such as “I like ___” and “I don’t want to ___,” as well as offer constructive criticism, such as “I feel irritated when you ___.” For example, if your colleague forgot a lunch date with you, don’t assume it’s because she doesn’t care. Instead, offer an “I” statement and follow it up with an invitation for her to share her experience: “I felt hurt when you didn’t make it to lunch. What happened?” Express your feelings as they really are. If you have been invited to an office function and you really don’t want to go, don’t say something like “Oh, I guess I’ll go, but it’s not really my thing.” Instead, say “I really don’t enjoy large crowds. I’d prefer not to go.”"

These words are known as “categorical imperatives” and can create feelings of anger and guilt in others (or in yourself, if you’re directing the statement to yourself). [14] X Research source For example, instead of saying something like “You should remember to take out the trash when you’re supposed to” to your child, try saying “It is important for you to take out the trash when it is your turn.” Try substituting “I prefer” or “I would like you to” for “should” statements."

Instead, invite others into the conversation using cooperative phrases such as “What do you think?” or “Do you have any suggestions regarding ___?” [16] X Research source This is particularly important if you are offering constructive criticism or sharing a negative feeling. Asking the other person to share their feelings and thoughts makes them feel as though they are important to you. For example, if you have a friend who repeatedly cancels plans with you at the last minute, tell her how you feel and then invite her to share her experiences with you: “When we make plans and you cancel at the last minute, I feel frustrated because it’s too late to make other plans for myself. I also sometimes feel as though you don’t want to spend time with me. Is there something going on?” [17] X Research source"

Criticizing others for their own shortcomings in blaming language, especially language that generalizes, such as “You always forget to pick me up!” or “You’re such a slob!” gets in the way of productive dialogue. For example, if your employee forgot to file an important report, don’t heap on the blame and negative language; chances are, s/he already feels bad about forgetting. Instead, focus assertively on what s/he can do differently in the future: “I noticed that you forgot to file that report. When I have deadlines, I set a reminder in my calendar so that I don’t forget them. Do you think that would help you?”"

      "title": "Distinguish between fact and opinion.",
      "content": "Distinguish between fact and opinion. If you and another person disagree on something, don’t try to battle over who is “right.” This is especially true of situations where there is usually no “right” answer, such as an incident that hurt someone’s feelings. Using phrases such as “My experience is different” will help make room for everyone’s experience. For example, imagine that your partner comes to you and says that you hurt his or her feelings during an earlier conversation. Instead of immediately replying \"I didn't mean to\" or using other defensive language, first acknowledge that s/he felt the way s/he says. For example: \"I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. I really didn't mean to, and I will work on not saying things that way again.\" As another example, remember that people have many ways of approaching life. Just because they are different from yours does not mean they are wrong. For example, imagine that your colleague is approaching a project in a way that you don't think is the most efficient. An example of aggressive communication could look like this: \"That's a dumb way to do that\" or \"Who does it that way?\" [18] X Research source Instead, if it is your place -- e.g., you are in charge of the project, you are the other person's boss -- communicate your concerns about the efficiency assertively. \"I see that you're tackling the project in X way. I have some experience with these projects, and I've found that Y way usually gets it done faster with better results. What would you think of trying it this way?\" Keep in mind that it is often not your place to correct others. It's usually a good idea to refrain from imposing your opinions on others."

You can be assertive with your ideas and also invite others to share their own. This increases the likelihood of others feeling included and worthwhile. Others may also be more willing to collaborate than simply follow orders.

Assertive body language isn’t tense, shut-down or withdrawn; it moves steadily and smoothly. Avoid gestures such as pointing; use an open palm instead. Try not to fidget. Open posture. Stand with your shoulders back and your body turned towards whomever you’re interacting with. Distribute your weight evenly rather than pressing your weight onto one leg. Keep your feet between 4-6” apart, and don’t cross your legs. [21] X Research source Relaxed jaw and mouth.

[22] X Research source Arrogant individuals often have a very external sense of confidence (i.e., they base their opinions of themselves on how others think of them). While this type of confidence isn’t negative on its own, it can cause arrogant individuals to prioritize their own self-worth over the feelings of others.
