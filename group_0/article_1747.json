      "content": "A Scorpio woman will be enchanted by Leo's bold confidence. The boastful lions of the zodiac, Leos steal the spotlight at every party and social gathering they attend. A Leo man's charisma will catch the eye of the more introverted Scorpio woman. She'll be impressed with his bravado and will make it her mission to get to know and understand what lies beneath the surface of his persona. Leo is ruled by the sun, which represents ego and vitality. A Leo man is self-assured, energetic, and generous, which makes him a great compliment to a Scorpio woman's deep and brooding emotions.

      "content": "A Leo man will be intrigued by a Scorpio woman's mystique. Scorpio is one of the most mysterious signs of the zodiac, which makes Scorpio women quite private (with their fair share of secrets). This will be a totally new phenomenon to the brash and showy Leo man, and he'll want to get to know someone so wonderfully different than him. Scorpio is ruled by Pluto , the planet of secrets and transformation. This compels Scorpio women to be rather elusive and slow to get to know, which is the perfect challenge for a Leo man. Reader Poll: We asked 261 wikiHow readers if they think Scorpios are generally more mysterious or open, and 91% agreed that Scorpios are mysterious and it may take a while to get to know them . [Take Poll]"

      "content": "It may take a Scorpio woman some time to trust a Leo man. Represented by the scorpion, a Scorpio woman is instinctually self-protective. She's nobody's fool, and to prove this fact, she may put her Leo man through a series of tests before she can let her guard down. Loyal and generous with his love, a Leo man can pass these tests with flying colors. All he has to do is open up to her and commit to the relationship."

      "content": "A Scorpio woman and a Leo man will have intense physical chemistry. Traditional astrologers believe that Scorpio is co-ruled by Mars, the planet of passion and sexuality. [2] X Research source This compels Scorpio women to be bold and passionate in the bedroom, which makes them a great match for a Leo man (a confident fire sign). These two will share a fiery attraction for one another, and they'll likely never get bored in the bedroom. Leo men are very physically affectionate, and they like giving their partner a ton of attention. A Scorpio woman will appreciate this constant affection, and it'll help her feel more comfortable letting her guard down around him."

      "content": "As fixed signs, Leo men and Scorpio women are stubbornly loyal. In relationships, both of these signs are known for being committed (even a little possessive). They'll be faithful and honest with each other, and their passionate feelings will be unwavering. [3] X Research source These two are so loyal that they may need to tame their feelings if it leads to jealousy.

      "title": "A Scorpio woman and a Leo man will learn a lot from their differences.",
      "content": "A Scorpio woman and a Leo man will learn a lot from their differences. As a water sign, a Scorpio is a deep thinker. Her depth and emotional intelligence will encourage a Leo man to think about what's really important (besides his surface-level desire for attention). As a fire sign, Leo's bold and optimistic energy will be a wonderful influence for a Scorpio woman. He'll bring her out of any emotional funks, helping her see things from a more hopeful perspective. These two can avoid growing frustrated by their differences if they get some space from each other. It's important for a Scorpio/Leo pair to maintain their independent lives, friendships, and interests."

      "content": "A headstrong Leo and a stubborn Scorpio will need to compromise. Two fixed signs, these two hold tight to their beliefs. A relationship between such steadfast signs can actually be a wonderful opportunity for growth and transformation. Their different viewpoints will challenge each other to see life from a new perspective, and the two can even bring out the best in each other if they agree to meet in the middle. [4] X Research source These two will benefit from letting petty arguments go. Though they may not always agree, it's not worth jeopardizing their unique and meaningful relationship."

      "title": "A private Scorpio woman may grow tired of Leo's need for attention.",
      "content": "A private Scorpio woman may grow tired of Leo's need for attention. Scorpio women prefer to observe rather than be the center of attention, while a Leo adores being the star of the show. He may grow tired of Scorpio's need for privacy, while a Scorpio woman might resent Leo's need for attention (especially if it makes her jealous). These two will make their relationship work if they remember that these very differences were why they fell for each other in the first place. Leo is one of the most social signs, so they love to be surrounded by people. A Scorpio woman will benefit from understanding that this is simply his nature and not a sign that he's going to be unfaithful. A Scorpio woman can be a little possessive, but it's just because she loves her partner and doesn't want to lose him. A Leo can ease her anxiety by making her feel like a priority with regular dates and plenty of kind words."
