      "title": "Be more considerate of others.",
      "content": "Be more considerate of others. The first step in being seen as older is to give up selfish habits in place of more empathetic ones. Try to think of things from other people’s perspectives before reacting or responding. Consider how your decision may impact the people around you, either now or in the future. You will appear much more mature and very wise for your age. For instance, instead of asking your mom to do something for you right after she has gotten off of work, try to do it for yourself if possible. She already likely has many things to do so don’t add something else."

      "title": "Maintain a calm demeanor.",
      "content": "Maintain a calm demeanor. Put away juvenile behaviors and trade them for adult-like ones. Whining, sulking, and throwing tantrums are great ways to be considered as a child but are not so great if you want to be respected and taken seriously. No matter how upset you may be with a friend, family member or coworker, never resort to behaving like a child. Opt instead to remain calm and to have a reasonable and levelheaded discussion. [1] X Research source Pay attention to how people around you deal with stressful situations or with being challenged. This may help to give you some ideas for how you can respond as well. If you feel yourself becoming angry or mad, walk away from the situation for a few moments. Practice breathing deeply to calm yourself down in stressful situations."

      "title": "Be responsible and take on more responsibility.",
      "content": "Be responsible and take on more responsibility. Another integral step in gaining maturity is achieved through taking care of your responsibilities and accepting more as you can. Be sure to handle your business daily, including doing your homework, doing your chores, or completing all of your tasks as work in a timely fashion. As you become more accustomed to these tasks, your time may free up a bit, so don’t shy away from doing more. You will be respected for taking initiative. [2] X Research source For instance, offer to babysit your siblings for your parents. Taking care of people younger than you will help you think and become more mature and that will show in your demeanor. Offer to do more around the house. Volunteer if your teacher should ask for help or assistance. If your supervisor or parent mentions something that needs to get done, take note of it to remind yourself and take care of it without being asked."

      "content": "Develop social graces. Remember to be polite in any space that you are in.

[3] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 29 September 2020. Get into the habit of pausing for three seconds after someone finishes talking and then respond. Avoid interrupting or talking over people. Make sure that you always greet people when you enter into a room. Not doing so can be interpreted as rude and immature.

      "content": "Be confident. Nothing communicates maturity like confidence.

Remember that and hold your head high when you walk into a room. [5] X Research source Even if you don’t feel confident yet, faking confidence until it feels real is a great strategy.

      "content": "Avoid arguments. There is a proverb that goes something like “don’t argue with fools; from a distance you can’t tell who’s who.” As much as it is possible with you, try to live at peace with everyone. If you feel an argument brewing with someone, work to keep the situation calm and respectful or remove yourself from the conversation until things settle. Don’t get involved in an argument that you don’t want to be involved in. You can always just say, \"I don't wish to discuss this.\" You might say something like “hey, let’s talk about something else, okay?” Sometimes, arguments must be had, however. Consider whether the problem will matter in a few weeks or if it may prevent you from doing your job. Pull the person aside to talk to them, don’t interrupt them when they speak, and work to find solutions rather than create more problems."

      "content": "Watch your words. Using phrases similar to “umm” or “like” very often can make you seem younger. Work to expel these youthful phrases from your vocabulary and opt instead for a slight pause until you can gather your thoughts and choose a better word. [6] X Research source Remember that you don’t need to fill every moment with speech. Some people use terms like “um” when they are thinking or when they don’t know what to say. In those moments, silence will suffice."

      "title": "Mimic your role models.",
      "content": "Mimic your role models. Sometimes the best way to appear older is to fake it until you make it. Think about your mentors, parents, or other role models. What behaviors or mannerisms do you notice in them that you think are admirable? Mimic those and incorporate them into your daily life. [7] X Research source For instance, if you notice that your father never insults people but always compliments them instead, you can work to become more like that, as well."

      "content": "Maintain good hygiene. In addition to behaving more maturely, it is also important to maintain good hygiene practices.

      "content": "Consider getting glasses. Glasses are primarily worn by older people, so many have a tendency to associate anyone wearing glasses with being more mature.
