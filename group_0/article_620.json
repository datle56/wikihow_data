[2] X Research source Whole grains are minimally processed and contain all 3 parts of the grain: the germ, endosperm and bran. The bran is the portion of the grain containing the most fiber. One serving of grains is 1 ounce. Aim to have a source of whole grains at most or all of your meals. Examples of whole grain foods include: brown rice, quinoa, oatmeal, millet and corn.

      "content": "Vary your protein sources. Protein is an essential nutrient to your diet. In addition to animal-based protein sources (like chicken, dairy or beef), there are a variety of protein-rich foods that are also fiber-rich foods called legumes. These can help you meet your daily fiber goal. Legumes are vegetables that contain a relatively high amount of fiber. They include: lentils, beans and peas.

Go to source Specific types of legumes include: black beans, chick peas, split peas, navy beans, edamame/soy beans, fava beans, kidney beans and black-eyed peas. Legumes are a very healthful addition to your diet. In addition to being a great source of protein and fiber, they are also fairly high in folate, potassium, magnesium and iron.

      "content": "Take a fiber supplement. Consuming the recommended 25 or 38 g of fiber daily can be a challenge. If you're having trouble meeting this goal on a regular basis, you may want to consider adding a fiber supplement to your daily routine. [12] X Trustworthy Source University of California San Francisco Health Center Research hospital associated with UCSF, a leading medical university, providing innovative patient care and public health resources Go to source There are many different types of fiber supplements available. Generally, they're functional fibers, a type of fiber derived from plants that's beneficial to your health. Supplements may come in the form of powders, oils, capsules or chewable tablets. In addition, many processed foods contain added fiber. For example, soy milk or orange juice with added fiber. Note that many health professionals recommend consuming as much fiber as you can from natural sources (like whole grains or vegetables). Always check with your doctor before adding any type of supplement to your diet."

However, with additional fiber in your diet, it's also very important to drink adequate amounts of fluids daily. Inadequate water consumption when increasing fiber can result in constipation. [13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source 64 oz of water daily is a general rule to help you consume enough water. However, the Institute of Medicine recommends about 9-13 cups of fluids daily. Fiber works best when combined with water. It will absorb water and help make your stools soft and mobile. Drink water consistently throughout the day. Keeping a water bottle with you at all times to measure how much you need to drink can help."

However, if you eat the skin on many fruits and vegetables, you can maximize the amount of fiber from that food. [15] X Research source For example, don't peel apples before you eat them or if you're eating potatoes, try to leave the skin in the dish (such as if making baked or mashed potatoes). Eating fruits with seeds is also a great way to consume more fiber. Berries are among the highest in fiber due to their miniature seeds that are consumed when eating them whole."

[16] X Research source Try 100% whole wheat pasta or pasta made from brown rice or quinoa. If you don't like the taste, mix it with a little regular pasta. Have brown or wild rice instead of white rice. Alternatively, try some barley, quinoa or millet. Instead of white bread products, use 100% whole wheat bread. If you like to eat toast in the morning, make it whole wheat bread. Alternatively, there are brands of bread and English muffins that have 5 or more grams of fiber per slice. Check to make sure processed foods like bread or pasta are 100% whole grain by reading the food label. The first ingredient should be 100% whole grain flour.

[17] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Eat a cereal with 5 or more grams of fiber per serving. Read the food label to check how much fiber is in one serving (or however many servings you'll be eating) of that food. Cereals like oatmeal or a bran-based cereal are good options to start with. Substitute old fashioned steel cut oats for microwave instant oatmeal for an additional 2-4 grams of fiber per serving. If you have a favorite cereal you just can't let go of, add few tablespoons of unprocessed wheat bran or mix it with a high fiber cereal. Make sure your breakfast also includes protein to ensure that the high carb count in fiber rich foods doesn't cause a blood sugar spike/drop and cravings later in the day."
