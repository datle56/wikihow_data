      "content": "Break up with him in person. You and your boyfriend have been through a lot together! The best way to respect your relationship and him is to break up face-to-face. If distance is an issue, plan a video call with him instead. If that's not possible, a phone call is the next best option. [1] X Research source Avoid breaking up through text or instant messenger, which is hurtful and impersonal. Only resort to a letter or email if you have tried to break up before and he changed your mind. If you are in an abusive relationship , breaking up over the phone, through email, or with a letter is okay. Your safety is most important."

      "title": "Meet him somewhere that's somewhat private.",
      "content": "Meet him somewhere that's somewhat private. Ask him to go for a walk with you, or meet up with him at a park or somewhere similar. That way, once it's done, you can go your separate ways. If you invite him over to your house, it may get awkward or he may be reluctant to leave. [2] X Research source If you are unsure of how he’ll react, schedule the meeting in a more public place, like a coffee shop. If you're afraid he might have a bad reaction, have a friend come along with you. They can be out of sight, but somewhere in the nearby vicinity, just in case you need them."

      "content": "Be considerate when choosing the time of day. Choose a time when both of you can talk in private without distractions. Wait until the end of the day rather than doing it first thing in the morning before he has to face a full day of school or work. If possible, do it on a Friday so that both of you can have the weekend to deal with your feelings privately. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Don't rush into it or break up with him during a fight. In the heat of an argument, it's easy to say things that you don't mean. Give yourself time to think things over before losing your boyfriend . You may realize you want to resolve things with him, or your perspective on the situation may change. [4] X Research source Give yourself a couple of days to think things over to be sure breaking up is what you want."

      "content": "Don't wait too long or avoid the situation. While it's important to give yourself time to think things over, don't put off the conversation once you're sure it's what you want. Dragging it out will be harder on him in the long-run, or the information may leak out and he ends up hearing the news from someone else. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Rehearse what you’ll say beforehand. Go over what you’re planning to say to your boyfriend with someone you trust. Or, you can simply practice by yourself in front of a mirror. Anticipate his reaction and prepare responses based on what you think he’ll say. [6] X Research source Practicing can help you avoid rambling or saying something you regret. Keep in mind that no matter how well you prepare, he still may react differently than you expect."

It's often best to very literally state that you want to break up.

I'm not happy.\" \"We argue more than we have fun together.\" \"There's someone else.\" [9] X Research source"

[13] X Research source Make sure you make it a clean break. Don’t get sucked into talking with him again to make him feel better.

Too much contact may make him think there's an opportunity to rekindle the romance. Keep any contact brief and to-the-point. For instance, if you see him socially in a group, you might say \"Hi\" and then find a seat near some other friends to limit conversation opportunities. Make sure that you do not ask him about his personal life or tell him about yours during any interactions that you have with him."
