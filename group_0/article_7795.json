      "title": "Place dishwashing liquid in a small bowl.",
      "content": "Place dishwashing liquid in a small bowl. Mix a few drops of mild dishwashing soap into a bowl with club soda or seltzer water. Make sure that the water is room temperature or warmer. If you are worried about spillage, place a towel under the bowel before setting it down. Club soda or seltzer water can help to remove stubborn spots on gold due to their carbonation. [1] X Research source You can also use dishwashing detergent. Just make sure that it is labeled as mild. Harsh detergent can ruin your jewel. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Soak the chain.",
      "content": "Soak the chain. Take the chain and immerse it into the bowl. Take your time to avoid damaging the jewelry and to limit any spillage. Move the chain around so that it is not balled up or overlapping overly much. Leave the chain in the bowl for 2-15 minutes. Soak it again, if necessary, to remove particularly stubborn dirt or grime. You can also place your chain into a metal strainer and then lower the strainer into the bowl until it is submerged. Then, you can remove the chain by simply lifting the strainer. This is a good method to use if you are concerned about dropping the chain. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Scrub with a toothbrush.",
      "content": "Scrub with a toothbrush. Get out a soft bristled toothbrush. Pull your chain out of the bowl. Dip the toothbrush into the cleaning solution and gently stroke over the chain. Use quick, light strokes and make sure to never scrub heavily. To get in between the chain links, push some of the toothbrush tines into these spaces. Make a clockwise, circular motion and repeat anticlockwise. This ensures the dirt to loosen up or remove altogether. Going with a medium or hard bristled brush could make it easier for you to scratch your jewelry. It is also best to keep a brush set aside specifically for jewelry cleaning. This is at your own risk since it can spoil the jewel if it is delicate or sensitive."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse with water.",
      "content": "Rinse with water. When you are finished running your toothbrush over the chain, place your chain back into the strainer. Then, run some warm water over the chain and strainer. If you feel as if there is a chemical residue on the chain, you may want to move it a bit under the water."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dry with a soft cloth.",
      "content": "Dry with a soft cloth. Place your chain onto a cloth and gently pat it dry. Continue to do so until you can lift it up without feeling wetness or grease. Keep polishing in small motions until the shine is restored. Your jeweler can give you a polishing cloth to use or you can get a simple microfiber cloth."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Use rubbing alcohol. This method can be a bit abrasive, so it is not suggested for antique or fragile gold chains. Create a 50/50 mixture of rubbing alcohol and warm tap water in a bowl. Soak your jewelry for a few minutes. You do not need to rinse the chain again with this method, although you can if you prefer. [4] X Research source One good thing about using rubbing alcohol is that it will disinfect the chain while also cleaning it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use ammonia.",
      "content": "Use ammonia. In a small bowl, make a mixture of 6 parts warm tap water to 1 part ammonia. Leave your chain soaking in this mixture for a minute maximum. Ammonia is a very powerful cleaner, so you should only use it for newer, undamaged gold chains. You will also want to rinse the chain out thoroughly under water when you are finished. Using ammonia as a regular jewelry cleaner can break down the pieces over time. Therefore, it is best if this method is only used on occasion and for deep-set grime and residue. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use beer.",
      "content": "Use beer. With this method youâ€™ll need to pour a bit of beer onto a soft cloth. Place the chain within the cloth and rub up and down the links. You can also dip a soft toothbrush into beer and use it to lightly scrub the chain. You can use any beer with the exception of dark ale. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use toothpaste.",
      "content": "Use toothpaste. This is a cheap, all-purpose approach to cleaning jewelry. Place a small dot of toothpaste onto a soft bristled toothbrush. Then, gently scrub at the chain until you start to see results. Reapply the toothpaste as needed. When you are finished, thoroughly rinse the chain off under warm water. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a professional cleaning solution.",
      "content": "Use a professional cleaning solution. You can also purchase a specialty gold cleaning solution from your jeweler directly or from a jewelry site online. Check the label to verify that it is okay for use on gold chains. Follow any additional instructions carefully, including any safety warnings. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use an ultrasonic cleaner.",
      "content": "Use an ultrasonic cleaner. If you want professional results without messing with cleaning solutions, you can purchase an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner. You will place your gold chain inside the machine which will clean it through the use of small, fast vibrations. This is best used for sturdier, thicker chains without any embellishments. [9] X Research source Before you use an ultrasonic cleaner, it may be a good idea to talk with a jeweler to see if it is appropriate for your type of gold chain. Otherwise, it could result in damage to the chain."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make any repairs prior.",
      "content": "Make any repairs prior. In a brightly lit room, raise your chain to eye level and carefully inspect all of the links, the clasp, and any embellishments. If the clasp is already loose, then you may damage it beyond repair by cleaning it. If any gemstones are damaged, then they may fall off during the cleaning process. You can take your gold chain to a jeweler and ask them to repair the damage and give it a thorough cleaning as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Test out a small area.",
      "content": "Test out a small area. If you are unsure about how your cleaning solution will affect your chain, then take a q-tip, dip it in a bit of solution, and apply it to one link. Observe to see if the link shows any discoloration as a result. If you see any discoloration or problems developing, rinse the chain out under warm water right away."
    },
    {
      "title": "Block off the drain.",
      "content": "Block off the drain. It is quite common to lose a piece of jewelry down a drain as a result of the cleaning process. Before you start to clean, block off the sink drain with a cover. Or, place a mesh strainer over the drain to ensure that your chain is safe to handle, even if dropped. [10] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Take care of any precious stones.",
      "content": "Take care of any precious stones. If your gold chain includes gemstones, such as diamonds or pearls, you will want to carefully consider how a cleaning solution or process could impact them as well. Some solutions that are fine for gold alone, such as ammonia, could prove overly abrasive to an embellishment, like a freshwater pearl. Also, make sure to keep your scrubbing gentle. Or, you could accidentally snag and pull a gemstone out of its setting. Some gemstones can even lose color if scrubbed too hard. [11] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Consult with a jeweler.",
      "content": "Consult with a jeweler. When in doubt, go to a jewelry store and talk with a professional jeweler. They can suggest cleaning methods and even offer advice regarding possible cleaning solutions. This is especially important if your gold chain is antique or especially delicate. If you bought your gold chain from a national jewelry chain, you might also be able to contact customer service for cleaning advice."
