      "content": "Decide if your rabbit should stay outdoors at all. Traditionally, pet rabbits have often been kept outside in a pen or “hutch”. However this is now seen as out of date a cruel. Almost all hutches and runs for sale on the high street or from online retailers are actually too small and below welfare standards. Even big shops sell accommodation that is simply not big enough. This is because pet shops and retailers are here to make money. There are currently no laws in the UK regulating the size of cages that can be sold so shops stock what sells and, in doing so, perpetuate misinformation on what rabbits need. If your rabbits live outside, it is very important to predator-proof the housing properly. Chicken wire is not strong enough to keep out a fox or smaller predators like weasels. You need to make sure all wire is 16G and the holes are no bigger than 13mm x 13mm. You will also need to ensure the floor is solid or meshed underneath to prevent anyone digging in or out. Something that might initially seem like a secure enclosure may not keep your bunny safe from a fox, bird of prey, or neighborhood cat. [1] X Research source Still others still say that, with proper preparation and care, full-time outdoor living is fine. As your rabbit’s caretaker, the decision is yours."

      "title": "Don't feed your rabbit carrots.",
      "content": "Don't feed your rabbit carrots. Bugs Bunny may have done fine with a single-veggie diet, but real rabbits require lots of hay and diet diversity. The staple of your rabbit’s diet should be hay, which should be available at your pet supply store. This should make up about 75% of its diet. They should have hay access at all times. [2] X Research source Pelleted food should also be a part of your rabbit's diet. Your rabbit should get 1 ounce of hay-based feed per 1 pound of their body weight once a day. Each day, you can add forage like dandelions, brambles, and grass and a handful of rabbit pellets, which offer important nutrients."

      "title": "Keep enclosures clean.",
      "content": "Keep enclosures clean. A rabbit will typically establish 1 or 2 litter areas in their enclosure (let the rabbit decide where, and then place a bunny litter box there), but keeping the area clean in general is important for health and happiness. Change litterboxes ever 1 to 2 days depending on how many bunnies you have. Perform a more thorough clean every week. Soiled and/or damp bedding will encourage flies, which can bring on maggots that can infest your rabbit and cause “fly strike,” a potentially fatal illness. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "All rabbits do better in pairs and groups.",
      "content": "All rabbits do better in pairs and groups. Wild rabbits are sociable creatures, and that quality has not been bred out of their domesticated cousins. So, if you’re going to have a pet rabbit make sure you give them a friend or two. Never bond unfixed rabbits as breeding for hormonal aggression can occur. If you chose to house rabbits together, listen to them to make sure your pair get on - if they don't you'll need to find them alternative friends. There is a rabbit friend out there for every bun.ref> https://bunnyjackpotfoundation.co.uk/guidance/rabbit-guidance/how-do-i-bond-my-rabbits </ref> Check on your rabbit at least once or twice a day, and spend some time with them. Let them free roam when supervised if an area is safe from escape attempts. It's always best to entice a rabbit back inside with food than to try and catch them. All rabbits prefer a companion then being kept alone, so think about adding another compatible bunny. Make sure they are spayed or neutered, especially if you have boy and girl bunnies together — you know what they say about rabbits! [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Give your rabbit daily exercise and playtime.",
      "content": "Give your rabbit daily exercise and playtime. Rabbits are meant to be active creatures, running and hopping about, and need 24 hour access to a space of at least 3m x 2m. [5] X Research source \"Free range,\" however, does not mean loose and unsupervised in the yard, unless you want your bunny pal to become lunch for your local foxes. Your rabbit must either be supervised or placed in a secure \"bunny run\" that allows plenty of room for horizontal and vertical movement. Rabbits are also curious, sociable, and intelligent, and thus benefit from play time (and so will you!). Games like \"bunny bowling\" (the rabbit knocking over plastic pins), \"fetch\" (with you doing the fetching!), and \"cardboard castle\" (which is inevitably destroyed) are among the many play options. [6] X Research source Rabbits enjoy playing with paper, cardboard, or untreated wood toys as well. Avoid treated wood and some varieties such as cherry, redwood, and peach, as these may be toxic.

      "title": "Prepare a proper home.",
      "content": "Prepare a proper home. The days of thinking it acceptable to keep a pet rabbit in a small, isolated “hutch” are in the past. Rabbits need a dry, clean, ventilated, safe, well-placed, and relatively roomy home to thrive. Even modern outdoor “hutches,” with multiple levels and/or rooms, are usually unsuitable for pet rabbits as they're too small. As 1 example, you can create an exercise pen (or “rabbit run”) for your bunny to use daily out of wooden framing and 16G wire. It should be at least 3m x 2m to give your rabbit enough room to run and hop about. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Protect your rabbit from predators and itself.",
      "content": "Protect your rabbit from predators and itself. Making sure other animals can’t get in and your bunny can’t get out are essential. If you’ve ever had wild rabbits invade your flower bed or garden patch, you know they’ll eat just about anything. So, especially if your rabbit ever runs free in your enclosed yard, avoid having poisonous plants around. Also, anywhere your rabbit will be, take care to secure electrical wiring and keep it out of tooth-range. [9] X Research source There are many plants that can be toxic for rabbits, including aloe, begonia, daffodil bulb and Easter lily. Check before you give anything new to your rabbit."

      "title": "Keep things dry.",
      "content": "Keep things dry. When it comes to an outdoor rabbit home, dampness leads to dirtiness leads to sickness, such as the “fly strike” as previously mentioned. [10] X Research source Give your rabbits' home a roof that resists rain — it can be plywood, corrugated panels, or even plastic sheeting or a tarpaulin. Repair and replace the roof as necessary to keep the rain out. During heavy rain or snow, consider moving your rabbit (by having a mobile home or second home) to a drier location such as a porch, garage, basement, or just in the main house."

      "title": "Beat the summer heat.",
      "content": "Beat the summer heat. If you’ve spotted wild rabbits near your home in the summertime, they’ve probably been lounging in the shade or in a hole they’ve dug in your yard. Rabbits like to stay comfortably cool year-round. [11] X Research source Place your rabbit’s home in a shady area, and/or provide shade with a roof or screening material. Make sure the enclosure is well-ventilated to prevent overheating, however. You can also try freezing plastic water bottles and putting them in the enclosure. This will provide your rabbit with some cool spots to lounge. Another tip, is to provide a tile or stone slat for the rabbit to lay their belly on. If temperatures climbs too high, make sure to bring the rabbit inside as they can easily die of heatstroke. Make sure your rabbit always has a fresh water supply in all weathers."

      "title": "Make winter warmer.",
      "content": "Make winter warmer. With a properly insulated and protected home, rabbits can withstand the winter cold, although you may consider just keeping them inside — at least at night — during the coldest time of year. [12] X Research source Before winter arrives, repair the rabbit’s home, taking special care to fix any leaks or damp spots. Damp is bad, and damp and cold is especially bad for rabbit health. It makes a huge difference if the sleeping area is permanently insulated. Cavity wall insulation for your rabbits. Line the inside of the sleeping area with plywood and leave a gap between the ply and the walls/floor which can be filled with roof insulation. This will mean that your bunnies will be protected for many winters to come, but don’t forget that they will still need plenty of good, fresh bedding. The whole enclosure should be located where it is protected from wind and rain wherever possible. Tarps can be found inexpensively at most garden centres and are great both as a windbreak and to keep the rain off. It is best to buy tarps with eyelets so they can be fastened securely in place with cable ties. [13] X Research source You can purchase special heaters for a rabbit home, but make sure any electrical wiring is out of reach. There are also special bunny heating pads, or you can just nestle (securely closed) plastic bottles full of warm (not hot) water in the bedding several times per day. Check on your rabbit friend more often than usual in cold weather. Make sure water supply is not frozen, and provide extra hay. [14] X Research source"
