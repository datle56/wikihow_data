      "content": "123123 represents completion, new beginnings, and balance. 123123 is associated with the conclusion of a cycle. If you see it regularly, it could be a sign from your guardian angels that you must prepare for change to occur, and not to be afraid, but instead to use it as a chance to experience something new and to evolve as a person. Now is a time for starting afresh and seizing opportunities for personal growth and adventure—without losing sight of your core self and values. The new beginning could be something you initiate yourself: maybe you’re feeling restless in your job, relationship, friend group, or city, and you need a change. Or maybe it’s something that’s forced upon you—a relationship ending, the loss of a job, or an unexpected opportunity to try something new may present itself, and you may be invited to make a choice as to how to proceed. As Siegel says, 2 also represents the need to make a choice: “Remember, there are two sides to a coin, I could go this way or that way…. [I]t's a timeframe when you're at a bit of a crossroads.”"

      "content": "If you're in a relationship, 123123 signifies growth. You and your current partner are in for a season of new opportunities to grow stronger as a couple and get to know one another better.

Lean into the changes that lie ahead, confident that you and your partner can weather whatever comes your way.

      "content": "If you're single, 123123 signals a time of personal development. Whether you're single and ready to mingle or happy being on your own, being alone is the perfect opportunity to get to know yourself better and really cultivate your own interests. Relish your own company: take a class and learn how to do something you've always wanted to do, finally finish that novel you've been working on for ten years, or take yourself out on solo dates around town. If you're dating around, enjoy the experience! Each new person you meet marks an opportunity to learn more about a world and perspective that's different from yours, and that can tell you a lot about who you are too."

      "content": "For twin flames, 123123 is a sign to let go. If you've found your twin flame , 123123 is a reminder to practice letting go of control now and again, even when it's scary. This means letting go of your expectations in the relationship, as well as your attachment to wounds from the past. Maybe you worry your flame will forget about you or abandon you if you relinquish control, but in fact, the opposite is probably true: like the saying goes, \"If you love something, set it free. If it comes back, it's meant to be.\" Maybe you're clinging to past hurt because you haven't fully healed. 123123 is a reminder to trust your twin flame to help you move past that wound. They know and love you, and they don't expect you to be perfect, so go easy on yourself."
