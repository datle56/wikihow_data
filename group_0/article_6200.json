Be prepared to chip away at its health with a few strong Pokémon. While you don't want to kill it before capture, a Fire and an Electric Pokémon will make powerful additions to your team here. Make sure you also have a strong, basic Pokémon, like a Normal type, to fight as well."

You'll be making a decent sized trip to get to Articuno, and you don't want to be left with weak Pokémon when the fight begins. Bring Revives, TM Boosts, and Potions to make sure your team is in top shape when you arrive, or simply use Repels to avoid fighting wild Pokémon."

Start by going straight down until you get stuck, then turn hard to the left to reach the Seafoam Islands, the home of Articuno. You'll see a little cave that you need to enter. There are two entrances to this cave, but only this entrance will work to get Articuno. [1] X Research source"

Use Strength to push the boulder through the hole. Off to the left, on the same floor, is another boulder that needs to be pushed through as well. Without leaving that floor, push that boulder the whole near it as well. Then return to the first hole and drop through along with the boulders. Do not use the ladder in the cave, as it will reset your boulders. The boulders halt the current in the lower levels of the cave, allowing you to surf on the river and find Articuno."

When possible, use moves that deal damage but aren't super effective, as you don't want to unintentionally knock the bird out. Normal moves like Slash are good, as are moves like False Swipe. To help you capture the bird, remember it's strengths and weaknesses: Weak Against: Fire, Electric, Rock (x2, so be careful with Rock attacks), and Steel.

Obviously, the lower the health you can get it to the better, but don't risk knocking it out if your attacks are hitting strongly. Use Sleep Powder, Paralysis, Thunder Wave to ensure that Articuno is lulled out of combat, making it easier to catch."
