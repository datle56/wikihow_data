      "title": "Be yourself.",
      "content": "Be yourself. Many middle schoolers become self-conscious and insecure about things that make them different. But as long as your behaviors aren't harming anyone, you should feel free to express your individuality. Classmates may try to tease you about quirky clothing or unusual hobbies you like. Don’t let it get to you! If you learn to be confident in the things you like, it’s much harder to tease you about them."
