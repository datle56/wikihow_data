      "content": "Enjoy nutritious meals or snacks instead of skipping meals. Pay attention to your body's cues and eat when you're hungry. While eating smaller more frequent meals won't boost your metabolism, it will stop you from getting too hungry and overeating when you do sit down to eat. [1] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Plan on eating a meal or healthy snack every 3 or 4 hours. You'll make more nutritious choices if you don't wait until you're absolutely starving to eat. Start your day with a nutritious breakfast instead of skipping it. Try Greek yogurt or eggs with fruit and a piece of whole-grain toast, for instance."

      "content": "Chew your food slowly and enjoy every bite. When you eat slowly, it gives your body time to send a signal to your brain that it's full and you can stop eating. Give yourself at least 15 to 20 minutes to eat a meal so you don't eat too quickly. Once you feel full, stop eating! [2] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source You've probably experienced this before—you're really hungry, so you eat as fast as possible. You most likely ate a lot of food and then felt really full. Eating slowly can prevent this from happening in the future. It takes about 15-20 minutes for the hunger center in your brain to process the signal that you’re full. Eating slowly or taking a break in the middle of your meal can give your stomach and brain time to catch up so that you don’t overeat."
