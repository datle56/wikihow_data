      "content": "Learn the basic requirements. If you're interested in becoming a Disney princess, there are a variety of basic requirements. Some of these requirements are based on unchangeable qualities, such as your height and age. If you want to pursue work as a Disney princess, make sure you meet the basic qualifications. Disney princesses need to be between 5'4 and 5'7. This is to make sure they resemble the characters on screen. [1] X Research source You have to be at least 18 years old to be a Disney princess. The oldest princesses can be varied. Most Disney princesses are between 18 and 23. However, princesses who have worked successfully for Disney in the past may be between the ages of 24 and 26. It is rare to find a Disney princess older than 27. [2] X Research source In terms of size, Disney princesses can not be higher than a dress size 10. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Gain acting and performing experience. Disney has no specific requirements regarding past work when it comes to hiring princesses. However, acting and performing will be a large part of your job. Having experience in these fields can help you audition successfully. In high school or during college, join a theater group. You might also want to take classes like drama in order to learn the craft of acting and performing. If you're not currently in school, see if there are any acting classes available in your area. Look for performance experience. Audition for school plays or community theater. See if you can find a job that requires that you perform. For example, you could work at a restaurant, like Medieval Times, where you have to play a character as part of your job. Learn a bit about improv. Take an improv class at your local theater or art center. Join an improv group to get hands-on experience. As you'll be answering questions in-character while working at Disney, you'll need to learn basic improvisation."

      "title": "Consider a college degree.",
      "content": "Consider a college degree. Disney has no specific degree requirements for princesses. However, a college degree in something like theater could bolster your chances of career success. The one downside of gaining a college degree is Disney's age requirement. Most people graduate college around the age of 22. Remember, most Disney princesses are between 18 and 23. However, there is one upside to a college degree. Disney offers a college program where you spend a semester working at a Disney theme park. You'll get invaluable behind-the-scenes experience and have the opportunity to meet cast members. This may lead to work with the Disney corporation later on, providing you an in for a princess role."

      "title": "Stay in physical shape.",
      "content": "Stay in physical shape. As Disney princesses cannot be higher than a size 10, work on maintaining a healthy weight. Toned muscles may give you an edge as well. The audition process is largely non-verbal, so your physical presence makes a big difference. The Department of Health and Human Services recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of strenuous aerobic activity a week to stay fit. Moderate aerobics include things like brisk walking or light biking. Strenuous aerobics would be things like running or jogging. It's also recommended you incorporate strength training twice a week. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you're trying to lose weight, you may need to be exercising more each day. Talk to a doctor about how to lose weight as they will be able to give you advice that takes your current weight and medical history into account. It's best to pick activities that you enjoy. If you loathe running, for example, don't plan on getting fit with a daily jog. Instead, try something you enjoy like swimming or biking. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Strength training can come in the form of classic weightlifting. However, activities like Pilates and yoga help you build your core muscles simply by using your body as weight. Eating a healthy diet can also help you get fit. Aim for a diet that includes a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables. You should also eat whole wheats and healthy, lean proteins like those found in poultry and fish."

      "content": "Familiarize yourself with different Disney princesses. You do not get to choose which character you play as a Disney princess. For example, if you love Belle and know every detail about her, you may end up being asked to play Merida instead. Therefore, try to have some familiarity with all the Disney princesses before beginning the audition process. There are 16 Disney characters officially recognized as princesses by the Disney franchise. They are Jasmine, Ariel, Rapunzel, Tiana, Belle, Merida, Cinderella, Pocahontas, Aurora (Sleeping Beauty), Mulan, Elsa, Anna, Snow White, Moana, Raya, and Elena of Avalor. [6] X Research source Disney does provide an extensive training process for those chosen to be princesses. It involves extensive viewing and analyzing of the films to help you better match the character's mannerisms and voice. Therefore, you do not need to memorize everything about each princess as Disney does not expect you to be an expert going in. It's still a good idea to watch all the Disney princess films prior to your audition. This will show your commitment to the Disney franchise. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Get headshots.",
      "content": "Get headshots. Headshots are an important tool when auditioning to become a Disney princess. Quality photos printed on standard, letter-sized paper are ideal. Make sure your photos accurately represent your current appearance. Choose the right outfit for headshots. Go for a solid color instead of something brightly patterned, as flashy patterns can be too distracting on camera. Plain white, however, might produce a glaring effect. A V-neck is usually flattering. Keep the outfit somewhat professional but also fun. A tank-top or sleeveless shirt can be a nice touch. Avoid jewelry, as this can also be distracting. [8] X Research source Do your make-up how you usually wear it for an average. Take some extra time and apply carefully. Do not apply make-up heavily, as clumped mascara or smeared lipstick will show up in a headshot. Shiny eye shadow or lipstick can cause camera glare so it should be avoided. [9] X Research source Avoid cutting or dyeing your hair before a shoot. Wear it as you usually do. Drink a lot of water in the days leading up to your headshot to help you skin look hydrated and healthy. [10] X Research source You can pay to have professional headshots taken. This can be expensive, however, and there's no guarantee you'll like how the photos turn out. Consider asking a friend with a nice camera to help you take some flattering photos of yourself. Go to a local print shop to make copies."

      "content": "Prepare a resumé. A resumé highlighting your acting and performing experience can be helpful. Disney recommends keeping your resumé to one page. They also mention a lack of experience is okay. Much of your training and learning will come after you've been hired. An actor's resumé is slightly different from a standard resumé. As with a regular resumé, list any basic contact information like your name, phone number, and address. You should also list any special performing skills you have. For example, if you have professional vocal training, this is something to include. You should list any performances you've been in, and include the time, location, and the roll you played. Some actresses list their measurements, height, and weight on a resumé. As Disney does have specific size requirements, this could be helpful information to include. Bring a copy of your resumé with you to your audition. Keep it in a folder so it stays in good condition."

Disney recommends you wear comfortable clothing to the auditions as you'll be asked to complete a specific set of movements.
