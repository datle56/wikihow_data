You may be outbid by other companies for the same keyword or keyword combination. Your website will appear higher and attract more customers and clicks if you fine-tune your keywords over time.

Use WordStream’s free keyword tool to research popular keywords before you bid for them on Google Ads or Microsoft Advertising."
