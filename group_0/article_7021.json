      "content": "Keep conversations on the shorter side. In the beginning, it may make sense to keep Messenger conversations shorter rather than longer.

If you’re unsure how to begin, open the conversation by asking about something perfunctory rather than personal. This doesn’t mean that a personal conversation can’t follow, but it puts less pressure on getting the conversation started. You could say, “Hey, do you know what the English homework is for tomorrow? I forgot to write it down,” or “What time does our shift at the restaurant begin tomorrow, again?”"
