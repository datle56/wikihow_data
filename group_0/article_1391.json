      "content": "Select the appropriate pack of Advantage for cats. Advantage for cats comes in packs of four or six, and is divided into three weight categories: under 5 pounds (kittens), five to nine pounds (small cats), and over nine pounds (large cats). Advantage for kittens is available in packs of four, and Advantage for small and large cats is available in packs of four or six. If you are unsure of cat’s weight, weigh them or look at the medical report from their most recent veterinary visit. Advantage should not be applied to kittens under two pounds, or cats less than eight weeks old."

      "title": "Remove the cap.",
      "content": "Remove the cap. Opening the tube of Advantage is not as simple as just untwisting the cap. First, using the thumb and index finger of your non-dominant hand, hold the tube upright and away from you and your cat’s eyes and face. Then, use your dominant hand to untwist the cap."

      "title": "Part the fur at the base of your cat’s neck.",
      "content": "Part the fur at the base of your cat’s neck. To apply the Advantage, your cat can be lying down or standing up—just make you can keep them still. Use both hands to part the fur at the base of their neck until you can see their skin. The base of their neck is the preferred application site because it is unlikely that your cat will be able to reach that area with their tongue. [3] X Research source Make sure your cat’s skin is clean and dry before applying the Advantage. [4] X Research source Hold the parted fur with your non-dominant hand so that you can apply the Advantage with your dominant hand. Have someone else hold your cat if you do not think you are able to hold them and apply the Advantage on your own."

    {
      "title": "Apply the Advantage.",
      "content": "Apply the Advantage. With your dominant hand, press the tube directly onto your cat’s skin at the application site. Apply the entire tube of Advantage, without letting it run off their body and onto the floor. If any product lands on another part of their body or on the floor, quickly clean it up with a paper towel or absorbent towel. You do not need to apply pressure when touching your cat’s skin with the tube. Make sure the Advantage does not get into your cat’s mouth or eyes. If it gets into their mouth, they will probably start to salivate due to Advantage's bitter taste. If it gets into their eyes, do your best to rinse their eyes with cold water. [5] X Research source Call your veterinarian if Advantage gets into their mouth or eyes. [6] X Research source Wearing gloves is not necessary to apply Advantage. [7] X Research source"

If you touch the area within these first few hours, you may end up getting Advantage on your skin. [8] X Research source If this happens, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water and do not place your fingers near your eyes or mouth. [9] X Research source Do not allow your children to touch the application site for at least several hours after Advantage application. [10] X Research source Keep other pets away from your cat until the application site is dry. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Do not shampoo your cat for at least two days.",
      "content": "Do not shampoo your cat for at least two days. This will give Advantage the opportunity to absorb fully into your cat’s skin. If you decide to shampoo your cat after two days, make sure to use a soap- or detergent-free shampoo. Shampoos with soap or detergent can strip away the oily layer of your cat’s fur through which the Advantage is absorbed. [12] X Research source Vigorous shampooing can also disrupt the oily layer. [13] X Research source Your cat probably does not want a bath anyway, so you will likely have no problem waiting two days to shampoo them. Advantage is waterproof and will remain effective after a bath."

      "content": "Monitor your cat for side effects. Fortunately, side effects of Advantage are uncommon. [14] X Research source One potential side effect is hair loss at the application site. In addition, if your cat manages to lick at the application site immediately after you apply the Advantage, they will probably start to salivate due to the bitter taste. [15] X Research source The bitter taste is meant to dissuade cats from licking the application site. [16] X Research source"
