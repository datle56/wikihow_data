The formula to use for this is K = (y °F + 459.67) x 5/9 . [1] X Research source For example, if you needed to convert 75 °F to Kelvin, the formula would look like K = (75 °F + 459.67) x 5/9"

[2] X Research source Because the Kelvin scale does not contain negative numbers, you must first add 459.67 to any Fahrenheit number when you want to make the conversion to Kelvin. In the example of converting 75 °F, the answer to the first step is 75 °F + 459.67 = 534.67"

The answer to that product is your temperature in Kelvin. [3] X Research source In the example of 75 °F, the answer to the second step is 5/9 x 534.67 = 297.0388, where 8 is a repeating decimal The answer to (75 °F + 459.67) x 5/9 = 297.0388 Therefore 75 °F = 297.0388 K"

The second way of converting Fahrenheit to Kelvin involves calculating the temperature in Celsius first, which can be handy if you need to compare all the numbers. The formulas you can use to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius to Kelvin are: formula 1 is K = (y °F – 32) x 5/9 + 273.15 ; formula 2 is K = (y °F – 32) ÷ 1.8 + 273.15 . Both formulas will produce the same result. [4] X Research source For example, if you needed to convert 90 °F to Kelvin, the formula 1 would look like K = (90 °F – 32) x 5/9 + 273.15 The formula 2 would look like K = (90 °F – 32) ÷ 1.8 + 273.15"

[6] X Research source In the example of 90 °F, the answer to the third step is 32.22 °C + 273.15 = 305.3722 The answer to both (90 °F – 32) x 5/9 + 273.15 and (90 °F – 32) ÷ 1.8 + 273.15 = 305.3722, where 2 is a repeating decimal.
