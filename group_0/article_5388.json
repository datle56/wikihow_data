[3] X Research source If we’re looking to find the percentage of blue marbles, that is our “part.” The “whole” is the total number of marbles (1684). Therefore the fraction is 485/1684 (part/whole).

Example: If your bill is $54, a 10% tip would be $5.4. Calculating a 15% tip: Find 10% by moving the decimal place over to the left. Then, divide that number in half to get 5% of the bill. Then, add the 10% and 5% values together. Example: For a $54 bill, 10% is $5.4. Half of $5.4 is $2.7. Finally, $5.4 + $2.7 = $8.1. Calculating a 20% tip: Double the total bill, then move the decimal place over once to the left. Example: For a $54 bill, double that is $108.
