Pull out any boxes, loose articles of clothing, shoes, toys, and any other items that may have intentionally or unintentionally ended up underneath your bed. Put things away where they need to go, or set them to the side so you can store them under the bed again after that space has been cleaned. You may be surprised at what you find under there! [1] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source Because you’re working with a low bed, you’ll most likely need to get on the ground to reach underneath it. If you’re having a hard time grabbing items, try using a yardstick or the end of a broom to push items out. Items under your bed can also get covered with dust and dirt, so make sure to wipe down the tops of boxes and wash any clothes or linens you find underneath there."

      "content": "Get rid of sneeze-causing dust bunnies with a yardstick and a sock. Because your bed is low, it may be impossible to reach underneath with a rag to dust and clean up. Take a yardstick and put a clean sock on the end, fastening it in place with a rubber band. Then, get down on the ground and use your homemade duster to dust under your bed. You could also spray the sock with a little bit of a cleaning solution to help the dust stick to it more easily. Cleaning up dust in your bedroom can actually help make your room smell better and could help you manage any allergies you might have. [3] X Research source Feel free to use this trick to dust other hard-to-reach spaces. Another option is to attach a microfiber cloth to the end of a broomstick, as the material will help collecting the dust bunnies.

You can just use water, though for tougher stains and spills you may want to use a cleaning product. You’ll likely need to lay down on the ground so you can maneuver the mop and get it completely flat to reach all the way under the bed. [5] X Research source Make sure the mop has been wrung out so it’s not dripping wet. You can make your own simple floor cleaner with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of warm water and 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of dish soap.

Now is the time to make use of those attachments that came with your vacuum! Connect an extension rod to the vacuum hose to reach under the bed with something like an upholstery cleaner attachment or a swivel-head attachment. The long, narrow crevice tool can be really helpful to clean along baseboards or in a hard to reach corner, too. Remember, even if you can’t get all the way under your bed, doing a little is still better than nothing! Most big vacuum cleaners won’t be able to fit under your bed. However, if you have one that can lay completely flat on the ground, you may be able to use that to clean out that space."

But, if you can push your bed to the side, you’ll be able to access the space underneath it to give it a good cleaning. You may even be inspired to do a little rearranging and give your space a cool makeover. If you have hardwood floors, be careful to not scratch them. You may want to install furniture pads on the bottom of each leg of the bed so that they don’t mark up the floors. [8] X Research source"

Getting things neat and tidy can be very daunting, especially if that area under your bed is filled with lots go different items. Since you’ll be pulling things out and going through them, it’ll make things much easier if you aren’t also dealing with the physical and visual clutter of an unmade bed. [9] X Research source If the things under your bed are dusty, you may want to lay a towel or blanket down on your bed, too, to keep it from getting dirty during your organizational project."

You could use colored tape or washi tape to make cute, easy-to-see labels. [12] X Research source Containers with wheels may work particularly well and would be easier to get out and put away.
