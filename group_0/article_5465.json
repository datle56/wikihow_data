      "content": "Find the length of one side of the square. This will probably be given to you. If you are working with a square in the real world, use a ruler or piece of measuring tape to find the length. Since all four sides of the square are the same length, you can use any side of the square. If you do not know the length of one side of the square, you cannot use this method. For example, you might want to find the length of the diagonal of a square that has sides 5 centimeters long."
