In the United States, Canada, the Dominican Republic and U.S. territories such as Guam and Puerto Rico, this code is 011. If you’re calling from anywhere else in the world, visit https://countrycode.org/ to look up your exit code. If you’re on a cell phone, you can save time by pressing +, which is on the same key as 0. This will not work on landline phones. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Dial the city code. The city code is the first two digits of the phone number. If the first digit of the city code starts with a 0, start with the second digit. For example, in this number: 01 22 33 44 55, the city code is 01. Do not dial the 0 part of the area code. Just dial 1."

      "title": "Dial the phone number.",
      "content": "Dial the phone number. French phone numbers have eight digits (after the two-digit city code). The phone numbers are usually written as five pairs of numbers with a space between each pair. Sometimes dashes or periods are used instead of spaces. For example, to dial a person in France at 01 22 33 44 55 from the US or Canada, you would dial 01133122334455."

Large chain stores usually have the cards hanging on wall racks so that customers can examine them before buying them. [2] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Cards sell for as little as $2.00, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get a bargain. Check the per-minute rate for France. Compare rates if different kinds of cards are available. Always read the fine print before buying a prepaid calling card. Check if rates to cell phones cost more than calls to landlines or if you can use the card for multiple calls.

If you spend $30 on a card, you shouldn’t be forced to use it in just a month. If you want a reloadable option, set up an account with online providers like ZapTel, which offers low rates for calls to cell phones and landlines."

      "content": "Keep track of your minutes. Keep a pen and paper by your phone. Jot down the time you began your call and the time you hung up. Convert the time span into minutes. Deduct those minutes from the total minutes you paid for. For example, if you began your call at 12:00pm and ended it at 1:10pm, you were on the phone for 70 minutes. If you bought 5,000 minutes of talk time, you now have 4,930 minutes remaining."
