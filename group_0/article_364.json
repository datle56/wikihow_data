      "content": "Speak to her kindly. Speak to your girlfriend the way you would want to be spoken to by a close friend. Regardless of whether you are sharing a good laugh or arguing, a healthy relationship is always based on mutual respect. [1] X Research source Always speak in a kind tone, even if you’re upset. Keeping your tone of voice in check lets your girlfriend know that you care about her. Never call your girlfriend names, even if you’re mad. Name-calling is a big sign of disrespect. Similarly, avoid swearing at her or cursing at her."

      "content": "Observe and respect her body language. Reading body language is a big part of understanding a person's feelings on a deeper level. Experts say that about 55% of communication involves body language, so picking up on your girlfriend's nonverbal cues may give you inside information about her feelings. [2] X Research source If your girlfriend is enjoying the moment, her body language will likely reflect that feeling. She may be smiling coyly, making consistent and lingering eye contact, or leaning her body in towards you. She will probably appear relaxed, and her face, body, and feet will be directed toward you. Pay attention to these cues to know when you are doing something you should continue doing, whether in an intimate setting or amongst a group of peers. If your girlfriend is feeling uncomfortable or nervous, she might touch her neck, stroke her own hair, or play with something in her hands. If you notice these things, quietly pull her aside and ask her if she’s okay."

      "title": "Treat her as your equal.",
      "content": "Treat her as your equal. Just as you pride yourself in being your own person, so should your girlfriend. Be proud that she has her own thoughts, opinions, and dreams. Encourage her to share them with you as you two get closer to each other. [3] X Research source Accept differences in political stance, taste in art or music, and interest in recreational activities. Whether or not they are the same stances and interests as yours, her opinions and tastes matter. Just remind yourself that you're really not the authority and arbiter on all things, personal and public. Just think of your differences as part of the \"spice of life.\" Wouldn't it be boring if you two agreed on everything? If you feel like you can't respect her opinions, this might not be the right relationship for you. If you differ on fundamental issues—a desire for monogamy in the relationship, for instance, or the religious upbringing of your children—it might be time to reevaluate the relationship. While you should still treat her opinions and feelings with respect, you may realize they are just not compatible with yours."

      "content": "Be honest. Honesty is the cornerstone of all healthy relationships. Being honest with your girlfriend is extremely important right from the beginning. While it is sometimes difficult to be honest, it is always, always the best policy. Keeping a web of lies straight can be quite stressful. Besides, what's the point of maintaining a relationship built on deceit? [4] X Research source Be honest from the start. Trust can be very hard to regain once it's broken. Instead of risking being caught in a lie, just be honest from the beginning. A relationship built on lies will never make you truly happy. If you have told a lie, admit it. The best thing you can do is to have your girlfriend hear the truth from you and not from someone else. She will likely respect you more for your ultimate honesty (once she gets over the shock of being lied to). She wants to believe you—and believe in you."

      "content": "Apologize if you make her upset. Apologizing is one of the best ways to show your respect for your girlfriend. It doesn't require a grand gesture, but it needs to be genuine and from the heart. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Apologize sooner rather than later. The best time to apologize is as soon as you know you were in the wrong. Speak from the heart. Say something like, “I'm really sorry I hurt your feelings. I'll try to do better next time.” This can be as powerful as a dozen roses. Don't force your apology or fake one. Your girlfriend will probably be able to tell that you don’t mean it."

      "content": "Let her know you're thinking about her. Whenever she pops into your mind, let her know. A simple text message or phone call if you are apart, or a gentle touch on her back or arm if you are together, are small ways to let her know you care. [6] X Research source Try a simple message: “Just wanted to let you know I'm thinking about you.” A little gesture like this may make her day. Bring up a recent memory. For example: “I can't stop thinking about the time I accidentally dropped all the eggs on the floor and you slipped on them! It's been making me laugh all day.” Begin with a compliment: “Your beautiful smile has been on my mind all day today!”"

      "content": "Use your manners and be courteous . Use your manners and go out of your way to be particularly polite and thoughtful around her. Talk with your girlfriend early on about which types of traditionally courteous behaviors fit into your lives and which do not. For example, you may want to pull out her chair for her, but she may find this patronizing. Communicating about these behaviors will help avoid any misunderstanding. Here are some suggestions for courteous behaviors she may appreciate: [7] X Research source Open the door for her. This move has been appreciated by women for centuries! Walk on the outside of the sidewalk, closest to traffic. This is a quiet sign of protection. Put your arm around her in busy, public places. Offer to pay the bill at dinner. Even if she refuses and asks to split the bill, your offer will not go unnoticed. Introduce her to your friends or people you know. It might bother her to be standing next to you chatting with a crowd of your friends when none of them knows her name. Make sure the first thing you do is introduce your girlfriend. This will make her feel important to you and let her relax a bit in conversing with your friends."

Whether you are alone, amongst friends, or at a crowded bar of strangers, let her know that she is the one who has your eye and your heart. [8] X Research source Make eye contact with her from across the room. Let her know she's the only one on your mind without having to say a single word. Smile at her. You know how you feel when she smiles at you. It works in the other direction, too. Take her feelings into consideration. For example, when you are making plans, discuss them with her. Make her feel like half of a couple. Compliment her . Whether it's a new outfit, a new haircut, or simply the way her smile lights up the room, tell her you've noticed and that you like it. Spoil her a little bit. Has she been eyeing a certain scarf at the mall? Buy it for her and give it to her as a “Just Because it's Thursday” present. Thank her when she brings you something, helps you with something, or does something kind for you. A simple \"thank you\" can mean a lot and will make it more likely she'll go out of her way for you in the future. Better yet, thank her for no reason at all—just for being herself. An unexpected kindness will warm her heart for days."

      "content": "Get to know her friends. Your girlfriend's friends (and family) probably play a huge part in her life. They will have some influence on her. If you're going to make this relationship work, you will want to try to gain the approval of her close friends of either sex. [9] X Research source Show interest in her friends. Ask them the same questions you asked her when you were getting acquainted. A great place to start is asking her friends how they met your girlfriend. Prove she's in good hands. Show her friends that you genuinely care about her, but don't push it too hard. Hold her hand, perhaps, but don't display affection to the point of embarrassing anyone. Speak highly of her. Her friends don't want to see you making fun of her or putting her down. While light jesting can be okay, save that for when you know her group a bit better. For the first few meetings, just be quietly but firmly complimentary. If you can't get along with her crew, minimize your contact with them. Just let her know that you approve of her spending time with them and that you won't feel jealous of them as a result."

Send her a card in the mail for no reason. It doesn't have to be a holiday. Getting something in the mail will be a pleasant surprise. Send her flowers. Choose a bouquet that’s perfect for her, and have them delivered to her home or work. You may not care about flowers, but she does. Plan a surprise date. Text her: “See you at 7 at my house,” and have a candlelit home-cooked dinner waiting for her when she walks in the door. She will remember this for the rest of her life."

[11] X Research source Hold her hand when you go for a walk. This simple and sweet action will show her that you're proud to call her yours. Wrap your arm around her when it's cold.

This doesn't mean you need to find her faultless in every situation, but it does mean that you’re a source of support for her. Later, when things have calmed down, you point out that she might not have been completely right. Showing your support can be as simple as listening to her vent and validating her feelings. If she’s telling you about a fight with her friend, you might say something like, “Wow, that sounds really stressful. I’m sure you’re upset—I would be.”"

Not only will this show that you’ve been listening to her, it will show that you care enough to put effort into planning a date she will love. Here are some examples: [12] X Research source If you know she loves music, take her to enjoy a jazz concert in a garden, and pack your own picnic, complete with champagne. You can listen to the music together and cuddle up as the sun goes down. If spaghetti is her favorite food, take her on a date to an Italian cooking class. You'll learn to make pasta while also having a great time getting messy in the kitchen. Does she like beer? Plan a tour at a local brewery that includes tasting the products they turn out. Not only will you get to try some tasty beverages, you'll learn something, too. Is France her favorite country? Plan a “French night” at home. Buy French wine, have fresh croissants and cheese, try your hand at French cuisine, and put on a French playlist with Spotify. Light candles, and pull up a picture of the Eiffel tower on your laptop for effect. Voilà! A perfect evening in Paris."

      "content": "Try a new activity together. Have you always wanted to try wakeboarding but never had the chance? Having a girlfriend is reason enough for trying new activities. If your girlfriend feels like she is your “partner in crime,” she will realize she is an important part of your life. Having the courage to try something new shows her your adventurous side, a trait that many women find highly attractive. [13] X Research source Pick a unique activity: think whale watching, bouldering, brewing your own beer, or learning how to shear a sheep! The possibilities are endless. Get out of your comfort zone: dress up for a night and schmooze with the elite at an art show or gallery opening. Don't be afraid to look silly. Even if you aren't an \"all-star\" at the date activity you've chosen, showing your girlfriend that you have the confidence to try something different can be impressive."

      "content": "Spend time alone and in groups. It will help build and maintain a happy, healthy relationship if you spend time together bonding as a couple without alienating those around you. Some couples practically disappear from their friends' lives once they start dating, and that's a mistake. Your girlfriend will appreciate a balance between spending time with you alone, spending time with mutual friends, and spending time with her friends without you. [14] X Research source Make a dedicated “date night.” Setting aside 1 day a week as a day that you will spend together (even if it's just an evening) is an important part of any relationship. It is important to show your girlfriend that she is one of your top priorities. Make this night extra special by trying a date idea suggested above. Schedule time with friends. Getting groups of friends together can be challenging, but scheduling a get-together well in advance can help make it happen. Send a Facebook invite or a group text suggesting a meet-up at a favorite restaurant, a local park, or a new bar. Be sure to invite her friends as well as yours. Double (or triple!) date. Planning a night out with another couple can be a fun way to maintain a social life while also spending important time with your girlfriend. Host a party . This is a great way to get all your and your girlfriend's favorite people together in one place at one time. The party can be for a holiday, a big sporting event, a birthday, or “just because.” This is a chance to spend time party-planning and practicing teamwork with your girlfriend."
