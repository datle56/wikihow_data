      "title": "Peel your potatoes if you don’t want the skin on.",
      "content": "Peel your potatoes if you don’t want the skin on. Leaving the skin on will keep more of the nutrients inside of the potato, and add texture to the potato’s flavor. But if you’re planning on mashing the potato or using it as an ingredient, you’ll probably want to skin them first. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Find a microwave-safe bowl that will fit all of your potatoes. Most ceramic bowls will work well in the microwave. Try to avoid any kind of plastic that might melt. [2] X Research source You can usually tell if a bowl is microwave-safe by inspecting the bottom. If it says “microwave safe” or has a symbol with three wavy lines, then it’s safe to use. [3] X Research source Never put metal in the microwave."

      "title": "Wash your potatoes thoroughly with water.",
      "content": "Wash your potatoes thoroughly with water. Wash your potatoes by hand, making sure to cover each part of the potato with water. Do not pat them dry. The layer of moisture left on the potatoes will help them cook evenly. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Poke each of the potatoes with a fork on all sides. Use a fork to poke several sets of holes around each of the potatoes. [5] X Research source If you don’t poke any holes in your potatoes, the pressure and heat may cause them to explode in the microwave. [6] X Research source The holes should go deep into the middle of the potato. Depending on the size of your potato, you may want to use a skewer to create deeper holes."

      "title": "Put the potatoes in your bowl.",
      "content": "Put the potatoes in your bowl. They should still be a little wet from the wash that you gave them, but if they’re drying off at this point, give your potatoes a quick rinse. You can also add a teaspoon of water to the bottom of your bowl before turning the microwave on. [7] X Research source The water keeps your potatoes from drying out as they cook, but if they’re totally soaked the water won’t evaporate and you’ll be left with moist potatoes."

    {
      "title": "Cover your bowl with plastic wrap.",
      "content": "Cover your bowl with plastic wrap. Cover your potatoes with plastic wrap to ensure that the steam doesn’t escape the bowl. This will also help the potatoes boil evenly. [8] X Research source Most plastic wraps are microwavable, but check the packaging before using it to cover your potatoes."

      "content": "Select your time based on the size of your potatoes. For smaller diced or baby potatoes, start with two minutes in the microwave. For bigger potatoes, like sweet or russet potatoes, start with four minutes in the microwave. [11] X Research source The wattage of your microwave will affect the cooking time required for potatoes. It’s always better to start lower though when it comes to cooking in the microwave. You can always add time, but you can’t undo shriveled and dry food! [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep an eye on your potatoes while they cook. Potatoes can explode in the microwave if the pressure inside them builds up to high levels. Stay in the kitchen while they microwave to keep an eye on them. [13] X Research source Microwaves heat up the inside of the potato first. This means that the pressure will build up inside of the potato as it cooks. [14] X Research source An explosion is more likely to occur if the skin is still on or you haven’t poked enough holes in your potato. [15] X Research source Watch out for any movement or popping noises in your microwave. That may be the pressure trying to fight its way out of the potato."

      "content": "Use an oven mitt to take your potatoes out and check them. The potatoes will be extremely hot at this point, as will the bowl that they’ve been cooking in. Put on an oven mitt and carefully remove them from the microwave. Put them on the countertop and peel back the plastic wrap away from you. Open the plastic wrap away from your body and face. There will be a lot of hot steam coming out of the bowl and you don’t want to get burned."

If there’s barely any resistance when you slide the knife in and out, then your potato is fully boiled. If there’s a little resistance and it’s hard to pull your knife out, microwave them for an additional minute and check again. [16] X Research source If you can’t insert your knife at all, the potatoes haven’t cooked at all. Check your microwave’s power level and try cooking them again. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Allow your potatoes to stand for a few minutes to cool off. Because potatoes have a skin that seals in the heat, they’ll be extremely hot when you take them out of the microwave. Let them stand for 1-2 minutes before touching them or taking any additional steps. [18] X Research source Consider garnishing your potatoes with some herbs and spices while they rest. Parsley and a pinch of salt can go a long way to add flavor to this simple dish. [19] X Research source"
