      "content": "Set aside a time to discuss plans. The best way to convince your parents of anything is to talk with them in a direct way. Tell them you want to talk about having a coed sleepover and ask when would be a good time to talk. Respecting their time will show them your maturity and ability to handle a sleepover with boys and girls. Make sure that you choose a good time when your parents are not tired or stressed. For example, if your parents are tired when they get home from work, then that might not be that best time to ask. Try asking during dinner or on the weekend when your parents are in a good mood."

      "content": "Explain that you know the potential problems of a coed sleepover. Reassure your parents that you’re aware that they might be worried about the potential for sex, alcohol, or other delinquent activities. Tell them that you will not be taking part in these activities. Try saying something like, “I know that you might be thinking I just want to have a sleepover to fool around with guys, but I just want to have fun with all of my friends, and some of my friends are guys.”"

      "content": "Assure your parents that they can check on you and your friends. Make sure that your parents know that you expect them to be around during the sleepover to chaperone you and your friends. This will show them that you do not intend to do anything that they would not want you to be doing. Try saying something like, “Even though we won’t be doing anything wrong, you can check on us any time you want. You won’t have anything to worry about.”"

      "content": "Speak calmly and avoid whining. Whining may cause your parents to treat you like a kid, so it is important to avoid whining. Act like a mature, young adult by asking your parents about having a coed sleepover in a calm voice. If it looks like your parents might say no, don’t lose your cool. Continue to speak respectfully and let them finish speaking before you jump in and defend why you want to have a coed sleepover."

      "content": "Be prepared with all of the details. If you want to host a coed sleepover, make sure that you have all the details they might want. Asking your parents to have a coed sleepover before working through the details may make them think that you’re not mature enough to have a coed sleepover. [1] X Research source Have a time and date available when you ask your parents to have a coed sleepover. Make a list of all of the people who you want to invite to the sleepover. Figure out where everyone will sleep. Your best bet is to tell your parents that the girls will sleep in one room and the boys will sleep in a different room."

      "content": "Give them time to think and talk with other parents. Don’t pressure your parents into making a decision right away. They may want to weigh the options of having boys and girls sleep over, so give them space and time to think. Don’t bug them or they might become irritated and just say no. Offer to let them talk to any other parents in the meantime to find out procedural issues"

Working in advance to show your maturity is a good idea so your parents don’t have to ask you to do anything. Do all of your homework in advance so that you don't fall behind on schoolwork.

If your parents still seem reluctant, then you might consider asking if you can have your girlfriends sleep over and just have the guys come and hang out. Your guy friends could stay until a certain time, such as 10pm, and then head home. Keep in mind that this will mean that your guy friends will have to arrange to get rides home. Tell all of your guy friends in advance so they can make arrangements for rides."

Some things your parents might want you to put on the list might include: No sharing blankets or sleeping bags. No kissing. No sitting on laps. Girls stay out of the boys bedroom and boys stay out of the girls bedroom. No leaving the house."

      "content": "Pick a night that’s not a school night. It will be easier to convince your parents to let you have a sleepover if it’s on a weekend. That way, the sleepover will not interfere with your sleep and make you and your friends tired at school the next day. Having the sleepover will probably also be easier on your parents too, as long as they have the weekend off of work. Arrange to have the sleepover on a Friday or Saturday night."

As a host or even a guest, you never want anyone to feel left out or bored. It is essential to plan. Be clear about the things you are going to do. Accordingly, decide what to wear. Movies are a safe and easy option for sleepovers. Pick movies that your parents will be okay with you and your friends watching. For example, you might want to stick to PG or PG-13 comedies and adventure movies. Depending on your age, games like Spin the Bottle or Seven Minutes in Heaven could be perfect to break the ice or make things really awkward. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that your parents probably will not approve of these games, so you may want to avoid these. Video and board games are always a fun option that everyone can get involved in. Put out a stack of board games or set up a game console in your family room."
