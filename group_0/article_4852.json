      "content": "Cut 2 vertical supports so they’re 6 ft (1.8 m) long. Get at least 12 feet (3.7 m) of 4 in × 4 in (10 cm × 10 cm) lumber to use for the vertical supports on your gymnastics bar. Mark 6 ft (1.8 m) sections on the lumber and use a handsaw or table saw to cut through the wood. Make straight cuts through the wood so the ends are flush with one another. If the lumber is too expensive, glue 2 pieces of 2 in × 4 in (5.1 cm × 10.2 cm) boards together so it forms a 4 in × 4 in (10 cm × 10 cm) post. Once the glue dries, put 3 in (7.6 cm) screws along the length of the board every 6 inches (15 cm)."

Get 1 piece of 2 in × 4 in (5.1 cm × 10.2 cm) board that’s 10 feet (3.0 m) long so you can make the base pieces for the gymnastics bar. Measure 5 feet (1.5 m) from the end of the board and make a mark on the wood. Cut a straight line through the middle of the board so you’re left with 2 pieces of wood that are each 5 feet (1.5 m) long. You can also use a table saw to cut your boards if you have one."

      "content": "Cut 45-degree angles into the ends of the angle braces with a miter saw . Adjust the bevel on the miter saw so the blade is at a 45-degree angle to the board. Line up the blade of the saw with the end of the board before turning on the saw. Slowly pull the saw handle down to cut through the end of the board so it has an angled edge. Repeat the process on the other end so the board looks like a trapezoid. Continue mitering the other 3 boards the same way. [1] X Research source Be sure that the angled cuts on the ends of the board are not parallel with one another or else it won’t fit on the base properly."

Center the vertical support on one of the 5 ft (1.5 m) boards and clamp it in place with a C-clamp. Drive 4 wood screws that are 3 in (7.6 cm) long through the base board into the bottom of the vertical support. Repeat the process with the other vertical support and base piece.

Drive 2 screws through each end of the angle brace and into the vertical support and base. Secure a second angle brace on the other side of the vertical support. Repeat the process on the other vertical support to finish the legs. [3] X Research source Ask a helper to hold the vertical supports steady while you attach the angle braces so they’re less likely to move around."

Use a measuring tape to find the height from the floor to the center of your chest, or to the top of your armpit. Write down your measurement so you don’t forget it. If you’re building the gymnastics bar for someone else, measure their chest height instead."

Since you’ll have a mat underneath the gymnastics bar when it’s finished, add an additional 4 in (10 cm) to the chest height measurement to be more accurate. Measure up from the bottom of the leg piece to the height you found and make a mark in the centers of the vertical supports. Make sure the marks on the leg pieces line up with one another or else the bar will be crooked when you try to install it."

Line up the center of the hole saw with the mark you made on the leg piece before you turn your drill on. Slowly push the hole saw straight into the leg piece to cut a hole completely through it. Cut another hole through the mark on the second leg piece. Don’t try to force the saw through the wood since you could cause the attachment to break or chip the wood. You may also use a drill press to cut the holes if you have access to one."

Push the end of the bar into the hole on one of the leg pieces until the end is flush with the edge. Guide the other end of the bar into the hole on the other leg piece and push it through the wood completely. [4] X Research source You can buy wood bars from your local hardware store. You may also use a metal bar instead of wood, but be sure not to use any hollow pipes since they won’t be as strong. If you use a metal bar, make sure at least 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) extends out from the sides."

Make sure the screw goes into the wooden bar to secure it in place. Work slowly so you don’t accidentally break or chip the wood. Then add another screw on the opposite side of the leg support 1 in (2.5 cm) over. Repeat the process on the other leg piece. [5] X Research source If you used a metal bar, then slide a flange coupler over each end of the bar. Drive wood screws into each of the holes on the flange couplers to secure them to the supports. Tighten the screw on top of the flange to secure the bar in place."

Work around the corners to give them a soft, rounded edge to prevent you from getting hurt if you bump into them. Continue working until all of the edges are smooth. [7] X Research source Use an electric sander if you have one to finish working on the wood faster."

Use a mat that’s at least 4 inches (10 cm) thick so you don’t get injured if you slip off of the bar. Make sure the cushion covers both of the crossbars on the bottom so you don’t land on them by accident. [8] X Research source You can buy gymnastics mats online or from a specialty store. If you can’t find a mat that’s 4 inches (10 cm) thick, then stack 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) mats on top of one another to use as padding."
