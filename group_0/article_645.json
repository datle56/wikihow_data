      "content": "Open the release valve on the jack. This lowers the jack so you can access the filler plug. Different jacks may have different release mechanisms. On some jacks, turning the handle counterclockwise lowers the press. If you’re unsure how your jack releases, consult your owner’s manual.

      "content": "Remove the cover plate if your jack has one. Depending on your jack model, there may be a cover plate that protects the jack’s internal mechanism. Remove any screws holding this cover in place. Then lift the cover off. [3] X Research source Depending on the type of jack you have, the cover plate might come off entirely or just lift up. If the plate comes off, keep it in a safe place so you don’t lose it. Usually these screws require a Phillips head screwdriver, but check your particular model to see what type of screwdriver you need. Don’t lose the screws you remove. Keep them in a safe place so you can put the cover back on later."

      "content": "Wipe the area around the filler port plug if it’s dirty. The filler port is where you will pour the oil. To prevent dirt or grime from contaminating the jack oil, use a rag and clean off the area around the filler plug. If you’re filling a new hydraulic jack, you don’t have to do this. If your jack is old and there is a lot of caked on dirt around the fill plug, try spraying a hose or pressure washer to remove the gunk first."

      "title": "Remove the filler port plug.",
      "content": "Remove the filler port plug. This plug is underneath the cover plate on most jacks. Depending on your jack model, the plug might unscrew or just pop out. If it is a screw type, use a screwdriver and turn counterclockwise to remove the plug. If it pops out, insert a flathead screwdriver or another flat tool under the plug and lift it out. [4] X Research source If you have a bottle jack, the filler port will probably be on the side of the jack. Leave the jack upright to fill the reservoir. [5] X Research source If you can’t locate the filler port, check the owner’s manual for your jack. Be careful not to damage the plug when you remove it. If it doesn’t come out easily, stop and reassess what you’re doing. Don’t force it out."

If you see a lot of debris in the oil or it looks black or especially thick, tip the jack to carefully pour out all of the old oil into a sealable container, like a metal coffee can. Once the jack is empty, turn it back over, then wipe the area around the filler port to ensure it’s clean.

[7] X Research source Some brands of hydraulic jack oil have a narrow spout top that makes it easy to precisely pour the oil into the filler port. If your bottle doesn’t have a spout, use a funnel instead. Do not use any motor oil, brake fluid, or any other type of oil besides hydraulic jack oil."

[8] X Research source After the plug is in place, follow the procedure to bleed air out of the hydraulic system . Do not replace the cover plate yet. You still need to bleed the air from the mechanism before moving on, and the cover plate will get in the way. Some people prefer to leave the plug out while they bleed the air in case they need to add more oil. Also, depending on the jack model, you may need to keep the fill plug out while you bleed the air. Consult your owner’s manual for the correct process. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Confirm that the release valve is open.",
      "content": "Confirm that the release valve is open. You should always bleed the air after filling the jack, so the release valve should still be open. But if it isn’t, open the release mechanism all the way completely to lower the jack. Leave the release valve open while bleeding the air. [10] X Research source The bleeding process is important because air can build up in the hydraulic system while you change the oil. If air is in the system, the jack won't rise properly and could even collapse. Bleeding the jack removes the air and makes the jack function correctly. If you notice that the jack feels spongy or isn't lifting evenly, it could be due to air in the reservoir—follow the steps for bleeding the air out of the jack, and add more oil if needed."

If it starts rising, double check to make sure the release valve is open. [11] X Research source Some jack models have different variations on how to bleed the air. Check with your owner’s manual to see if your model uses a different method. It’s a good idea to check the oil in your reservoir after you bleed the air. If the level drops, add a little more oil."

      "content": "You’ll probably notice a spongy feeling if the jack needs oil. As the oil level decreases, air will build up inside the jack. This will cause the jack to feel spongy when you move the handle, or the jack might not lift all the way. It may also fail to lift at its full capacity. [14] X Research source Other signs that the jack needs oil might be: The jack lifts slowly or unevenly, feels unstable, or sways It’s leaking oil or you see oil stains under the jack You see air bubbles in the reservoir The jack rattles or makes other noises when you use it Change the oil every 3 years, or more if it looks dirty."

The wrong oil could be corrosive or could otherwise damage the jack—which could lead to injury or even death if the jack fails when it’s under load. [15] X Research source Do not use brake fluid or motor oil in a hydraulic jack. Do not mix different types of oils in the jack."

Pump the jack up to its full extension to make sure it’s working properly. If it’s damaged or isn’t working correctly, do not use the jack. [16] X Research source If any of the seals are leaking oil, replace the seals before you use the jack. Check the oil before every use—if it’s low, refill it, and change it if it looks dirty. Also, replace the oil if it’s been more than 3 years since the last change. [17] X Research source"

When you store the jack, retract the pump and piston completely to reduce the chance that they’ll be damaged. [18] X Research source Store the jack in a dry location out of the reach of children.
