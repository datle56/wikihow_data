      "content": "“Awaiting Delivery Scan” means your package has reached the final post office before delivery. Your shipment is likely at the local post office or delivery facility responsible for bringing it to your address. However, it has not yet been scanned as \"out for delivery\"—the final step before your package is on its way to your doorstep. In other words, your package is currently at the post office, awaiting its final scan before being delivered to you. To understand this status, it’s helpful to know how the USPS system works. The USPS receives your package at the initial facility, where it is sorted and prepared for transportation. Your package is then scanned, sorted by destination, and loaded onto delivery trucks. It travels through various facilities on its journey to the final destination. Once the package reaches the local post office, it is loaded onto the mail carrier's truck for the final delivery to your doorstep. “Awaiting Delivery Status” is typically what you’ll see before this final step.

      "content": "The package wasn’t scanned at the last checkpoint. The \"Awaiting Delivery Scan\" status often indicates the package was loaded onto the delivery truck but not scanned before leaving the facility. This does not necessarily mean the package will be delayed. The carrier may have simply forgotten to scan the item or was unable to do so due to a high volume of mail or other circumstances.

Similarly, technical issues can prevent the delivery scan from registering in the system. In such cases, the package has likely been delivered, even though the tracking status has not been updated.

Technical issues or system updates within the USPS network can temporarily delay tracking updates and lead to inaccurate or outdated delivery information. These problems are usually resolved quickly, but they may cause temporary tracking lapses. During high-volume periods like holidays and major sales, the USPS faces an exceptionally heavy workload that can result in longer delivery times, lost packages, and an extended \"Awaiting Delivery Scan\" status for some items.

      "content": "You will encounter several status updates as your package travels through the USPS system. Some of the most common status updates include: Shipping Label Created, USPS Awaiting Item : Although a shipping label with a USPS Tracking number has been created, the package has not yet been handed over to the postal service. Once the package is received, it will be processed and transported to your local post office, at which point a delivery date will be provided. USPS in Possession of Item: The USPS has received your package and is now processing it for transport to your local post office. Your package is on its way. In Transit : USPS picked up your package and it is currently moving through the network to get to you. Arrived at USPS Facility/ Departed USPS Facility : Your package is currently being processed or transported to your local post office. You may see multiple tracking updates from the same facility and on different days as the package travels to its destination. Arrived, Departed, or Picked Up by Shipping Partner Facility/USPS Awaiting Item: The USPS does not currently have your package. It was picked up by one of our shipping partners or has arrived at or left their facility. They will be transferring the package to the USPS for further processing and delivery to you. Out for Delivery : Your package has been prepared for delivery at your local Post Office and will be delivered by a carrier today. However, it may not arrive at the same time as your regular mail, as it may be handled by a different carrier. Delivery Status Not Updated: Since your package did not show a Delivered status within 18 hours of being Out for Delivery, USPS now expects it will be delivered on the next business day. Insufficient Address: The package is being returned to the sender because the delivery address is missing, incomplete, or incorrect, preventing successful delivery. No Access to Delivery Location : Your mail carrier was unable to deliver your mail due to one of several common issues: a vehicle blocking access to your mailbox, a loose dog or other animal interfering, your address being in a gated community or locked building that the carrier could not access, ongoing public utility work, or the presence of emergency responders in the area. Notice Left (No Authorized Recipient Available): Since no one was available to sign for the package that required a signature, the carrier left a PS Form 3849 Redelivery Notice, indicating there will be no automatic second delivery attempt. Forwarded: The package is being forwarded to a different address, either because the recipient requested a change of address or the package was sent to the wrong post office for delivery."
