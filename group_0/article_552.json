      "title": "Do a patch test.",
      "content": "Do a patch test. This is especially important if you're using a new essential oil for the first time, because you want to make sure you aren't allergic to it. To do a patch test: Mix three drops of the oil you plan to use with ½ teaspoon (3 ml) of carrier oil, such as jojoba, almond, or walnut oil. Place a couple drops on your inner forearm, just below your elbow. Cover the area with an adhesive bandage. Keep the bandage on and don’t wash the area for 48 hours. After that time, remove the bandage and check for irritation, such as redness, itching, blisters, or swelling. If none of these symptoms appear, you aren't allergic to the oil and it’s safe to use in your shampoo. [2] X Research source Some essential oils shouldn’t be used on children under five, including basil, camphor, cinnamon, clove, eucalyptus, lavender, lemongrass, thyme, bergamot, nutmeg, peppermint, rosemary, tea tree, wintergreen oils and sage. [3] X Research source Be careful not to get essential oils in your eyes, as they can cause irritation."

      "content": "Gather your supplies. To add essential oils to your shampoo, you will need a few things on top of your shampoo and the essential oils of your choice. Also gather a measuring cup, funnel, small mixing bowl, and dark glass or plastic bottle with a tight fitting lid. Store your shampoo and essential oil mixtures in a dark bottle with a tight lid because light, heat, and oxygen can destroy the aromas and properties of the oils. [4] X Research source Always put the lid back on tightly after you’ve used essential oils or your shampoo. Some essential oils in their concentrated forms can degrade plastics, so you should always store concentrated oils and blends in glass bottles."

      "title": "Portion out the shampoo.",
      "content": "Portion out the shampoo. A good rule of thumb is to use about 20 drops of essential oil per ½ cup (120 ml or 4 oz) of shampoo. Measure out the shampoo and pour it into your mixing bottle. Stick the funnel into the mouth of the mixing bottle before pouring in the shampoo to prevent spills. [5] X Research source Start with ½ cup (120 ml or 4 oz) of shampoo if you haven't done this before, just in case you don’t like the smell or effect of the oils you use. If you want to use a full bottle of shampoo, look at how many ounces or milliliters are in the bottle to determine how many drops of oil to use. You can add oils directly to the bottle of shampoo if you're adding the same oils to the entire bottle."

      "title": "Combine your oils.",
      "content": "Combine your oils. In a small mixing bowl, blend about 20 drops of different essential oils, or 20 drops of a single oil if you prefer. Stir them with a spoon or swirl them around the bowl to blend them together, and then smell the oil combination. Remember to increase the amount of oil you use based on the quantity of shampoo. Many shampoo bottles contain between 12 and 16 ounces (355 to 473 ml) of shampoo, so if you're adding essential oils to an entire bottle, you'll need between 60 and 80 drops of oil."

      "content": "Add the oils and stir. When you're happy with the result of your essential oil mixture, pour it into the mixing bottle with the shampoo. Use the funnel to avoid spills. Stir the oils into the shampoo if you have a long and narrow stir stick or spoon that will fit into the bottle. Otherwise, give it a gentle shake. Always shake the shampoo before using it, to redistribute the oils throughout the shampoo."
