[1] X Research source A \"ratio\" is any comparison of two numerical measurements. Each measurement is called a \"term.\" A \"rate\" is a ratio in which the two terms are measured in different units. All rates are ratios, but not all rations are rates. A \"unit rate\" is a rate in which the second term equals \"1.\" When calculating a unit rate, you need to determine how much of the first term exists for every one unit of the second term."

      "title": "Look at the data.",
      "content": "Look at the data. The problem must have two terms, and you must be asked to determine how much of one term exists per unit of the other term. Common examples include: speed (miles/kilometers per hour), unit price (cost per item), and wage (earnings per hour/week). [2] X Research source If you aren't sure about whether or not you're being asked for the unit rate, look for the word \"per\" somewhere in the description. Some unit rate problems won't include \"per,\" but many do. Example: A certain bakery can bake 40 loaves of bread in an 8 hour work day. How many loaves of bread can that same bakery make in one hour? In other words, how many loaves of bread are typically baked per hour?"

The total loaves of bread will become the numerator, and the total hours will become the denominator, giving you: 40 loaves / 8 hours"

[5] X Research source In other words, you are calculating the cost per item . Example: Jennifer purchased 7 boxes of cereal for a total cost of $16.38 (without tax).

Note that the unit of time will vary depending on the circumstances.

From that data, you should be able to determine how many miles (or another measurement of distance) has been travelled per hour (or another unit of time). In essence, you are calculating the distance per unit of time. The units will vary depending on the circumstance, but one unit must express distance (mile, kilometre, feet, meters, etc.) and the other unit must express time (hours, minutes, seconds, etc.). Example: The Smith family travelled 150 miles in 3 hours. If they drove the same speed during the entire trip, how fast did the Smith family car drive as an expression of miles per hour?"
