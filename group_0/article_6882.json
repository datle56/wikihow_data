      "content": "Evaluate your electrical experience. Even when unplugged, a microwave contains high-voltage capacitors that can cause serious injury or death. Although fuse replacement is easy (but not necessarily safe), a blown fuse is often a sign of other electrical problems which may be difficult for a layman to handle. If you are not experienced with electrical repair, hire a professional."

Protect yourself before you begin: Remove all jewelry and watches, which could snag on components and conduct electricity. Magnetic microwave components may damage some watches. Wear rubber soled shoes and consider wearing insulated gloves. Have someone nearby to call emergency services if necessary. Take care not to touch any metal parts within the microwave, especially circuit boards and capacitors. [1] X Research source"

After removing the screws, unhook the plastic tabs by sliding the grille (usually left or upward). Set it aside. Label all screws with their original location. On some models, you'll need to open the microwave door to access the grille. [2] X Research source Some models have the grille on the back of the machine. You may not need to remove this rear grille to remove the other panels, but there could still be a fuse behind it. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Check for obvious problems. A blown fuse is usually a sign of an electrical fault. Perform a visual inspection for scorch marks, dead insects or other debris causing a short circuit, and broken or leaking components. If any of these are present, you will likely need to replace or repair additional parts besides the fuse. There are many possible causes for a blown fuse, and these are not covered in this guide. One common cause is a broken door interlock switch, which may require replacing several door components or realigning the door. [11] X Research source WARNING: Do not touch or disassemble an unidentified component. If you cannot identify the broken part or do not know how to handle high-voltage equipment safely, hire a professional repairman."

      "content": "Locate the fuses. Your microwave may have two types of fuse. The line fuses are usually familiar ceramic tubes, about 1¼ inches (3 cm) long. [12] X Research source The thermal cutoff fuses are typically squat black cylinders with two prongs on the same side. Their exact location depends on your model, but check behind the control panel. [13] X Research source If you are having trouble, consult the wiring diagram printed on the inside cover of the microwave (or occasionally on the underside or back of the exterior panels). Some fuses may be hidden by other components. [14] X Research source Only remove these components if you are familiar with their function and know how to handle them safely."

[15] X Expert Source Marvin Woo Licensed Electrician Expert Interview. 31 January 2022. Test the fuse resistance: Touch the two probes together. You should hear a tone if the multimeter is set to continuity. If set to measure resistance, the multimeter should read 0 Ohms. (Analog multimeters may need calibration.) Touch the two probes to opposite ends of the fuse. If the multimeter reads 0 Ohms or you hear a continuity tone, the fuse is working. If the multimeter measures resistance or displays \"OL\" for overload, or if there is no continuity tone, the fuse is blown."

      "content": "Replace the fuse with an identical component. The fuse must be exactly the same size and have the same amperage rating as the original. This information should be displayed on the fuse, although you may need a magnifying glass to read it. Pop the new fuse back in with the fuse puller or insulated gloves. Buy a couple spare fuses. If there is an underlying electrical problem, the new fuse could blow as well."

Check all tabs around the edge of panels to make sure they fit securely in their slots, without pinching any wires. Improper reassembly could cause radiation to leak out of the microwave during operation. Make sure all screws are in their original position, as some may be responsible for grounding the cover.
