      "content": "Find the natural focal point in the room. The focal point of a room is not always the wall you see when you first walk in. Go with the wall that you want to draw attention to because it’s interesting or unique in some way. For example, in a room with a fireplace, accent the fireplace wall. If you have built-in bookshelves, an interesting nook, wainscoting, or something else architecturally distinctive, highlight those elements. [1] X Research source In a bedroom, the wall behind your headboard is a good choice for an accent wall. If you have a unique sofa, dramatic artwork, or another bold piece in the room, accent the wall behind it. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Create a focal point if the room doesn’t have one.",
      "content": "Create a focal point if the room doesn’t have one. Think about how you plan to decorate the space and what furniture you have to work with. That way, you can use those elements and the accent wall to create a focal point in the room. If you’re working with a brand new and unfurnished space, the accent wall will determine the color scheme for the rest of the room, so keep that in mind. [3] X Research source For example, if you have a collection of framed family photos you want to hang, showcase them against the backdrop of the accent wall. Gorgeous indoor plants can also serve as focal points. If you have a special plant or had your eye on something at the nursery, spotlight it with an accent wall."

    {
      "title": "Go with a solid wall without windows or doors.",
      "content": "Go with a solid wall without windows or doors. Accent walls look best against solid walls that have no openings, such as windows and doors. If you have large, open windows with a view of beautiful scenery, that wall isn’t necessarily a good wall to accent. The accent color may distract more than accentuate it. Natural light from large windows can also alter how the paint color looks on the wall, and you may not like the results. [4] X Research source This isn't a hard and fast rule, so if you have your heart set on accenting the wall with windows or a door, do it."

      "title": "Select the farthest short wall in an oblong room.",
      "content": "Select the farthest short wall in an oblong room. If you’re working with a long, skinny room, avoid accenting either of the long walls. The accent color will make them feel even longer, throwing the room off balance. Accenting the farthest short wall will make that wall appear closer to you and balance the oblong shape of the room. Overall, this creates a more proportionate vibe in your space. [5] X Research source If you aren't interested in proportions or if you want to emphasize the length of a room, ignore this advice. These are just basic rules of thumb. You have total artistic freedom, so feel free to break any \"rule\" you want."

      "title": "Favor muted colors over bold ones to stand the test of time.",
      "content": "Favor muted colors over bold ones to stand the test of time. Rich, vibrant colors work well for accent walls, but if you’re leaning toward a particularly bold statement color, like fire engine red, think carefully before you take the plunge. This is especially true if the color you’re considering is a current trend. Trends come and go, and in the long run you’ll probably be happier with something more neutral. [6] X Research source Color trends like bright purple and aqua don't have to be avoided completely! If you're considering a bold or unusual color, consider a slightly muted shade of that color. If you don’t mind painting the room again when you’re over the statement color, then you should go for it. If you don’t want to paint again in a year or 2, opt for a muted shade."

      "title": "Account for the room’s purpose and the mood you want to create.",
      "content": "Account for the room’s purpose and the mood you want to create. Different colors convey different energies, and these energies can have a significant effect on some people. If you’re painting a bedroom, for instance, a red accent wall might be jarring or make it difficult to fall asleep. A color like cerulean blue, which is still a vibrant hue, may create a more calming atmosphere. [7] X Research source In a room where you want to create energy, like a den or playroom, vibrant options like lime or chartreuse work well. A bathroom might benefit from a calmer green, like seafoam green. The temperature of the color plays a role, too. Warm colors like red and orange create a different vibe than cool tones like green, blue, and purple."

    {
      "title": "Go with a color that is darker than the other walls in the room.",
      "content": "Go with a color that is darker than the other walls in the room. A darker hue will contrast with the lighter walls and pull eyes straight to it, which is what you want. A good rule of thumb is to paint the accent wall the same color as the other walls, but 2 shades darker. If you don’t feel comfortable going wild with color choice and placement, this route tends to be foolproof. [8] X Research source You don’t have to do this. A light accent wall in a darker room can work, but it’s riskier. When the focal point in the room is lighter than the wall across from it, the room may feel off balance or disorienting."

      "title": "Choose a color that complements the room’s color scheme.",
      "content": "Choose a color that complements the room’s color scheme. This may seem like a no-brainer, but it’s extremely important! The accent wall must work with your existing décor, and the best way to connect it is by replicating a color from the current color scheme. Secondary colors (rather than the main color) in your current color scheme are usually a great choice for accent walls. [9] X Research source For example, the color of your throw pillows or in the pattern of the sofa fabric would work well. A color that pops up frequently in your wall art is another strong choice. If your current decor consists of a navy blue couch with forest green pinstripes, forest green throw pillows, navy blue curtains and a small green rug, consider using green for your accent wall."

      "title": "Avoid color coordinating everything in the room.",
      "content": "Avoid color coordinating everything in the room. Don’t use the dominant color in your color scheme for your accent wall. Everything in the room will match too much and nothing will stand out, making your accent wall a bit anti-climactic. For the best results, be sure to choose a color that contrasts with the dominant color in the room. [10] X Research source For example, if you have navy blue curtains and upholstery, don’t use that color for your accent wall. All that navy will end up being a bit drab."

      "title": "Calculate how much paint you’ll need.",
      "content": "Calculate how much paint you’ll need. Multiply the total width of the accent wall by the height of your ceiling. This tells you the square footage of the accent wall. Typically, 1 gallon (3.8 L) of paint covers around 350 to 400 square feet. Divide your total square footage by 350 or 400 to figure out how many gallons of paint you’ll need to cover the wall. A single gallon is enough for most walls, but keep in mind you’ll probably need to do 2 coats. If there are windows on the accent wall, subtract 15 square feet from your total square footage. Then divide that number by 350 or 400. If there's a door, subtract 21 square feet before dividing by 350 or 400."

      "content": "Remove the fixtures on the wall and put down protective tarp. Take off the outlet covers, fixtures, switch plates, and window coverings before you get started. Use painter’s tape to mask off the window sills, door hinges, baseboards, etc. Protect the floor with a tarp and cover any furniture in the room. Crack a window or get a fan so that the room stays ventilated."

      "content": "Use painter's tape to create clean lines on the adjoining walls. Since the color of the accent wall will contrast quite a bit with the ceiling and other adjoining walls, it’s important to get a straight, clean line where the accent wall meets them. Crooked or smudged lines will be very noticeable. Apply the tape slowly and be precise for best results. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean the wall before you paint.",
      "content": "Clean the wall before you paint. Dirt and debris will prevent the paint from adhering well to the wall, so always clean interior walls before you paint them. Create a mild cleaning solution with warm water and a few drops of dish detergent. Wipe the wall down with a sponge or cloth, working from floor to ceiling and in small sections. Let the wall dry completely before moving on."

      "content": "Brush on a coat of primer for the best paint coverage (if desired). Primer isn’t required, but it’s recommended. It will help the paint adhere to the wall, allow for better coverage, and help the paint wear better over time. Buy an indoor paint primer and apply one coat to the accent wall with a roller or paintbrush. Let it dry completely before you start painting."

      "title": "Apply 2 coats of your chosen paint for the best finish.",
      "content": "Apply 2 coats of your chosen paint for the best finish. Use a latex-based interior paint for this job. Start applying paint in one of the top corners, working from the ceiling to the floor in small sections. Use an angled brush to get into the corners, then switch to a roller to cover the main wall space faster. Use the angled brush anywhere you need to do detail work. Wait for the first coat to dry, then apply a second coat the exact same way. Let the last coat of paint dry completely before removing the painter’s tape and replacing fixtures."
