The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) provides sample forms for obtaining permission to do a background check and obtain a consumer credit report for employment purposes. E-Renter provides free forms for landlords, including a Consumer Reports Disclosure , which the renter must sign in order to give the landlord permission to do a background check and obtain a credit report.

      "content": "Check the credit score of a potential employee. According to CNN.com, in 2010, nearly 60 percent of employers ran credit checks on potential new hires. They see it as an important part of the hiring process, like checking someone’s references. Some employers check applicants’ credit because of the nature of the job for which they are applying. For example, banks, brokerages, the government and other financial institutions want to hire people with a proven ability to manage their personal finances. Other employers use credit histories as a way of weeding out weak applicants. They see the existence of high debt or credit delinquencies as a possible distraction that may affect job performance. Federal law allows employers to see a modified credit report for job applicants or employees. This is sometimes referred to as a credit header. It omits account numbers to protect privacy. If an employer decides not to hire someone based on a credit report, the applicant must be given a copy of the credit report and told of their right to challenge it under the FCRA."

      "content": "Guard against identity theft if your spouse has died. A person’s identity is especially susceptible to theft in the months following death. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the problem is increasing because identity information about the recently deceased is so easy to get. The government publishes the names and social security numbers of the recently deceased on the Social Security Administration’s website in order to prevent welfare fraud. But identity thieves need only to download this Excel file from the website. Some genealogy websites publish social security numbers and maiden names of the deceased. It can take up to a year to settle the affairs of a person who has died. During this time, bills continue to come in and creditors are notified of the death. Identity thieves think a few extra credit card bills in the person’s name are not likely to get noticed."

Thieves sometimes convince the elderly to cosign on loans. When the loan doesn’t get paid, the cosigner becomes responsible for the debt, and this can negatively affect a credit score. Also, if an elderly person is suffering from dementia, he may randomly apply for credit or use credit irresponsibly. You will need power of attorney or a court-appointed guardianship to obtain a parent’s credit report."
