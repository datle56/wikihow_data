      "content": "Work on personal style. A stylist and photographer will alter your appearance for photo shoots, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have a strong sense of personal style. Decide if you are girly, alternative, earthy, punk, etc. Showing off your personality through your appearance can draw attention to yourself, and lead people to focus on something other than your height. Wear clothing that sets you apart from the crowd. Don’t be afraid to divert from popular fashion. Try out a hair cut and color that flatters your face and gives you a distinct appearance."

      "content": "Acknowledge your modeling opportunities. Opportunities to become a high fashion runway model are not impossible, but they are limited. Modeling for magazines, catalogs, and print ads are your best options for petite modeling. Specifically, consider parts, swimsuit, lingerie, and commercial modeling. [4] X Research source Parts modeling involves modeling specific body parts like hands, feet, teeth, and eyes. Height does not matter for this type of modeling, as long as you meet the aesthetic requirement for the desired body part. Body type matters more than height for swimsuit modeling. A fit and curvaceous body is desired more than a tall height for women in swimsuit modeling. For men, a fit and athletic body is more important than height. Many modeling agencies are looking for models with all different body types, not just models who fit into smaller sizes. [5] X Expert Source Melynda Choothesa Professional Stylist & Fashion Designer Expert Interview. 17 April 2019. Lingerie and underwear modeling have similar requirements to swimsuit modeling. The women should be fit and curvaceous, and the men should have an athletic figure. The model being comfortable with his or her body is important in this type of modeling. Commercial modeling is aimed towards selling products. These products might be jewelry, cosmetics, cars, etc. The average height for a female commercial model is 5’4”, and a male commercial model is around 5’9”. Commercial modeling is a great field for petite models because the aim is to sell a lifestyle, and models of all ages, sizes, and ethnicities are sought after."

If you only want to do commercial modeling, a smaller city could yield enough opportunities. [7] X Research source At this point, you should only consider making a move.

      "content": "Make a comp card. A comp card, or composite card, is a marketing tool used by models for self-promotion. This is akin to a business card that you can send to agencies interested in petite models. A comp card allows industry professionals to judge you based off of more than just a headshot. This is what your agent would send in to submit you for print work. It should have a headshot on the front, three to five photos on the back, and your measurements. A good size for a comp card is 6”x 9”. [10] X Research source For a comp card, you should have photos showing you from every angle. Have one photo showing you facing the camera directly, and a few photos taken of you from various angles. It is also a good idea to include one or two candid photos. Examples of comp cards can be found in a quick online search. If you are a parts model, or a model that only shoots specific types of photos, then you will not need a typical comp card. Include photos of body parts if you are a parts model. Include photos of you in swimsuit or lingerie if you plan to be a swimsuit or lingerie model."

Even if you are rejected, it is a good idea to send an email thanking the agent for taking his or her time to meet with you. The note or email should be short and thank them for their time. You never know when you will encounter this person in the future, so it is good to leave the person with a pleasant memory of you."
