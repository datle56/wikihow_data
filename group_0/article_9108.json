      "title": "Be prepared.",
      "content": "Be prepared. Write out what you want to say before you sit down with the person, so that you won't get taken off track, do it. Don't blame and don't use accusatory language, just state your feelings. Use “I feel …” statements, not “you did …” statements. [1] X Research source"

    },
    {
      "title": "Set the agenda.",
      "content": "Set the agenda. Since you're the one who's called this meeting, you get to decide what topics will be discussed. Again, writing down what you want to talk about might help. Stay in control, stay calm, stick to your agenda, don't get pulled down rabbit trails. If the other person starts blaming you (and they likely will do so) just acknowledge their feelings, which leads to the next point. [3] X Research source When you are in control, you have an ability of being composed, attentive, and respectful. Don't show threatening or hostile behaviors."

    {
      "title": "Clarify what is said.",
      "content": "Clarify what is said. While it may seem counter-intuitive, listen as much as you talk. When the person responds, repeat what they've said to make sure you understand. One of the most effective ways to confront someone is to “hold up a mirror” by repeating what he has said or describing what she has done. You might say, “This is what I hear you saying...” Repeat or rephrase what the person has just said to you. Quite often, they'll feel understood and gratified that someone else can articulate what they are feeling or thinking. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Stay in control.",
      "content": "Stay in control. Don't get sucked into old patterns. Your job here is not to fix the other person or make them feel better. It is to have an honest conversation. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Accept appropriate responsibility.",
      "content": "Accept appropriate responsibility. Own what is yours, but don't accept blame for what is not. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't expect instant repentance.",
      "content": "Don't expect instant repentance. Your freedom is not dependent on their apology, but on your own decision to confront and set boundaries. “More commonly, a person's first response is a fierce defensive reaction to being confronted,” Clinton and Springle write.

      "title": "“Forgiving doesn't mean we have to give in to manipulation.",
      "content": "“Forgiving doesn't mean we have to give in to manipulation. It doesn't mean we have to blindly trust again. It doesn't mean the hurt is magically erased. Reconciliation is based on trust, and trust must be proven over time.” Forgiveness is not creating the justification for others to do wrong or to get away with deeds that are egregious. It is rather about allowing these events to be alleviated from your mind and body. Forgiveness leads to a healthier and happier life, and creates room for healthier communication. Sometimes, forgiveness just means that you can walk away from the person who’s wronged you without feeling guilty or weighed down by the past. Reader Poll: We asked 1019 wikiHow readers who've been hurt by a friend or loved one, and 49% of them agreed that they would just walk away from that person . [Take Poll] So if someone in your life isn't treating you right, it may be time to forgive and move on."
