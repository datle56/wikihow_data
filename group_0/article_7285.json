The only way to get an idea of who has seen your videos is to look at the comments or to check social media.

People may also be discussing the contents of your video on social media, which means they've likely watched it as well."

YouTube channels can earn money through multiple streams—including ad revenue, merch sales, affiliates, sponsorships, channel memberships, and more. Social Blade gives a rough estimate of how much a YouTube channel could be making, but this isn't always accurate. The only way to know for sure is if the creator discloses how much they make from their channel."
