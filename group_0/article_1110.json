      "content": "Select the Search icon on the Fire TV home screen. Because your Fire Stick doesn't support AirPlay out of the box, you'll need to install an app called AirScreen if you want to AirPlay to your TV. The search icon is in the upper-left area of the Fire TV home screen. While AirScreen is free, it does have some limitations. You might see an ad here and there and have some trouble playing copyrighted content from apps like Netflix and Hulu. But since those apps are available on your Fire Stick anyway, you probably won't need to worry about that. If you want an ad-free option, you'll need to pay for a premium app. Some popular options are Replica (iPhone/iPad only) or AirPlayMirror Receiver (all Apple devices)."
