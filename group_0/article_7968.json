Spread the paste over the surface of the pewter and allow it to sit for 30 minutes. Never use the paste or any other polish on antique, oxidized pewter. Oxidized pewter is darker and is treated with lead to make it look older. These pieces were intentionally made to be darker and polishing them damages the finish and their value. Polish gently. Remember that this is pewter. It won’t look as shiny and reflective as a metal such as silver."
