      "content": "Find the stroke in centimeters. The stroke refers to how far the piston travels within the cylinder. [3] X Research source If you don’t have the specs, measure this using a deck bridge and dial calipers. Position the dial calipers on the deck bridge so the jaws are upward. Move the piston to top dead center, then position the bridge over the cylinder. Zero out the calipers, then put the piston at bottom dead center by rotating the crankshaft. Open up the calipers until the depth rod is touching the piston deck, then read the number."

[4] X Research source If your piston is above deck, it takes away from the clearance volume. If your piston is below deck, it adds to the clearance volume. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Measure the head gasket volume in cubic centimeters. You may be able to find this information online or in the specs. If not, measure the sealing ring distance in inches and divide that by 3.1416. Square the answer then multiply it by the compressed gasket thickness in thousandths of inches. Take your answer and multiply it by 12.87 to find the head gasket volume in cubic centimeters. [8] X Research source For example, say the head gasket is 13 inches long and 0.041 inches thick. Divide 13 by 3.1416, which is 4.138. Square this number to get 17.123. Multiply this by 0.041, which is 0.702, then multiply that by 12.87. The head gasket volume is 9.04 cubic centimeters."

Finally, multiply the result by the stroke to determine the swept volume of the engine. [10] X Research source For instance, if your cylinder diameter is 8.1 cm and your stroke is 8.9 cm, divide 8.1 by 2, which is 4.05. Square 4.05, which is 16.4025. Multiply this by 3.14, which is 51.50385, then multiply that by 8.09. The answer is 458.38 cc. [11] X Research source"

Simply add the volume of the combustion chamber, the piston top volume, the gasket thickness, and the deck height or clearance. [12] X Research source For example, if the volume of the combustion chamber is 38.6, the piston volume is 9.0, the gasket volume is 4.5, and deck clearance is 1.6, the clearance volume is 53.7 cc."

      "content": "Plug your numbers into the formula CR = (Vsw + Vcl) / Vcl. Now that you know the swept volume and clearance volume, simply insert those numbers into the formula and solve it. Add the swept volume and cylinder volume together first. Then, divide the result by the cylinder volume to find the compression ratio. [13] X Research source For instance, if the swept volume is 458.38 and the clearance volume is 53.7, start by adding 458.38 and 53.7, which is 512.08. Divide 512.08 by 53.7, which is 9.5359. So, the compression ratio is 9.54:1."
