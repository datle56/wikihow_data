Marriage and family therapist Jessica George suggests, ‚ÄúTell them how you feel, but avoid pointing your fingers at them.‚Äù She adds, ‚ÄúUse ‚ÄòI‚Äô statements, but be sure to let them know that this will not be tolerated.

      "content": "Listen to the other person and try to understand what they say. George explains that it‚Äôs important for each person to take a turn speaking while the other person focuses on absorbing what they‚Äôre saying. Then, the listener repeats back what the speaker said. This slows the conversation down, which makes it easier to work toward a resolution. Ask the other person to tell you what they think the problem is. Encourage them to be as open and honest as possible. Clearly communicate your willingness to solve the issue so they‚Äôre comfortable letting you know what‚Äôs really bothering them. When they speak, make sure you‚Äôre using active listening skills to really hear and understand what they‚Äôre saying."

According to Rosenberg, ‚Äú[Conflict is] really a natural part of relationships, and it will serve you and the other person in the relationship if you address it head-on.‚Äù Licensed professional counselor William Schroeder suggests, ‚ÄúTry to engage someone and just set a framework for what you‚Äôd like to change: When X happened, I felt Y, and I wanted Z.‚Äù He adds that you should always start from a place of empathy and compassion. You may not be able to change their mind, but empathy goes a long way to resolving conflict."
