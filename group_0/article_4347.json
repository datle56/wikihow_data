      "content": "Ask your barber for a high-cut, low-skin fade. Then, ask your barber to cut the fade around the sides and back.

      "content": "A satirical photo of someone asking for a Boosie fade went viral. A video of a man requesting a Boosie fade but receiving an unblended bald fade with a long top went viral, spawning countless memes of bad haircuts with the caption “Bruh wanted a Boosie fade but got this instead.” [3] X Research source The most popular meme was of Patrick Star from the cartoon, SpongeBob Squarepants, who was pictured wearing a water bucket on his head with the same caption. Patrick clearly has a bucket on his head, but the caption that he asked for a Boosie fade and got that instead makes for a funny visual of the barber putting a bucket on his head in place of a sharp, precise cut. The Boosie fade meme is usually referenced when someone posts a photo or video of their haircut onto social media."

      "content": "Southside Fade If you want a low cut that sports a strong, contrasting fade, go with the Southside fade. The Southside fade is a high and tight skin fade that seamlessly blends with the hair at the top of the head. Although the Boosie fade leaves room for a hair up top, the Southside fade is the way to go if you’re looking for a similar look with a lower, less shaped top."

      "title": "South of France",
      "content": "South of France If you want to sport the same tall fade as the Boosie fade but still keep your length, the South of France is the way to go. It features a skin fade towards the bottom and gradually rises in length as you make your way towards the top. The key difference is that the hair remains on the back of the head, with the fade only taking up the sides. It’s a great choice if you want a more versatile look."
