      "content": "Political correctness refers to the belief that offensive behavior should be avoided. To be politically correct means to hold the belief that language, behavior and actions that can be considered offensive to others, especially those related to sex, gender, and race, should be avoided to prevent offending people. Politically correct words are often used in place of words that may be considered offensive. [1] X Research source Example: Many people find the words “fireman” and “policeman” sexist. To be politically correct, they use “firefighter” and “police officer.” Example: Many people find the terms “stripper” and “prostitute” offensive. Instead, they use the term “sex worker.”"

      "content": "Focus on being kind to people, not on being \"right.\" The phrase \"politically correct\" is misleading, because the spirit of what you're doing is being respectful and kind, not imposing rules. Recognize that words can hurt, and can tie into countless other hurts that people may have experienced. [2] X Research source Focus less on yourself and your word use, and more on the impact your words have on others. Licensed clinical psychologist Kim Chronister says to be aware of your nonverbals when showing kindness. Instead of showing contempt, judgment, or anything else that conveys discomfort, make conscious adjustments to seem warm or neutral. You may be confused or fearful of different people—so take a deep breath, remember that they matter, and react with acceptance and respect. The goal isn't to censor people, it's to encourage people to be kind. The goal isn't to be right, but to not be a jerk, especially to people who have faced more than their fair share of hardship and jerks. [3] X Research source Instead of asking \"am I politically correct?\" ask \"am I being caring and respectful towards others?\" [4] X Research source"

Being politically correct doesn't just mean being mindful of what you say. It also means learning about those different from you and respecting those differences. Reach out, interact, talk, and befriend those who have a different background than you. Ask coworkers or classmates from a different religion, ethnicity, sexuality, or country to go to lunch. If you're not that close, just start a conversation with them. You may be surprised how much you have in common. Find culturally diverse events and experiences. Developing your thoughts and understanding that all people are equal through interactive learning will foster a respectful attitude. Don't be afraid to ask about other people’s lived experiences. You may not understand the lived experiences of oppressed groups, especially if you are a member of a privileged group, so ask questions and listen closely to the answers."

Terms such as \"Chinese auction,\" \"Indian giver,\" \"Jew down\" (negotiate), and \"gyp\" are racist. Many common words also have implicit discrimination in them and are thus considered harmful. For example, words such as \"gypsy\" and \"oriental\" are derogatory. Instead use \"Roma\" for \"gypsy\" or \"Asian\" for \"oriental.\""

Think of it like a cheap knockoff. It exploits the aesthetic while ignoring the meaning and history. And it usually reinforces stereotypes. Here are some examples of what is and isn't appropriation: [5] X Research source Wearing a pretty necklace that you bought from a Native American craft shop isn't cultural appropriation. That's supporting an artist. Dressing up like a \"Native American\" with headdresses and feathers for Halloween is cultural appropriation. Buying a black singer's album and singing the songs you like isn't appropriation. That's enjoying their music. Making a fashion statement by copying black people's hairstyles, which they often face discrimination for, is appropriation. Making curry for dinner because you like it is not appropriation. It's enjoying good food. Wearing a bindi because you think it's cute or trendy, ignoring its cultural context, is appropriation. Celebrating Lunar New Year with your Chinese friend is not appropriation. It's joining a celebration where you were invited. Getting a random Chinese character tattooed on your body because it's \"pretty\" or \"deep\" is appropriation. [6] X Research source"

Substitute gender-neutral language to include people of different sexual orientations and gender identities. Gender-specific language can be extremely harmful. Avoid giving things genders in your mind and refrain from claiming actions, occupations, or items are \"male\" or \"female.\" Use gender-neutral job titles when you aren't referring to a specific person. For example, say \"chairperson\" or \"chair\" instead of \"chairman\"; \"firefighter\" is preferable to \"fireman\"; a \"police officer\" includes all genders; and \"flight attendant\" replaces \"steward\" and \"stewardess.\" [8] X Research source Don't assume that people are straight (or even monogamous). Ask \"Do you have any partners?\" or \"Are you engaged/dating anyone\"? rather than \"Do you have a boyfriend/girlfriend?\" [9] X Research source Don't generalize about genitals. Some women have penises/testicles and some men have clitorises/vaginas. Furthermore, intersex people exist. Respect gender identities. A person's real name is the name that they accept as the one that matches their gender. If you're unsure how to be respectful towards someone's identity, just ask them. They'll likely appreciate your good intentions. Using terms and titles such as \"woman's work\" or \"secretary\" (instead of \"administrative assistant\") is demeaning and belittling. Calling women \"girls\" (instead of \"ladies\" or \"women\") is infantilizing and discounts that the place of women in the world is equal to men."

Limit the amount of religious terms in your language, especially when speaking in groups of people. [10] X Research source Avoid religious statements when talking to non-religious people, or people of an unknown religion. For example, instead of telling a sick atheist you'll pray for them, say that your thoughts are with them and their family. It's also a good idea to avoid referencing \"God/god.\" Every religious group has different names for and rules for saying the term. Jews do not say the name of god, Muslims refer to their god as Allah, and Hindus worship many different gods. [11] X Trustworthy Source Chabad.org Online resource for information related to Chabad-Lubavitch and Jewish culture Go to source Asking questions like \"what would Jesus do?\" to an individual whose religion you don't know or group that isn't entirely Christian is ill-advised. Save the religious discussions for when you're with other Christians or when someone says they're open to discussing it. There is an exception to using religious terms: to describe either academic or specific characteristics of a religious group.

Other people's bodies aren't your business. Don't comment on their weight or offer unsolicited advice about how to change their bodies. If they don't ask about it, don't bring it up.

Not everyone in a group is the same, acts the same, or believes the same things. This kind of language reduces a person to one category, when people are so much more. For example, don't refer to groups by saying things like: the deaf, the gays, the Jews, or the Blacks.

For example, \"I don't want to offend you and was wondering if you call yourself Black or African American?\" If they are neither, show interest and ask how they'd like to be referred to. Don't use controversial terms if you aren't a group member. For example, many Roma self-identify as gypsies. Unless you are a member of the Roma community, avoid using \"gypsy\" and always use Roma. It isn't your word to reclaim. Skip the trendy terms. Most of these terms are used by members not part of the group.

If you get too upset, it's okay to step back and say that you need to take a few minutes to think. Take a break. Pause before reacting. To apologize, licensed clinical psychologist Gera Anderson says to “acknowledge their feelings and any actions on your part that may have led to those feelings.” Anderson says that “If you regret your actions, apologize for your actions.

There are a few ways to assess your own prejudices. What do you think when you hear an ethnic last name? What is your first instinct if you learn someone is gay or transgender? If someone talks or moves slowly, what do you think of them? Being honest about your initial reactions can help you identify your prejudices. Life coach Rachel Kove says to challenge these internalized stereotypes, it may be helpful to ask yourself why you feel this way and where your prejudices might come from.
