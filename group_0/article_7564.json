      "title": "Use the first element of your Works Cited entry in your in-text citation.",
      "content": "Use the first element of your Works Cited entry in your in-text citation. When you mention the regulation in the text of your paper, follow it with a parenthetical citation that will direct your readers to the Works Cited entry. For your parenthetical citation, use the first couple of elements included in your Works Cited entry. This will typically be \"United States\" and the name of the executive department or agency that issued the regulation. [7] X Research source Example: The regulation requires manufacturers to maintain records demonstrating that tobacco products, such as vaping devices, are legally marketed (United States, Food and Drug Administration). If you included the name of the executive department or agency in your text, you typically don't need a parenthetical citation at the end of the sentence. For example, you might write: \"After deaths from the use of vaping devices, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a regulation that would control the marketing of vaping devices.\" Because you identified the executive agency in the sentence, you would not need to include a parenthetical citation."

Typically, you would place this information in parentheses at the end of any sentence in which you discuss the regulation, inside the closing punctuation. [12] X Research source Example: The regulation would modernize existing mammography standards by updating them to conform with current technology (Mammography Quality Standards Act, 2019). If you include the title of the regulation in your text, place the year of publication immediately after the title of the regulation. If you happen to include both the year of publication and the title of the regulation, you don't need a parenthetical in-text citation at all."
