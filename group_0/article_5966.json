      "content": "Read over the instructions in your Sisterlock starter kit. After your Sisterlock appointment, your consultant will give you a “starter kit,” which comes with specialty shampoo, small rubber bands, and a tip sheet about grooming and shampooing. To keep your locks as tight as possible, you must follow these instructions exactly. Typically, these instructions call to wash your hair every 1-2 weeks. [1] X Research source If you use other shampoo or do not use the tip sheet, you can damage your locks or roots and disturb the Sisterlock process."

      "title": "Bundle your hair in sections before you wash it.",
      "content": "Bundle your hair in sections before you wash it. Divide your hair into 4 even sections to separate your hair into bundles. Use your fingers to section your hair in half, and then separate those halves into 2 sections each. For extra protection, braid each bundle of hair, then tuck the ends and secure each braid with a rubber band, creating a braided loop. [2] X Research source Your trained Sisterlocks Consultant will instruct you according to your individual needs. In general you should bundle your hair in sections before you wash it. Section your Sisterlocks into as many portions as needed to comfortably bundle them. For longer locks, you should have 8 to 10 section which should be braided loosely leaving room at the scalp. Fold the ends up towards the head and rubber band them into place. Shorter hair will require more bundles. To bundling your short locks you should slip a rubber band around a small section. Wrap the rubber band close to the base of the locks until it is secure. If your locks are long enough, fold the your ends down toward your head and secure them with the last wrap of the rubberband. Make sure you leave room at the scalp if possible. This is the proper technique to use when washing your hair. Bundling your hair helps your locks stay tightly coiled."

      "title": "Apply the Sisterlock shampoo directly to your scalp.",
      "content": "Apply the Sisterlock shampoo directly to your scalp. When you first get your Sisterlocks, use the 4oz (118.3 mL) starter bottle that comes in your kit. Wet your hair thoroughly in the shower, and work the shampoo through your hair, moving from root to tip. Always wash with your fingertips, rather than your nails. [3] X Research source If you change the direction of your application, your Sisterlocks and get loose and fuzzy. The Sisterlock shampoo is specially formulated to clean your hair and scalp while keeping the shape of your locks. The starter kit shampoo typically lasts 2-3 shampoos, depending on your hair length. When you run out of the starter kit, purchase more Sisterlock shampoo from your consultant or the Sisterlock website."

      "content": "Rinse out the shampoo completely and dry your hair with a microfiber towel. After you apply the shampoo, rinse the product out of your hair while gently massaging your scalp. Then, squeeze out the excess moisture using your hands while you are still in the shower. Wrap a towel around your head so your locks can mostly dry. [4] X Research source The amount of time your hair needs to dry depends on your hair length and hair type. Do not use heating tools to help dry your hair. This will harm the integrity of your locks."

      "title": "Undo each of the bundles and separate the locks once they dry a bit.",
      "content": "Undo each of the bundles and separate the locks once they dry a bit. After your hair is mostly or completely dry, take your hair out of the bundles and remove any rubber bands. If you braided your bundles, undo the braided sections after you release the bundles. Then, use your fingers to separate each lock individually. [5] X Research source If your hair is too wet and you take out the braids, this can loosen your locks. Separating the locks individually helps them lay flat and straight rather than kinked."

      "title": "Ask your consultant about using diluted witch hazel to cleanse your scalp if it gets itchy.",
      "content": "Ask your consultant about using diluted witch hazel to cleanse your scalp if it gets itchy. Some people have had success with this method, and others advise against it. If you are having a tough time adjusting to the Sisterlock wash cycle, fill up a small spray bottle with 10-15 drops of witch hazel. Then, fill the rest of the bottle full of water. Shake up the bottle gently to mix the products, and apply it directly to your scalp whenever it is itchy. [6] X Research source For the first few weeks or months, expect your scalp to be rather itchy as it adjusts to the locks. Your scalp may have excess build-up since you are only washing it a few times a month. You do not have to wash out the witch hazel. You can also try a spritz of distilled or filtered water if your consultant advises against witch hazel."

      "content": "Wrap your Sisterlocks in a silk or satin scarf when you go to sleep. If your hair is short, simply place a silk or satin bonnet over your hair. Stretch the elastic over your head, and release it when all of your hair is over. If your hair is long, you can bundle and braid it, then wrap a silk scarf around your head. This protects your hair as you sleep, keeping it soft and preventing breakage. [7] X Expert Source Amber Rose Licensed Cosmetologist Expert Interview. 13 April 2021. [8] X Research source To wrap your hair in a scarf, place the scarf across the top of your head. Gather the ends of the scarf at the back of your head, and secure the scarf with 2 knots to keep it in place. Then, twist the ends several times so it does not come undone. Pull the end of the scarf across your forehead, and tuck it underneath the scarf near your eyebrow. You can also use a silk or satin pillowcase to avoid breakage and tangles."

      "title": "Avoid using heating styling tools on your Sisterlocks.",
      "content": "Avoid using heating styling tools on your Sisterlocks. Sisterlocks will lose their tightly coiled shape if you use heating tools, such as a blow dryer or diffuser. Instead of using these tools to dry or style your hair, let your hair air-dry instead. After you've had your braids for 6 months, you can use low heat on your Sisterlocks. Set your curling or straightening iron on the lowest setting."

      "content": "Ask your consultant about using a leave-in conditioner after 6 months if your hair is fuzzy. Depending on your hair type, they may advise you not to use any additional products. If they say it's safe to use products on your hair, use a dime-size amount of a natural olive oil or coconut oil conditioning lotion to smooth away any frizz or stray hairs. Pat the leave-in conditioner over your hair starting at the crown of your head and working toward the ends. [10] X Research source Avoid using oils, waxes, and gels, as they will weigh down your hair."

      "content": "Get your locks tightened after 3 weeks initially, then every 3 months. If you just got your Sisterlocks put in, you should book your retightening appointment with your stylist before you leave the first appointment. Typically, this is scheduled 3-4 weeks after your locks are completed. If you’ve had your locks for over 1 month, schedule a retightening appointment with your stylist every 3-4 months or as needed. During the retightening session, your consultant locks your new growth as well as re-tightens the rest of your locks. If your ends are loosening, they can tighten them at this time. As another option, you can learn to tighten your Sisterlocks yourself by taking a course to learn the technique. Ask your consultant about courses in your area or search online."
