      "title": "Remember PAL.",
      "content": "Remember PAL. PAL stands for \"Pause, Adult, Listen.\" It describes the three things you need to do as soon as a lockdown begins: [1] X Research source \"Pause.\" Take a deep breath. Breathing helps you think. During a lockdown, instead of panicking, take a moment to slow down and make decisions. \"Adult.\" Find an adult you trust. This can be your teacher, the principal, or someone who works at your school. If you are in your classroom, listen for instructions from your teacher. If you are outside, find the nearest trusted adult and do what they say. \"Listen.\" Listen to the trusted adult while they tell you what to do next. You will only know what to do if you listen. Lockdowns are a little different from fire drills or earthquake drills because you might not go to the same place every time."

      "title": "Hide where the trusted adult tells you to hide.",
      "content": "Hide where the trusted adult tells you to hide. Your teacher or other trusted adult will direct you to a safe place. Go to exactly the place they tell you to go, and stay there. If you aren't near a teacher or a trusted adult, you will need to find your own hiding place. Possible hiding places include: The nearest classroom. Your classroom's designated \"safe corner\" where nobody can see you if they look in the windows. A closet. A locker room. Hide in an unlocked locker if you can. A bathroom stall. Lock the door and stand on the toilet so that your feet don't show. If the school is just doing a lockdown drill, don't hide on your own. Just find a trusted adult."

    {
      "title": "Stay quiet.",
      "content": "Stay quiet. When there's a lockdown, quiet down immediately so you can hear your teacher. Stay quiet after that so that nobody finds your hiding place. If you need to ask your teacher something, wait until they are nearby and then raise your hand. If they can answer your question, they'll let you know. The adult supervising you will let you know when it's safe to make noise again."

      "title": "Don't open the door.",
      "content": "Don't open the door. If you are in your classroom, your teacher may lock the door, pull down the blinds, and turn out the lights. Stay out of your teacher's way while they are closing down the room! Once your teacher has done these things, don't change themâ€”don't turn the lights on, don't open the blinds, and don't open the door, even if you need to use the bathroom. Even if the fire alarm goes off, stay put. Chances are, it was set off in an attempt to get you out of the room. Your teacher will tell you when it's safe to open the door. Don't open the door to anyone--not even if the person says they're the police. The police have ways of getting into the room that doesn't require people on the inside to open it."

      "title": "Wait for the correct exit signal.",
      "content": "Wait for the correct exit signal. During lockdown drills, your school may play a special noise or message that means the coast is clear. Don't leave the classroom, make noise, or look out of the windows until you hear the right signal. Don't get confused by fire alarms or dismissal bells. If you don't remember what the signal sounds like, wait for your teacher or other trusted adult to confirm that it is the right signal."

      "content": "Take deep breaths. Calm down by breathing in and breathing out slowly. Breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth. [2] X Research source Try breathing in for the count of four, then breathing out for the count of four. Do this four times."

      "content": "Stick close to your classmates and comfort them. When you are hiding, comfort yourself and your classmates by holding hands, hugging, and smiling at each other. This will help you feel brave together. [3] X Research source If you see someone who is scared, offer them a hug."

      "content": "Speak calmly. Steady your voice and speak at an ordinary volume to your class (or quieter if you are trying not to be heard). Try to sound as cool and collected as you normally do when you are trying to get them to quiet down and follow directions. Speak in short, simple sentences. Tell your students exactly what to do. Calm yourself first. Take a deep breath. Breathe out slowly. Address yourself by name in your head. Say, \"Alright, Mitchell, calm down.\""

      "content": "Direct your students to safety using simple commands. Try to behave as if everything is under control and show your students to the safe corner. Be quick about it and give your students clear instructions in a reassuring tone. Say something like, \"Everybody go to the safe corner\" or \"Please quietly stand up and walk to the coat closet.\""

So long as you aren't worried about your voice carrying through the door, you can help keep your class calm and in control with words. [5] X Research source Act hopeful. Say, \"Help is on the way\" or \"We are waiting for the helpers to come get us.\" Compliment good behavior. Say, \"Everyone is doing a great job staying quiet.\" Reassure them that you are taking care of them. Say, \"I'm right here,\" or \"I'm your teacher. Let me protect you.\" If you are waiting a long time, help them think about pleasant things. Ask them to imagine a cool vacation they took or a beautiful place they'd like to go."

      "content": "Follow all the protocol to keep your students safe. Each school's plan will vary a little, but some steps to a lockdown are consistent: Check the hall for lingering students. Lock the doors. Pull down the blinds. Turn off all lights, including computer monitors. Direct your students to a designated safe space. Turn your cell phone to silent, or off. Wait for the right signal before you let anyone out."
