      "title": "Seraphic Rod",
      "content": "Seraphic Rod While the Seraphic Rod is incredibly difficult to get, that naturally means it's one of the best rods in the entire game. Besides having a ton of luck and an incredibly high lure speed, the Seraphic Rod has a passive that helps you fill up the progress bar and has a 30% chance to apply the Blessed mutation, which gives 10 times the amount of money when selling the fish. Unfortunately, you have to reach level 1000 to get this incredible rod.

      "title": "No-Life Rod",
      "content": "No-Life Rod The No-Life Rod is probably the second-best rod in Fisch. It has awesome stats as well as two passives: Hexed (which gives a 50% chance for fish to have the Hexed mutation, which increases their value by 1.5x) and Stab (stuns the fish you're catching). While it's not as hard to get this rod as the Seraphic Rod, you still have to reach level 500 to unlock it.

      "title": "Rod of the Depths",
      "content": "Rod of the Depths While the third-best rod in the game—the Rod of the Depths—doesn't have a specific level requirement, it is a little difficult to get. You can only get this rod in the Depths , which can only be accessed after you fill out the Vertigo Bestiary and get the Depths Key. It's worth it, though, since this rod has an awesome passive: when using this rod, you summon a ghost that stands behind you. For every third catch, this ghost will give you a random fish from your location. This fish can be mutated, and there's a low chance it will also contain an Enchant Relic.

      "content": "Heaven's Rod While the Heaven's Rod lacks lure speed, it makes up for it in so many other areas. This rod has an astronomical luck stat, and it also has a pretty good chance of giving fish the Heavenly mutation, which gives a 6x increase to their value. To get this rod, you must complete the Glacial Grotto puzzle by collecting the four Energy Crystals. You can then purchase the rod from the Heaven's Rod Vault. [4] X Research source Lure speed: 30% Luck: 225% Control: 0.2 Resilience: 30% Max weight: Infinite Passive: Heavenly Cost: 2,750,000C$ (plus the cost of the Energy Crystals)"

      "title": "Kraken Rod",
      "content": "Kraken Rod The Kraken Rod is another rod with great stats but a hefty price tag. It also has two passives: Kraken's Power (for every 50 catches, you are guaranteed to catch a Legendary/Mythical/Exotic fish from the bestiary that you've already unlocked) and Kraken's Curse (5% chance to give a fish the Tentacle Surge mutation, which increases their value 10x). To get this rod, you must complete the 4 tasks and 5 wheels in Atlantis. You can then purchase this rod in the Kraken Pool.

      "content": "Poseidon Rod The Poseidon Rod has overall great stats, but what really makes it shine is its high resilience. This rod has two passives: Bonus Currency (which gives a 25% chance that a fish will give an additional 75% of its value) and Poseidon's Blessing (which gives a 10% chance for Poseidon's ghost to appear, which summons lightning that makes fish weigh 75-150% more and applies the King's Blessing mutation).

This is the best rod for beginners due to its passive: a 70% chance to get the Luck IV bonus for 45 seconds after catching a fish. While this rod isn't viable for the long haul, it's a great choice for a newbie fisher.

      "content": "Steady Rod Technically speaking, the Steady Rod is kind of outside the realm of \"beginner rods,\" and is likely your first rod into the mid-game of Fisch. However, we feel it's a good addition to this section because if you got super lucky with the first few fish you caught in the game, you might be able to afford this rod sooner than you think. It has a very slow lure speed but makes up for it with good resilience, luck, and max weight. This rod can be obtained in Roslit Bay.

      "content": "Rod of the Forgotten Fang Rod of the Forgotten Fang is a viable alternative to Rod of the Depths. However, this rod is less reliable and harder to get than the Rod of the Depths, so it's only really worth making this rod if you are looking for big fish. This rod's passive will summon a Meg that jumps out of the water after 3 perfect catches. The Meg will be carrying a fish that is a higher rarity and is 15-20% larger than normal. This rod can be crafted using the crafting station in the Ancient Archives.

That's because this rod is one of only two rods in the game that allow you to fish in lava, allowing you to collect all the fish from lava pools. The other rod that can be used in lava is the Magma Rod, but the Reinforced Rod is the better pick by far. You can get this rod in the Desolate Deep.
