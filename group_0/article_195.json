      "title": "Find the right size.",
      "content": "Find the right size. Use a cloth measuring tape to measure your band size (under your bust, across your ribcage, and under your arms) and your bust size (the fullest part of your breasts). To deduce your cup size, subtract your band size from your bust size and use the total difference to refer to a standard cup sizing chart. You can also drop by or schedule a bra fitting at any lingerie boutique or department store. The clerk will measure your band size, bust size, and determine your cup size. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Make an adhesive bra if you have a very petite bust. Adhesive bras are stretchy, sticky strips of rayon that provide backless support. Cut the adhesive bra one to two inches from the bottom and remove the backing on the remaining piece. While pressing your breasts together with one hand, apply the sticky side of the adhesive strip against the outer edge of one breast (close to the areola), run it on the underside of both breasts, and around the edge of the second areola. [2] X Research source If you don't plan to wear a cloth bra over the adhesive bra you can wear pasties (nipple stickers)."

      "title": "Wear a balconette bra if you have a small to medium bust.",
      "content": "Wear a balconette bra if you have a small to medium bust. This is a type of demi bra, also referred to as an unlined bra, that supports your bust from beneath without showing harsh lines through your top. The balconette provides ample push, but lacks the restraining security for larger bust sizes. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear a bra with an underwire if you have a medium to large bust.",
      "content": "Wear a bra with an underwire if you have a medium to large bust. Underwire bras not only help avoid the dreaded droop that bustier women struggle with, but they also provide an extra “boost and press” that accentuates your natural cleavage curve."

      "title": "Wear a push up bra for dramatic cleavage.",
      "content": "Wear a push up bra for dramatic cleavage. Push up bras come in various amplification sizes that offer a simple yet effective way to accentuate cleavage for any bust size. They are designed to lift and press your breasts together to create the desired double arch effect, but provide more security than a balconette or adhesive bra."

      "title": "Wear a bustier for both figure and cleavage accentuation.",
      "content": "Wear a bustier for both figure and cleavage accentuation. A bustier is an undergarment that gently draws in your mid-section and upper torso via a stretch satin or rayon material, while providing cupped support for your bust. These undergarments are designed to accentuate your bust by tightening your mid-section and pressing your breasts upwards. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Wear plunging necklines.",
      "content": "Wear plunging necklines. Purchase tops and dresses with V shaped and deep necklines that expose your cleavage area. Make sure to choose an appropriate neckline for your specific bust size. Women with larger busts should consider a supported V neck, while smaller busts are complemented by support and depth effects. [5] X Research source A V-neck neckline with a lace bralette underneath creates weight there, but also makes the visual of some cleavage.

      "title": "Try a crop top to enhance bust size.",
      "content": "Try a crop top to enhance bust size. Crop tops instantly draw the eye upward to the bust. The design of the crop top provides a natural drape over the breasts, which accentuates a smaller bust and makes it appear larger. A high-necked crop top will accentuate breast size rather than cleavage. If you wear a crop top make sure to incorporate a low neckline."

      "title": "Go with horizontal stripes.",
      "content": "Go with horizontal stripes. Horizontal stripes have an effect of widening areas of the body. Wearing a top that has horizontal stripes exclusively across the bust area will create a more voluminous look. If you don't have a striped shirt, try choosing a top with ruffles or a pocket on top that creates the illusion of more weight and volume with fabric.

      "title": "Wear bottoms with high waists and figure hugging dresses.",
      "content": "Wear bottoms with high waists and figure hugging dresses. A plunging neckline isn't the only garment style that draws attention to cleavage. Pants and skirts with chic and flattering high waists and dresses that cling to the mid-section draw the eye inward and upward. They also emphasize an hour glass figure, which naturally accentuates the bust."

      "title": "Try styling your hair out of the frame.",
      "content": "Try styling your hair out of the frame. Hair is a great accessory, yet can be distracting. Styling your hair away from your face and neckline, such as a bun, pony tail, or twist, will help cleavage stand out as a central asset."

    {
      "title": "Wear a bold necklace or pendant.",
      "content": "Wear a bold necklace or pendant. Just as a plunging neckline attracts the eye, necklaces with bright colors, large pendants, or beautiful designs naturally draw the interest of onlookers. Placement of your jewelry is key. Make sure that the pendant or necklace swoop lays strategically at the crest of your cleavage or along the upper curve of your breast."

      "title": "Use a bronzer to highlight your bust line.",
      "content": "Use a bronzer to highlight your bust line. Dark bronzer across the top of the breast will define your breast shape, while a lighter, slightly gold hue dusted between your breasts will create depth. [8] X Research source Put on your bra before applying makeup. If possible, get completely dressed and protect clothing in the area where you'll be applying the makeup with some facial tissue or toilet paper."

      "title": "Use a self-tanning lotion for the summer months.",
      "content": "Use a self-tanning lotion for the summer months. Use a powder puff to apply a light layer of self-tanner to the area below your collar bone and over your bust. Next, use a makeup applicator pad to apply a second layer of self-tanner directly to the collar bone, breast arch, and cleavage crevice. This layer will dye your skin darker in key areas creating the illusion of rounder, larger breasts. After blending harsh lines with a clean makeup brush, use a hair dryer set on cool to quickly set and dry the tanner. [9] X Research source With the powder puff, draw crescent moons along the natural curve of each breast as you are blending the first layer of self-tanner. After the second application, dab baby powder in the middle of your breasts to slow the darkening process."
