Don't accidentally get pre-qualified instead of pre-approved. There's a difference. Pre-approval means that the lender is usually prepared to give you a loan after seeing your financial vitals. Pre-qualified only means that the lender is estimating what you could borrow. It doesn't mean you'll get a loan.

Too many people fall in love with a home that they — well — can't afford. They struggle finding a mortgage that covers the cost of the home. Finding a mortgage first and a home second may seem less appealing, but it's smarter. You'll immediately be able to tell whether a home is in your price range or out of it. Think about the sort of down-payment you'll be able to afford. This should be part of your mortgage calculations, although you don't need to know for sure when shopping for a mortgage. Have a general idea in mind. More on this later in the article. Find out what ratios lenders are using to determine if you qualify for a loan. \"28 and 36\" is a commonly used ratio. It means that 28% of your gross income (before you pay taxes) must cover your intended housing expenses (including principal and interest on the mortgage, as well as real estate taxes and insurance). Monthly payments on your outstanding debts, when combined with your housing expenses, must not exceed 36% of your gross income. Find each percentage for your monthly gross income (28% and 36% of $3750 = $1050 and $1350, respectively).

There are a couple things in particular that you and your family should give good thought to: What will you and your family need in several years? Maybe you're just a couple right now, but are there plans for kids in the future? A home that snugly fit two people could be torturous for three or four. What tradeoffs are you willing to make? In other words, what are your priorities? Although we like to believe that buying a house can be straightforward, it's often a complex ordeal in which we're forced to compromise. Do you care more about a safe neighborhood and good schools over a big backyard? Do you need a big, workable kitchen more than a big luxurious bedroom? What are you willing to sacrifice when it's crunch time? Do you expect your income to increase over the next couple years? If your income has increased by 3% for several years in a row and you hold a secure job in a safe industry, you can probably rest assured that buying an expensive but still reasonable mortgage is possible.

The area in which your home is located is sometimes a bigger consideration than the home itself, since it has a major impact on your home's resale value.

Never buy the most expensive house in the neighborhood. Your bank may balk at financing the home, and you probably won't see your home appreciate in value very much. If you can, buy the least expensive home in a neighborhood — as homes around you sell for more money than you paid, your home's value increases."

Here are some things to keep in mind as you think about your offer: What are the seller's financial prospects? Are they in desperate need of money or are they sitting on a pile of cash? Cash-strapped sellers will be more likely to take an offer that undercuts their asking price. If the house is a flip, the seller is often less emotionally invested and wants to sell quickly. Have your agent call the seller's agent and find out what they want for the property. People flipping houses usually already have a number in mind. You can find out if a house is a flip by looking at sale records, if it sold recently (around a year ago) and for much less than it's listed for now, and looks upgraded, it's probably a flip. You can also look it up on Google Maps street view to get some insight as to what it looked like before. If it looked run down with boarded up windows, and now it's looking pretty nice, it's probably a flip. It can also help to reassure the seller that you can close quickly (if you really can!). How long has the home been on the market? Homes that have been on the market for longer periods of time can usually be bid down. Have they already bought another house? If the sellers aren't currently living in the house they're trying to sell, it may be easier to bid less than you otherwise might."

Credit unions often offer lower closing costs to their members.) Put the total into a mortgage calculator (you can find them online or make your own in a spreadsheet .

Although the guidelines for submitting offers may differ from state to state, this is usually how it goes: You submit your offer to your Realtor, who then forwards it to the seller's representative. The seller then decides to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer. Include earnest money with your offer. This is typically 1-5% of the offer. Once you sign an offer, you are officially in escrow, unless you cancel using an accepted contingency to the contract during the contingency period. During escrow (typically 30 to 90 days), your lender arranges for purchase financing and finalizes your mortgage. Consider putting an expiration time on your offer if you or your agent think it makes sense for that situation. For example, if you put a 24-hour expiration, you're only bound to that offer for 24 hours. This can put a little pressure on the seller to act quickly."

That's also money that you don't have to pay interest on. The more of a down payment you're able to make on your home, the less money you'll ultimately pay on your home. [10] X Research source You may be expected to put down 10-20% of the appraised value of a home depending on your loan package. However, there are loan packages that allow you to put down much less. Note that the appraised value may be higher or lower than the selling price of the house . If you have $30,000 saved for a down payment, for example, you can use it as a down payment for a home between $300k (10% down payment) or $150k (20% down payment). Putting less down often, but not always, requires you to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI), which increases your monthly housing cost but is tax deductible. However, 20% is the typical amount for not needing to pay PMI. If you can't afford a 10%-20% down payment on your home, but have good credit and steady income, a mortgage broker may assist you with a conventional or FHA mortgage. FHA mortgages only require a 3.5% down payment and there are other loan packages that require as little as 3% down. There are also USDA and VA loans that require no money down.

(You will generally have 7–10 days to complete inspections — be sure that your agent explains this fully to you when signing the purchase and sales contract.) A home inspection costs between $150 and $500, depending on the area and the size of the home, but it can prevent a $100,000 mistake. This is especially true with older homes, as you want to avoid financial landmines such as lead-paint, asbestos insulation and mold.
