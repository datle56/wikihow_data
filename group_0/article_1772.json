      "content": "Choose your yarn. Arm knitting requires no needles or other equipment, just some yarn and your own two arms. However, it is important to choose yarn that will be bulky enough to complete your project. One option is to purchase yarn that is super bulky and meant for arm knitting. You can find this type of yarn in a craft store. [1] X Research source If you canâ€™t find super bulky yarn, then you can also use three strands of bulky yarn held together to arm knit your blanket. [2] X Research source The amount of yarn you will need will depend on how large you want your blanket to be. Plan on needing at least a three skeins of super bulky yarn to complete this project. If you are going to hold together three strands from three bulky skeins to knit your blanket, then you will need at least nine skeins of bulky yarn."

      "title": "Pull five feet of yarn out of the skein.",
      "content": "Pull five feet of yarn out of the skein. To begin casting on, pull about five feet of yarn out of the skein. This is the tail of your yarn, which you will use to cast on your first row of stitches. Allow the yarn to drop onto your lap or onto the floor beside you. [3] X Research source Five feet is enough to cast on about 18 stitches for a small blanket. If you want to make a large blanket, then pull out a bit more, like six or seven feet of yarn."

      "title": "Cast on your first stitch.",
      "content": "Cast on your first stitch. Start by making a slipknot with some of the yarn from the five foot length of yarn you pulled out. Start near the skein and work downwards. To make a slipknot, make a loop in the yarn and then pull a second loop of yarn through this loop. Then, slip this loop onto your right arm. This will be your first cast on stitch. [4] X Research source Continue to loop the yarn and pull loops through to create more cast on stitches. Slip these stitches onto your arm as you go. Continue casting on until you have at least 18 stitches on your arm. This will make a small blanket or throw. [5] X Research source If you want a larger blanket, then try casting on 24 to 30 stitches."

      "title": "Knit your first row.",
      "content": "Knit your first row. Knitting on your arms uses the same basic technique as knitting with needles. However, it can be more challenging at first since you will be using your fingers to create the new stitches. To knit the first row, take the free end of the yarn (set the tail aside) and loop that yarn around your hand. Then, insert this loop into the first loop on your right arm. As you pull the loop through, slide the old loop off your right arm and slide the new loop onto your left arm. Continue to knit the stitches in this way until you reach the end of the first row."

    {
      "title": "Transfer the stitches back to the right arm for your second row.",
      "content": "Transfer the stitches back to the right arm for your second row. As you knit using your arms, you will be transferring the stitches from one arm to the other. That means that if you started on your right arm, then you will be transferring the stitches over to your left arm by the end of the first row, and then back to your right arm by the end of the second row. Continue knitting until you have achieved the desired length."

    {
      "title": "Bind off the stitches.",
      "content": "Bind off the stitches. You will need to bind off the stitches to finish the blanket. As with knitting using needles, you will be casting off by knitting the first two loops and then pulling each loop through the one that is behind it. For example, start by knitting the first two loops in your row. Then, stop knitting and grasp the first loop in your row with your fingers. Pull this loop up and over the second loop on your hand so that it is secured and you only have one loop on your hand. To continue casting off, follow the pattern of knitting one and looping the first loop over the second loop until you reach the end of the row. As you cast off, you should never have more than two loops on your casting off arm."

    {
      "title": "Weave in the ends.",
      "content": "Weave in the ends. After you have cast off the final loop, pull the free end of the yarn through the loop. Then, weave the tail end of the yarn through the loops on the edge of the blanket to hide it. You can also tie the end of the yarn in a knot going through one of the stitches to secure it. Trim off any excess yarn from the tail and your blanket is complete!"
