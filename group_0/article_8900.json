      "content": "Choose a supportive friend who will help you gain confidence. An open-minded and understanding friend can support you and help you gain the courage to move forward. If your first experience coming out to someone is positive, you might be less anxious about telling other people in the future. You might find it easier to come out to your friends before telling your family. However, keep in mind that you’re in charge. If you’d feel more comfortable telling your parents first, then that’s the path you should take. Keep in mind people don’t always meet your expectations, and you can’t control anyone’s reaction. Don’t get discouraged if someone you tell doesn’t react the way you expected. Sometimes, people are shocked or upset at first, then become more accepting after they’ve had time to absorb the news."

      "title": "Pick a relaxed, private place to tell them.",
      "content": "Pick a relaxed, private place to tell them. While there’s no ideal way to come out, a private, distraction-free time and place can make things easier. Avoid having the conversation when you or your friend are stressed, upset, or busy. That way, you’ll have an easier time expressing yourself clearly, and your friend will have a chance to process what you have to say. For instance, you wouldn’t want to want to deliver the news when your friend has a basketball game in 10 minutes or is running late for work. You don’t have to make a big deal about it. Just ask your friend to hang out, and say that there’s something you want to tell them."

    {
      "title": "Try to be honest, matter-of-fact, and positive.",
      "content": "Try to be honest, matter-of-fact, and positive. Take a breath, relax, and say, “I wanted to tell you something. I’m gay. I’m telling you because I trust you and know you’ll be there for me.” If you haven’t come out to anyone else, let your friend know that this is the first time you’ve told anyone, and that you’ve chosen to tell them because you trust that they’ll be there for you. While it’s a big moment, it’s not like your confessing to a crime or informing your friend that you have a life-threatening sickness. You’re sharing something with someone you trust. This is a good, friendship-affirming thing, so do your best to keep your tone positive."

      "content": "Allow your friend to react and ask questions. Your friend might need a moment to process what you’ve said, so be patient. Give them a few minutes to react, and let them know they should feel free to ask any questions. [1] X Research source Your friend might not have any questions, or they might say that they’re not surprised. Don't worry if the conversation is a little awkward, or if they don’t know what to say. Just give your friend the time they need to take in the news."

      "content": "Let them know you could use their help as you come out to others. Knowing that you're no longer alone and that you have someone to lean on can make things much less overwhelming. Be honest with your friend, and tell them that you could use their support through your coming out journey. [2] X Expert Source Deb Schneider, LCSW, PPSC Licensed Clinical Social Worker Expert Interview. 2 April 2021. [3] X Research source Say, “It’s such a relief that you’ve been so accepting. I’m still anxious about telling other people, and I’m hoping you might be able to give me a pep talk now and then. Knowing that I’m not alone in this would really make me feel better about telling people.” Unfortunately, you might not get the support you expected when you come out to friends and family. If someone needs more time to process what you’ve said, or if their reaction is negative, don’t get discouraged. There are other people who can give you the support you deserve."

      "content": "Build a support system if you’re worried about telling your family. Coming out to your friends can help you feel more confident about yourself. If you’re not sure how your parents will react, it’s also important to have people you trust who can lend emotional and practical support. [4] X Research source If you’re legally a minor or still depend on your parents, it might be best to put off coming out if you think they'd stop supporting you. If you feel compelled to tell your parents regardless of the outcome, make arrangements to stay with a supportive friend or relative just in case. If you’re not ready to tell your parents, make sure your friends understand that your family doesn’t know, and ask them to respect your privacy."

      "content": "Try to anticipate how your parents will react. The best case scenario is that they will be completely accepting, that they might have already known, and that this conversation won’t cause tension. However, coming out to your parents could be risky, especially if they’ve demonstrated discriminatory behavior towards LGBTQ+ people in the past. [5] X Research source If your parents have expressed positive views of the LGBTQ+ community, have supported other people coming out, and are generally open-minded, then there’s a good chance they’ll be supportive. Keep in mind that, while your parents may be accepting or have LGBTQ+ friends, they might still react strongly when you tell them."

If they’ve expressed anti-LGBTQ+ views, and if you’re financially dependent on them, it might be in your best interest to wait to tell them until you’re independent. [6] X Research source Ask yourself if they might withdraw their support, stop paying your school tuition, or kick you out of the house. While keeping it to yourself might be tough, you shouldn’t come out to them if your well-being is at risk."

Whether your parents react positively or negatively, it’s helpful to know that you have friends on whom you can rely. If you’ve already come out to friends or relatives, tell them when you’re planning to come out to your parents. Your supportive loved ones will be there for you to vent to regardless of how things go with your parents.

Additionally, you might have an easier time if there are no major life events happening. For instance, avoid telling them if a relative has just passed away or the night before your sister gets married. [8] X Research source Make sure the emotional climate at home is stable. If your parents are fighting or if you’ve just gotten grounded, you might want to wait for things to settle."

      "content": "Don’t come out during a fight. You may feel tempted to come out in the middle of an argument with your parents, but you shouldn’t use the news as a weapon. If you tell them out of spite, you’ll make it harder for them to come to terms your identity."

Tell them that you want them to be a part of your life, and that their love and support mean a lot to you. [9] X Research source Take a deep breath and keep your cool. Even if you’re worried that they’ll react negatively, your parents might surprise you and thank you for being honest. Do your best to stay positive, and tell them, “I’m gay,” or “I’m bisexual,” in simple, matter-of-fact terms."

      "content": "Let them know you understand if they feel shocked or upset. Even to the most accepting of parents, your news may come as a complete shock. They might be afraid that you’ll face a more difficult life, or that you won’t be able to get married and have children. Their fears may or may not be justified but, either way, try to be empathetic instead of taking it personally. [10] X Research source Try saying, “I get that this is a lot to take in, and you have a right to have strong feelings. But this is who I am, and I’m happy with it. This isn’t a bad thing, so please don’t be angry or blame yourself. This doesn’t have anything to do with you or your parenting.” Assure them that you’re happy and healthy, and that life poses challenges for everyone, regardless of their orientation or gender identity. Remind them that, in general, people are becoming more accepting of other lifestyles. If your country or local government has non-discrimination or same-sex marriage laws, tell your parents about them."

For other parents, accepting the news can take months or years; some, unfortunately, aren’t able to accept it. Try to be patient, and be prepared to answer any questions they may have. While you wait for them to process your news, make sure you feel safe. The environment may feel a little tense and uncomfortable, but as long as you’re safe, you can remain at home. While you give your parents time to process this information, lean on your friends. Spending more time with your support network can help you get through a rough patch with your parents."

If you don’t want other relatives to know right away, ask your parents to respect your privacy. Remember that you get to choose when and how you come out to the people in your life. [12] X Research source Of course, it’s fine if you think it’d be less stressful for your parents to tell other family members. You’re in charge, so take the steps that make you most comfortable."

It’s normal to feel confused, so don’t feel like you need to have all of the answers. Just try to accept that your LGBTQ+ identity is part of who you are, and know that you have no reason to feel ashamed. Coming out to yourself can be tough, but it’s an important first step. Tell yourself, “I’m gay,” “I’m bisexual,” “I’m transgender ,” or “I’m questioning right now, and that’s okay. I have no reason to feel guilty or ashamed.” Reminding yourself that you’re not alone can help. Try reading books or online articles about other people’s coming out journeys."

You are in control of whom you tell and when, so take each step of your journey at your own pace. You may have friends who came out years ago, but that doesn’t mean you need to follow their timelines. What’s right for them isn’t necessarily what’s right for you. Coming out can lift a heavy weight off of your shoulders, and it can help you feel closer to supportive loved ones. However, it can be risky. You shouldn't feel like coming out is your only choice, especially if you don’t feel safe doing so.

If you’re unsure or aren’t ready to put a label on your orientation or identity, don’t let someone else define it for you. Keep in mind you might feel pressure to adopt a label from both non-LGBTQ+ and LGBTQ+ friends. [14] X Research source For example, suppose you tell your friend that you think you’re bisexual, and they say, “Well I’m sure you’re really gay, but you’re more comfortable saying ‘bi’ for now.” No one knows you better than you and, even if your friend is right, no one can force you to adopt one label or another. An LGBTQ+ friend might tell you that you need to tell everyone in your life your specific orientation or label in order to be your authentic self. No one, whether they’re supportive or not, has the right to dictate another person’s identity. [15] X Research source Being gay, bi, or queer is only part of your identity, just as a straight person isn’t purely defined by their sexual orientation. You don’t need to change who you are to fit anyone’s standards or stereotypes."

Try bringing up issues with friends and family like gay marriage or transgender teen homelessness, or mention an LGBTQ+ movie or TV character. [17] X Research source You could say, “I saw a story on the news about same-sex marriage. What are your thoughts on it?” Before you come out to someone, think about how accepting they are of other people. Do they have a loved one who’s openly LGBTQ+, and do they treat that loved one with love, support, and respect? Do they make offensive jokes or disparaging comments? If you have a trusted friend who’s a member of the LGBTQ+ community, they might be the best person to tell first. They’ve been in your shoes, and there’s a lower risk that they’ll react negatively."

If coming out to a loved one face-to-face is too intimidating, or if you’re afraid of getting tongue-tied, you could write them a letter instead. Start by letting them know that you trust them and want to share something important with them. Then tell them about your LGBTQ+ identity in clear, simple terms. For example, you might write, “I’ve wanted to tell you that I’m gay for a little while now, but I’ve been so scared. I think part of me has known most of my life, but I’ve never really accepted it until recently.” Be sure not to give your loved one the letter at school, work, or a crowded place. You could ask them to read it in private, or you could hand them the letter and ask them to read it in your presence. It might be easier to get the conversation going if you put everything you want to say in writing. Writing a letter could be a good method if you’re worried about coming out to your parents."

If you encounter homophobia or transphobia regularly, coming out is a lower priority than staying safe. If LGBTQ+ discrimination and bullying at school or work are commonplace, or if being LGBTQ+ is illegal in your country, it’s not your responsibility to come out and try to change society.

Do people make offensive jokes? How close are you with your coworkers? If you have any openly LGBTQ+ coworkers, you could ask them for advice.
