      "title": "Choose a style and stay consistent.",
      "content": "Choose a style and stay consistent. Whether you’re getting several realistic portraits or a few simple tribal tattoos, sticking to a single style is essential for designing a sleeve that makes sense as a single piece. Research different styles online and ask to view a tattoo artist’s portfolio to see what kind of styles they specialize in. Once you’ve selected a style, you can begin planning and designing your sleeve. [1] X Research source The most popular styles are traditional, realism, watercolor, tribal, new school, neo-traditional, and illustrative. Certain styles work with certain subjects or compositions better than others. For example, tribal styles and watercolor are probably not the best for portraits, while abstract or minimalistic styles might work better. Ultimately, your sleeve is up to you. If you want a sleeve with multiple styles, go for it. Just know it likely won’t look as cohesive as if you choose a single style."

      "title": "Stick to 1 or 2 themes to make your sleeve cohesive.",
      "content": "Stick to 1 or 2 themes to make your sleeve cohesive. Like sticking to a singular style, choosing a single theme helps your tattoo sleeve look more intentional. For example, if you already have a few nautical tattoos, adding a portrait of a family member will seem odd and out of place. Try to choose a theme that you find particularly interesting or sentimental so you don’t lose interest halfway through. [2] X Research source Any topic or idea can function as a theme for a sleeve. Possible themes include places from your past, loved ones, tribal tattoos, insects, and iconic places from your hometown. If you’re trying to pay homage to a family member, reference your favorite television program, let people know where you grew up, and show your love for boating all in one sleeve, your tattoos are going to seem disconnected and random."

      "title": "Don’t get small tattoos as main pieces if they’ll be hard to connect.",
      "content": "Don’t get small tattoos as main pieces if they’ll be hard to connect. If you get a 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) minimalist tattoo in the middle of your forearm, it will disappear in the context of your full sleeve. Sometimes, you might not realize just how much space you have to work with. When choosing a design , especially for your main piece, consider going bigger than you originally planned. This ensures that your sleeve will have a focal point. [3] X Research source If you’re connecting pre-existing pieces, you’ll probably need to get smaller tattoos in between the main pieces. These are called filler tattoos. Save your small tattoo ideas for the filler! Before committing to a size, ask a tattoo artist if they think a piece is going to be too small or too big. Portraits, cartoons, iconic figures, and complex machines are all excellent choices for your larger pieces. If someone were standing 6–8 feet (1.8–2.4 m) away from you, would they be able to tell what your tattoo is? If not, your tattoo may be too small for a main piece on a full sleeve."

      "title": "Consult a tattoo artist to start your full sleeve.",
      "content": "Consult a tattoo artist to start your full sleeve. After you’ve selected an artist and come up with your first design , meet with your tattoo artist before sitting down for your first session. They can offer guidance regarding the size, placement, and color choices of your sleeve, and they’ll be able to tweak any design elements that you may be unsure about. Choose an artist who understands your vision so you can work together to create the best sleeve for you. [4] X Research source Ask to see preliminary sketches before a tattoo artist invests too much time in them. They’ll appreciate saving the energy, and you won’t waste any time waiting for a completed sketch to get finished. Make sure to choose an artist whose work you truly admire. A tattoo sleeve is a big commitment, so your artist should be able to produce high-quality work. Don’t choose an artist simply because they’re all you can afford at the time; instead, save up so you can invest in a tattoo you’ll be proud to show off. Tattoo expert Michelle Myles recommends doing your research when choosing an artist: “Get a referral or really look online at what makes a tattoo look good. Does it have nice, solid lines, good solid color, or smooth shading? Make sure that the tattoo shop is also clean and reputable.”"

      "content": "Work with the same tattoo artist to ensure that the work is uniform. Every tattoo artist has a different style and process. [5] X Research source Working with the same tattoo artist is a good way to ensure that your sleeve has a consistent style and cohesive feel. This will also make it easier to complete your tattoo slowly over time, as you won’t need to meet with multiple artists to explain your vision and ideas. If possible, avoid tattooing sessions that are longer than 2-3 hours. Not only are they painful , but they make it difficult to assess the direction of your sleeve. Ask questions! Solicit advice and feedback from your tattoo artist at every stage of the process in order to make sure that both of you are on the same page."

      "title": "Don’t rush the design process.",
      "content": "Don’t rush the design process. It’s totally normal to be excited about a new tattoo and want to get it done as soon as possible. Just remember that a tattoo sleeve is a big commitment, and you’ll have these designs on your body forever. Sometimes, your first design idea might not be your best. Give yourself some time to really consider what designs you want your sleeve to include and imagine how it will look on your arm. Tweak your design until you’re confident it’s what you want. [6] X Research source There isn’t an exact timeline for how long you should wait before committing to a design. Some people wait a few months, while others wait over a year to make sure they still like the design before getting it tattooed. Choose what feels right to you. This doesn’t mean you have to know every little detail about your design. If you’re struggling to come up with ideas, talk to your artist so you two can work together to complete the design."

      "title": "Try not to wait too long between sessions.",
      "content": "Try not to wait too long between sessions. Because tattoo sleeves are so big, you’ll have to book multiple sessions to complete them. While tattoos can be expensive, try to have enough money saved up so you can book your next session as soon as possible. If you wait too long, like a year or two, the existing tattoo will have faded, so you’d need to spend more money to touch it up so it matches the new addition. [7] X Research source While it may take over a year to finish all of your sessions, try to space each session within a few months of each other. Plus, if you’re going for a full, themed sleeve, it may look incomplete and awkward until you get it finished."

      "title": "Use the negative space on your skin as contrasting filler.",
      "content": "Use the negative space on your skin as contrasting filler. If you already have a lot of colorful or black ink on a sleeve, fill in the negative space by using the blank skin as the interior texture for a tattoo’s outline. Choose simple designs, like flowers, clouds, or minimalistic shapes, and leave them unfilled and unshaded to give the impression that the blank skin is part of your design. [8] X Research source This is an excellent option if you already have a lot of black ink or shading in your tattoos. The contract between black ink and clear skin can create a strong visual impression. Consider using the empty skin as the background for a silhouette landscape or portrait. The empty skin will make the black figures pop, and the empty space will feel like a part of the composition. Consult your tattoo artist to see what they would do to fill in the remaining sections of your skin. They likely have a lot of experience turning smaller pieces into a full sleeve."

      "title": "Extend images and add on to tattoos to make them bigger.",
      "content": "Extend images and add on to tattoos to make them bigger. If you already have a few tattoos and have some negative space between them, add on to them to make them blend into one another more cleanly. For example, facial portraits can be given necks and shoulders, and flowers can have stems and leaves added on to them. Extend landscapes horizontally or vertically, or add geometric lines to minimalist designs to make them larger. [9] X Research source Unless your piece is based on a specific individual, try adding a second version of the piece to fill in nearby space. For example, if you have a pair of scissors on your forearm, add a switchblade or sewing needle next to it. This keeps the theme intact while adding to the piece. Extended images can also be shaded into each other. This is a neat way to connect separate images without detracting from their main elements."

      "title": "Add some color to black and gray tattoos to be more vibrant.",
      "content": "Add some color to black and gray tattoos to be more vibrant. If you have a lot of tattoos with only black ink, connect them by adding some colorful elements to each piece. Red or yellow outlines can easily be added to pre-existing tattoos to connect them uniformly. Or, add drips, bubbles, or geometric shapes to the exterior edges of your main pieces to connect them. If you like the look of all-black tattoos, there’s nothing wrong with keeping your sleeve monochromatic. Color fades over time. Add color after you’ve had the black outlines done to ensure the ink fades at the same rate and the tattoo remains uniform."

      "title": "Make filler tattoos lighter and less bold than main pieces.",
      "content": "Make filler tattoos lighter and less bold than main pieces. As a general rule, filler tattoos should enhance the overall impression of your main pieces, not detract or distract from them. To avoid making a sleeve too busy or overwhelming, design filler tattoos to be simpler than your main designs. If you have a lot of black ink, make filler tattoos lighter shades with thinner lines. If you have a lot of color, use more muted shades in your filler pieces. A main piece refers to any tattoo that functions as a cohesive piece of art and covers a large portion of your skin."

      "title": "Use simple line work and patterns to fill in un-inked skin.",
      "content": "Use simple line work and patterns to fill in un-inked skin. Simple lines and patterns are a good, subtle method to fill in the space between tattoos. Straightforward patterns like parallel lines of varying sizes and stippled textures are excellent choices that won’t detract from your main pieces. Minimalistic line work and patterns work well alongside highly-stylized images and abstract pieces. If you want something fun and abstract, add trippy patterns and illusions with some simple linework. Wavy checkerboard patterns and geometric shapes often create a crazy effect."

      "content": "Cover up tattoos you no longer like. If you have a tattoo that was poorly executed, no longer matches your preferred tattoo style, or you simply don’t like anymore, work with your tattoo artist to see if it’s feasible to cover it up. This way, you can start with a clean slate when developing your sleeve without having to worry about a singular tattoo standing out. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Create a patchwork sleeve out of unrelated tattoos. While many people think of a tattoo sleeve as a cohesive unit, patchwork sleeves are becoming increasingly popular. A patchwork sleeve consists of individual tattoos rather than a specific theme or design. These may not always look as cohesive as a regular sleeve, but they work well if you want to get a lot of smaller designs rather than committing to one large one. [11] X Research source Many people choose to create patchwork sleeves out of individual traditional tattoos, as that style tends to look very cohesive. Recently, patchwork sleeves have also become popular with those who enjoy minimalistic or fine line tattoos."

      "content": "Go for a skull sleeve for a timeless design. Skull tattoos have always been popular, and it doesn’t seem like that will change any time soon. Not only can skull tattoos make you look tough, but many people see them as a reminder of life’s fragility. Add your own meaning to your design to make it totally unique to you. [12] X Research source Create a sleeve of human skulls in various sizes and positions, or add some animal skulls into the mix. Skulls are also great if you’re thinking about creating a pirate theme for your sleeve. Add other elements, as well, like snakes or spiders. For a more feminine touch, go for flowers or butterflies to create contrast."

      "title": "Choose a floral sleeve for a more feminine look.",
      "content": "Choose a floral sleeve for a more feminine look. Flowers are popular tattoos for any gender, but floral sleeves are especially popular with women. Go for a sleeve filled with your favorite flower, or mix things up with a bunch of different flowers. Floral sleeves look great in black and gray or with a pop of color. [13] X Research source Roses are always a popular tattoo choice, but choose whatever flower you prefer. If you want your sleeve to have extra meaning, choose the birth flowers of your close loved ones. If you want something a little edgy, add some snakes or skulls to the sleeve."

      "content": "Honor your religion or culture with spiritual elements. Many people proudly represent their heritage or spirituality with their tattoo sleeves. For example, many Polynesian people get tribal tattoos , while some Christians may get images of crosses, angels, or Bible verses. These tattoo sleeves can help you remember what you value most. [14] X Research source Celtic tattoos are popular with those from a Celtic background, and many people opt for Greek mythology tattoo sleeves, as well. Or, choose a traditional Japanese sleeve to wow everyone with bold lines and colors."

      "content": "Show your love for your favorite anime or cartoon. If you’re really passionate about pop culture, brightly colored cartoons and anime often make great tattoos. Choose characters from your favorite show or include elements from several different shows. Sticking with a similar color theme for each element will help your sleeve look cohesive. [15] X Research source For example, if you love Disney, you might create a sleeve based on your favorite princesses or classic Disney characters. Similarly, if you love an anime like Naruto , include your favorite characters and scenes in your design."

Opt for a large portrait of your favorite animal, like a wolf or a lion, and/or blend it with the trees and the sky to create a larger piece. These designs often look best in black and gray realism, but choose whatever style you prefer. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Create a background with clouds or waves.",
      "content": "Create a background with clouds or waves. One great way to make your sleeve look like a cohesive unit is to create a “background” that extends up your arm. Tattoos like clouds or waves offer a ton of coverage so you don’t have to come up with ideas for a bunch of small filler tattoos. Consider what theme you want for your sleeve and try to find an organic shape that can fill in the gaps. For example, if you’re going for a Greek mythology theme, clouds would be a great background, while waves would work for a nautical theme. Flames also work well as a background filler."

      "title": "Add simple images like stars, birds, clouds, or flowers.",
      "content": "Add simple images like stars, birds, clouds, or flowers. If you want to add more visual elements to your sleeve, opt for simple compositions that can easily be modified to fit different parts of your skin. For example, birds and flowers can fill in different parts of your limb. Landscape elements like trees, clouds, and flowers are great if you have a few nature-themed pieces. These are good options if you have a lot of traditional, neo-traditional, or new school tattoos. Banners and flags are excellent choices if you want to add some written text in the context of your sleeve."

      "content": "Choose chains or vines to cover awkward gaps. Depending on the placement of your existing tattoos, you may end up with some blank spaces that will be hard to fill with another design. Elements like vines and chains can curve and curl into almost any shape, so they’re great options for these areas. Plus, they often accentuate the tattoos around them. Bolts of lightning can also be designed in any size or shape to cover gaps in your ink."

      "content": "Add traditional dot work for a subtle background. If you have a lot of traditional tattoos you’d like to connect into a sleeve, create a simple background of bold dots and stars. Traditional tattoo artists have been using dotwork as filler for years, as it takes up space without drawing attention from your main pieces."
