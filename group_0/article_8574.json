If you’ve just been injured and you haven’t seen a doctor yet, go see one as quickly as you can. There are lots of sensitive and vital areas on your face, and a doctor should take a look if it’s anything other than some small surface damage.

      "content": "Stop the bleeding by holding a clean cloth over the wound if necessary. If the wound is actively bleeding, grab a clean cloth and fold it over as needed to make it a little thicker. Hold the cloth over the wound and apply a light amount of pressure to the wound to suppress the bleeding. If the wound isn’t bleeding a lot and it stops after a few minutes, go ahead and move on. If there’s a moderate amount of blood, hold the cloth in place for 15 minutes to give it time to stop. [5] X Research source If you’re using a thin cloth and the blood soaks through, swap the cloth out and replace it. Bleeding typically stops on its own after 15 minutes of pressure. It’s okay if blood trickles a little bit for an additional 45 minutes. If the bleeding won’t stop after that, see a doctor immediately."

If the facial wound is in a location where you can’t hold it under a slow stream of water, grab a clean cloth and soak it under the water. Wipe the area repeatedly to brush and debris or contaminants out of the wound. [6] X Research source Don’t worry if the wound is a little sensitive at this point. So long as you aren’t in any serious pain, it’s okay. If you feel any intense pain or your face feels numb, see a doctor immediately. [7] X Research source"

If you see any pebbles or dirt in the cut or scrape and they’re sitting on the surface of the wound, grab a set of tweezers and look in a mirror. Carefully and gently remove each object that’s stuck in the skin without irritating the wound. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source If you can’t remove an object or it appears to be deeply embedded in your skin, see a doctor. Do not attempt to remove any large objects that won’t come out of the wound."

      "content": "Treat the wound with an antibiotic cream for the first 2 days. If the wound is fresh, grab an antibiotic cream or ointment, like Polysporin. Spread a thin layer of your antibiotic over your wound after you clean it. This will keep bacteria out while the wound begins to heal. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Avoid touching the wound directly if you can; just brush the cream or ointment on in light layers without rubbing the skin."

      "title": "Protect the wound with an adhesive bandage while it heals.",
      "content": "Protect the wound with an adhesive bandage while it heals. Get a non-stick adhesive bandage that’s large enough to cover the wound entirely. Peel off the adhesive backing and stick the bandage over your wound so that the damaged skin isn’t touching the sticky portion of the bandage. [10] X Research source Non-stick adhesive bandages are not standard Band-Aids, although you can certainly use one of those if the cut or scrape is small and you don’t want a big bandage on your face. The non-stick adhesive bandages are thin pads that are less adhesive and more comfortable than standard bandages. You can find these in any pharmacy. For a fresh wound, replace the bandage and repeat the entire process the next day. After 2 days, you will stop using the antibiotic cream or ointment. You can use gauze if you really prefer, but gauze tends to stick to wounds as they heal. This can irritate the wound further whenever you replace the bandage. If the wound covers a round portion of your skin and you want to hold the wound together, use a butterfly bandage to cover the wound crosswise and hold the skin together. [11] X Research source Try to find a bandage that matches the color of your skin if you don’t want it to stick out."

[12] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If the wound is near your eyes, be extremely careful as you clean the surrounding skin. Keep your eye closed if you can and keep the soap out of your eyes. This is really important if you want to minimize the odds that your wound heals into a scar. You have to clean the wound every day until it’s entirely healed. Never use iodine or hydrogen peroxide to clean your wound. These products can damage your skin and prevent healing.
