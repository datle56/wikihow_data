You might be connected to an old friend on social media, but passively liking each other's posts or even occasionally commenting isn't the same as a friendship. Still, you can use those posts to spark a conversation. Here are a few possibilities: \"OMG I just saw your anniversary pictures! I can't believe you've already been married for 5 years—it seems like the wedding was just yesterday!\" \"I can't believe you went to Paris. Your photos are amazing!

Look, I know we haven't talked in a while, but I'd love to catch up!\" Other holidays work for this as well. For example: \"Happy New Year, my friend!

[5] X Research source Here are some ways you can briefly explain the situation: \"I've been so busy the past few months I can barely keep my head above water.

[15] X Research source If the person is open to reconnecting with you , make an effort to get to know them as the person they are now, rather than constantly reminiscing about the people the two of you were back when you were close. It's possible the person won't ever respond to you, or that they'll have no desire to reconnect with you. That can be hard to deal with, but try to respect their wishes. Remember that growing apart is natural, and it doesn’t mean that the time you spent in each other’s company was any less meaningful or important."
