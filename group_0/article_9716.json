      "title": "Have a clear reason to convert this person.",
      "content": "Have a clear reason to convert this person. Why do you want to convert this person to Christianity? Do you want to prove something to others? Do you feel obligated to do it? Has God put this desire in your heart? Or do you just really love and care for this person and want them to go with you to Heaven?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Have a clear understanding of Christianity.",
      "content": "Have a clear understanding of Christianity. Are you a devoted Christian? Do you put God first in your life? Are you a good example of how a Christian should be? Make sure to have a close relationship with God. Attend a church every Sunday , read your Bible , have quiet times, and of course pray."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pray",
      "content": "Pray . Prayer is the number one factor here. If you want to convert your Muslim friend to Christianity, you have to tell God first! Tell Him how you feel, and really open your heart to Him, so that He can see how devoted you are, and so that He can help you overcome this challenge and achieve victory. Remember to pray daily and to include your Muslim friend. If your friend is sick or has pain you can also ask to pray directly for them and if they accept and Jesus heals them you then have Jesus backing up your words with His power. Have faith, both in God and in yourself."

    {
      "title": "Understand their religion as well",
      "content": "Understand their religion as well . This knowledge may come in handy, especially when it comes to discussions . Be persuasive , but be respectful. You'll be more successful if the other person doesn't feel threatened, so don't insult their faith, or they'll simply become defensive and stubborn (not because they're Muslim but because they're human). Likewise, don't try to force them to convert; it's disrespectful and will not work."
    },
    {
      "title": "Invite them to church!",
      "content": "Invite them to church! If your friend won't attend church , then introduce that person to some of your Christian friends so that they can feel the warmth and love that we share with each other. \"Why should I go to church?\" Share your testimony (story of how you came to know Christ or of what God's done in your life) or have a friend share their testimony. Talk about salvation, but don't overdo it — even if you're friends, they'll see you as preachy and tune you out. Again, the goal is to lead by example. Don't talk about doom and gloom and things to come."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be kind to others.",
      "content": "Be kind to others. Showing a good example is also a big key. Be kind, not only to them but to everyone! Always have a smile on your face and always be happy , for God always wants our light to shine. Our actions can have a great impact on others — remember that talk is cheap, but actions are worth so much more."

    {
      "title": "Be a best friend.",
      "content": "Be a best friend. Be there whenever you can. If your friend is in a bad situation, don't just sit there and pity them, but rather, do something for them! That way they can see how extraordinary you are."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't get discouraged.",
      "content": "Don't get discouraged. Your friend may not ever want to become a Christian and that is perfectly okay. Nobody is obligated to change their religious beliefs for anyone else. If they let you know that they aren't interested, drop it and leave it be. Don't push it on them. Remember, even if the person doesn't become a Christian when you are talking to him/her, your witness can make a lasting impact in that life and in a circle of influence and may be nurtured to accept Christ later."

      "title": "Discuss \"Be peacemakers\".",
      "content": "Discuss \"Be peacemakers\". Jesus said, \"Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the Sons of God\" (Matthew 5:9). Point out that Jesus/Isa is the Prince of Peace in the Bible. He calls his followers to bring peace to conflict or peace will have little meaning. We may intervene or interfere in warlike situations. We are to bring love and peace, joy,... with us -- Why?: \"...brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you\" (2 Corinthians 13:11)."
