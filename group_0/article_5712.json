      "content": "Yes, Uno can be played with as few as 2 players. There aren't many differences between playing Uno with a large party and playing it with only 2 people. The main change to be aware of is that Reverse cards now work the same as Skip cards. In other words, if you play a Reverse or a Skip card, the other player's turn is skipped, and you automatically get to play again. [1] X Research source Similarly, if you play a Draw 2 or Draw 4 card, you get to take your next turn right after the other person draws the correct number of cards."

[2] X Research source Whoever draws the highest point value is the dealer, and the other player gets to go first. After dealing the cards, flip the top of the deck over and lay it face up on the table. That's the start of the discard pile. A traditional Uno deck comes with 112 cards. [3] X Research source Those include: 19 Blue cards 19 Green cards 19 Red cards 19 Yellow cards 8 Skip cards (2 in each of the 4 colors) 8 Reverse cards (2 in each of the 4 colors) 8 Draw 2 cards (2 in each of the 4 colors) 4 Wild cards 4 Wild Draw 4 cards 4 blank cards"

      "content": "Play by laying down a matching card or an action card from your hand. Whenever it's your turn, try to match the face of the card on the top of the discard pile with a corresponding number or color from your hand. You can also play an Action card to (hopefully) win the game faster, as well as make it more challenging for your opponent. The Action cards include the Skip, Reverse, Draw 2, Wild, and Wild Draw 4 cards. [4] X Research source Here's what each card does when you play it in the 2-player version of Uno: Skip and Reverse : Skips the other player's turn and lets you play again immediately after you lay it on the discard pile. Draw 2 : Requires the other player to draw 2 cards from the deck and then lets you play another turn. Wild : Allows you to change the color being played on the discard pile to any color you choose (for example, if the top card on the discard pile is currently green, you can play a Wild card on your turn and change it to blue). Wild Draw 4 : Allows you to change the color being played on the discard pile and requires the other player to draw 4 cards before giving the play back to you. Only play this card when you don't have another card in your hand that matches the color of the card on the top of the discard pile."

This is critical to helping you win the game. If you don't and your opponent catches you, you'll have to draw 4 more cards, giving your opponent a chance to snatch your victory out from under you.
