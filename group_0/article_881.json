    {
      "title": "Call them “Commissioner” when you see them in person.",
      "content": "Call them “Commissioner” when you see them in person. Don’t worry about any special honorifics when you’re in the middle of a conversation, like “The Honorable.” Use the prefix “Commissioner” and the person’s surname when you speak with them. [1] X Research source For instance, you can say something like, “Hello, Commissioner Brown! How are you today?” If you’re talking about them in conversation, you’d say something like, “Commissioner Hall will be here shortly.”"

    {
      "title": "Fill out an envelope with “The Honorable” if they were elected.",
      "content": "Fill out an envelope with “The Honorable” if they were elected. List out their full name, their position as Commissioner, and the organization or agency they preside over. Then, list out their full address. [2] X Research source For instance, you can write something like: The Honorable Glenn Williams Commissioner Administration for Community Living 300 Main Street New York, NY 12345"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use “Mr.",
      "content": "Use “Mr. /Ms./Dr.” if the Commissioner is appointed. Unless the person was appointed by a very powerful person, like a president, governor, or other well-established leader, you don’t need to use “The Honorable” when filling out their address. Instead, list them with regular, civilian prefixes, along with their position and the agency that they work for. [3] X Research source For example, you’d write something like: Dr. Bailey Theo Commissioner Advisory Council on Historic Preservation 300 Main Street New York, NY 12345"
    },
    {
      "title": "Write “Dear Commissioner” and their last name as a salutation.",
      "content": "Write “Dear Commissioner” and their last name as a salutation. Don’t stress about sounding too formal or casual—with letter headers, “Dear” works perfectly fine as a salutation. Use “Commissioner” and their last name, and skip over their first name altogether. [4] X Research source For instance, you could start a letter with: “Dear Commissioner Wolsek.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "List the Commissioner first and their spouse second on an envelope.",
      "content": "List the Commissioner first and their spouse second on an envelope. Follow the same rules for addressing envelopes, but use a regular prefix for the Commissioner’s spouse. Then, write out the address as you normally would. [5] X Research source For instance, you’d address an elected Commissioner and their spouse as: The Honorable Charlie Davenport and Mrs. Davenport 20 Oak Lane Chicago, IL 12345 The mailing address for an appointed Commissioner would look like: Mr. Anthony Baker and Mrs. Caitlin Baker 2000 Axel Lane Washington, DC 12345"

    {
      "title": "Call them “Judge” if they’re an elected or appointed official.",
      "content": "Call them “Judge” if they’re an elected or appointed official. Court Commissioners are essentially judges, and can be addressed as such. Just use the prefix “Judge” along with their last name whenever you speak to them. [6] X Research source For example, you can say something like, “Hello, Judge Brooks! It’s great to see you today.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Refer to them as “Your Honor” if you’re in court where they’re presiding.",
      "content": "Refer to them as “Your Honor” if you’re in court where they’re presiding. Play by the courtroom rules in a professional setting. Don’t worry about official titles—“Your Honor” works just fine, and is the usual protocol in a courtroom. [7] X Research source If a Court Commissioner is only visiting a courtroom but not leading the court proceedings, you don’t need to call them “Your Honor.” Don’t use “sir” or “ma’am” in the courtroom—this is considered impolite.

      "title": "Write “Commissioner” and their last name in a letter salutation.",
      "content": "Write “Commissioner” and their last name in a letter salutation. List out the person’s title and then their last name. Don’t worry about first names for your correspondence, since they aren’t necessary. [10] X Research source For example, “Dear Commissioner Haverford” would be a good letter or email salutation."
