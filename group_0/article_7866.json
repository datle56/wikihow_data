      "content": "Try mixing a natural cleaning solution. Fill up a large bucket about ¼ - ½ of the way with lukewarm water. Mix in equal parts of white vinegar. The exact measurements on the water to vinegar ratios are rather loose, because most linoleum floors do not need an entire bucket’s worth of cleaning solution to clean the floor surface. Besides, standing water can damage linoleum, so you never want to use more water than necessary. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Try mixing a chemical cleaning solution.",
      "content": "Try mixing a chemical cleaning solution. Use a cleaning product specifically intended for cleaning linoleum floors. Linoleum-specific cleaning products can be found in most flooring and home department stores. Most linoleum floor cleaners need to be diluted with water, so follow the manufacturer’s instructions by mixing in the appropriate amount of cleaning detergent in a large bucket filled with the correct measurements of water. [6] X Research source If using a chemical cleaner, make sure that your cleaning area is well ventilated. Alternatively, you could mix about 6-7 drops of a mild detergent (such as dish soap) with approximately one gallon of warm water as your cleaning solution. [7] X Research source Bear in mind that this solution will clean and disinfect your floors, but a linoleum-specific cleaner might remove dirt a little better. Chemicals that have high pH levels can be extremely damaging to linoleum flooring, so stay away from cleaning products like ammonia when cleaning your linoleum floors."

[10] X Research source [11] X Research source If you want to clean you floors more thoroughly, you can use a soft bristled scrub brush instead of a mop. [12] X Research source This method would most likely require you to work on your hands and knees.
