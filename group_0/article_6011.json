[5] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If the blister has torn, or if there is dirt under the skin flap, you may need to trim it away to prevent infection and keep it from ripping further and damaging healthy skin. First, wash the area thoroughly. Then, disinfect a pair of small scissors (nail or first aid scissors work best for this) using rubbing alcohol. (You can also sterilize scissors by placing them in boiling water for 20 minutes, or holding them over an open flame until the metal turns red, and then letting them cool.)

If the skin over the blister has come away, or if the blister is on your foot or another sensitive area, you may want to use a special bandage designed for blisters. There are numerous brands of special blister cushion bandages that are padded to protect delicate skin. You can also use moleskin on blisters. Moleskin is a soft, felt-like substance that often has an adhesive backing. Cut two pieces of moleskin slightly larger than your blister. Cut a circle roughly the size of your blister in one of the pieces. Apply this piece over the blister, positioning it so that the “window” is directly over the blister. Apply the second piece of moleskin on top of the first. [13] X Research source Resist the urge to use a liquid bandage like New-Skin. These are more suited to cuts or lacerations, and could cause further irritation or infection if used on a blister. [14] X Research source When in doubt, ask your pharmacist or call your doctor for a specific recommendation."

It is common for a blister to itch as it heals, especially if it is allowed to dry out, but it is important not to scratch it and risk further skin damage. Keeping the area cool and wet is one way to decrease itching. Soak a clean cloth in ice water, and apply it to the site, or soak the area in a tub of cool water. [16] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Be sure to clean the area, reapply antibiotic cream and bandage it again afterwards. If the skin around the bandage becomes red, bumpy, or itchy, you may have an allergy to the adhesive in the bandage (or the bandage itself). Try a different brand, or try nonstick sterile gauze pads and medical tape. You can apply hydrocortisone 1% ointment to the irritated skin around the blister to help with itching, but don’t apply it to the blister itself."
