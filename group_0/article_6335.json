Press A to interact with the Hallowed Tower. If you have an Odd Keystone item in your bag, then you will be prompted to put it into the tower. [1] X Research source You can find Odd Keystones in a few different places in the game: Twinleaf Town: Use Surf on the water at the south edge of town. Move to the left side of the water, face the trees, and press A to find a hidden Odd Keystone. Route 208: Talk to the Black Belt NPC in the bottom right corner by the honey tree, and they will give you an Odd Keystone. [2] X Research source The Underground: Look for shiny areas of the wall and interact with them to start a mining minigame. Odd Keystones may appear at random and are uncovered when you mine the 4 x 4 area they’re hidden behind."

      "content": "Visit the Underground and talk to 32 other players. The Underground is a large maze area under the Sinnoh region you can access once you have the Explorer kit item. The Underground shows other people playing the game near you using DS Wireless Connection. Interact with 32 players that are not NPCs to move on. [3] X Research source Nintendo shut down Internet services to the DS, so the only way to talk to other players in the Underground is if someone nearby has a console and a copy of Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum. The number of players you talk to saves in between visits to the Underground, so it’s okay if you don’t talk to 32 players in one sitting. Each time you come back to the Underground, you can talk to the same player and it will still add to your count."
