Soak a cloth with some dry cleaning fluid and blot the stain up. For extra stubborn stains, follow up with vinegar. While you are blotting the garment, you'll notice the stain transferring to the cloth. You'll need to use a clean portion of the damp cloth to avoid putting the stain back onto the garment. Once the stain is gone, dampen a clean cloth with water, and blot the area clean. Let the garment dry on its own. [1] X Research source Oil-based stains will include lipstick, mascara, most sauces, and salad dressings. If the stain is very thick, try to scrape as much of it off as you can with your fingernail or the edge of a spoon."

Place the bag into the dryer, and dry it according to the manufacturer's directions (usually about 30 minutes). Once the time is up, remove the garment from the bag and hang it up so that it can dry; the bags can produce a lot of steam inside. [5] X Research source Keep in mind, however, that heat tends to set stains as well. You must treat the area first with the stain removal pen. Consider taking the garment to a professional dry cleaner instead. Sometimes, the pen will not get the stain out."
