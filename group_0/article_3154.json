      "title": "Familiarize yourself with Korean culture and beauty standards.",
      "content": "Familiarize yourself with Korean culture and beauty standards. Though many companies will accept non-Korean trainees, you will still be catering to a largely Korean audience. It’s smart to learn about the culture if you aren’t already familiar. Study popular K-pop groups, spend time on Korean fashion websites, learn how to apply Korean-style makeup , and read up on etiquette and social norms. [1] X Research source If you aren’t Korean, it’ll show the producers that you are invested in becoming a K-pop trainee and are willing to work hard to be a part of the culture."

      "title": "Learn to speak Korean if it isn’t a language you’re familiar with.",
      "content": "Learn to speak Korean if it isn’t a language you’re familiar with. At a minimum, make sure you know basic phrases like “ Hello ,” “Goodbye,” “Please,” and “ Thank you ,” and read the Korean alphabet. You will have to sing in Korean at least some of the time if you become a trainee, and knowing the language will also help you make friends and get around in South Korea. [2] X Research source If you can’t take a Korean language class, try downloading an app like EggBun or Duolingo ."

      "content": "Avoid scandals and be careful with what you put on social media. A big part of being a successful trainee is characterized by having good manners and behaving properly. Avoid situations where you might get in trouble, like being at a party where there’s underage drinking. Also use caution when posting on social media. Managers and executives can most likely see your accounts. Producers are interested in trainees who have the right skill and are willing to work hard. They aren’t interested in trainees who end up in the spotlight because they’re often in trouble or causing drama."

      "title": "Create a YouTube channel",
      "content": "Create a YouTube channel to upload videos and create a following. Start recording your original songs, as well as your covers.

      "title": "Maintain a healthy weight and stay physically fit.",
      "content": "Maintain a healthy weight and stay physically fit . Regardless of the beauty standards a company might adhere to, your physical health should be in good enough shape to allow you to keep up with the rigorous activity you’ll go through as a trainee. For K-pop trainees, and even idols, hours of dance practice everyday is fairly common. If you feel like you’re out of shape or want to lose weight , incorporate daily exercise into your routine and try to eat more whole foods rather than processed foods."

      "title": "Take dance classes to become a better and more versatile dancer.",
      "content": "Take dance classes to become a better and more versatile dancer . If you don’t have much dance experience, take a variety of dance classes while maintaining a focus on hip-hop and urban dancing. A big part of being a trainee is being able to perform exceptionally, and that includes dancing. [4] X Research source If you can’t take actual classes, use the internet to learn new skills."

      "title": "Invest in a vocal coach to strengthen your singing abilities.",
      "content": "Invest in a vocal coach to strengthen your singing abilities . Even if you’re already a great singer, a coach will likely be able to teach you something new.

      "content": "Work on your rapping skills to round out your skill set. Rapping is an important part of the K-pop genre and is featured in many K-pop songs. Listen to more rap music to get an idea of the rhythm and start imitating your favorite artists. [6] X Research source If you have trouble enunciating your words and keeping up with the fast rhythm, practice tongue twisters to loosen your lips."

    {
      "title": "Practice writing your own music and perfecting well-known songs.",
      "content": "Practice writing your own music and perfecting well-known songs. When you audition, you’ll need to perform songs that the producers already know, but when you’re a trainee, you’ll be working on writing and choreographing your own original music. It’s a good idea to work on both aspects of being a performer. [7] X Research source Take a music writing class and spend a lot of time listening to K-pop and watching music videos so you can start emulating popular styles."

      "title": "Decide which companies you’d like to audition for.",
      "content": "Decide which companies you’d like to audition for. Some of the major entertainment companies include SM, JYP, YG, Cube, LOEN, Pledis, Woolim, and BigHit. Some companies are focused on trainees who match a certain aesthetic and already know how to sing and dance, while others don’t mind taking someone who needs more training in a particular area. [8] X Research source Auditioning for every available opportunity can get expensive and be very time-consuming. Start by finding a company that is most likely to accept you and focus your attention on their auditions. If you’re under 14 years old, a legal guardian will need to attend the audition with you or sign-off on the audition on your behalf."

      "title": "Become an expert in your skill and be confident when you audition.",
      "content": "Become an expert in your skill and be confident when you audition. Most K-pop trainees are great at one of the following skills: singing, dancing, or rapping. Come prepared with one really strong skill and a familiarity with everything else. For example, if you are strongest at dancing, take classes and hone that skill as best as you can, but also don’t neglect working on your singing and rapping, too. [9] X Research source No matter where you end up, you’ll be taking hours and hours of classes for all of the skills needed to be a K-pop idol. But having a strength when you set out to audition could help you stand out to the producers."

      "title": "Prepare 3 songs for an audition, including at least 1 Korean song.",
      "content": "Prepare 3 songs for an audition, including at least 1 Korean song. Think about where your talents shine, and then make your song selections based off of that. For example, if you’re great at rapping and dancing, choose 1 song that is in Korean that showcases your rapping and dancing skills, choose another that exhibits another type of dancing, and then choose a song that you absolutely love—the producers will get a chance to see both your skill and your passion. [10] X Research source Search YouTube for audition videos to check out what other hopeful trainees are doing and what types of songs they’re auditioning with."

      "title": "Get headshots done to hand out or send to producers.",
      "content": "Get headshots done to hand out or send to producers. You can have these done professionally, or you can try to do them yourself at home.

    {
      "title": "Wear plain clothes and minimal makeup on your audition day.",
      "content": "Wear plain clothes and minimal makeup on your audition day. The judges will want to see what your face and body look like without excessive makeup or distracting clothes. Stick to form-fitting clothes in neutral tones so that your body movements are the center of attention. [12] X Research source Avoid wearing K-pop fan clothing—producers might assume you’re only at the audition so you can see your favorite idol."

      "title": "Attend a live audition or submit an audition video online.",
      "content": "Attend a live audition or submit an audition video online. There are tons of live auditions that take place all over the world all throughout the year, so chances are you can find one in your country to attend. If you can’t attend a live audition or if you simply want to increase your odds of being chosen by participating in more auditions, check out each company’s online audition forum at their websites. Online auditions are a great option for people hoping to be trainees. Live auditions are great for the experience and opportunity, too, but don’t discount the possibility of getting discovered through an online audition."

      "title": "Be resilient—it can take a while to get accepted as a trainee!",
      "content": "Be resilient—it can take a while to get accepted as a trainee! A lot of people audition again and again before they finally get chosen to be a trainee. If you get feedback from an audition, make sure to incorporate those corrections in your next audition. For example, if a judge says that you need to work on your vocal strength, start seeing a vocal coach to work on that. Don’t worry if you’re older and still not a trainee. Lots of K-pop idols didn’t get started in a company until they were in their late teens. Keep working on your skills, attend auditions, and don’t give up."

      "title": "Read your contract carefully before committing to a company.",
      "content": "Read your contract carefully before committing to a company. Being a K-pop trainee is a long term commitment. Some companies, depending on your age, may even ask you to sign a 5-6 year-long contract. Read and review the contract’s contents very closely. If you don’t speak Korean, hire a professional lawyer who can review and walk you through the fine print. Many entertainment companies make you repay your salary if you break your contract. Some of them also will not make accommodations for emergencies or health issues. Don’t sign anything before you fully understand it."

      "title": "Work to overcome language barriers and make friends with other trainees.",
      "content": "Work to overcome language barriers and make friends with other trainees. Trainees often sign years-long contracts and spend upwards of 18 hours a day with the other trainees. If you don’t speak Korean or are unfamiliar with the culture, it may take a while before you make friends and feel like you fit in. Make an effort to try and communicate clearly with others, especially if there is a language barrier. Be kind to others and help each other while you’re adapting to trainee life.

      "content": "Take good care of your health throughout the rigorous training program. Many trainees work from 5 or 6 am until midnight or later. In addition to training, you may also have schoolwork that has to be done or might need extra practice on your own. [14] X Research source The company often sets the schedule for their trainees without running it by them first. Trainees generally don’t get the recommended amount of sleep every night, and they often don’t eat meals at regular intervals."

      "title": "Be prepared for monthly skill evaluations.",
      "content": "Be prepared for monthly skill evaluations. Because new trainees are often being brought into the company, everyone is evaluated on a monthly basis to ensure that the recruits are all up to standard. It can be a tense time every month, as the company could choose to let you go if you don’t perform well. [15] X Research source There are generally 20-30 other students at any company at any given time, so you are usually going to be in competition with your classmates to keep your place at the company."
