      "title": "Acquire good equipment.",
      "content": "Acquire good equipment. In order to practice volleyball, you need access to good equipment, including a comfortable outfit that allows a range of body motion, shoes specifically designed for volleyball, and a good quality volleyball. As well, you should have access to a volleyball net and court. Men, especially taller men, may need to opt for a basketball shoe instead of a volleyball shoe. In order to do some volleyball drills, it can be helpful to practice against a tall smooth wall or a basketball hoop."

      "title": "Practice the basic volleyball stance.",
      "content": "Practice the basic volleyball stance. When you play volleyball, you will assume a basic ready position. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and bend your knees. Make sure your body weight is more on the balls of your feet so that you are ready to move quickly. [1] X Research source Hold your arms loosely in front of you"

    {
      "title": "Practice shuffling your feet.",
      "content": "Practice shuffling your feet. Many volleyball moves require you to move quickly from side to side. Minimize the amount of movement (and the amount of energy required) by shuffling your feet side to side. Stand in the basic ready stance and move sideways in a straight line. Keep your body low to the ground. [2] X Research source Do not cross your feet over one another while shuffling. You might trip. Once you’ve got the hang of shuffling your feet, start integrating it into other drills, such as passing the ball to another player."

    {
      "title": "Learn how to serve the ball.",
      "content": "Learn how to serve the ball. Serving the ball is done from one back corner of the court. The ball is hit over the net. This puts the ball in motion in the game. To serve the ball, toss the ball straight up into the air with one hand. Bring your other arm up over your head to hit the middle of the ball. Make sure to fully extend your arm, and make contact with the ball when your arm is extended. It is also important to make sure the ball is in front of you when you make contact with it. Keep your arm moving downward in order to follow through with the hit. Your footwork is also very important here, as it can determine how hard you hit the ball, and if it even goes over the net. you can either start with the foot opposite of the hand you're hitting with, or on the same side as your hitting hand. If you start on the same side that you hit with, you will take another step, and lean on that opposite foot for leverage.If you start on the opposite foot you hit with, you will simply toss the ball, and lean in as you hit. You will need to see which works best for you, and also practice your timing. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Learn to pass the ball.",
      "content": "Learn to pass the ball. Stand in the basic ready position as the ball is moving downward. Position yourself just behind where the ball will land. The earlier you’re ready to hit the ball, the more time you have to make minor adjustments. Put your arms together in front of you with your elbows close together. Hold the back of your hand in the palm of your other hand and press your thumbs together. Don’t swing your arms; rather, move your shoulders to pass the ball. [4] X Research source Use the force of your core and lower body to power the ball in the right direction."
    },
    {
      "title": "Learn to set the ball.",
      "content": "Learn to set the ball. Setting the ball is a maneuver in which one player makes contact with the ball, setting it up for another player to spike the ball. Set the ball by raising your arms above your head. Touch all of your fingertips together and then pull your hands apart so there is just enough room for the volleyball. When the ball comes down over the net or is passed from another player on your team, get under the ball and bounce it up with your fingertips. [5] X Research source Do not touch the ball with your palms. A correct set uses only the fingertips of the thumbs, index fingers and middle fingers. Work up to properly setting the ball by first catching the ball in between your fingertips. Once you’ve mastered the ball settling into your hands smoothly and with balance, then work on springing the ball into the air with your fingertips."

      "title": "Learn to spike the ball.",
      "content": "Learn to spike the ball. Spiking the ball is a technique to hit the ball forcefully over the net so that the other team has a hard time recovering the ball. Spike the ball after another player on your team sets the ball. As the ball moves upward in the air, jump up to meet the ball at its highest point. Hit the top of the ball with the middle of your hand: this will give the ball a solid top-spin, sending it over the net. [6] X Research source Spiking the ball effectively requires good timing. If you jump too early or too late, you’ll miss hitting the ball at the best position. Practice spiking frequently to hone your timing."

      "title": "Develop a good sense of timing.",
      "content": "Develop a good sense of timing. Volleyball is a sport that demands keeping your eye on the ball at all times and knowing when to pass, spike or hit the ball over the net. Having a good sense of timing will strengthen your defense. Develop your sense of timing by practicing drills that emphasize timing, such as blocking the ball at the net. Blocking the ball will demand that you watch the ball carefully and keep your eye on other players’ movements."

      "title": "Practice with a basketball hoop.",
      "content": "Practice with a basketball hoop. A basketball hoop is a good partner for practicing techniques such as passing, setting and serving. Pass or set the ball towards the hoop. Stand at the foul line, or about 15 feet (5 m) away. Toss the ball into the air and pass or set the ball towards the hoop. Try making a basket with your passes. Serve the volleyball at the hoop. Start at the foul line, or about 15 feet (5 m) away. Aim for the square on the backboard. Try hitting the square 10 times in a row."

      "content": "Practice like you’re in a game. If you are able to practice on a volleyball court with a net and a partner, always practice like you’re playing in a game. For example, if you are working on passing the ball, have your partner send the ball over the net to you. If you are practicing spiking the ball, do so over the net. [8] X Research source"

Achieve high jumping with plyometrics, which are movements that are completed with a lot of force very quickly. [9] X Research source Measuring your current jump height will give you a good indication of how much you are improving. To measure your height: Ask someone to observe you. Jump up as high as you can next to a wall while reaching your arms upward. Have your observer mark on the wall how high you jumped and measure the height. You can also put a bit of chalk on your hands. As you jump up against a wall, extend your arm upward and touch the wall at the highest point you can reach. Measure that height."

At the same time, shrug your shoulders to help lift the weights. Land back down with both feet firmly balanced on the floor. Complete 3 sets of 25 repetitions every day. [11] X Research source When this weight becomes easy, increase your weights in 5-pound increments. Alternately, use a medicine ball instead of weights. Lift the ball above your head as you jump up.
