      "content": "Graduate from high school with courses in math and science. Although there are no high school course requirements for becoming an airline pilot, generally courses in math and science will be most helpful for your future career. Enroll in advanced placement classes if they are offered by your school. Consider taking part in extracurricular activities related to flying. In the UK, for instance, you could join the Air Training Corps (ATC), a volunteer-military youth organization for people under the age of 18."

      "content": "Earn a 4-year college degree to fly for a large commercial airline. A bachelor's degree or equivalent is required to become a pilot for a major airline. It's preferable to get a bachelor of science with an emphasis in aviation, but your degree doesn't necessarily have to be aviation related. [1] X Trustworthy Source US Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. government agency that collects and reports labor-related information Go to source Some regional airlines only require a 2-year degree. Certain colleges and universities, such as the University of North Dakota, offer flight training in concurrence with academic classes. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Obtain a first-class medical certificate. Make an appointment with a certified aviation medical examiner. A doctor will review your medical history and conduct a physical examination to ensure that you’re both physically and mentally capable of operating an airplane. Contrary to popular belief, you can still become a professional pilot if you wear glasses or contacts, as long as your vision is correctable to 20/20. [3] X Research source In the United States, you must visit the office of a certified Aviation Medical Examiner (AME).

      "content": "Enroll in an accredited flight school or training program to gain flight experience. Training generally comes in two forms: integrated and modular. Integrated training programs are more expensive, but allow you to complete your training more quickly—generally 14-18 months. Modular programs allow you to pay as you go and are better if you want to train part-time, potentially taking breaks between modules. [4] X Research source If you’re in the United States, completing classes at an FAA-approved flight school can reduce the amount of flight experience required for a pilot’s license."

      "content": "Consider military flight training for a subsidized option. Enrolling in flight school and acquiring the required number of flight hours can be an incredibly expensive process. If you enlist in the military, however, your flight training will be subsidized. The flip side, of course, is that you must agree to a multi-year commitment to the armed forces (10 years, in the United States). [5] X Trustworthy Source US Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. government agency that collects and reports labor-related information Go to source The Air Force, Navy , Army, and Coast Guard offer flight training if you are a U.S. citizen. Job prospects are generally good for those leaving the military to become an airline pilot."

These licenses are free to apply for, but you may need your instructor sign-off to prove your skills. [6] X Research source You can start taking flying lessons before you’ve applied for a student pilot certificate, but you’ll need one to operate a plane by yourself. A private pilot’s license, your next step, requires a certain amount of solo flying hours. You can often apply for a student pilot certificate at the same time as your medical certificate."

Those 40 hours must include a minimum of 10 hours flying solo, of which 5 must be a solo cross-country flight, and 20 hours with an instructor. The flight exam is administered by an FAA examiner and usually lasts 1-2 hours. You must provide your own plane for the exam.

You also need 40 hours of actual or simulated instrument flight experience to qualify. To prove your flight hours, your instructor will review your pilot logbook and set up an appointment with a dedicated pilot examiner. Then, you’ll be asked to plan a cross-country flight using instrument flight rules (which you may or may not actually fly), as well as an oral exam and flight test.

Check professional pilot websites where pilots share airline specific interview experiences. You may want to bring copies of records such as college transcripts, military records, and licenses to the interview.
