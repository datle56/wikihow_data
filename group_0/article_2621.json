Any type of canvas slip-on shoes work well, too, and you can buy these from any budget shoe store. You do not have to buy them new, and they can be off-brand.

      "content": "Get an emo makeover. Get an emo hairdo and apply lots of dark eyeliner and nail polish to achieve the emo look. Up until the mid-2000s, there was no real emo hairstyle, but these days, \"emo hair\" usually refers to a particular layered haircut in which long bangs are swept and styled to one side and held in place with mousse, hair gel, or pomade. You can keep the color the same, or you can dye your hair black and maybe even include a bright highlight of blonde or other punky colors, like highlighter pink or yellow. If you prefer to wear your hair short, grow out your bangs but continue to get clean-up cuts on the back of your neck for a “party up front, business in the back” look. If you wear your hair long, get layers in your hair on the sides and maintain the classic emo bangs. Use pencil eyeliner or liquid liner—whichever you’re comfortable with. Just make sure your liner is dark and dramatic! Consider getting piercings too. Snake bites and septum rings are very common piercings among the emo community."

      "content": "Learn about the origins of emo. To be emo, you need to understand emo. Contrary to mainstream belief, emo does not mean emotional. It stands for “emotive hardcore” and is a subgenre of hardcore punk and post-hardcore. [3] X Research source Emo emerged from the Washington, D.C., hardcore punk scene of the mid-’80s. [4] X Research source The first printed use of the term \"emo-core\" was first said to be used in Thrasher magazine. [5] X Research source It was used to describe bands who used a more confessional, self-questioning, and personal approach to lyrical themes as opposed to the confrontational and politically-charged themes of its parent genre. [6] X Research source Campbell, Michael. Popular Music in America:The Beat Goes On. Nelson Education, 2012. p. 360 Other facts about emocore include: The Beach Boys' 1966 album Pet Sounds was labeled \"the first emo album\" by Treblezine ’s Ernest Simpson. [7] X Research source Minor Threat fan Guy Picciotto despised the heightened violence in the hardcore punk scene, so he formed Rites of Spring, known as the first emo band, in 1984 to turn the focus back to the individual. To add to their legacy, they were only documented performing 15 times in 2 years before their disbandment in 1986. [8] X Research source In 1980, Ian Mackaye founded Dischord Records, which signed many Washington, D.C. hardcore punk bands and eventually signed Mackaye and Picciotto's iconic band Fugazi. Fugazi was not emo, drawing in elements of hardcore, funk, and jazz instead [9] X Research source Greenwald, A. (2003). Nothing Feels Good: Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo. New York: St. Martin's Griffin, p.17 , but they did inspire emo bands in the mid-’90s to abandon conventional hardcore roots. Minor Threat member Ian Mackaye formed the short-lived band Embrace in 1985. They followed the same characteristics of Rites of Spring. However, they hated being called “emo.” [10] X Research source Greenwald, A. (2003). Nothing Feels Good: Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo. New York: St. Martin's Griffin, p.14 Revolution Summer 1985 was a social movement in the D.C. hardcore punk scene. It was an attempt by bands like Gray Matter, Beefeater, Dag Nasty, and Soulside to break the limitations of hardcore punk to make way for creative musical innovations. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Know the subgenres of emo. Emo didn’t evolve as much as it grew offshoots and subgenres. The original emocore sound is still around, but as the decades went on, other bands who became part of the scene added and exchanged characteristics. That being said, if you're more into one emo style than another, it doesn't matter because it's still emo. Here are the subgenres of emo: Emocore: short for emotive hardcore, the original style of emo which grew from the Washington D.C hardcore punk scene in the mid-80s with Rites of Spring and Embrace. Other bands followed suit such as Gray Matter and Fire Party, who was termed \"the world's first female-fronted emo band\". [12] X Research source Greenwald, A. (2003).

New York: St. Martin's Griffin, p.14 Post-emo indie rock/Midwest emo: Emo was reinvented in the ’90s, becoming more melodic and mixed with indie rock to create a softer sound. A perfect example of this sound is Sunny Day Real Estate's 1994 album Diary . Midwest emo was popular enough to form a small subculture surrounding the genre, and was more romantic than emo had ever been. [13] X Research source Greenwald, A. (2003). Nothing Feels Good: Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo. New York: St. Martin's Griffin, p.35 Emo pop: Emo-pop is a fusion genre of emo and pop-punk.

[14] X Research source Pioneers include The Get Up Kids, The Promise Ring, and Jimmy Eat World, whose single The Middle broke into the mainstream in the ’00s. Screamo: Screamo is a misunderstood genre originating from San Diego in 1991 with bands like Heroin and Antioch Arrow.

Generally speaking, all emo music has 2 things in common: big, sweeping, extremely melodramatic guitar-based music (either aggressive and harsh or acoustic and gentle), and confessional or personal lyrics, often about heartbreak and loneliness. Beyond that, lots of emo bands might sound wildly different: The Used doesn't sound much like Death Cab for Cutie which doesn't sound anything like Jawbreaker. But they're all emo bands. Pick the sounds you like and don't listen to what you don't like. If you want to dress emo and listen to Sunny Day Real Estate, go for it. If you also have Lady Gaga, Johnny Cash, and Cannibal Ox on your Spotify Weekly, that doesn't make you any less emo. A real \"emo\" is someone who listens to emotive hardcore music and genres surrounding it, so as long as you're into emo, you are emo. While a guy with dark hair and eyeliner listening to Dashboard Confessional in Columbus, Ohio might be considered emo by a lot of people, the California blonde who surfs and listens to Dashboard Confessional might consider herself emo as well."
