      "content": "Write the problem down. Getting the problem down in concrete language helps to clarify and simplify your issue. [1] X Research source This can make it seems more manageable and move you forward on dealing with the problem head-on. Additionally, simplification of the language you use can serve to reduce reactions such as being overwhelmed by the complexity of an issue. [2] X Research source One example of a possible problem is that you procrastinate (wait until the last minute) on important tasks. Write down what your specific issue is that you need resolved. Define the problem in the simplest terms possible. If procrastination is the issue, simply write down procrastination instead of, “I always wait until the last minute to complete projects and this is stressful.”"

      "title": "Make sure the problem needs fixing.",
      "content": "Make sure the problem needs fixing. [3] X Research source Have you ever heard the saying, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it?” This mantra also applies to identifying problems. Sometimes we can be quick to judge and identify problems when there aren’t any. For example, if you think procrastination is the issue, are there also ways that it is not a problem? Is it possible that it does not create stress and helps you focus on getting your work done (some people need the pressure to work)? Is it possible that others may not like that you procrastinate, but it doesn’t hurt anyone and doesn’t seem to affect you getting your work done? Thus, if the problem does not seem to have identifiable consequences, it might not be a top priority problem, or may not be a problem at all. In other words, perhaps you think you procrastinate but you don't."

      "title": "Create a pros and cons list for solving your problem.",
      "content": "Create a pros and cons list for solving your problem. Identifying the pros and cons of solving a problem can help you identify whether the problem is worth fixing, or if it is a high priority issue. A cost-benefit analysis involves identifying the positives of solving the problem, as well as the negatives of not solving the problem. [4] X Research source Write down what will happen if the problem is not resolved. In the example of procrastination, the consequences might be that others may continue to comment on your procrastination, you may have difficulty prioritizing tasks, you may have increases in stress, and your work quality may suffer if you don't give yourself enough time to complete a project. Write down and recognize the benefits of solving the problem. For example, the benefits of solving procrastination might be: less stress at the last minute, quality of work will increase due to more time, will have more time to complete work, and bosses and coworkers will be less concerned about the procrastination. If you identify that there are many benefits to solving the problem, then it is probably worth solving and may be a high priority issue."

      "title": "Identify all of the components of the issue.",
      "content": "Identify all of the components of the issue. Learn to be comprehensive. Identify the components of the problem in their entirety. Include the people involved, the content, and the context. Write down everything you know about the problem and all of the components that you think contribute to the problem. Pertaining to procrastination, this list might look like: distractions such as television/internet, avoidance of tasks that take a long time, scheduling problems (not enough time), and low frustration tolerance. These issues could be associated with organizational skills. Try creating a problem tree with your main issue on the trunk of the tree, and the associated components on the branches of the tree. This way can you visualize what your problem looks like and how the other issues contribute to the main problem."
    },
    {
      "title": "Focus on one problem at a time.",
      "content": "Focus on one problem at a time. In defining your issue, make sure it is specific. [5] X Research source Sometimes one problem can have many components, so it is important to focus on a specific and detailed problem before attempting to solve the big picture issue. For example, procrastination could be a small part of the bigger problem that your work quality is suffering and your boss wants you to make fewer mistakes. Instead of trying to combat the issue of work quality (which could be very complex), you would identify all of the components that contribute to the issue and work on each component separately as its own issue. One way to understand this is to make a graphic representation or “problem/solution tree” of the bigger issue versus the smaller issues. You would place the bigger issue in the center (organizational issues with affect work quality), and the components of the issue would branch out from the center. [6] X Research source Components contributing to the bigger issue might be things like: getting enough sleep, paying close attention, managing time, and procrastination. Notice that procrastination is just one component of the big picture issue of work quality and/or organizational issues."

      "content": "Write down your goals. In order to begin to solve a problem you need to understand what final result you want. Ask yourself, “What do I want to accomplish by solving this issue?” [7] X Research source Make your goals specific, realistic, and time-limited. In other words, give yourself a specific amount of time that you need to accomplish the goal or solve the problem. Some goals may take 1 week while others will take 6 months. For example, if your goal is solved your issue of procrastination, this might be a very long-term goal since some habits can be deeply ingrained and difficult to break. However, you can make the goal smaller, more realistic, and time-limited by saying, “I want to get at least 1 project done 1 day before it is due in the next 2 weeks.” This goal is specific (1 project done ahead of time), realistic (1 project instead of every project), and time-limited (in the next two weeks)."

[9] X Research source Compile a list of all possible solutions. Write down every way to solve the problem you can think of. In the example of procrastination, your list might involve: keeping a strict schedule, prioritizing tasks, writing daily reminders of important tasks, making realistic evaluations of time needed to complete projects, getting help when needed, and beginning a task at least one day earlier than needed. These are organizational and time management skills that can be learned. There will most likely be many ways to work toward solving the issue. You may also identify other behaviors that reduce the likelihood of procrastination such as: getting adequate sleep, exercising to cope with stress, and eating a healthy diet (to increase and maintain overall health)."

      "content": "Think about the problem abstractly. Thinking of the problem or question in a different way can open new paths in your brain. Your mind can have a new starting point to track in your memory or make connections within your brain. [10] X Research source Try to think more broadly or abstractly about the issue. For example, if the issue is procrastination, another way you can think about it that perhaps you need stress in order to get things done. In this line of thinking, you will need to solve the problem of needing stress to perform instead of the procrastination itself. Consider philosophical, religious, cultural, and components of your issue."

Try doing free writing or brainstorming in order to generate new ideas. Simply write down everything you think of in regards to possible solutions to the issue. Analyze your list and consider some of the options that you may not normally consider or that you think won’t work. Consider alternative views that you normally wouldn’t. Entertain outlandish suggestions from others and at least consider them as options. [11] X Research source For example, if procrastination is a constant struggle, perhaps making someone else do your work for you might solve your issue. This may sound silly, but even the most outlandish ideas can have a grain of truth in them. For this idea, perhaps asking for help on difficult tasks is not something you considered because getting assistance seems impractical. However, getting help can be very helpful indeed. Do not set limits. Look at the absurd. The answer may go against convention. Take risks. Open-mindedness can be associated with taking appropriate risks, and learning from your mistakes.

For example, a very helpful solution to procrastination might be keeping a strict schedule, while getting more sleep at night will have less of an overall effect on the issue. Thus, the most helpful solutions will directly affect or target the problem. Once you have developed your ratings, write them down from 1-10 on paper or the computer. This way you can refer back to it once you have implemented your choice solution. If your first solution does not work, you can revisit the list and try your second solution and so on. You can also apply several solutions at once (instead of one at a time)."

However, research implies that we may tend to underestimate how much other people are willing to assist us. It is important to not let your own fear of not being helped prevent you from asking for assistance when you really need it. If you cannot decide on a solution, or you are simply unfamiliar with the territory, it might be helpful to get input from others that have solved a similar issue. [15] X Research source Talk to a friend who shares the issue or has solved the issue in the past. If the problem is work-related, discuss it with a co-worker whom you trust if they have experience dealing with your problem. If the problem is personal, have a conversation with a family member or partner who knows you particularly well. Get professional help from someone who is an expert in solving the problem you have."
