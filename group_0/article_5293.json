      "title": "Measure the width of one tread with a tape measure.",
      "content": "Measure the width of one tread with a tape measure. The tread of a stair is the horizontal part of the stair on which you step. With a tape measure , measure from one side of the stair tread to the other side. Then, add about 2 in (5.1 cm) to account for any uneven spaces or mistakes. [1] X Research source Standard treads are usually about 3 ft (0.91 m) wide. So, if the stair width is exactly 36 in (91 cm), with the added inches, the stair width would be 38 in (97 cm). If your stairs have a railing on one or both sides, account for the extra carpeting needed to fit through the railing and around to the bottom of each stair—usually an extra 2 in (5.1 cm) per side. If you plan to only install a carpet runner down the center of your stairway, measure the width of the area that you plan to cover. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Measure vertically across the tread and riser of one stair.",
      "content": "Measure vertically across the tread and riser of one stair. Set your tape measure at the back edge of the tread and measure the tread from front to back. Then bend the tape measure down at a 90° angle and continue measuring in the same direction down the riser, or the vertical board that elevates the stairs. Add an extra 2 in (5.1 cm) to this measurement as well, and write this measurement down. [3] X Research source The average tread depth is about 10–11 in (25–28 cm) and the average riser height is about 6 in (15 cm). If your tread and riser measured 16 in (41 cm), you’d write down 18 in (46 cm). It’s a good idea to measure more than one stair, and even different points of the same stair, to make sure they’re all the same size."

      "title": "Account for any overhang if your stairs have one.",
      "content": "Account for any overhang if your stairs have one. If the tread has an overhang that goes beyond the riser (known as a nosing), measure back to the riser itself under the overhang and then down to the bottom. You’ll use the total measurement to calculate the height of each stair. Alternately, you can add about 2 in (5.1 cm) to the depth measurement to account for this overhang. In the case of our example, this would make our length measurement 20 in (51 cm)."

      "content": "Measure the length and width of any landings separately from the stairs. Measuring the carpet for landings is straightforward: just write down the length and width of the landing. While you’re measuring the width of the landing, bend the tape measure and measure the height of the riser directly beneath it. A common landing size would measure something like 4 ft × 5 ft (1.2 m × 1.5 m). [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Measure the widest length and depth of irregular or bullnose stairs.",
      "content": "Measure the widest length and depth of irregular or bullnose stairs. If your staircase has winders—irregular-shaped steps that go around a curve or corner—measure those separately. Find where the step is the widest and deepest and take those measurements, then write them down. [5] X Research source If you have a bullnose stair—a larger stair with curved edges at the bottom of your staircase—measure the width across the widest point. If your stairs flare out so they’re wider at the bottom, measure each stair from the bottom individually until you’re sure the remaining stairs have the same dimensions. There will be some excess carpet left over from winders or bullnoses, but that’s okay—it’s better than not having enough."

      "content": "Multiply the measurements to find the square footage of 1 step. Multiplying the rounded length and width measurements will yield the square footage of a step. The square footage—also called the area—of a step will give you the number of square feet (or meters) that you’ll need to cover with carpet. [6] X Research source The area of the stairs in our example above would be 38 in (97 cm) times 20 in (51 cm). That works out to 760 sq in (4,900 cm 2 ), or 5.28 sq ft (0.491 m 2 )."

Residential remodeling expert Josh Goldenberg says, “To calculate how much carpet you’ll need for stairs, multiply the number of stairs you have by the width and height of each individual stair.” If you measured by inches, he says to “divide that answer by 12 to get feet. This is how much square footage you’ll need for the stairs portion.” If there are 8 steps on our staircase, that would be 6,080 sq in (39,200 cm 2 ) or 42.22 sq ft (3.922 m 2 )."

This will give you the total area of the landing (and the riser just below it). Add this number to the total area of the stairs to calculate the total surface you’ll need to purchase carpet for. [7] X Research source In our example, the landing measures 4 ft × 5 ft (1.2 m × 1.5 m). Multiply these dimensions to calculate the amount of carpet you’ll need to cover the landing: 20 sq ft (1.9 m 2 ). If you add that to the carpet needed for the stairs, you’ll need a total of 62.22 sq ft (5.780 m 2 ) of carpet for your staircase and landing."

      "content": "Add 10% extra to avoid running out of carpeting. Mistakes can happen while carpet is being installed, and it’s always better to have too much carpeting than too little. So, when you’re ordering, add in an extra 10% of the total to make sure that you’ll have enough carpeting to compensate for any errors or uneven measurements. [8] X Research source In our example, the total stair surface area came to 62.22 sq ft (5.780 m 2 ). Adding an extra 10% to this estimate gives us a final figure of: 68.44 sq ft (6.358 m 2 ). Getting this measurement can be helpful when you’re trying to determine a budget for your carpeting—it will give you a general idea of how much carpet you’ll need. But because the nap of the carpet and the seams have to be calculated carefully for stairs, this won’t tell you exactly how much carpet to buy—you’ll need to use the next section for that."

      "title": "Divide 12 ft (3.7 m) by the width of your stairs.",
      "content": "Divide 12 ft (3.7 m) by the width of your stairs. A standard roll of carpet is sold in 12 ft (3.7 m) widths. Divide that by the width of your stairs to determine how many stair widths you can get from a single strip of carpet. Be sure to use your rounded-up measurement. [9] X Research source In our example above, the carpet for the stairs was 38 in (97 cm) wide. When we divide that into 12 ft (3.7 m), we get 3.78—so you’ll get 3 stair widths out of every strip of carpet. It’s okay if there’s a little left over. It’s more important that the seams and pile line up correctly than it is to use every inch of carpet. The width of the carpet roll should always be calculated along the width of the carpet roll. This will ensure that the pile of the carpet goes the right way down the stairs—lifting up when you’re going up the stairs and laying flat when you’re coming down."

      "content": "Use the depth of the stairs to determine the length of each carpet strip. The depth of the stairs is the number we got from measuring the height of the riser, the depth of the tread, any overhang, and a little extra as an allowance. This will tell you how far into the carpet roll you’ll need to go to cover a single stair. [10] X Research source In our example, the depth was 20 in (51 cm). So based on our calculations, every 20 in (51 cm) by 12 ft (3.7 m) will cover 3 stairs."

      "title": "Determine how much carpet you’ll need to cover all of the stairs.",
      "content": "Determine how much carpet you’ll need to cover all of the stairs. It’s usually easier to draw this out—sketch out a block of carpet, then draw blocks representing each of the stairs. Keep adding rows until you have enough blocks to cover all of the stairs. [11] X Research source In our example, we can fit 3 stairs on each width of carpet and we need 8 total stairs, so we’d need 3 rows (3 on the first two rows and 2 on the third)."

      "title": "Add in blocks for any landings or odd stairs.",
      "content": "Add in blocks for any landings or odd stairs. Check your measurements sheet and add in anything that you need to carpet that isn’t already covered by the stair blocks. If you need to, you can rearrange the stair blocks to make the landings fit more efficiently. [12] X Research source If we move one of our stair blocks up to a fourth row, we’ll be able to fit in the landing block and have a total carpet area of 144 in (370 cm) wide and 80 in (200 cm) long. This works out to about 80 sq ft (7.4 m 2 ). This is a bit more than our estimate above because the estimate didn't account for wasted carpet at the end of the roll. This will give you more traction climbing up the stairs and make it easier to come down the stairs. It will also be easier to sweep dust and dirt toward the bottom of the stairs."

Look at how each of these fit into your budget, as well as which options are best for a busy staircase. Material: Wool and nylon carpets tend to be more expensive and more durable than polyester. [13] X Research source But because they’re easier to clean, nylon and polyester may be more suited to high-traffic areas like a staircase. Pile: Carpet with a longer pile will feel more plush but may cost more. But for safety reasons, a lower-pile carpet is usually recommended for stairs. [14] X Research source Twist: Carpet with tightly-twisted fibers will cost more but will also last longer. A tighter twist may also be a better option for stairs."

      "content": "What direction should the pile go on stairs? The pile should face up when you’re going up the stairs. Position the carpet on the stairs so the carpet fibers feel smooth when you run you hand from the back of the tread to the front, and the carpet fibers lift up when you run your hand from the front of the tread to the back. [15] X Research source The carpet pile refers to the direction the fibers lay."

      "content": "What’s the biggest mistake to avoid when measuring carpet for stairs? The biggest mistake you can make when you’re measuring for carpet is to just guess at the measurements. Double-check your measurements—measure the width and depth of multiple steps to make sure they’re all a consistent size. Also, be sure to include your landings and winders, and account for any doorways, bannisters, or alcoves. [16] X Research source It’s a good idea to hire a professional to install the carpet on your stairs. If you’re having the work done professionally, they’ll be able to calculate the carpet you’ll need, minimize waste, and give you a cost estimate."

      "content": "How do you estimate the cost of carpet for stairs? Multiple the area of the carpet by the price per foot or yard to determine your cost. When you’re figuring your initial budget, you can use a rough estimate of the carpet’s area for a general idea of how much your carpet will cost. But when you’re getting ready to purchase, use more precise calculations to determine how much your carpet will cost. The type of carpet will affect the price, as well as installation costs and where you shop."
