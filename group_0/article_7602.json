      "content": "Remove decorations one at a time. You may be in a hurry to get your tank looking fresh, but never clean all of your decorations at once. Decorations are home to helpful bacteria that keep your fish healthy. Removing them all at once can upset the balance of your aquarium. [1] X Research source Removing all of the decorations at once is stressful for your fish. Keep your fish in the tank. There’s no need to remove them when cleaning parts of the tank. Wash your hands with warm water and soap before you reach into the fish tank. Make sure you’ve rinsed all of the soap off your hands. Soap is terrible for fish and can kill them."

      "content": "Move live plants to one corner of the tank. If you keep live plants in your tank, you don’t need to remove them. Plants naturally keep themselves clean. Simply move them to one corner of the tank so you can see and clean everything else. You can replace the old live plants with new ones if you want to change your aquarium’s look. Live plants are an excellent way to help enhance the health of an aquarium, since they work as a natural filter."

      "title": "Vacuum gravel from the bottom of the tank.",
      "content": "Vacuum gravel from the bottom of the tank. Gravel is the most common decoration, and can become covered in algae over time. If you want to spruce it up, use a special gravel vacuum. The gravel vacuum will suck up water and gravel when you stick it into the gravel. As the gravel gets sucked into the tube, the pressure will tumble the gravel and clean it. The gravel will then fall back out of the vacuum to the bottom of the tank. This will remove some dirty water from the tank. You will need to replace it with dechlorinated water when you are done cleaning the decorations."

[2] X Research source Your solution should be 5% bleach and 95% water. A handy recipe to use is 4 teaspoons of bleach to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water.

It may irritate or dry out your skin. Never use tap water or chemicals as it will stay inside the ornament and get in the fish's gill which could lead to death."
