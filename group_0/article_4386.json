      "content": "Start your run up from the same point every time. Count the number of steps you are taking as you approach the crease. Make sure you are consistent to solidify your muscle memory for your delivery. [1] X Research source Practice several deliveries to determine your natural starting position. Mark this spot on the pitch. Measure the distance of your starting location to the crease or foul line. Mark this spot on both ends of the field before you play each match."

      "title": "Get a good final bound.",
      "content": "Get a good final bound. Body position and jump height will vary from person to person. As you practice your run-up, determine what bound feels most natural to achieve the proper foot placement for your delivery. Jump toward the batsman to gain momentum. [2] X Research source A high bound can disrupt your momentum and slow your bowling speed. Having no bound will give you less power to deliver the ball. Practice a moderate jump to optimize your form before delivery."

      "title": "Land your leading foot in the same location each time you bowl.",
      "content": "Land your leading foot in the same location each time you bowl. Point your toe toward the batter as your hips swivel around. Although the hand position and spin may vary on each delivery, your body mechanics and placement should be consistent. Practice landing in the same spot to prevent being called for no balls. If you land on your back foot, aim to keep your weight in your toes. Then, transfer your weight to your leading foot as quickly as possible."

      "title": "Practice your run-up to solidify your technique.",
      "content": "Practice your run-up to solidify your technique. After you have determined the optimum distance, bound height, and foot placement for your delivery, practice over and over so you don't have to think about these items during matches. Let your muscle memory guide your body, and the speed of delivery will come as a natural result. [3] X Research source Run in as you normally would—like an athlete! Aim to gain momentum as you run up."

      "content": "Record a video of your bowling delivery to analyze. It is much easier to evaluate and understand how you are bowling if you can watch yourself. [4] X Research source Set up a cell phone or video recorder to record your delivery. Bowl several deliveries to get a good measure of your form. Watch your recording to determine what aspects of the delivery need to be adjusted."

      "title": "Maintain a fixed elbow flexion during delivery.",
      "content": "Maintain a fixed elbow flexion during delivery. Proper arm placement is important in generating faster ball speeds. Avoid using a straight-arm delivery and you'll have better results achieving high bowling speeds. Follow through after you’ve bowled the ball. [5] X Research source Keep your non-bowling arm outstretched before bringing it into your body. Imagine you are going to grab the batsman and pull them toward you to help gain speed."

    {
      "title": "Use your whole body to generate momentum.",
      "content": "Use your whole body to generate momentum. Bowling speed comes from more than just your arm. Make sure your whole body is involved in the delivery of the ball to achieve maximum bowling velocity. [6] X Research source Land your front foot at the same spot relative to the crease each time. Rotate your upper body using your hips to propel you forward. Swing your non-bowling arm to whip your bowling arm forward."

      "title": "Snap your wrist at delivery.",

Bowl over and over to solidify your muscle memory."

    {
      "title": "Work on perfecting different types of fast deliveries.",
      "content": "Work on perfecting different types of fast deliveries. Fast bowlers employ several specific deliveries in their arsenal with different ball or hand positions for each. Keep opposing batters on their toes by practicing different deliveries. Use different grips and spins to achieve variation in your delivery: Practice dragging your fingers along the side of the ball as you deliver it to create spin and cause the ball to cut left or right after the bounce. Try to bowl the ball with little to no spin and perfect the delivery of a yorker . Aim for the batter’s feet and release the ball early. Position the seam of the ball vertically in your hand so the ball bounces off the seam and veers to the side after the bounce."
