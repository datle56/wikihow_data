For example: sudo /etc/init.d/networking stop stops the network service, and sudo adduser adds a new user to the system. Both of these tasks require root access. You will be prompted to enter your password before sudo runs the command. Linux stores your password for 15 minutes, so you won’t have to keep typing it."
