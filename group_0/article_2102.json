Basically, you want to be well put together to attract an older guy. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Act mature . Depending on how old the guy is, he may have completely different social habits than you. If you're in your 20s, and you're after a guy in his 30s, he may not be as interested in going out drinking as you are. [9] X Research source You don't have to change who you are to attract an older guy, but you should make sure the two of you are a good fit. An older guy is likely to be more set in his ways, but that doesn't mean you have to follow suit. You can still go out with your friends, but don't leave a string of drunken messages on his phone."

      "content": "Avoid pointing out the age gap. Getting over the age gap may be one of the harder aspects of dating an older guy. Avoid making references about his age, and if you bring your friends around, make sure they do the same. [10] X Research source An age gap between partners can make it harder to connect. He probably has different hobbies, and different tastes, than you do. Try to connect with him on these things. Listen to music he likes, but also try to expose him to things you like. Don't force him to behave like a younger man, but try to involve him in your hobbies and interests."

      "title": "Don't play games.",
      "content": "Don't play games. It doesn't matter how old someone is, nobody likes manipulation. Don't try to make an older man jealous to get his attention, and don't play head games to make him want you. One reason an older man might hesitate to date a younger woman is the fear of being toyed with. Approach an older guy with confidence and be direct. If you like him, say so. Don't assume that because a man is older, he's mature and ready to settle down. Some older men may want to take advantage of younger women to make themselves feel younger. Just as you don't want to play games with an older man, don't let an older man play games with you."

[11] X Research source Don't ask him how much money he makes, or what kind of car he drives. If he gets the feeling that you're only with him for his money, he's likely to end things.

It's important to know how you will fit into each other's life. [12] X Research source If he already has kids, for example, he may not be interested in starting a whole new family with you. If you don't want kids, this may be fine with you. But, if you do want kids, this could mean trouble down the road. Don't sacrifice your own goals to be with someone who is already starting to settle down. Or, if his plans are to start traveling the world, and you're still finishing up college, don't drop everything just to be with him. [13] X Research source"

Think about the type of people you regularly hang out with. How will they react to you dating an older man? [16] X Research source Your friends shouldn't dictate who you date, especially if you care for the person. However, you should consider how your partner will get along with your friends.
