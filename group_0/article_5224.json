      "content": "Follow these general rules when you buy online not only through eBay but also any other website. [1] X Research source Check the website address (URL) to make sure you are on the correct website. Connect to the Internet safely. Try to use a wired connection to connect to the Internet directly instead of using a wireless connection at public places such as a Starbucks that can be hacked more easily. Install an anti-virus program. It is best to use a software with live monitoring so it will protect you from viruses in real-time while you are browsing the Internet. Never allow websites such as eBay to save your payment details. Not allowing your computer system or websites to store your payment details helps keep your payment information confidential. Log out after you have completed your transaction. Otherwise, someone could use the same computer that you were using to buy products and have them billed to your account. This rule is especially important when using a public computer that is accessed by multiple users."
