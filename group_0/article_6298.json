They come in two basic types, 1-door and 2-door. 1-Door traps are simpler and afford for better bait placement, but 2-door traps have a higher catch rate due to the fact that the animal can see through both sides and enter through either.

      "title": "Place your bait.",
      "content": "Place your bait. You'll need to use a bait that the chipmunks can't steal without going into the trap. Peanut butter works well, as does any sort of nut that is larger than the holes in the mesh of the trap. Place the bait on the trigger inside the trap, either at the opposite end of the door on a 1-door trap or in the middle of a 2-door trap."

      "title": "Set your trap.",
      "content": "Set your trap. The trap you bought will have come with its own instructions on how to properly set it. It usually involves the careful balancing of rods and locks. After you've set your trap, you'll want to test it by lightly pressing on the trigger plate. If it doesn't go off, consult the instructions and try again. After your trap is set, avoid walking close to the trap or disturbing it in any way, as many traps can be quite sensitive."

      "content": "Catch a chipmunk. Check your trap often and regularly. Once you've caught a chipmunk. Handle the trap with care. Wear gloves to avoid being bitten through the mesh. Check your local laws before releasing your chipmunk outside of your property. [3] X Research source After releasing the chipmunk, disinfect the trap before using it again. Use a disinfectant spray and a cloth to clean the trap."

      "title": "Gather your materials.",
      "content": "Gather your materials. For a bucket trap, you'll need a large plastic bucket, something that will work as a ramp, a flat piece of wood that will work as a trigger, and a thin stick to hold the trigger. You'll also need some bait, such as birdseed. For the ramp, find something long, flat, and sturdy, like a piece of wood. Something around one to two feet long will work. For the trigger, you'll need a piece of wood no longer than the diameter of the bucket."

Then place the trigger on the bucket, with one end resting on the edge of the bucket, and the other end hanging over the stick in the middle. Then, adjust the stick and trigger so that the slightest amount of pressure on the end of the trigger will cause it to tip over. [4] X Research source It's okay if it's not perfectly balanced. Just use your best judgment to determine whether the weight of a chipmunk on the unsecured end of the trigger will cause the trigger to tip over."

      "content": "Place the ramp. Take the longer piece of wood or other material you're using as a ramp and lay it so that one end rests on the bucket, near the top. It should sit on one of the outer lips of the bucket, as close to the trigger as possible without disturbing the trigger."

      "title": "Place the bait and then wait.",
      "content": "Place the bait and then wait. Put some of your bait at the entrance of the ramp, and even more bait on the unstable end of the trigger. You may need to adjust the trigger and the stick more if the bait causes the trigger to tip over. Then all you have to do is wait for a chipmunk to fall for your trap. Check it regularly throughout the day. [5] X Research source Optionally, you can place a trail of bait up the ramp as well. Use peanut butter to make the bait stick to the ramp without sliding down."

Wait patiently and quietly for a chipmunk to come jump in the trap to have a feast. Then release the box. What will happen is he will probably try to jump out of the hole and escape, but because of all the bird food under him, he won't be able to jump because there is no support, and he'll be trapped."
