      "content": "Be sincere and include a return envelope to get a response. Briefly introduce yourself and explain how Morgan has impacted you. Whether he inspired you to pursue a music career or start volunteering in your community, get specific about what you love about him. Finish off with a polite request to return your letter, send an autograph , or answer one of your burning questions. [2] X Research source When writing fan mail , use conversational language to showcase your personality. To make your letter stand out (and increase the likelihood of it being read), put it in a brightly-colored envelope or decorate the outside with stamps and stickers. Be genuine and specific to make your letter more meaningful. For example, instead of saying, “You're so amazing,” you could say, “I watched every episode with you on The Voice and it inspired me to audition for the show.” If you’re requesting an autograph from Morgan, send your photo in a properly stamped and self-addressed envelope. It typically takes 3+ months for a response, so try your best to be patient. [3] X Research source"
