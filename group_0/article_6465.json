      "title": "“Champagne Problems” is about college sweethearts who break up after a rejected marriage proposal.",
      "content": "“Champagne Problems” is about college sweethearts who break up after a rejected marriage proposal. In the printed booklet that accompanies the evermore album, Taylor Swift herself describes the story as “one where longtime college sweethearts had very different plans for the same night, one to end it and one who brought a ring.” [1] X Research source The man proposes to the woman and she says no, leading to his heartbreak ( Your heart was glass, I dropped it) and the shock of all their friends and family ( Your sister splashed out on the bottle / Now no one's celebrating…No crowd of friends applauded) . [2] X Research source Throughout the rest of the song, which is stylized as “champagne problems,” the woman tells her own feelings of pain and guilt over rejecting her former lover. She explains how she left her could-be fiancé speechless , but she couldn’t give a reason and never was ready, so [she] watches [him] go. Swift details the fallout of this ended relationship, including the consequence of their college friend group having to distance themselves or choose sides in the situation ( How evergreen, our group of friends / Don’t think we’ll say that word again ). The first-person narrator also continuously paints herself as the problem in their relationship, ending the song by promising her college sweetheart that he’ll find the right person for him and forget about her: You’ll find the real thing instead / She’ll patch up your tapestry that I shred…You won’t remember all my / Champagne problems. “Champagne Problems” is a notoriously sad song. In an interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music, Swift herself said that she “love[s] a sad song” and names “‘champagne problems’ as one of [her] favorite bridges to write,” despite its melancholy feel.

      "title": "The title of the song is a play on the phrase “champagne problems.”",
      "content": "The title of the song is a play on the phrase “champagne problems.” Before its connection to Taylor, the expression “champagne problems” had a similar meaning to “first world problems,” aka problems that seem trivial compared to other, larger issues in the world. In the context of the song, Swift seems to be using this phrase to convey that the female narrator’s problems are not perceived as all that serious—and even the narrator herself alludes to her heartbreak and the loss of her friends and partner as “champagne problems.” [4] X Research source This perspective likely comes from the idea that everyone would be expected to want a romantic proposal from their high-society college sweetheart ( Because I dropped your hand while dancing / Left you out there standing / Crestfallen on the landing ). Our narrator doesn’t want that life or this man, but the heartbreak she’s left in her wake and the pain she’s feeling are seen as “champagne problems” because a proposal from this person is nothing to complain about—the people in her life even describe her f—cked in the head . The song may also be alluding to the potential fiancé thinking that the woman’s problems are “champagne problems.” Since the song ends with You won’t remember all my / Champagne problems , Swift seems to be saying that the champagne problems belong entirely to the woman narrator—or at least that’s how she felt. These champagne problems may be mental health issues ( “This dorm was once a madhouse” / I made a joke, “Well, it’s made for me” ) or just an inability (or lack of desire) to commit to this man: Sometimes you just don’t know the answer / ‘Til someone’s on their knees and asks you. In another interpretation, the “champagne problems” is a literal reference to the bottle of champagne that the man in the song proposed with ( Dom Pérignon, you brought it) and how the champagne is now a physical reminder of his heartbreak at the moment he was meant to be celebrating—a literal champagne problem."

      "title": "The song may also comment on Swift’s real-life privilege and fame.",
      "content": "The song may also comment on Swift’s real-life privilege and fame. The use of the phrase “champagne problems” hints at a discussion on privilege, self-awareness, and how we get to decide the extent to which other peoples’ suffering matters. In a move that could be considered extremely self-aware, Swift may be winkingly acknowledging her own privilege and the fact that many of her personal issues—amidst her wealth, status, and fame—would be considered “champagne problems.” After all, Swift has been constantly criticized throughout her career for her alleged focus on silly heartbreak songs or songs about boys. Despite the pain in these songs and their proven ability to connect with so many people, the majority male music critic landscape has often ridiculed and infantilized these themes as insignificant (or “champagne”) problems. [5] X Research source Ironically, there’s an argument that most music critics (straight, white males with stable incomes) have more privilege and “first-world problems” than practically anyone else. Ultimately, this interpretation of the song would pose a question to the listeners—how does the song’s narrator (and Swift) reckon with their very real problems, knowing that everyone else views them as silly and meaningless? Similarly, who gets to decide which problems we count as worthy and which we consider frivolous? Swift doesn’t give us an answer, so it’s up to her fans (meaning you!) to decide."

      "content": "In Verse 1, Swift describes the heartbreak felt by the dumped boyfriend. She opens “champagne problems” with the aftermath of the failed proposal, writing, You booked the night train for a reason / So you could sit there in this hurt / Bustling crowds or silent sleepers / You’re not sure which is worse. In this image, we envision the distraught and heartbroken boyfriend sitting alone on the train after his college sweetheart has turned down his marriage proposal. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "In Chorus 1, Swift flashes back to the moment of rejection.",
      "content": "In Chorus 1, Swift flashes back to the moment of rejection. Moving into the first chorus, Swift writes, Because I dropped your hand while dancing / Left you out there standing / Crestfallen on the landing / Champagne problems. With these lines, Swift is not only beginning to tell us why the man on the train is feeling hurt, but she also solidifies the setting of this story—an upper-class society of ballrooms, gowns, and large mansions with landings where people can be poetically crestfallen. [7] X Research source The line I dropped your hand while dancing is the first clue to the reader that the woman is rejecting the man and realizing they’re not meant to be together. Then, Swift continues the chorus with Your mom’s ring in your pocket / My picture in your wallet / Your heart was glass, I dropped it / Champagne problems. With this second half of the chorus, it’s now clear to readers that this rejection came after a marriage proposal ( Your mom’s ring in your pocket) . This chorus is also the first time listeners hear “champagne problems” in the song, and it’s repeated twice—with two different seeming implications. The first “champagne problems” is after the man has his hand dropped while dancing—not the end of the world, right? The second refrain, however, comes after a metaphorical shattered heart and rejected engagement—a pretty real, un-champagne problem from pretty much any perspective."

      "content": "In Verse 2, Swift details the family’s reaction to the rejection. Now that we know this song is all about a rejected marriage proposal, we get to hear about how the boyfriend’s seemingly highfalutin family feels about his long-term girlfriend’s decision. Swift writes, You told your family for a reason / You couldn’t keep it in , revealing the man’s excitement and complete ignorance of what’s coming. Then, she continues, Your sister splashed out on the bottle / Now no one’s celebrating.From one line to the next, Swift takes us from a place of joy (a future sister-in-law dropping cash on expensive ~champagne~) to shock and sadness (no celebration—and definitely no popping bottles)."

      "title": "In Chorus 2, Swift describes the reaction of others close to the couple.",
      "content": "In Chorus 2, Swift describes the reaction of others close to the couple. Moving outside of the immediate family, the female narrator talks about everyone from their close college friends to the townspeople in their hometowns: No crowd of friends applauded / Your hometown skeptics called it / Champagne problems . With these lines, we understand the reaction of their friends, as well as the seeming implication that their neighbors and extended social circle saw her reaction or reasons for it as a frivolous decision—or as a “champagne problem.” [8] X Research source In the second half of the chorus, Swift returns to the shocked sadness of the boyfriend ( You had a speech, you’re speechless / Love slipped beyond your reaches) but mentions the girl’s mindset for the first time: And I couldn’t give a reason . Interestingly, Swift never reveals exactly why her character wasn’t ready to say yes to a proposal. However, she also doesn’t mention if the boyfriend should have had a reason to think the girlfriend would say no but ignored it. She leaves these interpretations up to the listener!"

      "title": "In the bridge, Swift reflects on the couple’s early and current stages.",
      "content": "In the bridge, Swift reflects on the couple’s early and current stages. The lengthy bridge begins with reminiscing on the pair’s college days while also alluding to how the narrator views herself as unstable, with the lyrics Your Midas touch on the Chevy door / November flush and your flannel cure / “This dorm was once a madhouse” / I made a joke, “Well, it's made for me” . In the next phrase, Swift similarly refers adoringly to the couple’s evergreen…group of friends before stating that she [doesn’t] think we’ll say that word again / And soon they’ll have the nerve to deck the halls / That we once walked through . [9] X Research source In this well-loved line that’s continuously dissected by the internet’s Swiftie sleuths, Swift seemingly uses the word evergreen to talk about how their friend group seemed like they’d be friends forever. But by saying that they'll never say that word again , many believe she’s referring to the word “evergreen” (the permanency of college friendships), some advocate for “our,” (as they no longer share anything as an ex-couple), while others argue that she’s referring to the “group of friends” (something that no longer exists). Regardless, Swift finishes this section of the bridge with a clear image of all of her college friends (and her former boyfriend) celebrating the holidays without her in her former home or haunts before repeating how she can’t even explain her own reasoning for the rejection except that she wasn’t ready ( I never was ready, so I watch you go / Sometimes you just don’t know the answer / ‘Til someone’s on their knees and asks you ). To wrap up the bridge, Swift writes one of her most iconic (and cathartic) lines before extending a promise from the girlfriend to the boyfriend that he’ll find something better: “She would’ve made such a lovely bride / What a shame she’s f—d in the head,” they said / But you’ll find the real thing instead / She’ll patch up your tapestry that I shred. Once again, Swift depicts her female narrator as a supposedly crazy, unstable person and implies that her friends, neighbors, and other acquaintances have all sided with the man. However, it seems that the woman herself also sides with the man, as she wishes for him to find the real thing instead , which she believes she cannot give him."

      "title": "In the last chorus, Swift envisions the man with a new girl.",
      "content": "In the last chorus, Swift envisions the man with a new girl. Continuing from the final line in the bridge, the narrator describes how her ex’s new love will always hold his hand while dancing, Never leave [him] standing / Crestfallen on the landing / With champagne problems . She hints at another engagement to this new woman, saying to the man: Your mom’s ring in your pocket / Her picture in your wallet / You won’t remember all my champagne problems. In this last refrain, Swift brings us back to the beginning of the song. The same events are happening but with a new girl and a (seemingly) happier outcome from the man. As Swift ends the tune with the repeated outro, You won’t remember all my champagne problems , she emphasizes that the man will move on and forget all about her and the “silly” problems she brought to his life. While Swift in no way implies that she sees these problems as frivolous or trivial, she does convincingly and heartbreakingly portray the feeling of leaving a relationship (and a song) with the overwhelming emotion that you were the problem and your ex-partner will move onto someone better and easier to be with."

During the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns, Taylor Swift dropped two surprise “sister” albums—the first, folklore , was released in July 2020. [10] X Research source Evermore , which includes the song “champagne problems,” was released on December 11th, 2020 by Republic Records. [11] X Research source The released track is a lo-fi tune with a simple musical composition—just Swift’s voice over a piano melody and guitar riff. The chords and musicality are simplistic but melodic, but the lyrics are complex enough to make the song a fan favorite, despite never being released as a single. [12] X Research source Before its release, “champagne problems” was recorded at both Kitty Committee Studio in Beverly Hills, CA, and Long Pond Studio in the Hudson Valley area of New York. “Champagne Problems” was co-written by Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn (under the pseudonym William Bowery) and produced with Aaron Dessner. The song is 4:04 minutes long. [13] X Research source Other credits on the released track include Jonathan Low (vocal recording, mixing, recording), Greg Calbi (mastering), Steve Fallone (mastering) and Logan Coale (upright bass).

The second track on evermore debuted at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 3 on the Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart. [15] X Research source “Champagne Problems” also peaked within the top 25 of eight countries, including Malaysia, Australia, and New Zealand, and reached number 15 on the UK Singles Chart. [16] X Research source Aside from its commercial performance, “champagne problems” is widely critically acclaimed and considered one of Taylor Swift’s best songs by many professional music critics. SPIN’s Bobby Olivier referred to “champagne problems” as an “unskippable track” that “contains this glorious line: ‘She would’ve made such a lovely bride, what a shame she’s fucked in the head.’” [17] X Research source Meanwhile, Variety’s Chris Willman wrote that “Champagne Problems” is “a superb example of her abilities as a storyteller who doesn’t always tell all.” [18] X Research source Pitchfork Magazine gave evermore an overall album score of 7.9, with critic Sam Sodomsky specifically naming “Champagne Problems” as a “spacious piano ballad.” [19] X Research source"

      "content": "“Champagne Problems” is the second-most popular evermore track. As of September 3rd, 2024, “champagne problems” has over 647 million streams on Spotify, making it the 34th most-streamed Taylor Swift song overall and the second most-streamed song off of evermore (after willow with 885 million streams). [20] X Research source Unsurprisingly, due to its popularity, “champagne problems” has maintained a permanent spot on the Eras Tour setlist. During the record-breaking show, “champagne problems” is performed by Swift on a moss-covered piano. Notably, the evermore tune is one of the only songs performed without backup dancers, backup singers, or other flashy additions. As part of the Eras Tour traditions, Swift usually gives an emotional speech before “champagne problems” is performed and the crowd always gives an unusually long standing ovation after the song concludes. For example, one of the concerts at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, CA, lasted almost eight minutes. [21] X Research source Swift always appears extremely emotional during this part of the show as she takes in the applause and connects with her massive audience. In response to the SoFi standing ovation, for instance, Swift commented, “I’m going to spend several decades trying to figure out words for how that just made me feel.” [22] X Research source"

      "title": "Yes, “Champagne Problems” is a fictional song penned by Taylor Swift.",
      "content": "Yes, “Champagne Problems” is a fictional song penned by Taylor Swift. Although fans may theorize otherwise, the song is not believed to be about any true story or romantic partner in Swift’s life. Both folklore and evermore were meant to be mostly fictionalized albums, with Swift herself writing in the evermore album booklet that she \"loved the escapism [she] found in these imaginary/not imaginary tales.\" [23] X Research source Despite this fact, many fans theorize that “champagne problems” alludes to Swift’s long-term romantic relationship with actor Joe Alwyn. However, Alwyn actually co-wrote the tune with Swift while the pair were still dating, so it’s unlikely that the song’s about him. [24] X Research source Many fans still, however, point to the fact that Swift and Alwyn were together for six years without being engaged or married, and many of Swift’s post-break-up tracks allude to tension over this issue. But these songs often indicate that Swift was the one who wanted to get married, unlike the female voice on champagne problems. For example, on the Midnights bonus track “You’re Losing Me,” released shortly after the public announcement of Swift and Alwyn’s break-up, Swift sings, And I wouldn’t marry me either / A pathological people pleaser. [25] X Research source On “So Long, London,” another track widely believed to be about Alwyn, Swift writes, You swore that you loved me but where were the clues / I died on the altar waiting for the proof. This song was released as part of The Tortured Poets Department , Swift’s first album released after the break-up. [26] X Research source"

      "content": "Swift has never said that “Champagne Problems” is about Gilmore Girls . Shortly after evermore ’s release, fan theories began swirling that “champagne problems” was written about one of the central couples on Gilmore Girls : Rory Gilmore and Logan Huntzberger. Similarly to the story told in the song, Rory and Logan fall in love while attending Yale but break up when Rory rejects Logan’s marriage proposal in the penultimate episode of the series. [27] X Research source While there are many parallels between the fictional relationship in Gilmore Girls and the one penned by Swift, there has been no confirmation or concrete evidence that Swift had this in mind while writing her ballad."
