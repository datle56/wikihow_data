That will mix the dirt and sediment back in with them. If you have a salad spinner, you can use it to get rid of the excess moisture from the bok choy. Check the water after you’ve removed the bok choy. If it is extremely dirty or cloudy, dump it out and repeat the process of soaking the boy choy until the water is mostly clear when you remove it."
