      "content": "Educate yourself about the history of pride. Modern Pride as we know it can be traced back to one significant event in particular: the Stonewall Uprising of 1969, where the LGBTQ+ community clashed with and protested against a police raid at the Stonewall Inn (a gay bar) in New York for 6 days total. Exactly 1 year after the original demonstrations at Stonewall (on June 28, 1970), the LGBTQ+ community held the very first Pride march as a way to commemorate the original protests while continuously advocating for LGBTQ+ rights. It’s because of this original event and the following march that Pride Month is held in June. [1] X Trustworthy Source Library of Congress Official library of the U.S. and main research institution for Congress and the American public Go to source It’s important to recognize the role that BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) members of the queer community played during this significant event, including figures like Marsha P. Johnson, Stormé DeLarverie, and Sylvia Rivera. [2] X Research source"

[3] X Research source Here’s a quick break-down of some of the different labels used within the LGBTQ+ community, as defined by the Human Rights Campaign: [4] X Research source Gay: “A person who is emotionally, romantically, or sexually attracted to members of the same gender (used by men, women, and non-binary individuals).” Lesbian: “A woman who is emotionally, romantically, or sexually attracted to other women (used by women and non-binary individuals).” Bisexual: “A person emotionally, romantically or sexually attracted to more than one gender, though not necessarily simultaneously, in the same way or to the same degree.” Transgender: “An umbrella term for people whose gender identity and/or expression is different from cultural expectations based on the sex they were assigned at birth.” Queer: “A term people often used to express a spectrum of identities and orientations that are counter to the mainstream.” Questioning: “A term used to describe people who are in the process of exploring their sexual orientation or gender identity.” Intersex: “Intersex people are born with a variety of differences in their sex traits and reproductive anatomy.” Asexual: “Often called ace for short, “asexual” refers to a complete or partial lack of sexual attraction or lack of interest in sexual activity with others.” Non-binary: “An adjective describing a person who does not identify exclusively as a man or a woman.” Pansexual: “Describes someone who has the potential for emotional, romantic, or sexual attraction to people of any gender, though not necessarily simultaneously, in the same way or to the same degree.”"

      "content": "Yes, straight people can go to Pride. Pride month is all about celebrating the LGBTQ+ community, acknowledging the progress that’s occurred, and highlighting the changes that still need to be made before the queer community is universally accepted within society. Straight people play an important part in that change and acceptance, and attending Pride events is a great way to show your support and solidarity with the queer community. What matters most is that you’re letting LGBTQ+ people take the spotlight at Pride, rather than drawing any extra attention or focus to yourself. What to wear to Pride: There’s no official “dress code” for Pride, so wear something comfortable for you to walk around in (especially during warmer weather). There's some debate around wearing rainbow or pride-themed clothing and accessories as an ally—some people suggest avoiding those items if they don't truly represent who you are, while others think it's a good way for straight people to show their support. Do what you think best supports the LGBTQ+ community."

When someone shares their pronouns, do your best to use and respect them in a given conversation. [15] X Research source Don’t be afraid to share your pronouns regularly, too! For example, stick your pronouns at the bottom of your email signature at work to help normalize a culture where people can openly share their preferred pronouns. Don’t make a big deal and profusely apologize if you misgender someone. It can be uncomfortable and embarrassing to use the wrong pronouns—but just apologize sincerely and leave it at that. When you apologize over and over again, you end up making the situation about yourself, which isn’t ideal. The best apology is making a conscious and informed effort in the future!
