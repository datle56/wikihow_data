      "content": "Increase your intake of vitamin C. Since viruses enter the body when the immune system is weak, you should take steps to strengthen your immune system so that the body does not become vulnerable. One easy way to do this is to increase your intake of vitamin C. Vitamin C is available in tablet, capsule, effervescent and syrup form. You should take 500 mg of vitamin C every day to boost your immune system and protect the body against immune system deficiencies. Vitamin C can also come from other foods and beverages such as cantaloupe, orange juice, broccoli, red cabbage, green pepper, red pepper, kiwi and tomato juice."

      "content": "Understand what causes stomach flu. Most cases of gastroenteritis are linked with the invasion of infectious agents like bacteria and viruses. Bacterial or viral infection causes diarrhea and other symptoms by triggering the inflammation of gastrointestinal tissue. These agents tend to elevate the amount of fluid in the intestine and colon by altering the normal function of the gastrointestinal tract in absorbing water and by speeding up the motility of ingested food items which leads to diarrhea. It can also damage the intestinal cells either directly or indirectly through its secreted toxins."

The prevalence of gastroenteritis is globally-high as it is almost impossible to avoid exposure with any of the identified causes of the disease throughout your entire life. However, some individuals are more vulnerable to gastroenteritis, for example: Individuals who are immunosuppressed . It may involve infants, children, adults and elderly as they may have underdeveloped or weakened immune system which puts them at greater risk of acquiring the disease. They also have the tendency to become dehydrated easily as compared to those with healthy and strong immune system. Individuals taking antibiotics . This drug can weaken the function of normal gastrointestinal microbes which makes it easier for the invasion of certain bacteria and viruses like Clostridioides difficile ( C. diff ) that can cause disease. Individuals with poor hygiene . Proper maintenance of the body such as correct techniques in handwashing can help in preventing certain types of diseases like gastroenteritis. Individuals exposed to uncontaminated foods and drinks . Eating under cooked or unwashed food items or drinking from contaminated water sources such as rivers or streams could potentially put an individual at higher risk of developing gastroenteritis."

An individual who touches a contaminated item such as feces and in turn touches another individual could directly transfer the viral or bacterial agents causing gastroenteritis. Indirect contact . An individual carrying the bacterial or viral agent touches a certain object and another individual touches the same object previously handled by the carrier and then suddenly places his/her already contaminated hands into their mouth could indirectly transfer the infection. Contaminated foods and drinks . These items could potentially harbor the causative agents of gastroenteritis and if ingested accidentally could lead to the outbreak of the disease."
