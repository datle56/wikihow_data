      "content": "Choose a cleaning agent to treat the mold, like white vinegar or bleach. You can use a mold-killing detergent, diluted bleach, vinegar, or a commercial cleaner made specifically for killing mold. [1] X Research source Don’t mix anything other than water with bleach, as certain cleaning agents can produce highly toxic fumes when mixed with bleach. [2] X Research source For a diluted bleach solution, mix three parts water with one part bleach in a bucket. You can also use white vinegar or hydrogen peroxide to kill mold. [3] X Expert Source Mike Kapur Certified Mold Assessor & Home Inspector, Sonic Home Inspections Expert Interview. 19 August 2020. Don’t forget to test a small, discreet area first. Bleach and other chemicals can discolor concrete that’s been colored or stained. [4] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 357 wikiHow readers which chemical solution they prefer to use to clean mold, and only 10% of them said 3% hydrogen peroxide. [Take Poll] While peroxide can be effective at removing mold, other cleaners may work better."

      "content": "Apply the solution. Use a heavy duty sponge or scrub brush to apply your chosen cleaning solution to all visible moldy areas on the concrete. Scrub the areas vigorously. If you’re using mold-killing detergent, apply it directly to the spots and scrub it with a bristle brush. [5] X Research source Don’t use a wire brush, which can scratch concrete. [6] X Research source Wear old clothes, rubber gloves, safety goggles and a respirator or dust mask."

      "title": "Rinse outdoor concrete.",
      "content": "Rinse outdoor concrete. Use a hot water pressure washer for the fastest and most effective rinse. Wear safety goggles, sturdy footwear and long pants. Use a pressure rating of at least 3000 psi with a flow rate of at least four gpm (gallons per minute). [7] X Research source This should lift any organic matter that has seeped into the pores of the concrete. [8] X Research source If you don’t want to use a pressure washer, try a regular water hose. You can rent a pressure washer at a home or building supply store. You may need a van, pickup truck or SUV to transport it, and a friend to help load and unload it. [9] X Research source Ask the rental agent how to use the washer and to give you any safety precautions. Find out if the washer comes with nozzles. Don’t use settings finer than fifteen degrees. Never use a zero degree nozzle on a pressure washer."

      "content": "Check the land for sloping and debris. Dirt should be slightly sloped away from the house so that water will travel away from the perimeter rather than pool up against the outer walls. Don’t allow wet leaves or other debris to pile up against the exterior walls of your home. [10] X Research source Pooling water can seep into the home and cause mold to grow inside the house. If your driveway is showing signs of mold, consider removing trees or shrubbery that are blocking sunlight on your driveway. Mold thrives in damp and shady areas. [11] X Research source"

[13] X Research source If you plan to paint concrete walls, use a waterproof sealant first, then apply stain-blocking primer and paint . For outdoors, try a high quality acrylic sealer made for exterior use. If your weather tends to be warm and humid, look for a low-solids solvent-based sealer. Choose dry, sunny weather and allow the sealer to dry for at least two to three days. [14] X Research source"
