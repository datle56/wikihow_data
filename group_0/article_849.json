You can also think of a multiple as the result of multiplying a number by a whole number. You are looking for the smallest multiple that the two denominators have in common. [5] X Research source For example, the smallest denominator in 4 5 + 3 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {4}{5}}+{\\frac {3}{4}}} is 4. The first several multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.
