If you're using an article, it will likely have a specific publication date because it wouldn't be changed later. For webpages, however, you're more likely to use the date of the last update, since those pages are reviewed periodically. Provide as specific a date as you can in parentheses, typing the year followed by a comma, then the month and day. Do not abbreviate the names of any months. Place a period outside the closing parenthesis. [2] X Research source Example: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2018, December 14)."

      "content": "Use the name of the agency and year of publication to cite in-text. Generally, APA requires a parenthetical citation at the end of any sentence in which you quote or paraphrase from a source. For a CDC citation, that parenthetical would include the full name of the CDC and the year the article or page was published or last updated. Include your parenthetical citation inside the closing punctuation for the sentence. [5] X Research source For example, you might write \"Children with ADHD have developmental differences that cause them to have continued difficulty focusing on tasks (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018).\" A parenthetical citation at the end of the sentence isn't necessary if you incorporate the parenthetical information in the body of your paper. For example, you might write \"According to the CDC (2018), more than 6 million children have been diagnosed with ADHD.\" If you quote directly from the source, include the page number (\"p.\") or paragraph number (\"para.\") where the quoted passage appears in your citation. For example, you might write: While researchers haven't yet identified the specific causes of ADHD, the CDC notes that \"genetics plays an important role\" (2018, para. 5)."

If your Works Cited entry lists the CDC first as the author, include the name of the agency and all the larger government units in your parenthetical in-text citation. On the other hand, if you started your entry with the title of the article, you would use a shortened version of the title. Include a page number if the source is paginated.
