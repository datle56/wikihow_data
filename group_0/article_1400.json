    {
      "title": "Put a latex glove on your dominant hand.",
      "content": "Put a latex glove on your dominant hand. Since you’ll only be applying the Biofreeze using 1 hand, you only need to put a glove on the hand you’ll be using to rub the gel in. You can use this hand to apply Biofreeze to yourself or to another person. [2] X Research source If you don’t have a latex glove, you can apply the Biofreeze using a bare hand."
    },
    {
      "title": "Squeeze some Biofreeze onto your glove.",
      "content": "Squeeze some Biofreeze onto your glove. Rather than applying Biofreeze directly to the skin—whether yours or someone else’s—apply the Biofreeze to the glove. This will prevent you from emptying out an excessive amount of Biofreeze all at once. [3] X Research source Start by squeezing 1 ⁄ 4 teaspoon (1.2 mL) of the Biofreeze onto the tip of your gloved index finger."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rub Biofreeze onto the painful area.",
      "content": "Rub Biofreeze onto the painful area. Use your fingertips and palm to rub Biofreeze into the area afflicted with muscle, joint, or arthritic pain. [4] X Research source Take at least 2 or 3 minutes to work the gel in. It needs to be absorbed into the surface of the skin for its full effect. [5] X Research source If you’re applying Biofreeze to someone else, ask them where the pain is located, and apply the gel to the area they describe. If you need Biofreeze on a hard-to-reach spot (like the center of your back), ask a friend to rub the gel on for you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Throw away the latex glove.",
      "content": "Throw away the latex glove. After you’ve applied the Biofreeze, dispose of the latex glove without touching the gel with your unprotected hand. Use your ungloved hand to grasp the bottom of the latex glove, and pull it off of your hand in one smooth motion. This will turn the glove inside out, with the Biofreeze on the inside. [6] X Research source Throw the glove away in a trash can. The trash can should have a lid, and be out of the reach of children or pets."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wash your hands immediately after applying the Biofreeze.",
      "content": "Wash your hands immediately after applying the Biofreeze. [7] X Research source If you didn’t wear a glove while applying Biofreeze—or if you accidentally smeared some gel on an exposed hand—wash your hands right away. Scrub the Biofreeze thoroughly, since it can cause severe agitation if it comes in contact with your: [8] X Research source Eyes or mouth. Ears. Armpits. Crotch area."
    },
    {
      "title": "Seal the Biofreeze gel pack with a paperclip.",
      "content": "Seal the Biofreeze gel pack with a paperclip. If you haven’t used up all of the Biofreeze, save the remainder in case the muscle or sprain pain comes back. Fold over the open end of the gel pack, and clip a paperclip over the open side. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Shake the tube thoroughly before using.",
      "content": "Shake the tube thoroughly before using. For the Biofreeze to have its full efficiency, it needs to be well shaken. [10] X Research source [11] X Research source Firmly shake the tube for at least 30 seconds. This and other directions should be printed on the Biofreeze tube itself. Be sure to read and follow all of the directions before beginning to apply the Biofreeze."

    {
      "title": "Apply the Biofreeze using strokes in a single direction.",
      "content": "Apply the Biofreeze using strokes in a single direction. Use the roller applicator to roll the liquid Biofreeze onto your skin. As indicated on the packaging instructions, apply the gel in a single direction. Press the roller firmly onto your skin, and apply for 10-15 seconds. [12] X Research source Do not apply Biofreeze by rolling it back and forth or by rubbing it around in circles."
    },
    {
      "title": "Squeeze the tube while you’re applying Biofreeze.",
      "content": "Squeeze the tube while you’re applying Biofreeze. Squeezing the tube will force more Biofreeze gel out onto the roller ball, which in turn will apply more gel to your skin. [13] X Research source Put about the same amount of pressure on the tube as it would take to dent a tennis ball. If you apply Biofreeze without squeezing the tube, less of the gel will be applied to your skin. You may not feel the full effects of the Biofreeze, and may be left with lingering muscle pain."
    },
    {
      "title": "Leave the area uncovered after applying Biofreeze.",
      "content": "Leave the area uncovered after applying Biofreeze. Do not bandage the skin to which you’ve applied gel. [14] X Research source The skin needs time to absorb the Biofreeze gel, and applying a bandage will only soak up gel and prevent it from reaching deep tissue. Follow any other safety precautions as printed on the Biofreeze tube. Do not apply more than 4 times on the same area in a day."
