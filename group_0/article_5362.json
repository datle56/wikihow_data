Add up all the numbers and divide by the population size: [1] X Research source Mean (μ) = ΣX/N, where Σ is the summation (addition) sign, x i is each individual number, and N is the population size. In the case above, the mean μ is simply (12+55+74+79+90)/5 = 62."

[2] X Research source For the example given, the standard deviation is sqrt[((12-62)^2 + (55-62)^2 + (74-62)^2 + (79-62)^2 + (90-62)^2)/(5)] = 27.4. (Note that if this was the sample standard deviation, you would divide by n-1, the sample size minus 1.)"

      "content": "Calculate the standard error (of the mean). This represents how well the sample mean approximates the population mean. The larger the sample, the smaller the standard error, and the closer the sample mean approximates the population mean. Do this by dividing the standard deviation by the square root of N, the sample size. [3] X Research source Standard error = σ/sqrt(n) [4] X Research source So for the example above, if this were a sampling of 5 students from a class of 50 and the 50 students had a standard deviation of 17 (σ = 21), the standard error = 17/sqrt(5) = 7.6."
