If they love dogs and you have a Labrador puppy, invite them over and pose your puppy next to a sign saying “Will you go to prom with me?” If their favorite animal is sharks, try Photoshopping a bunch of sharks into tuxedos and prom dresses, writing “Prom?” across the top, and sending it to them.

Spell out “Prom?” with pizza toppings or their favorite candy. You can also give them food in a box, like a cake or a burger, and write “Will you go to prom with me?” on the inside.

      "content": "Come up with a funny pun using their favorite things. If you’re good at coming up with puns, try sending them a pun based on their interests.

      "content": "Write a promposal song. If you’re a musical person, you can try writing a song for your prospective date. It doesn’t have to be anything complicated or brilliant. You can even just change the lyrics of a popular song to include your promposal. Make sure your song is the kind of music they like before you start writing! [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Buy them something they love. If you can buy a gift, getting them something you know they'll love can make your promposal memorable. The gift can be as simple as a handmade card or as extravagant as a pair of designer shoes. It's up to you and your budget! Avoid giving a lavish gift to someone you don't know well. It will be awkward for them and they might feel like they have to go with you."

      "content": "Write a message on a sign. The sign’s message doesn’t have to be complicated. It can be a simple “Will you go to prom with me?” or even just “Prom?” If you want to write something more involved, spend some time thinking about what will be easily understandable, what will fit on a sign, and what you wouldn’t mind other people seeing. A very personal anecdote, a long story, or a really obscure in-joke may not work out very well. [6] X Research source You can also decorate your sign with glitter, photos, or balloons. Try leaving your sign somewhere your date might come across it on their day-to-day lives. Make sure you put both of your names on it if you do this! [7] X Research source"

Any lighthearted or fun event is fine to choose. You can pick a sports game, a pep rally, or even just a really crowded hall or lunchroom. [8] X Research source Avoid formal events like speeches and plays. You want everyone to be thinking about how cool your promposal is, not wondering why you’re interrupting everything. Definitely don’t plan a promposal at a sad event or a party for someone else."

If you’d rather not, ask your friends to find out or drop a hint about prom to them. [11] X Research source Try saying something straightforward like “So do you have a prom date yet?” If they say yes, try to act calm and cool about it. Tell them you hope they have a great time.

A promposal isn’t a one-size-fits-all event. Some people would absolutely hate being asked to prom in front of everybody at the homecoming game, but others would love it. Think about what you know about your prospective date. Would they prefer to be asked privately, or would they love a big public event? Do they think pun promposals are cute or annoying?

Start by bringing up the idea of prom in general to see how they react. Some people are very no-frills and may not even be interested in prom at all. Just say something casual like “I heard they actually hired an outside DJ for prom” or “My friend works at the mall, she says everyone’s buying prom stuff already.” If they seem interested and don’t mention a date, you can ask them! If they act grossed out by the idea of prom, they might be trying to act cool, or they might really not want to go. The only way to find out for sure is to ask them directly."

      "content": "Ask them to prom. Just come right out and say it! You don’t need to recite a poem or talk about how much you love them. Just look them in the eyes, smile, and say, “Will you go to prom with me?” Depending on the person, you can even say something really casual like “Want to go to prom together?” [15] X Research source If they say no, smile, say you understand, and thank them. It doesn’t have to be awkward. You can still be friends later. It might be tempting to text them instead of speaking face to face, but don’t do it unless they have actually told you that they don’t mind text promposals. Many people think that sending a text about something important shows you don’t care that much. If you can’t see the person face to face, call them!"
