There are some things you should be aware of when using an international calling card with your cell phone. These tips will prevent you from accidentally incurring extra charges: Do not dial the number using your contact list. If you select the number from your contact list, you will disconnect from the calling card service and make the call through your cell phone service provider. You must dial out the numbers once you are connected to the calling card service. Do not press \"Send,\" \"OK,\" or \"Dial\" after dialing the number you are calling in Ireland. The calling card service will connect you automatically. Pressing any of these buttons will disconnect you from the calling card service and make the call directly from your cell phone using your service provider."
