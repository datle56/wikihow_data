    {
      "title": "Put the author's last name and year of publication in parentheses.",
      "content": "Put the author's last name and year of publication in parentheses. Place the citation directly after the information you wish to cite, inside any punctuation. Put a space between the author's name and the date, but don't use a comma. [2] X Research source For example: (Schmidt 1935). If you don't know the name of the author, use the name of the organization that published the text or a shortened version of the title in place of the author's name. For example: (Society for Psychical Research 1935) or (“Mystery of a Talking Wombat” 1935). [3] X Research source Don't include the author's name in parentheses if you've already mentioned it in the sentence with the citation. Instead, simply give the date (and page numbers, if applicable). For example: “John Schmidt (1935, 217-218) claimed that a talking wombat inhabited the walls of his Illinois farmhouse for over a decade.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Separate the names of 2 or 3 authors with commas.",
      "content": "Separate the names of 2 or 3 authors with commas. If the work you're citing has 2 to 3 authors, place all their last names in parentheses before the date of publication. Put commas between the authors' names, but not between the final author's name and the date. List the authors in the order in which they're given in the publication. [4] X Research source For example: (Schmidt, Bjorn, and Prince 1941)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write the first author's name and “et al.",
      "content": "Write the first author's name and “et al. ” when citing 4 or more authors. If the publication you're citing has 4 or more authors, include only the surname of the first author listed, followed by et al. and the date. Don't use any commas. [5] X Research source For example: (Schmidt et al. 1937)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use first initials to distinguish multiple authors with the same last name.",
      "content": "Use first initials to distinguish multiple authors with the same last name. It can get confusing if you're citing several authors who share surnames. Keep the distinction clear by placing the first initial of each author before their name in the citation. [6] X Research source For example: (J. Schmidt 1935), (V. Schmidt 1972)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Distinguish multiple publications with the same author and date by using letters.",
      "content": "Distinguish multiple publications with the same author and date by using letters. If you're citing more than 1 text by the same author published in the same year, you will need to make a clear distinction between each publication. Do this by assigning lowercase letters to each publication and placing them after the date in your citations. [7] X Research source For example: (Schmidt 1935a), (Schmidt 1935b). Before assigning letters, alphabetize these sources by title (which is also how they will be listed in your bibliography). Assign the letters in order so that the first source is a, the second is b, and so on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Separate multiple citations with semicolons.",
      "content": "Separate multiple citations with semicolons. If you want to cite information that you got from multiple sources, you can list your sources together in the same parenthetical citation. List each source as you normally would (Author Date), but place a semicolon between each source. [8] X Research source For example: (Schmidt 1935; Bjorn 1946)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include page numbers when you're citing specific passages.",
      "content": "Include page numbers when you're citing specific passages. If you are citing a specific passage from your source, localize the information as clearly as possible in your citation by using page numbers or other information (such as the chapter number). Place the page number or other location information after the date, separated with a comma. [9] X Research source For example: (Schmidt 1935, 217-310). If you are making a very general statement about the contents of your source, you don't have to include location information. Aside from page numbers, you can also specify other types of location information, such as chapter number, document number, or figure number. For example: (Prince 1932, chap. 15) or (Bjorn et al. 1946, doc. 27)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place a number in superscript after the information you wish to cite.",
      "content": "Place a number in superscript after the information you wish to cite. Unlike the Author-Date style, the Notes-Bibliography (NB) system uses footnotes or endnotes instead of parenthetical citations. The superscript number for each note will match with the number of the corresponding note at the bottom of the page (if you're using footnotes) or the end of your work (if you're using endnotes). Typically, the number should be placed at the end of the relevant sentence or clause, outside of any punctuation. [10] X Research source For example: “Schmidt's daughter, Viola, was the first person to report the phenomena.” 1 Footnotes and endnotes allow you to provide more complete citations than the parenthetical style used in the Author-Date system. You can also use these notes to provide additional information that you don't want to put in the main text. Both systems include a full reference list at the end, typically called a “Bibliography” in the NB system. Most word processing programs have tools to help you format footnotes and endnotes. For example, if you're using MS Word, you can insert notes into the text using the “references” tab."

      "title": "Start the note with the author's first and last name.",
      "content": "Start the note with the author's first and last name. Once you have added the note number into your text at the point where you want a citation, place a corresponding footnote at the bottom of the page. If you're using endnotes, place the notes in order by number at the end of the work. The note itself will begin with the name(s) of the author(s). Don't invert the names (Last, First) as you would in your bibliography. [11] X Research source For example: 1. Viola Schmidt If there 2 to 3 authors, list them in the same order used in the publication, separated by commas. For example: 15. John Schmidt, Maureen Schmidt, and Harlan Prince For 4 or more authors, list only the name of the first author, followed by et al. [12] X Research source For example: 27. Njord Bjorn et al."

If you're citing a book, put the title in italics. For an article or chapter title, place the title in quotation marks. All titles should be capitalized in headline style. [13] X Research source For example, if you are citing an article: 1. John Schmidt, “Mystery of a Talking Wombat” For a book: 17. Njord Bjorn, My Experiences at Schmidt Farm If you're citing a chapter from an edited book, place the book title and the editor's name after the chapter title. For example: 24.

After the title of the article, provide the title of the periodical in italics, followed by the volume and issue numbers (if applicable). Then, place the date in parentheses.
