      "content": "Clear out the oven before you clean it. Take out all of the oven racks so you can reach and clean the bottom more easily. Remove any other items like a pizza stone, baking stone, or any trays that may have been left in there. [1] X Research source Clean the oven racks before you put them back into the oven after you clean the bottom. This can also be a good time to clean any baking stones or pizza stones you typically keep in the oven, particularly if there are stubborn stains on the stone that weren't removed when you performed regular cleaning after use."

      "content": "Remove large food particles from the bottom of the oven. Use an old sponge, paper towels, or a cloth to scrub off large bits of food and grease that may have collected on the bottom of your oven. Lots of built up grease and food can prevent a cleaning solution from being effective. A cleaning solution will be more effective when it’s applied directly to the surface of the bottom of the oven, rather than a large chunk of food."

      "title": "Use your oven’s self-cleaning cycle.",
      "content": "Use your oven’s self-cleaning cycle. If your oven has a self-cleaning cycle, allow it to run until it’s finished. Self-cleaning cycles will bake the grease and food particles and make them dry and crispy so they’re easier to remove. [2] X Research source Depending on your oven, self-cleaning cycles can take up to 3 hours."

      "content": "Wipe the bottom of your oven with a damp rag or paper towel. After your oven has finished its self-cleaning cycle, there will be a layer of ash on the bottom of the oven. Use a damp cloth or paper towel to remove all of the ash from the inside of your oven before you add any cleaning solutions or it could cake together. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Put on rubber cleaning gloves and safety glasses. Chemical oven cleaners can be really caustic and can burn your skin and eyes. Wear safety glasses and a pair of sturdy rubber cleaning gloves to create a heavy-duty barrier between your skin and the oven cleaner. Don’t use disposable gloves as they may not be enough to prevent the cleaner from getting onto your skin."

      "content": "Lay down newspapers or paper towels on the floor in front of the oven. When you apply the oven cleaner to the bottom of your oven, some of it may spill or run out of the oven. Use newspapers or paper towels to soak up any excess cleaner."

      "content": "Let the cleaner sit for at least 30 minutes. Check the can to see the specific waiting time, but most oven cleaners need to sit for 30 minutes before you wipe it clean. Don’t disturb the oven while the cleaner is working. [5] X Research source Keep the oven closed so the fumes are contained."

If there are any sticky patches of residue, you can use a scrub brush or sponge to scrub it. Get into the corners and crevices to remove all of the dirt and the cleaner."

      "title": "Use baking soda and vinegar to clean without toxic chemicals.",
      "content": "Use baking soda and vinegar to clean without toxic chemicals. Mix 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of baking soda with 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of water in a bowl, and mix it to form a thick paste. Spread the paste on the bottom of your oven and let it sit for 12 hours, or overnight. Then wipe the bottom of your oven with a damp cloth. Fill a spray bottle with white vinegar, spray the inside of the oven, and wipe away the foamy mixture. The white vinegar will react with the baking soda and make a foamy cleaning mixture. You don’t need to let the foam sit in the oven. Wipe the oven clean right after you spray the vinegar. If you’re in a hurry, apply the baking soda paste, let it sit for 15 minutes, and then spray it with vinegar and wipe it away."

Slice 2 lemons in half and squeeze the juice into the water and then drop the lemons into the bowl of water. Place the bowl on a center rack and let it bake for 1 hour, then use a damp cloth to wipe the bottom of your oven. [6] X Research source Let the oven cool down enough to where it’s still warm, but you can reach into it to wipe the bottom. Use a wet scouring pumice or microfiber sponge to scrub difficult stains."

      "content": "Spread salt onto the bottom of the oven to clean it. Preheat your oven to 150 °F (66 °C) and sprinkle regular table salt all over the bottom of the oven. Put on oven mitts to protect your hands and use a damp sponge or rag to scrub the bottom of the oven while the oven is still warm. [7] X Research source The salt acts as an abrasive and will make the grime easy to wipe away."
