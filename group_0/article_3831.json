      "content": "Do not worry about perfection right away. Beginners sometimes worry they're bad at meditation. You may find it difficult to clear your mind and focus on your breathing. Do not get frustrated and beat yourself up. It's very normal for meditation to be somewhat difficult at first. Cut yourself some slack and keep practicing. Eventually, meditating will become easier. [1] X Research source Keep in mind, even people who meditate regularly never completely clear their minds. It's normal to have to stop and redirect your thinking to your breathing once in awhile. Do not feel like getting distracted means you're meditating incorrectly. More advanced meditators may try to clear their minds completely but Buddha Shakyamuni warned against too obsessed with clearing the mind. [2] X Research source . Many Zen masters recognize that the safest way is to substitute all wandering thoughts in mind with one single yet powerful thought - Buddha Amitabha, as highlighted in The Amitabha Sutra (Sukhāvatī-vyūha)."

      "content": "Increase your sessions with time. Start off with small sessions and build up. After you're comfortable meditating in short spurts, start adding on a few more minutes each week. Eventually, you'll be able to meditate for longer periods. There is no one size fits all rule for meditation. You may find very long meditation sessions, such as 25 minute sessions, help you relax. However, you may also find brief five to 10 minute sessions are sufficient. Experiment with different time frames until you find something you're comfortable with."

      "content": "Get into a stable position. The literal translation for zazen is \"seated meditation\". How you sit is very important. What matters most is that you stay comfortable and keep your back straight. If you need to do something like cross your legs, or use pillows to prop up your back, do so. If you are very flexible, try the half Lotus Position (Hankafuza) or the Full Lotus Position (Kekkafuza). The Half Lotus is done by placing the left foot onto the right thigh and tucking the right leg under your left thigh. The Full Lotus is done by placing each foot onto the opposite thigh. If either positions are painful, however, avoid using them as they can be distracting."

      "content": "Position your head in a comfortable fashion. The positioning of your head is important for Zen meditation, as it's vital you do not do anything to strain your body. Hold your head in a position that feels natural and does not cause strain in your neck. Ideally, your spine should align with your neck. Imagine a straight line running up your spine. Move your neck so this imaginary line continues across your neck. Tucking in your chin helps align your spine and neck."

      "content": "Relax your jaw and facial muscles. Before you begin meditating, pause and be aware of any tensions you're feeling in your jaw and facial muscles. You may not notice the tension in your jaw until you pay attention to it specifically. Try to loosen your jaw and the muscles in your face in general before you begin meditating. If your jaw feels very tense, use your fingers to lightly massage your face to loosen up the muscles."

It's important to breathe through your nose. Nasal breaths create a cooling and warming sensation as you breathe in and out. This can make it easy to follow the rhythm of your breathing as you meditate."

      "title": "Focus on the breath.",
      "content": "Focus on the breath. As you begin meditating, notice your breath as much as possible. Pay attention to the natural in and out rhythm, the sound of your breathing, and the warm and cold sensations provided by air passing through your lungs. Strive to be as aware as possible of your breathing for the duration of your meditation sessions. This may sound simple enough, but it's very difficult to quiet the mind. Do not be discouraged if you struggle to focus on your breath at first. Meditation, like anything else, takes practice."

Some people find it helpful to focus their eyes on a single point in the room. Others prefer their eyes to be shut. This is a matter of personal preference. Decide what to do with your eyes based on what feels most natural and soothing for you. This will take some trial and error. Change what you're doing with your eyes if you become distracted or uncomfortable. For example, if your eyes start to water when you're focusing on a single point in the room, close your eyes. See if this helps you better concentrate on your breath."

When you first start meditating, you will find yourself thinking about other things. You'll start thinking about errands you need to run or things that occurred earlier in the day. When you feel this happening, gently redirect your thinking to your breathing. Tune in to the natural ebb and flow of your breaths and the sensations they create.
