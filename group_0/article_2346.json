      "content": "Go with a variation of their middle name. When you want to avoid using a nickname for their first name, try one linked to their middle name instead. It offers a distance between your baby boy’s official name and the one you call him at home. This helps keep their nickname feel special to you and your family as something they only hear at home."

      "content": "Choose a nickname that ages well. Since you can’t choose your own nickname as a baby, you as a parent will want one that stands the test of time. Try to choose one they’ll love years down the road. Something like “pookie” or “precious” may work when he’s a tot, but they may be embarrassed by it by the time they leave toddlerhood. If you base a nickname off of their given or middle name, they’re more likely to use it as an older child. Be sure your nickname doesn’t put them down in any way. A nickname is a term of endearment that should let your little guy know how much you love them. It shouldn’t focus on any kind of shortcomings they may have."
