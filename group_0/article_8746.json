This works for many web browsers, like Chrome and Firefox, to delete embarrassing search terms or phrases. It doesn't delete your browser history, however. Oppido notes that whether you should clear your browsing data comes down to personal preference. \"If it's my own computer, I just think of it as my footprint,\" he says. \"Now, if I'm on my parents' computer, a friend's computer, or a library computer, I will delete my history when I'm done because I don't want anybody to see what I've been doing.\""
