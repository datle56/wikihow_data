The most common example of this is a problem calculating the force of gravity between an object and Earth.

[5] X Research source The distance from the surface of the Earth to the center is approximately 6.38 x 10 m.

Make sure all your variables have the proper units. m1 = 5.98 x 10 kg, m2 = 68 kg, G = 6.673 x 10 Nm/kg, and d = 6.38 x 10 m Write your equation: F g r a v = ( G m 1 m 2 ) / d ″ = [ ( 6.67 x 10 ) x 68 x ( 5.98 x 10 ) ] / ( 6.38 x 10 ) {\\displaystyle Fgrav=(Gm1m2)/d''=[(6.67x10)x68x(5.98x10)]/(6.38x10)} Multiply the masses of the two objects together. 68 x (5.98 x 10) = 4.06 x 10 Multiply the product of m1 and m2 by the gravitational constant G . (4.06 x 10) x (6.67 x 10) = 2.708 x 10 Square the distance between the two objects.

As academic tutor Sean Alexander explains, on Earth, the force of gravity causes objects to accelerate at a rate of 9.8 m/s.

Once you have defined the variables of your equation, you can plug them in and solve. Be sure that all of your units are in metric, and you’re using the proper order of operations to solve. [8] X Research source Let’s use the same equation from above and see how close the approximation is: The problem: Determine the force of gravity on a 68 kg person on the surface of the earth. Convert the variables to the proper units: m = 68 kg, g = 9.8 m/s. Write the equation: Fgrav = mg = 68*9.8 = 666 N. The answer: With F = mg, the force of gravity is 666 N, while using the more exact equation yields a force of 665 N. As you can see, these values are almost identical."

      "content": "The formula for the Second Law of gravity is F = ma . Newton’s Second Law of Motion states that any object will accelerate when acted upon by a net or unbalanced force. In other words, if a force is acting upon an object that’s greater than the forces acting in the opposite direction, the object will accelerate in the direction of the larger force. This law can be summed up with the equation F = ma , where F is the force, m is the mass of the object, and a is the acceleration. [9] X Research source Using this law, we can calculate the gravitational force of any object on the Earth's surface, given the known acceleration due to gravity."
