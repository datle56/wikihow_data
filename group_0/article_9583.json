      "title": "Identify your triggers to arousal and avoid them.",
      "content": "Identify your triggers to arousal and avoid them. Triggers to masturbation can be the thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and situations that result in arousal or the urge to masturbate. Triggers vary in each person, but can include looking at attractive people, body parts, clothing, animals, or inanimate objects. For some people, triggers can include sounds, smells, or other sensory or thought stimulation. If you work to cope with or reduce these triggers, you may be less likely to act on your impulse (by reducing the trigger) to masturbate. Make a list (either mental or on paper/the computer) of all of the things that trigger you to engage in masturbation. This list might include things like: looking at pornography, thinking about sex or fantasizing, looking at sex-related items, increased stress or anxiety, or difficulty sleeping."

      "title": "Focus on your responsibilities.",
      "content": "Focus on your responsibilities. Our obligations can help us focus on what is necessary (money, food, shelter, education, etc) rather than what is not essential for daily life (masturbation). Having less free-time overall can decrease your desire and actual ability to masturbate because it becomes an impractical part of your day. If you don't have time for it, you might not do it. Make a list of the things you need to complete each day. This list might include things like: complete work or school projects, go shopping, clean bedroom, pay bills, practice the guitar, and exercise. Keep this list handy. When you have the urge to masturbate, look at your list and tell yourself, “I don’t have time to masturbate right now. I need to get all of this done today.” Get a job if you are old enough. A job is a good distraction and can help you structure your schedule. Not to mention you'll have money to spend on activities that can distract and entertain you!"

      "title": "Set limits.",
      "content": "Set limits. If you really do not want to masturbate, try to focus on avoiding it when it is inappropriate to do so. This includes when you and your spouse/partner have planned intercourse soon, when you are not totally in private, when you need to be productive doing something else, or when you must save sperm for a medical test. Set goals that are specific to your personal needs. Some individuals may want to avoid masturbation altogether for religious or cultural reasons, while others may want to reduce the amount of time they spend masturbating overall. It is easy to lose your sense of time while masturbating. Be sure of how much time you have until your next obligation, such as work, school, etc. If you do not have enough time until your next obligation, consider putting off masturbation until later."
