This will keep strangers from seeing your Story. Everybody in your friends list will be able to view your story snaps. Tap Custom if you want to select certain friends to block from seeing your Story. Tapping on Custom will bring up your friends list, and you can choose friends one-by-one to block them from viewing your story snaps. They will still be able to see the Snapchats you send to them, but they won't be able to view your Story."
