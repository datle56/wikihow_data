To qualify for benefits, your household must also be at or below the net income limit, which is the gross amount minus allowable deductions. Like with the gross amount, the net amount depends on the household’s net income based on the poverty line for the household size. The allowable deductions and their amounts include: All households can deduct 20% of earned income. Additionally, you can remove the standard deduction of $142 for households with 1 to 3 members and $153 for households with more than 3 members. The program allows a dependent care deduction for child care or adult care expenses. For example, monthly daycare costs are deductible for households with children. Court ordered child support payments are deductible from the gross income. The only child support payments that the household may deduct are legal child support payments. Expenses such as rent and utilities are deductible for amounts that are more than half of the gross income (after subtracting other deductions). The maximum for the expenses deduction is $459. Households with an elderly or disabled member can deduct medical expenses that exceed the $35 per month \"deductible\" for out-of-pocket medical expenses."

Households that are eligible to receive SNAP are expected to spend 30% of their net income on food. The maximum allotment you could receive is based upon a net income of 0, and it decreases as you come closer to the maximum income. For example, a household of 3 with a net income of $1,500 must subtract $450 (30 percent of $1,500) from the maximum allotment for their household, which is $511 per month. They then subtract the $450 from the $511 maximum. The household will receive a food stamp allotment of $61 for the month. The maximum allotment for 2015 is: 1 member household: $194 2 member household: $357 3 member household: $511 4 member household: $649 5 member household: $771 6 member household: $925 7 member household: $1,022 8 member household: $1,169 For each member over 8, add $146 per month for each extra member"
