      "content": "Pull out the interior faceplate. Once the screws have been removed, the faceplate can be pulled out. Generally, you can pull it straight out, though in some cases you might need to twist the faceplate counterclockwise before pulling it out."

      "content": "Remove the exterior faceplate. Once the interior faceplate has been removed, the faceplate that is on the outside of your door can also be pulled out. You will probably need to twist it counterclockwise before pulling it out. Sometimes there will be screws in the exterior faceplate as well. If so, unscrew these as well, before attempting to pull it out."

      "content": "Unscrew the set plate. The set plate is the piece of metal that faces the doorframe and connects the bolt to the doorframe. It is the part of the lock that is visible on the side of the door. There should be a screw on the top and the bottom of the set plate. Remove both screws."

    {
      "title": "Pull out the set plate and bolt.",
      "content": "Pull out the set plate and bolt. The bolt is the piece of metal in the center of the deadbolt that, when locked, fits into the jamb hole in the doorframe to hold your door closed. It is usually attached to the set plate, so that once the set plate is unscrewed, both can simply be pulled out. In some cases, the set plate and bolt are not one piece. If so, once the set plate is removed you can pull out the bolt separately. If you did not unlock your deadbolt prior to removal, you can still remove the bolt. Just look for where the bolt connects to the locking mechanism and use a screwdriver to twist it open."

      "title": "Measure the size of the lock.",
      "content": "Measure the size of the lock. To ensure that your new lock fits in its opening, use a tape measure to check the size of the hole where your lock used to be. Then, measure the “setback,” the distance from the doorframe to the hole. Finally, measure the thickness of your door. In most newer homes these measurements are standard. The hole is generally 2 1/8th inches. Most bolts are also adjustable to accommodate the size of your setback. It doesn’t hurt, however, to be cautious and get all measurements. [1] X Research source"

It will also make it possible to get a new lock that is compatible with your keys. [2] X Research source To establish that your existing keys still work, you might want to get a deadbolt that is produced by the same brand as your current deadbolt. The brand name should be the set plate, the piece of metal that holds the bolt and connects it to the door frame."

Thus, you should buy strong locks from a reputable brand, to ensure that no one can force the door open. Your new deadbolt should have a metal strike plate. The bolt in the deadlock should fit all the way into the jamb hole in the doorframe. The screws that hold the deadbolt into the door should be at least three inches long."

This should seem familiar; each step in installing your deadbolt will mirror the steps you took to remove the deadbolt. Every time that you insert a screw, you can begin by using your hands to get the screw in place. Eventually, however, you should progress to using a screwdriver or power tool to ensure that screw is fully inserted and secure. [4] X Research source"
