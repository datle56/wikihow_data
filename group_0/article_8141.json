      "content": "Dust the furniture with a soft, lint-free or microfiber cloth . Dust shows up easily on white wood, making it look dingy and grimy. Fortunately, all you have to do is go over your furniture with a soft, lint-free cloth once a week. For extra dusty furniture, slightly dampen the cloth to prevent dust from circulating in the air. [1] X Research source Opt for a dusting cloth instead of a feather duster. Cloths work better for removing dust and they’re also less likely to scratch up your furniture. [2] X Research source Maintenance tip: Aim to dust your white wood furniture weekly to keep everyday dust from accumulating too much."

      "content": "Wipe away dirt with warm water and dish soap. This is the safest and easiest way to clean most wood, and white wood furniture is no exception. Fill a bucket with warm water and a squirt of mild dish soap. Dip a corner of a clean microfiber cloth or soft kitchen sponge into the sudsy water, then wring it out so it’s damp (not dripping). Gently wipe down the surface of your wood furniture. [3] X Research source Alternatively, use a 2:1 ratio of water and white distilled vinegar in place of dish soap. If you’re washing something treated with high-gloss or semi-gloss paint, like a kitchen cabinet, it’s okay to scrub a little. However, be gentle with more delicate finishes like whitewash, matte paint, or clear varnish. Wipe the wood lightly instead of scrubbing. [4] X Research source If you’re not sure how the finish will hold up to soap and water, put a drop of dish soap on a moist cotton ball. Gently rub the cotton ball on the furniture in an inconspicuous spot to make sure there’s no damage before proceeding. If the soap damages the finish in your test spot, continue with plain water instead."

      "content": "Kill surface mold with distilled white vinegar. If your white furniture has a little mildew on it, you might be able to clean it away with soap and water. However, for serious infestations, white vinegar can help. Mix equal parts vinegar and warm water in a spray bottle and spritz it on the area with the mold. Let it sit for an hour before wiping it away with a rag dampened in clean water. Dry the area thoroughly when you’re done. [11] X Research source For really stubborn mold, try scrubbing the area with a solution of 1 tablespoon (26 g) of Borax and 1 cup (240 mL) of water and a soft-bristle brush. Don’t wipe or rinse the solution away—just let it air dry, or use a dehumidifier to speed the drying process. Unfortunately, even diluted vinegar can dull or damage some paints or wood finishes. It might be necessary to repaint or refinish the affected area after treating the mold. For severe mold infestations, you may need to sand down the wood or even replace the damaged sections of your furniture. Safety tip: Wear rubber gloves, goggles, and a face mask to avoid inhaling mold spores. Do not clean mold yourself if it’s toxic black mold or takes up an area larger than 10 square feet (0.9 square meters)."

[12] X Research source If that doesn’t work, try one of these options: [13] X Research source Gently buff the stain with a dab of mayonnaise or petroleum jelly. If the stain is stubborn, let the mayo or petroleum jelly sit on the spot for a few hours or even overnight before wiping it away. Use a soft cloth to rub a little white, non-gel toothpaste into the stain, moving with the grain of the wood. Wipe the paste away with a damp cloth when you’re done, then dry the area. For set-in water stains, put a few drops of lemon oil on the area. Then, carefully rub the stain with very fine grade steel wool, moving in the direction of the wood grain.

      "content": "Brighten oil-based white paints with sunlight. While you might have heard that too much light can cause white furniture to yellow, the opposite is true in some cases. If your white furniture is finished with an oil-based paint, put it in a well-lit or sunny area to reverse any yellowing and restore it to its former glory. [14] X Research source If you can’t put your furniture in a sunny spot, artificial light will work as well. Place a lamp near the item and leave it on during the day to keep the area well lit. Oil-based paints may yellow without regular exposure to light, which helps break down compounds in the paint that can yellow over time. On the other hand, sunlight can cause some types of wood or wood finishes to darken or become yellow. If you’re not sure how light will affect your furniture, consult a wood repair or restoration expert for advice. Maintenance tip: Try to arrange white furniture with any other type of paint or finish away from areas with prolonged exposure to direct sunlight (like near windows), since this can contribute to yellowing over time."
