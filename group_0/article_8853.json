Once you’ve chosen your perfect theme, follow these party-centric pieces of advice to make sure that your event goes as smoothly as possible: [25] X Research source Invest in a good sound system: Look into renting speakers if you don’t have adequate ones already, and make sure to prepare a playlist ahead of time. Have sufficient seating and bathrooms: Ensure that guests will have comfortable places to sit and chat, and do your best to give access to as many bathrooms as possible (and make sure the lines are moving throughout the night). Keep the lighting low: At a college or frat-style party, no one wants to have blinding fluorescent lights on them while they’re getting down on the dance floor. Get warm, dimmable lights to set the vibe for your shindig. Prioritize safety: Make sure people aren’t driving while intoxicated and that everyone has a buddy at the party. Ask a few close friends to help you keep an eye on the crowd to make sure everyone’s staying safe. Provide hearty snacks and plenty of water: Especially if people are drinking alcohol, make sure to have enough filling snacks (like ones with carbs) and water. Hire a student photographer: If you have the budget, hire a local student photographer or ask a friend with photog skills to snap some photos throughout the night."
