Twist the front strand over and around the back. The back strand is now in front. Grab another small sub-section of hair, similar in size to the first, and it to the strand currently in front. Twist the front strand over and around the back. Repeat this step until you are satisfied with the length of the twist braid. Insert several pins into the end of the braid to secure it in place."
