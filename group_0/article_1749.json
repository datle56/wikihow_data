[1] X Research source They’re not a place you can actually go, but they are fun to think and theorize about. Many say The Backrooms evoke eerie feelings of disorientation and isolation that can’t quite be put into words, which might explain their popularity and ability to capture people’s imaginations."

      "content": "The Backrooms are a fictional place made entirely of empty rooms. They were originally described as an endless space of monotonous yellow rooms with musty old carpet. Harsh fluorescent lights hum on the ceilings, and the rooms are entirely empty of any objects or distinguishing features. That said, it’s implied that if you find yourself there, you may not be alone—something lurks within the rooms, and it can hear you wander through them. [2] X Research source The Backrooms have been described as a sort of fictional “liminal space,” which is a place that has no real purpose of its own, or which you travel through to get to another, and which often evokes strange feelings—think empty airport terminals or deserted buildings.

      "content": "People get to The Backrooms by glitching through reality. “No-clipping” is a phenomenon in video games where the player accidentally slips through the game world due to a bug, revealing the “behind-the-scenes” framework of the video game environment. It’s said that people get to The Backrooms when they no-clip through the fabric of reality. [4] X Research source This implies that The Backrooms are some sort of hidden area of our current reality, similar to the back rooms of a restaurant or office building, hence the name. Of course, you can’t actually no-clip through reality; it’s just a creepypasta, after all."

The original creepypasta doesn’t say how, or if, you can escape, but fan-made creepypastas sometimes center on finding a way out. It’s said that The Way Out, as it’s called, appears randomly to those who find themselves in The Backrooms. It takes a different form for everyone—a door, a staircase, an elevator—but is always bathed in glowing light. [5] X Research source"

An anonymous user on 4chan, a popular message board, started a thread where users posted “disquieting images” that feel “off” somehow. One user posted an image of what appeared to be a beige-yellow indoor environment lacking any notable features. Another user responded to the image with the following bit of flash fiction, sparking the creation of The Backrooms: [6] X Research source \"If you're not careful and you noclip out of reality in the wrong areas, you'll end up in the Backrooms, where it's nothing but the stink of old moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz, and approximately six hundred million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in. God save you if you hear something wandering around nearby, because it sure as hell has heard you”"
