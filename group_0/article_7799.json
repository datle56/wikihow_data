Use a soft cloth to dry your pieces of gold. If the gold is still dirty, then repeat steps one through four, or use a different method. Also, try to avoid scrubbing the gold with a toothbrush to clean it; you may accidentally scratch it by scrubbing it with baking soda and a toothbrush. Do not use this method for pieces of gold that contain pearls and gemstones. The combination of baking soda and vinegar may damage them."
