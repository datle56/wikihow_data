      "content": "Choose between a DIY or salon treatment. You can expect to pay between $100 and $500 for a single keratin treatment at a salon. [1] X Research source Doing a keratin treatment yourself won’t give you custom results since at-home treatments don’t evaluate your individual hair type. At-home treatments tend to be less damaging but last for a shorter amount of time. [2] X Research source For example, if you have a light hair color, a salon professional can adjust the formula so that the tonality of your hair shade doesn’t change. If you decide to go with a stylist, schedule a consultation first so they can determine the appropriate formula for your hair."

      "content": "Check reviews. Whether you opt for a salon or an at-home kit, make sure to go online and read user reviews before committing. Prioritize quality over looking for a good deal. If you know someone who’s had a keratin treatment, ask them for a referral, including the brand of solution and the salon/stylist they went to, if applicable. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Understand the process.",
      "content": "Understand the process. “Keratin” doesn’t actually smooth hair; the treatment does. During the treatment, a keratin hair straightening product is applied to your hair, and the heat of a flat iron is used to seal it in. This results in smoother, straighter hair."

      "title": "Stay away from formaldehyde-releasing treatments.",
      "content": "Stay away from formaldehyde-releasing treatments. Some keratin treatments contain ingredients that release formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is a chemical that can cause health problems, such as eye and nasal irritation, allergic reactions of the skin, eyes, and lungs, and can even cause cancer. There are a variety of treatments that use alternatives to formaldehyde. Check the product label or ask a salon professional if you want to ensure that the treatment is formaldehyde-free. [4] X Research source Since formaldehyde is used in higher amounts in salons, it can be hazardous to those who work with it often. DMDM hydantoin, glyoxal, imidazolidinyl urea, diazolidinyl urea, methyl glycol, polyoxymethylene urea, quaternium-15, and sodium hydroxymethylglycinate are all formaldehyde releaser chemicals that may be found in hair care products. [5] X Research source Treatments without toxic chemicals are less effective at softening hair curl patterns."

      "content": "Wash your hair with an anti-residue shampoo. Massage the shampoo into your hair and work up a lather. Let it sit for three to five minutes, then rinse it out. Apply the shampoo one more time. Make sure to rinse it completely out of your hair afterward. Don't apply any hair conditioner or mask. Just leave your hair clean. [6] X Research source Anti-residue shampoo is formulated to remove buildup from your tresses, such as from conditioners or styling products. This will prepare your hair to absorb the keratin treatment evenly. Anti-residue shampoo is sometimes called “clarifying shampoo.”"

      "content": "Blow dry your hair until it’s completely dry. Run your hands through your hair as you blow dry on a medium heat setting. Make sure that your hair is entirely dry unless your product’s directions state otherwise. A Brazilian treatment requires your hair to be slightly damp (85-90% dry), whereas a keratin treatment requires fully dry hair. Since the terms “Brazilian” and “keratin” (as they relate to hair treatments) are sometimes used interchangeably, it’s important to check with your product’s instructions."

When your flat iron reaches the correct temperature, straighten your hair in small sections (about one to two inches thick). You may want to clip up sections of your hair beforehand or as you finish straightening them. [10] X Research source Using a flat iron that is too hot may scorch your hair and cause breakage."

Try a fabric bandanna if you want to keep your hair out of your face. [12] X Research source Using hair ties or clips may cause a crease in your hair. However, this may not be the case if you wear a hair tie loosely. After your treatment, use a satin or silk pillowcase to protect your hair and keep it smooth and silky at night while you sleep."
