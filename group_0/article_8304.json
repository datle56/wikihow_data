The care label could tell you to hand-wash the jacket, to machine wash it on a special cycle, or to take the jacket to a professional down cleaner. If your jacket only needs a minor cleaning, the pre-cleaning alone might be sufficient, and you might not need to fully wash or hand wash."

To clean your down jacket, use the same down-safe soap that you used for spot cleaning. When down feathers are stripped of their oil, they can lose their loft, or fullness, which is related to their ability to insulate. [9] X Research source"

[16] X Research source Be warned that the drying process can take up to three hours, but do not increase the heat above low. Higher heat can damage or melt parts of the jacket. [17] X Research source Tumble drying is the recommended method for drying down jackets, because air drying can take so long, and eventually the jacket can start to smell.
