    {
      "title": "Rough dry your hair.",
      "content": "Rough dry your hair. If you already blow dry your hair, the way you position your blow dryer may be contributing to your frizzy hair. When drying your hair, shake the dryer over your head, back and forth, until your hair is 80% dry. [1] X Research source Keep your blow dryer’s nozzle face down, otherwise your hair will frizz. When hair is 80% finished, apply a smoothing or anti-frizz serum, before completing your blow out. For the ultimate smooth, polished look, use a boar bristle brush. If your hair is on the finer side, use a round brush while you blow it dry to help straighten it."

      "title": "Utilize serums.",
      "content": "Utilize serums. Spray a thermal protectant on your hands before rubbing it through your hair. When rubbing the protectant through your hair, steer clear of the roots. Covering your roots with product is a surefire way to make them greasy. Typically, a little bit of serum goes a long way. Start with just a little bit, and then add a little more if necessary. Perform this step before blow drying or straightening your hair. The serum will help protect your hair from all the heat. Use serums only on the days when you're applying heat to your hair. Do not use serums when your hair is already dry and straight."

      "title": "Straighten your hair with a flat iron.",
      "content": "Straighten your hair with a flat iron. Brush the hair, then use a ceramic iron to gently glide over the hair, without applying too much pressure. Do not clamp the iron down on any of the sections of hair. [2] X Research source The coarser your hair is, the higher the temperature on your iron should be. If you have thinner or finer hair, heat your iron to 300 or 350 degrees, max. [3] X Research source Divide your hair into sections before straightening. This will accelerate the straightening process, and help prevent you from going over the same sections of hair multiple times. If you own hair clips, use the clips to hold the hair you're not currently straightening out of your way. Try to grab 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of hair in each section if your hair is coarse, and 1 inch (2.5 cm) if your hair is fine."

      "title": "Straighten your hair with a curling iron.",
      "content": "Straighten your hair with a curling iron. Brush your hair and section it off as you would if you were using a straightening iron. Grab a section of hair and clamp the curling iron down on the hair, so the iron is facing the floor; this will keep your hair from crimping. Hold the bottom of your hair taut to create tension and slowly run your iron down the length of your hair. Repeat this motion for your entire head. [4] X Research source Hold the iron at the bottom of your hair for an additional two seconds to really straighten the ends of your hair. Go slowly, especially near your face, to avoid burning yourself."

      "title": "Brush your hair dry.",
      "content": "Brush your hair dry. After a shower, allow your hair to air dry, but continue to brush it every five minutes. Divide your hair into sections and brush each section, pulling the hair away from your head to encourage it to straighten. [5] X Research source To get your hair to dry straight faster, perform this process in front of a fan. If you utilize the fan method, brush your hair continuously throughout the process."

      "title": "Wrap your hair before bed.",
      "content": "Wrap your hair before bed. Wash your hair before going to sleep. While your hair is still wet, comb and part your hair down the center. Take the left half of your hair, wrap it around the back of your head, and secure it to the right side with bobby-pins. Do the same thing with the right half of your hair. [6] X Research source To reduce frizz, wrap a scarf or towel around your hair to sleep in. This method tends to work best if you sleep on your back or stomach."

      "title": "Create an all-natural straightening mask.",
      "content": "Create an all-natural straightening mask. Mix one cup of whole or coconut milk with one tablespoon of honey. Soak your scalp and hair in the mixture for one hour before washing the mixture out of your hair. [7] X Research source You can create a similar mixture by combining 2 cups of milk with one egg. Allow the mixture to soak in your hair for ten minutes. Squeeze out the excess moisture, contain your hair in a shower cap, and wait another 30 minutes before washing and brushing your hair. Add a few drops of coconut oil or almond oil to all of the aforementioned masks to further your fight against frizz."

      "title": "Use hair rollers.",
      "content": "Use hair rollers. Wash your hair before going to bed and while your hair is still damp, divide the hair into sections. Roll each section using large hair rollers and secure the rollers to your head using bobby-pins. Sleep with your hair rolled and in the morning, let it out for a straight and voluminous look. [8] X Research source Make sure hair has dried completely before unrolling your rollers. If hair has even the smallest amount of moisture still remaining, it will likely curl and frizz. The rollers should be approximately the size of soda cans. If your hair is too short for rollers that big, use the biggest rollers that your hair will fit around."

      "title": "Start straightening in the shower.",
      "content": "Start straightening in the shower. Your shampoo and conditioner can’t straighten your hair automatically, but they can give you a leg up. Purchase hair products that guarantee “smoothing.” After conditioning your hair, use a paddle brush to evenly distribute the conditioner, before rinsing out your hair. [9] X Research source When drying hair, do not rub your hair with a towel. Instead, gently pat hair to absorb the moisture. Use a microfiber towel, such as a Deva Towel, or a t-shirt to dry your hair instead of using a regular towel. These are softer alternatives that help fight frizz.

      "title": "Wait until your hair is completely dry before using an iron.",
      "content": "Wait until your hair is completely dry before using an iron. If you hear your hair sizzling, it’s likely still damp and you should stop straightening immediately to avoid damaging your hair. If your hair is dry when you straighten it and you’re still not getting the results you want, you may be using too much product. [11] X Research source Only apply product to damp hair, never dry hair. The iron traps the product in dry hair, causing you to boil the product inside your hair follicles. The more heat you use on your hair, the less products you should use. Try to limit your product usage to one or two serums, applied directly to damp hair."

      "title": "Put your damp hair in a bun before bed.",
      "content": "Put your damp hair in a bun before bed. This method works best for those with hair that is frizzy, but not wavy. After your shower, put your hair in a ponytail. Twist your ponytail like a rope to wrap your hair into a bun. Secure your bun with an elastic and sleep with your bun in. [13] X Research source In the morning, allow the hair to air dry for a few minutes before brushing the hair out. Use a fabric elastic rather than a rubber band, so you won't be left with a crimp in your hair."
