The basic parenthetical includes the author's name and the page number where the material used can be found. If the book has 2 authors, include both of their last names with \"and\" in between them. For 3 or more authors, use the last name of the first author followed by \"et al.\" [5] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source For example, you might write: \"Despite the lack of historical evidence for Robin Hood, many people believe that he was a real person (Locksley and Pendragon 42).\" If you mention the authors in the text of your paper, you don't have to repeat their names in the parenthetical. However, you still need a parenthetical with the page number.
