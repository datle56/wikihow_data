      "title": "Banana water is made by steeping banana peels in water.",
      "content": "Banana water is made by steeping banana peels in water. It's popular as a DIY plant fertilizer thanks to bananas’ high potassium content. Some people also drink banana peel tea for its supposed health benefits. A simple, straightforward recipe for hot banana water recently went viral, with some people questioning its authenticity because of how odd the recipe is (more on that later)."

      "title": "There may be some benefits, but they’re not proven.",
      "content": "There may be some benefits, but they’re not proven. Bananas do contain potassium, which is an essential nutrient for plants. They also contain small amounts of phosphorus and nitrogen, which plants also need. However, there’s no scientific proof that steeping banana peels in water extracts these nutrients, and most plants need a more balanced fertilizer than you can't get by only using banana peels. [1] X Research source A balanced commercial fertilizer—like one with an NPK of 10-10-10 or 4-3-4 —is probably better for your plants. Bananas are packed with sugar and carbohydrates. When you use banana water on your plants, those sugars and carbs could attract fungi and small pests like gnats. [2] X Research source Diluting the banana water may help prevent pests if you do decide to use it. Adding banana peels to your compost pile is probably more effective at extracting the nutrients than using banana water. You’re more likely to extract the nutrients in banana peels by allowing them to compost naturally. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Chop your banana peels into pieces to help them break down faster.",
      "content": "Chop your banana peels into pieces to help them break down faster. It’s up to you how large or small you want to cut the banana peels—you can roughly chop them into 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) pieces if you’d like, or add them to a food processor to break them down into smaller pieces. Some people skip this step, so if you want to add your banana peels whole, that’s okay. [4] X Research source The banana peels might break down a little faster if they’re in small pieces, but very small pieces may also be more difficult to strain."

      "title": "Add the banana peels to a container of water.",
      "content": "Add the banana peels to a container of water. Place your banana peels into the container. Then, add enough water to fill the container almost all the way full. Making banana water for plants isn’t an exact science, so there’s no need to measure anything. If you’re only using one or two banana peels, you might use a smaller container, like a 32 fl oz (950 ml) mason jar . If you have a lot of banana peels, you can use a larger container, like a 5 US gal (19 l) bucket. If you’d like, you can keep a container filled with water, then toss in a new banana peel every time you eat a banana. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Cover the container and let it sit for a week or more.",
      "content": "Cover the container and let it sit for a week or more. Seal the lid tightly—banana water doesn’t smell very good. Covering the container may also help prevent the mixture from developing mold. Place the container somewhere it won’t be disturbed, then wait at least 2–3 days, or until the banana peels turn black. [6] X Research source Some people prefer to let their banana water sit for weeks or even months before they use it. [7] X Research source Stirring the mixture occasionally may help the banana peels break down. If the container is small enough, you can just shake it, instead."

      "content": "Boil the banana water if you want it to be extra strong. After you’ve soaked the banana peels for at least a few days, you can create a banana peel tea from the mixture to help break down the peels even more. Pour the banana water into a large pot, then bring it to a boil. Allow it to boil for about 30 or 45 minutes, then let it cool and strain it. [8] X Research source If you boil the banana water, dilute it with 1 part banana peel tea to 5 parts water before you put it on your plants."

      "title": "Strain the water and discard the banana peels.",
      "content": "Strain the water and discard the banana peels. Once the water is a dark brown color, pour the banana water through a strainer to remove the pieces of banana peel. [9] X Research source Throw out the banana peels or place them in your compost pile. Keep in mind that the banana water will probably have a strong, unpleasant smell when you open the container."

[10] X Research source Use the same amount of water as you normally would, and water your plants with the same frequency. Some people believe that spraying banana water on your plant might help prevent aphids. [11] X Research source However, the high sugar content in banana water means it's probably more likely to attract pests than repel them. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut the top and bottom off of a banana peel. Wash the peel of the banana thoroughly, then carefully slice the ends off of the banana with a sharp knife. Toss these pieces in the trash or put them in your compost pile. Remove the peel from the banana and set the fruit aside. [14] X Research source If you’d like, you can leave the fruit of the banana inside the peel. [15] X Research source This may make a more flavorful tea. If you’re only using banana peels and you’re not going to eat the bananas right away, cut them into thick slices, add them to a resealable plastic bag, and put them in the freezer for later."

To avoid burning yourself, use tongs to carefully lower the peel into the water. Leave the peel in the boiling water for up to 5 minutes. [16] X Research source The banana peel will start to turn brown when it’s ready. If you prefer, you can pour hot water over the banana peel and let it steep for about 10 minutes.

Drink the banana water while it’s still warm. [18] X Research source If you included the fruit of the banana, you’ll probably need to strain the mixture. If you’d like, add honey, maple syrup, vanilla, cinnamon, or nutmeg to taste. You can also add in a splash of milk, almond milk, or oat milk."

The simple recipe and satirical comments naturally had people wondering if it's a real thing, and AllRecipes even used the recipe for an April Fools' video on their YouTube channel.
