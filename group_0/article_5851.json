Both signs will be excited to put in the work, doing whatever it takes to make their partner feel good. It’ll be a mutually generous, passionate affair. Both of you: to turn the heat even more, let yourself be a little vulnerable. The one thing that could negatively effect you here would be if you're unwilling to be honest about what you want. Communication is key! Capricorn, Virgo, share your fantasies! By being open about your desires, you’re not showing weakness, you’re creating even more room for steamy connections."

These two are hard-working, serious, and unstoppable. And luckily, they love that their partner is the same way (which means that they’ll support their dreams, not gripe over their partners' absence). But if your schedules get a little busy, why not look for ways to grind side by side? Choose a goal that works for both of you, then work on it together.

      "content": "They may struggle to get their relationship off the ground. Virgo and Capricorn are both super respectful, deliberate people. Neither one is likely to throw caution to the wind, even if they really like someone. Chances are, both earth signs will only act on a certainty, but because they’re both being so subtle, it’ll be impossible to tell that their crush feels the same way. Uh oh! How will they get together and finally find true love? Virgo, you can be a little, er, difficult to flirt with. If Cap has the courage to strike up a convo, don’t play hard to get. Otherwise, he might get the wrong idea. Capricorn, you like to know someone's into you before you ask them out. But with Virgo, this might not be an option. Why not be a little brave? The reward could be amazing! Both of you, keep your focus on your crush. Cap and Virgo won't mess around with flirts and players, so if either of you tries to play the field, that could risk your budding relationship."
