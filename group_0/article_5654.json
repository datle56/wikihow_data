      "content": "Protect yourself during an attack. If you are actively being attacked by an aggressive cat, you should protect yourself the best you can. Remember that a cat's best weapons are its teeth and its claws, so try to avoid contact with both. Your best option is to stay away from the cat and avoid handling it if possible. If you must touch the cat, try to hold it by the scruff so that it can't get you with its claws or teeth. You can also try to wrap it in a towel or blanket, as this can disable the animal. Shield your most vulnerable body parts with your arms if a cat is trying to latch on to you. Your most sensitive areas should be prioritized, including your eyes and face."

      "title": "Move away from the cat.",
      "content": "Move away from the cat. If a cat is exhibiting body language that is aggressive or striking out at you, you should move away from it. Getting out of striking distance can keep you safe and reduce the animal's anxiety as well. Moving closer to reassure the cat or to try to calm it down will likely only increase its defensiveness. This may result in an even more aggressive attack. Avoid looking directly into the cat's eyes, as this is a sign of an aggressive challenge. If the cat is in your lap when it becomes aggressive, stand up so that the cat falls away from you. Then quickly move away from the cat."

      "content": "Interrupt aggressive behavior. If possible, sidetrack a cat that is acting aggressively. Sometimes this can be done by engaging it with a toy it likes. You can also make a sharp noise that will scare or shock it, such as a clap or a hiss. You can also drop something that will make noise on the floor, such as a container full of pennies. A noise maker like this is good to have on hand if you have a cat that becomes aggressive often. If the cat is fixated on a specific thing, try to break eye contact. Put something between the cat and what it becoming aggressive towards."

      "title": "Break up a fight without getting involved.",
      "content": "Break up a fight without getting involved. If your cat is acting aggressively towards another animal, you should try to break up the fight and move the other animal to a safe space. However, you should never get in between the animals, as this is dangerous for you and could result in injury. In many cases, this can be done by giving the animals an escape route away from the fight, such as by opening a door. You can also try surprising the aggressive cat to disorient it by throwing a towel or a bucket of water onto it. This should give you the chance to get the other animal out of the situation. It is important to protect all your animals from fighting. You should not let them simply fight it out. This can lead to serious injuries and hard feelings between the animals in the long term. [1] X Research source It is especially important to separate animals that you are trying to acclimate to each other, such as when you add a new pet to your home. A fight early on in their relationship can make it strained well into the future. Try putting something between the fighting cats that will stop them from making contact with each other. For example, a pillow can be placed between the animals before they make physical contact."

Even light physical punishment, such as bopping the animal on its nose, can increase its anxiety. Instead of reducing aggression, this type of reaction can increase its severity. Never hit a cat. An aggressive cat needs your help, not more aggression added to the situation."

      "title": "Give the cat its own space.",
      "content": "Give the cat its own space. After an aggressive episode, it's best to let the cat decompress and calm down on its own. Don't interact with it until it has calmed down and it comes to you for interaction or attention. You may even want to keep it sequestered in a room by itself with food, water, and a litter box. However, some cats will not like this and it will increase their aggression. Some cats just simply need to be left alone a lot of the time. If you have a moody cat that simply wants to be left alone, give that to them. Give them their own space where they can be away from people and other animals in your home, such as a spare bedroom. Make sure each room in your home has a hiding place, such as a cardboard box, where the cat can retreat. Hiding helps cats deal with stress."

If your cat feels sick, it may act out with aggression to let you know that it is ill. To eliminate this as a possible cause of your cat's aggression, have your cat examined by its veterinarian.

If you have figured out that your cat's aggression has a specific cause, make any possible adjustments that will eliminate the cause.

      "content": "Reward good behavior. As you are trying to change your cat's behavior, it is important to let the animal know when it is doing a good job. Rewarding the cat with treats or a game it likes to play when it is acting nicely is a good way of showing it the right kind of behavior. For example, if your cat gets aggressive when it is petted for too long, reward it when it doesn't exhibit this behavior. Pet it lightly for a few moments in your lap and before the interaction goes awry set it on the floor. Then give it a treat for its good behavior. If you repeat this process, the cat will eventually learn that it gets something it likes if it does not strike out in anger."
