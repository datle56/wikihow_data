Think about who your parents enjoy being around. You might consider family members, close friends of the family, and even coworkers. Also, think about the size of your house. You don't want to overload the house with too many people. In addition, think about how much money to spend. While you can throw a party on a budget, you do need to think about how many people you can reasonably invite. [1] X Research source If the weather will be nice, consider having the party outside in your backyard or in a common area of your apartment complex. You may be able to invite more people than if you have it inside. [2] X Research source Send out invitations 2 months in advance. If you want it to be a surprise, make sure you emphasize that in your invitation. Include the date, the time, and reason you're celebrating. If you want, you can use the internet to invite people.

You could also cook one of your parents' favorite dishes. [4] X Research source In fact, you can ask guests to bring a dish instead of bringing a gift! Make sure you provide food for people with dietary restrictions, so include a few vegetarian/vegan and gluten-free options.
