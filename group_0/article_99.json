      "content": "The Bible says not to rely on hidden signs or messages. It’s tempting to live your life based on signs and omens, but the Bible warns against relying on things like angel numbers or numerology to give your life direction. In Genesis 3, Adam and Eve are punished for pursuing hidden knowledge, and Deuteronomy 18 warns against divining. [9] X Research source Instead, use angel numbers or other apparent “signs” as reminders to turn your mind toward God. That said, it is true that God loves symbolism in numbers, such as the 3 members of the Trinity, the demonic 666 in Revelations, or Jesus spending 40 days in the desert and then later ascending after 40 days. God may use numbers to enhance our understanding of scripture."
