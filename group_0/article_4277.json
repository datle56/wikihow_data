If you add up all three, you get the total macro calories per meal. [9] X Research source Use an online calculator to work out your daily macros. Many bodybuilders follow the 40-40-20 plan, a low-fat, high-protein diet for bodybuilders that is 40% protein, 40% carbs, and 20% fat. [10] X Research source There is no one-size-fits-all ratio for determining daily macros.

Store to-be-frozen meals in resealable freezer-safe containers or Ziploc bags. Label each container with a name and date so you can keep track of its freshness. If possible, use a vacuum sealer machine to extend freezing times and overall quality preservation. [14] X Research source Before freezing, combine food combinations that you can reheat together once defrosted. Separate sauces or garnishes before freezing—ice cube trays work great for this purpose. [15] X Research source Reheat food using the original cooking method. For example, if you start with baked chicken, warm it up in the oven.
