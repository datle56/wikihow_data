[2] X Research source Check or uncheck the box, depending on your needs. Here's what you need to know: Turning this feature on: You'll have two copies of each music file—one in its original location, and one in the Music folder. If you move or delete the original audio files, you won't have to worry, as there will always be a copy in the Music folder. If you have a large collection of music files, doubling the amount of disk space used by your music might be too much. If you're only adding a few songs to Apple Music and/or want to be free to move your music files, we recommend turning this feature On. Turning this feature off: Instead of making duplicate copies of each music file, Apple Music will create tiny reference files that point to the original locations. If you move or delete any of the original audio files after adding them to Apple Music, you won't be able to listen to them in Apple Music anymore. If you don't plan to move your music files at any point, and/or have a large collection of music you don't want to duplicate, we recommend turning this feature Off."

There's no way for an individual music-maker or record label to directly upload music for others to stream on Apple Music—you'll need to sign up with a distributor like CD Baby, TuneCore, or Distrokid. A distributor is a company that gets your music onto streaming platforms like Apple Music, Spotify , and Tidal. Apple maintains a list of preferred distributors, and you can check out that list at https://artists.apple.com/partners . [8] X Research source Other distributors can also get your music onto Apple Music but may not be considered \"preferred\" by Apple. Once you sign up with a distributor, they'll provide instructions for uploading your music and explain all the requirements. If you're confused about the process, contact the distributor's customer support team. Distributors usually have per-song or per-album fees or a single subscription rate. Make sure to edit the metadata (ID3 tags) of your finished songs to include Apple's required information, which you can find at https://help.apple.com/itc/musicstyleguide/en.lproj/static.html ."
