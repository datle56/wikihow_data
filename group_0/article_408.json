    {
      "title": "Ask for anything you want, whenever you want.",
      "content": "Ask for anything you want, whenever you want. Spoiled people have no problem asking for anything and everything they want at any time. If you see something in a store that you want, ask the person you’re with to buy it for you. If someone has something that you want, ask them to give it to you. If you want someone to do you a favor, just ask them. [1] X Research source You might say, \"Dad, don't you want to buy me those new designer sneakers? They're limited edition!\" Or you could say, \"I know it's the middle of the night, but I'm craving chocolate ice cream. Can you go buy it for me?\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Demand to get what you want if asking doesn’t work.",
      "content": "Demand to get what you want if asking doesn’t work. Asking for something is really just a polite demand, since you fully expect to get everything you ask for! If you ask for something and you don’t get it, take it up a notch and make demands. You don't want it, you need it; it’s not an option. [2] X Research source For example, if you ask your parents to buy you a new car for your 16th birthday and they refuse, say something like, “All my friends are getting new cars! You have to get me one or I won't fit in.” If your boyfriend says he can’t pick up your dry cleaning, say something like, “Well, it wasn’t really a question. It’ll be ready at 5pm.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Expect all of your demands to be met immediately.",
      "content": "Expect all of your demands to be met immediately. Spoiled people expect all of their desires to be granted right away, and anything less is unacceptable! After asking or demanding something, look expectantly at the other person, as if you’re waiting for them to give you what you want on the spot. [3] X Research source For example, if your significant other agrees to make your lunch but then continues on with whatever they’re doing, you can say, “Umm, I meant right now.” Then, look pointedly at your wristwatch. If you’re asked to wait for a table at an expensive restaurant, tell the hostess, “I want a table immediately. If you can’t do that, I want to talk to your manager right now.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Insist on the most expensive option in every scenario.",
      "content": "Insist on the most expensive option in every scenario. Money is no object to a spoiled brat – specifically, other people’s money! Expect the best, no matter what. This applies to clothes, colleges, vacations, material possessions, and everything in between. [4] X Research source If you have the choice between a name brand item and an off-brand item, always go with a name brand."
    },
    {
      "title": "Negotiate no matter what the circumstance.",
      "content": "Negotiate no matter what the circumstance. Refuse to take “no” for an answer. If you’re not given what you want, try to wheedle it out of the person. Think of something the other person wants or needs from you, then use it as leverage. This works best on parents, but you can try it on anyone. [5] X Research source For example, you might say, “If you get me a new car for my birthday, I’ll study harder and raise my GPA before the semester is over.” You could also take the opposite approach and say, “If you don’t get me a new car, I won’t study for the rest of the semester. If I flunk this year, it’s your fault!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t say thank you when you get what you want.",
      "content": "Don’t say thank you when you get what you want. Most spoiled people take others for granted and can't be bothered with saying “thank you” or acting grateful. They feel entitled to getting everything they want and they shouldn't have to thank anyone for it. If you get what you want, don't change your facial expression or say anything that makes it seem like you're thankful. [6] X Research source This isn't a good way to treat someone you care about, by the way! But if you want to act spoiled, this is the general vibe you should project."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask for more after you get what you want.",
      "content": "Ask for more after you get what you want. If you get exactly what you wanted, don’t be afraid to up the ante immediately and ask for more. Granting your original desire is the bare minimum, after all. In a spoiled person's mind, their expectations should be met immediately, and then exceeded. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "React in disbelief if things don’t go your way.",
      "content": "React in disbelief if things don’t go your way. Spoiled people expect others to fall over themselves to fulfill their needs. The possibility of not getting what they want usually doesn't cross their mind. If you ask for something and you don't get it, act incredulous, like being told “no” is absolutely unheard of. [8] X Research source For example, open your eyes wide and say, “Seriously?!” in the most offended tone you can muster."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get angry or lash out if you don’t get what you want.",
      "content": "Get angry or lash out if you don’t get what you want. Most spoiled people have no problem with emotional outbursts. If you don’t get what you want, slam the door or say something overly dramatic. [9] X Research source If you want to be really childish, stomp your foot! For instance, you might say, “If we don’t go on that cruise with our friends, I will never forgive you!” Then, storm off and slam the bedroom door. Passive-aggressive behavior can also work. For example, you might give someone the cold shoulder to “get back at them” for not giving you what you want. [10] X Research source Keep in mind that this behavior can really upset the other person. Don't go too far."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a scene in public until the other person caves.",
      "content": "Make a scene in public until the other person caves. If you get angry behind closed doors or fight about something in whispers, you might not get what you want. Raise your voice so that people around start looking in your direction. Tremble and be on the verge of tears. In fact, go ahead and burst into tears! Humiliating someone in public to get what you want is pretty awful, but if you’re determined to act spoiled, their feelings don’t really matter. At least, not more than yours! This isn't a healthy way to behave, so don't make a habit of it. If the other person seems frightened or alarmed, you should probably give it a rest."
    },
    {
      "title": "Whine incessantly if getting angry doesn’t work.",
      "content": "Whine incessantly if getting angry doesn’t work. Angry outbursts don’t work on everyone and can even have the opposite effect on some people. If you find yourself in this situation, don’t be afraid to complain, beg, or cry until they just break down and give you what you want. Try to make them feel sorry for you, or just wear them down by pleading nonstop. [11] X Research source Pestering someone until they give you what you want is not guaranteed to work. The other person could just lose their patience or get angry with you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Speak all of your thoughts with no filter.",
      "content": "Speak all of your thoughts with no filter. Say whatever you want, whenever you want. Interrupt other people when they’re talking if you need something from them. Blatantly talk about your needs without considering anyone else in the room. Tell your parents what you really think about them if they refuse you. Don't hold back! [12] X Research source Fair warning: most people are going to react very badly to this behavior."
    },
    {
      "title": "Assume that your bad behavior will be overlooked.",
      "content": "Assume that your bad behavior will be overlooked. No matter how spoiled you act, expect other people to deal with it. Act like you should be forgiven for all of your outbursts and tantrums immediately. You can also just pretend your bad behavior never happened and carry on like normal. [13] X Research source Keep in mind that very few people will actually overlook this type of behavior."
    },
    {
      "title": "Control your emotions when things don't go your way.",
      "content": "Control your emotions when things don't go your way. Unnecessary emotional meltdowns are unhealthy for you and toxic for everyone around you. No one likes to be put in upsetting situations or treated badly by a spoiled person. Throwing a tantrum could just end up creating resentment and awkwardness, and you won't even get the results you're after. [14] X Research source Reacting poorly when you don't get what you want usually makes other people unwilling to help you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be patient when you ask for things.",
      "content": "Be patient when you ask for things. Expecting instant gratification is unrealistic! Instead of expecting your requests to be fulfilled immediately, work on being patient with other people. Patience could be the key to getting exactly what you want, and you won't even have to act spoiled or hurt the other person in the process. [15] X Research source For example, your parents may fully intend to get you a new car, but they can't do it until the end of the year. Instead of demanding the car immediately, give your parents some time to get everything in order."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be considerate instead of making it all about you.",
      "content": "Be considerate instead of making it all about you. It's easy to forget that the world doesn't revolve around you, especially if you're caught up in the moment or feeling emotional about something. Instead of expecting others to drop everything and pay attention to you, consider what they might be dealing with in their own lives. [16] X Research source For example, you expect your mom to pick you up from school every day without fail, but she might have an important doctor's appointment or something else she needs to do. You could offer to take the bus that day, or at least be okay with it if she asks you to."
    },
    {
      "title": "Say \"thank you\" and don't take others for granted.",
      "content": "Say \"thank you\" and don't take others for granted. Be respectful and say \"thank you\" when you get what you want. Other people will appreciate your gratefulness, and they'll also be more inclined to help you in the future if they know you won't take them for granted. For example, if your parents get you the new car you've been wanting, you could say, \"I love it! Thank you so much, I can't wait to show my friends!\""
