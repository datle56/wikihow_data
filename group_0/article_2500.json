To bathe your Shih Tzu puppy, you'll need puppy shampoo , puppy conditioner , a pin brush for small dogs , a grooming comb , a clean towel, a washcloth, cotton balls , a small hair dryer , and puppy treats . When everything is close by and easy to reach, you can keep the bath running smoothly without having to run and grab anything halfway through. [1] X Research source If you plan to groom your puppy after the bath, you'll also need canine nail clippers and ear cleaner. Generally, the best shampoos for a Shih Tzu contain all-natural ingredients. Look for soap-free dog shampoo designed to soothe and hydrate your puppy's sensitive skin, and consult your veterinarian for their opinion.

      "content": "Set up a bathing area by laying down a bath mat or towel. Since Shih Tzus are small, you can easily bathe them in a sink or bathtub. Pick where you want to have the bath and spread a rubber bath mat or towel on the floor of the bathing area; either will keep your pup comfortable by giving them a good foothold in the tub, so they don't slip while getting the bath. [3] X Research source Ensure the sink or tub is clean before bathing your Shih Tzu puppy. Clear out any leftover soap or cleaning product residue, then lay down the bathmat."

      "content": "Place small pieces of cotton in your Shih Tzu's outer ear canals. Since a dog's ear canals trap water that gets in, it's helpful to block your puppy's ears before bathing them. With the cotton in place, water is less likely to get into the ear canal and cause an ear infection. Wedge a cotton ball in the pup's outer ear canals, but don't push them too hard. Be gentle and press the cotton lightly into place. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Comb out your puppy's coat to get rid of mats and tangles. Use the pin brush to check the puppy for mats (areas of clumped fur) and smooth out their coat. When you find mats, gently untangle them with your hands and the grooming comb; avoid yanking hard on your pup's fur. Brush all the way down to the skin, smoothing the puppy's silky coat and coarser undercoat as well. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Brush down the puppy's back in the direction their fur grows, so the movements feel natural and comfortable to your Shih Tzu. Mats get even harder to brush through when the puppy's fur becomes wet, so it's best to get the coat as smooth as possible before going forward with the bath. If your puppy is prone to getting mats in their fur, you can also use a detangling spray to help smooth it out."

You don’t need to fill the tub with water since you’re spraying it over your puppy. Avoid their face and ears for now; you'll have the chance to clean those individually later. Gently hold your pup's head up to avoid getting their face wet. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source If your dog doesn't like the showerhead or you don't have one, fill a pitcher with lukewarm water and pour it over them instead. A gentle stream of water is best because it helps your puppy relax and get comfortable with the sensation of running water on their body. When it's time for the bath, bring your puppy to the bathing area rather than trying to call them over. Go pick them up and carry them over to the sink or tub, talking to them in a quiet and soothing voice to keep them calm. Remember that dogs run a little bit warmer than humans, so a little bit more than lukewarm is okay for them. Make sure to use a gentle pressure when wetting the dog's body. Remember that it's a puppy and you shouldn't use force."

Rubbing can damage their coat and cause split ends; stick to blotting the water off instead. Once the conditioner is in place, massage the puppy's coat with your hands to distribute it evenly.

It's also a good idea to trim your puppy's nails at the end of a bathing session, especially since it's something they'd typically get at the groomer's. Using a pair of canine nail clippers , trim your puppy's nails to about 2 mm (.08 in) above the quick, which is the blood vessel that runs halfway through your puppy's nail. The pink quick is easy to identify if your puppy has light-colored or transparent nails. If they have dark nails, trim a little bit at a time and stop when you see a gray or pink oval in the cut edge of the nail—that's the quick. It also helps to start clipping your puppy's nails while they're young, so they get used to it and accept it as a part of life—just like bathing. If you're not comfortable with trimming your puppy's nails, a veterinarian or pet groomer can easily do it."
