Even if you notice that another person approaches your intended conversation mate, you can also join the two of them and start a conversation.

For example, you can say “I couldn’t help but staring at that beautiful nail color,” or “That was a beautiful talk! You are so eloquent and engaging,” or “I see you have the latest Android. I’ve been trying to get my hands on it and can’t. I’m totally jealous you have it!” Thank the person if they compliment you back. You can use this as a way to invite them to get to know you better."

Not only does this show that you’re listening closely, but also that you are interested in the person or group. Use natural pauses in the conversation to ask questions about something the person has said. You can also repeat an item as a part of your question. For example, you could say “You said that you’re headed to a remote region of Nepal for business. Where are you going? I’ve been to Nepal before and might be able to offer some tips on things to see and do.” Recognize any changes to the overall tone or demeanor, which can signal you to ask a question or offer a statement.

Make sure that you have a chance to talk and let the person or group know something about you and your interests. Allow the conversation to flow naturally and offer information at the right moment. For example, if the group is talking about something that you work on or have interest in, you could say “That’s a really interesting point, Sara. I’ve been working on a similar issue and have noticed the same patterns. Has anyone else here seen them?” Give your opinion or make statements without being overbearing or interrupting others. For example, you can say \"I see your point, but I don't share it. I believe that it's right for every person to have the same right to work.\" Make sure the information you offer about yourself is similar to what others tell about themselves. For example, if the conversation is strictly related to work, keep your comments to your professional life and don’t add anything about your personal situation. It helps some people to always have in mind five things about themselves they think are interesting, that they feel comfortable revealing and sharing.

It’s often a good idea to keep your views on politics or religion to yourself when you’re with a group or person who you don’t know. Ask honest questions if you’re unsure of something. For example, you could say “I thought stem cell research was fairly controversial within the evangelical community. Could you tell me a little bit more about it?” Remember to not say anything negative about others. If you’re among people you don’t know, you unlikely don’t know who is friends with whom. Refrain from making any negative comments or agreeing with something mean someone else says.
