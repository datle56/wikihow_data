      "content": "Check your company’s leave policy to see what’s covered. Look in the absence and leave portion of the company or employee manual to see what constitutes an emergency. Many times, you’re able to take off if you have a medical emergency or death in the family, an accident in the home, or a sick child you need to take care of. Check if there are a specified number of days you’re allowed to take for each type of emergency. [1] X Research source If the emergency requires urgent care, you can skip this and talk to your manager about the situation immediately. Leave may be paid or unpaid depending on the situation you’re experiencing and how much leave you’ve used throughout the rest of the year. If your company doesn’t have a leave policy or human resources (HR) department, then talk directly to your manager."

      "content": "Describe the emergency that needs your attention to your manager. Pull your manager aside or call them as soon as you’re able and explain what happened. Maintain a polite tone while you’re talking to them so they’re more likely to empathize with you. [2] X Research source Give them as many details as you’re comfortable explaining so they understand the urgency of the situation. [3] X Expert Source Brandy DeOrnellas, PCC, ESQ. Career & Life Transition Coach Expert Interview. 15 December 2021. For example, you may say, “This morning, my father had a heart attack and is in critical condition, so I need to be there to monitor him and help support my mother.” As another example, you could say, “My daughter’s school called and said that she needs to come home from school. My wife is traveling, and I have to step out and take care of her.” You don’t need to tell your manager a full medical diagnosis if there’s an accident or medical emergency."

If it’s a minor emergency, such as picking up someone after an accident or dropping off a child at daycare, try getting back within the day. For a more serious condition, such as a medical emergency, let them know how many days you’ll need off. [5] X Research source For example, you may say, “I plan on leaving today at lunch, and I can tentatively come back to work in 2 days, February 4th. Would that be alright?” If you don’t know how long you’ll be out from work, give your manager a time where you’ll contact them again so you can further explain the situation."

      "title": "Help delegate your work responsibilities to other employees.",
      "content": "Help delegate your work responsibilities to other employees. Ask other employees you work with to see if they can cover your shift or duties while you’re away. Try offering to take a future shift from them in exchange for them working during yours. Make sure the employee knows what you usually complete so they don’t forget anything while you’re away. [6] X Research source Your boss may also assign other employees to your duties. For example, you could say, “I can talk to Denise and Otto to help cover my paperwork and calls while I’m gone.” If you know that you’ll need to leave unexpectedly in the future, like if your partner is pregnant and they go into labor, plan with other employees a few weeks ahead of time so they can continue working on your duties while you’re away."
