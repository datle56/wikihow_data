Once something's in motion, hand it over to him—Leo is a fixed sign, which makes him great at taking over something you've started. As an Earth sign, you're best at planning and organizing. You can take the lead planning a larger project or trip, then hand off the reins to him once things get off the ground. In some areas, it might make more sense for one of you to take control simply because you know more about it. For example, if he's an expert foodie, put him in charge of picking restaurants."
