      "content": "Wash and moisturize your skin every day. If you want your makeup to look natural, you need to start with clean, hydrated skin. Every morning and every night, wash your face with a gentle facial cleanser. Then, apply a lightweight face moisturizer that’s made for your skin type , such as oily, dry, or combination. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Regular soap can be too harsh, so it may dry out your skin. Ask your parents if you can have a moisturizer with SPF to protect your skin from the sun every day."

      "content": "Start by only using 1-2 products at first. It can take a little practice to make your makeup look natural when you start wearing it, so it’s best to try out just one or two products at a time, especially if you’re trying to get away with wearing makeup without anyone noticing. If there’s an area of your face you feel self-conscious about, or if there’s something you really love that you’d like to show off, start with a product you can use there. For instance, if you think you have really pretty eyes and lips and you want to draw attention to them, you might wear a light coat of mascara and lip gloss. If you have dark circles under your eyes, you might wear a little concealer to feel more confident."

      "content": "Choose makeup that matches your skin tone . If you want your makeup to look subtle, it's important to choose a color that's as close as possible to the natural color of your skin. If it's possible, test out the makeup on the back of your hand before you buy it, since this is typically a similar color to the skin on your face. [2] X Research source You can also test the color along your jawline to ensure it blends well."

      "title": "Use concealer",
      "content": "Use concealer if you want to cover blemishes, like acne scars or dark circles. If you have a stick concealer, gently dot the end of the stick across the area you want to cover, then tap your fingers over the concealer to blend it. If you have liquid concealer, put a little on your fingertip, then tap it into place until it’s blended. [3] X Research source You’ll know the concealer is blended when you can’t see any edges anymore. If you need more coverage, you can add another light layer, but remember, you want the look to be subtle so your parents won't notice!"

      "title": "Try a tinted moisturizer if you want to even out the color of your face.",
      "content": "Try a tinted moisturizer if you want to even out the color of your face. If some parts of your face are redder or a slightly darker color than the rest of your face, a lightweight, tinted moisturizer can help your skin tone look more even. However, they’ll still look natural, so no one should be able to tell that you’re wearing anything on your face! [4] X Research source BB cream and CC cream are lightweight, moisturizing foundations that brighten your complexion and even out your skin tone. You may even be able to find a product with SPF in it to protect your skin from sun damage."

      "content": "Dust on a very light amount of powder if your skin tends to be oily. If you notice that your face looks shiny throughout the day, you may want to wear a little sheer powder to help absorb the natural oils on your face. Use the puff that comes in your powder compact to pat powder across your forehead, nose, cheeks, and chin. [5] X Research source If you can see any obvious powder left behind on your face, run the puff over it in a circular motion until it’s gone. Some powder doesn’t come with a puff, and you’ll need to apply it with a brush. If you’re trying to hide your makeup, it’s best to find a powder that already comes with the puff so you don’t have to buy a separate tool. Avoid products that are labeled as \"powder foundations,\" as these provide thicker coverage that will look more noticeable."

      "title": "Wear blush to add color and dimension to your complexion.",
      "content": "Wear blush to add color and dimension to your complexion. For the most subtle effect, look for a blush that’s about the same shade of red that your cheeks turn when you blush. This will create a soft effect that will bring out your natural beauty. If you’re using powder blush, lightly swipe the brush across the powder, then swirl the brush onto the fullest part of your cheeks, called the apples. [6] X Research source Cream and gel blushes can be very subtle, as well. Gently brush your middle or ring finger across the blush, then tap your fingertip across the apples of your cheeks until it’s blended completely."

      "content": "Wear a neutral eyeshadow if you want to even out the color on your eyelids. If your eyelids have a slightly blue or purple tinge, or if they’re uneven in color, try wearing a thin layer of a neutral-colored eyeshadow. A cream formula that’s close to your skin color will give you the most natural look, but you can wear a little powder eyeshadow in a similar shade as well. [7] X Research source If you want to add dimension, you can use a slightly lighter shade in the inner corners of your eyes. However, avoid anything too sparkly, or it will look obvious.

      "content": "Swipe on a single coat of mascara to emphasize your lashes. If your lashes are pale or short, or you just want to bring out your eyes, a coat of mascara can make your eyes look wider and brighter. Just place the wand at the base of your lashes and wiggle it slightly, then sweep it upward all the way to the tips of your lashes. You can apply a little to your bottom lashes, too, but only apply a very light coat or it will look obvious. [9] X Research source If there are any clumps in your lashes, use a cotton swab or your fingers to remove them. If you have light hair or lashes, use brown mascara, and only use black if you have naturally black hair. For an even more subtle look, curl your lashes with an eyelash curler and then apply a coat of clear mascara. You'll probably need to get eye makeup remover if you're planning on wearing brown or black mascara, because it can be hard to wash off. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Moisturize your lips with lip balm. Lipstick and lip gloss can look really obvious, but you can get a more natural effect by wearing lip balm. You may even be able to find a tinted lip balm for a subtle wash of color that won’t be super noticeable. [11] X Research source If you have chapped lips, you may be able to get your parents to agree to let you wear lip balm, even if they’re not okay with you wearing more traditional types of makeup."

      "content": "Buy makeup when you go shopping with a friend. When you get a chance to go out with a friend, look for inexpensive makeup brands that you can buy to start your collection. Try to pick colors that are close to your natural skin color for the most subtle effect. After you pay for the makeup, throw away any packaging or receipts and hide the makeup in your purse or a shopping bag. [12] X Research source If you have a debit card, withdraw cash to pay for your makeup so your parents can’t look at your statement and see what you spent. Make sure the friend you’re shopping with isn’t someone who’ll tell on you!"

For Halloween, for instance, try to come up with a costume that you would wear makeup for, like a flower child from the 70s . School plays are another great excuse to get makeup!"

      "content": "Put on your makeup on after you leave if you think they'll be able to tell. If your parents are really observant, or if you want to try out a more dramatic makeup look, you’ll probably need to put it on after you leave your home. For instance, you might do your makeup in the school bathroom before the first bell, or you could do it on the way to school if you ride the bus. [13] X Research source Avoid going overboard with your makeup even if you think your parents won't see you. They may show up wherever you are unexpectedly, and it will also be harder to clean off without leaving any traces. Remember to wash your face before you go home!"

      "content": "Don't leave your makeup laying out at home. If you don’t want your parents to know you’re wearing makeup, make sure you put it away every time you use it. Either put it away somewhere they won't look, like the bottom of a dresser drawer, or take it with you. [14] X Research source For instance, you might keep your makeup in a pencil case in your bookbag or purse. Ask a friend to keep your makeup for you if you're still afraid your parents will find it, like if you think they might go through your dresser or backpack. Make sure you give it to someone trustworthy, though, so your makeup doesn't get lost or stolen."

      "content": "Remember that disobeying your parents can get you into trouble. Before you sneak around, ask yourself if it's worth the upset if you get caught. Lying to your parents about makeup might mean they don’t trust you about other things, either, which could affect your ability to hang out with your friends or participate in your favorite activities. [15] X Research source If you do try any of these techniques, you might consider saving them for a special occasion, like a school dance or a field trip."
