When one object in a group is selected, all joined objects will also be selected and act as one object. [1] X Research source This does not modify the geometry of any of the objects. Objects do not have to be touching to be joined. Joining objects together is useful if you are dealing with complex shapes, character models , or complex scenery. It is not particularly useful for 3D printing, where the geometry of the joined objects needs to be merged into a single object."

The three types of boolean modifications are as follows: [7] X Research source Union: The Union boolean combines the primary and secondary object into a single shape. All intersecting internal geometry is removed. This is the one you use to merge objects. Difference: The Difference boolean subtracts the shape of the secondary object from the primary object where the secondary object overlaps with the primary object. The geometry of the secondary object is completely removed. Intersection: The Intersection boolean creates a new shape where the geometry of the primary object overlaps with the secondary object. All the geometry that is not overlapping is removed."
