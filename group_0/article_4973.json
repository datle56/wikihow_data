      "content": "Find your niche online. Search the platforms you have joined for causes you care about and other interests of yours. For instance, you can join groups on Facebook, follow organizations on Twitter. Post in these groups, reply to other members, and add other members with whom you get along. For instance, if you're in a Facebook group for Panda Habitat Conservation, and you always feel inspired by the jokes some man named Heinrich from Idaho posts, you can like his post, reply with a joke of your own, and then add him as a friend. Find message boards or online communities that focus on one of your interests. Post on the topic and share your knowledge. If someone on the message board has similar interests or can teach you something, then send them an email or a private message and get to know them."

      "title": "Add people freely.",
      "content": "Add people freely. Request connections with everyone you know and like in real life. If the network is a personal one, add only your close friends you would want hearing your unguarded thoughts. If the network is a business one, add the people you interact with, whether virtually or in person, so you can grow your reach."

    {
      "title": "Represent yourself.",
      "content": "Represent yourself. Be active on the sites you choose! Once a day or so, share a comment, photo, or article that interests you and that you think may interest others. If you only use your site to follow others, people will forget you are there."

The best way to strengthen your network is to interact with the people you are connected with. Take a few minutes a day to check the site and express enjoyment of various posts. Different platforms will let you do this different ways—you might comment or press \"like\" \"heart\" or \"favorite.\" Only do this when you actually like something! Otherwise your feed will slowly fill with things that do not interest you. Strive to be genuine in your interactions so you can find true common ground with others. On many platforms, you may post things and tag the people you think may be interested. Only do this on occasion, and try not to tag more than a few people—otherwise it won't feel personal."

      "content": "Reconnect with former contacts. Go through your address book, day planner, or other contact information for your current friends and contacts. Make connection with them just to talk. The subject of your conversation isn't really important at this point. Just staying in touch works wonders and will serve as the foundation for the next steps."

      "content": "Say yes to invitations. Attend weddings, funerals and parties that you are invited to. Showing that you care about the people in your network, even if you just pop in and say hi, will cause those that are in your 'network' to return the same courtesy. And, you could meet other people there too. If you have to say no to an invitation, send an event-appropriate gift or card."

      "content": "Give back by hosting. If you want to participate in a community, you have to give back! That means hosting parties and connecting people, promoting the interests of others within your network, and otherwise being a mensch to those around you. Consider starting your own activist, social, or artistic group. This can be a bit of a daunting task, but if you start your own group, whether an internet bulletin board group or an actual meet and greet group, people will be coming to you instead of you looking for them. This is a great way to meet new contacts and friends."

      "content": "Work your network. Once you have established yourself in a community, and are known to give back to it, ask for favors. Should you be seeking a job, don't hesitate to tell everyone in your network about it. Send out resumes to those you are closest to or those that share business interest."
