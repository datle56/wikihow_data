      "content": "Stage 1: Clean Shave (Week 0) Start your beard-growing journey fresh by giving your face a clean shave. To get a close shave and reduce irritation, professional barber Timmy Yanchun recommends washing and exfoliating your face to “get rid of all the dead skin on the surface layer of the skin.” Then, “soften the hair” and “open your pores by applying heat.” For instance, Yanchun advises shaving after a hot shower so that your hair is fully softened. After you prep your skin, Yanchun says to apply shaving cream and shave “with the grain of your hair.” He agrees that this is “the easiest way to prevent red bumps and irritation.” When you’re done shaving, Yanchun advises splashing your face with cold water to close your pores. What to do during this stage : Keep your skin moisturized . It’s normal for your skin to feel itchy after a fresh shave and as your facial hair starts to grow back. Yanchun agrees, saying that “the most common reason for itchy skin is dry skin,” so “moisturize your skin after a shave.” Treat razor bumps and irritation . It’s also common to get razor bumps after shaving your beard. Yanchun recommends applying witch hazel to your skin to help prevent and treat any irritation."

      "content": "Stage 2: Stubble Growth (Week 1-4) Starting around week 1, you’ll likely notice stubble starting to grow over your chin, cheeks, upper lip, and neck. Unfortunately, this also usually comes along with itchiness and some dandruff. By the end of the month, facial hair specialist Marlon Rivas says your beard typically starts to take shape and you’ll have a better idea of how it’ll grow in—you might notice more growth around your chin, cheeks, or mustache. What to do during this stage : Apply beard oil to keep your beard and skin moisturized . To help reduce itchiness and dandruff and keep your skin healthy, Yanchun recommends using a beard oil made with argan or jojoba oil. He advises applying it whenever your beard or skin feels dry (which might be more than once per day) and massaging the oil “from the root of the hair to the tip.” Wash your beard with beard shampoo daily . If you don’t clean your beard regularly and wash out the oil, Yanchun says grime can “build up on the hair and make the hair unhealthy.” Rivas recommends washing your beard daily—just make sure to moisturize afterward. Note : Everyone grows facial hair differently, so your beard growth stages might not follow this timeline exactly. Different factors affect beard growth , which we discuss in the sections below."

      "content": "Stage 3: Patchy Growth (Months 1-3) During this stage, you’ll likely notice that some areas of your beard are growing in fuller than others. This is completely normal, as different areas of your face grow in hair differently and might be in different hair growth cycles . While this can be an awkward stage, keep your head up and stay patient—most people’s beards even out in the next few months. [1] X Research source What to do during this stage : Avoid trimming your beard . While you might want to manually even out your beard, it’s best to leave it alone during this stage to prevent slower growth. Licensed cosmetologist Mark LoBiondo agrees, saying not to get your beard “trimmed or shaped until it grows longer than you want it.” Comb your beard with a boar bristle brush . Professional barber Woody Lovell recommends brushing your beard at least once daily to help “train the hair” so it grows in the direction you want. Boar bristle brushes are especially great because they help distribute oils through your beard, keeping it moisturized and healthy. Keep washing and moisturizing your beard . Continue your beard care routine by washing and conditioning your beard with beard oil daily to keep it healthy and soft."

At this stage, it’s a good idea to shape up your beard and start styling it into the look you like. What to do during this stage : Trim the hair around your neck . To get a well-groomed look, Rivas suggests trimming everything below your Adam’s apple. Then, “follow the jawline” to trim the rest of the neck area—he says to “just gradually go up towards the back of the [neck] where the jawline gets closer to the ear.” Trim the hair around your cheeks and jaw . Use a beard trimmer to tidy up the sides of your beard to achieve the style you like (like the short boxed beard or balbo beard). Then, shorten the length as needed to get a uniform look. Trim your mustache . Cut back any long hairs that are getting in the way of your mouth. Yanchun says to wash and comb your mustache first. Then, “hit it with the trimmers and scissors” to get rid of any annoying strands. Shape and style your beard with beard balm . Rivas recommends using a bit of balm to smooth your beard, shape it into the style you like, and “make it look more tamed.” Keep up your beard maintenance routine . As always, keep washing your beard and applying beard oil to keep it healthy and moisturized. Stick to brushing it daily with a boar bristle brush to help shape and smooth it, too. If you’re not sure what beard style to choose, Yanchun suggests going to the barber and asking them “what style works for your face shape.” He says, “Don't be afraid to bring a picture of something that you like to your barber”—a good barber will tell you if the style suits you and work with you to find a more flattering look."

Now, your primary goal is to simply keep your beard groomed and maintained in the style you like! [2] X Research source What to do during this stage : Trim your beard every 2 to 4 weeks . Whenever you notice your beard is growing unruly or losing its shape, give it a quick trim with your beard trimmers. Or, go to a barber, if you prefer.
