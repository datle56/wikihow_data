      "content": "Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) . If you're able to edit your computer's network connections (e.g., select a Wi-Fi network to connect to), you can most likely set your computer to use a VPN. Keep in mind that you must first select and pay for a VPN service before you can use most VPNs. VPNs can be used on mobile platforms (e.g., smartphones or tablets) and computers. One free VPN option is Hotspot Shield. If you can download and install Hotspot Shield on your selected computer, you can turn it on without having to configure it in your computer's settings."

      "title": "Use a proxy website.",
      "content": "Use a proxy website. Proxies are essentially miniature VPNs that apply only to the browser tab in which they're open. When you enter a request (e.g., a website's address) in a proxy site's search bar, the request is routed through several different servers (but not the one on which your normal Internet connection is located) to circumvent the current server's restrictions. Select a proxy service, such as: HideMe - https://hide.me/en/proxy ProxySite - https://www.proxysite.com/ ProxFree - https://www.proxfree.com/ Whoer - https://whoer.net/webproxy Click the proxy site's search bar. Enter the blocked website's URL into the proxy's search bar. Use the website. Your site should load like it does when browsing on an unrestricted computer, though it may take longer due to the proxy's server location. Keep in mind that while proxies hide your traffic from your web administrator, the proxy host can see all of the information you submit. Avoid entering sensitive information while on the proxy's site."

      "title": "Try visiting an alternative version of a website.",
      "content": "Try visiting an alternative version of a website. Some web restrictions block specific web addresses (e.g., www.facebook.com ) without blocking variations of the address. You may be able to bypass specific domain blocks by using one of the following variations on the site's address: IP address - If you can find the website's IP address , you may be able to enter the IP address in the address bar as a way of circumventing the web restrictions. Mobile site - By placing a m. between the \"www.\" and the rest of the website's address (e.g., www.m.facebook.com ), you can open the mobile version of the website. The mobile version often must be blocked separately from the regular version, so some web restrictions miss this exploit. Google Translate - In rare cases, you can go to https://translate.google.com/ and enter your website's address in the left-most box, select a new language for the right-most box, and click the link in the right-most box to open the website in a different language."

      "content": "Use a cellular data connection . If you have a supported iPhone or Android smartphone, you can use a process called \"tethering\" to use your phone's cellular data connection as a Wi-Fi network. This method is relatively guaranteed as long as your computer allows you to select a network. Keep in mind that tethering takes up a significant amount of cellular data, especially if you're downloading files or streaming video. The linked article references tethering on a laptop, but the same instructions will work for a desktop computer."

      "content": "Connect directly to the modem. You can bypass most network restrictions by attaching your computer to the modem via Ethernet . Naturally, you shouldn't do this if you don't have permission to access the modem. The modem is usually separate from the router. If your Internet connection uses a router/modem combo, this method most likely won't work for you. This method is most effective for home Internet connections rather than school, work, or public connections."

To use Tor, a browser with a built-in proxy, you'll need to install it onto a flash drive that you can then plug into the restricted computer. For this to work, there are a couple of other conditions to meet: The restricted computer must have at least one USB port. The restricted computer must allow you to open files from a flash drive. Your portable browser must be installed on the flash drive, not just stored on the flash drive."

Depending on the source of the web restrictions (e.g., a school network versus parental controls), the strength of the web restrictions will vary: Public web restrictions, such as those found in coffee shops or on parental-controlled computers, can sometimes be bypassed with most of the general strategies in this section. Regional web restrictions, such as the ones found on some YouTube content, typically require a proxy or VPN to access. School , government , and other workplace-style web restrictions are usually foolproof enough that you'll need to employ a proxy or portable browser. You can still try using cellular data to tether your computer."
