There are proper titles for these people as well that must be used when you address them. [5] X Trustworthy Source Victorian Government Official website for the Australian state of Victoria Go to source Some titles are simple. For example, a knight is simply addressed as \"Sir\" followed by his name, and a knight's wife is addressed as \"Lady,\" followed by her name. The same is true for baronets and their wives. Royal people that fall between knights and baronets and positions like king and queen are usually addressed as, \"The Right Honorable,\" followed by their name. A marquee, for examples, would be addressed as \"The Right Honorable.\""

For example, if you're writing to the King of England, your first line would read, \"Unto His Majesty, the King of England.\" The second line should state who you are.
