      "content": "Scrub the bottle with dish soap. Add a little bit of dish soap to the bottle, and pour water into the bottle. Shake the bottle to create soap suds, and use a clean bottle brush or sponge to scrub as deeply into the bottle as you can reach. Rinse until no more suds remain. [1] X Research source Using a small amount of dish soap is safe, especially if you take care rinsing the bottle, but if you are worried, you can use lemon juice instead.
