Most health insurance companies require that your newborn be added to an existing policy within 30 days of birth. Under the Affordable Care Act in the United States, you are required to sign your baby up for health insurance. Failing to do so could lead to a penalty of $47.50 per each uninsured child and you will need to pay for medical services for your baby out of pocket. [1] X Research source Though most larger health insurance carriers will notice your health care claims submission for the birth of the baby and reach out to you about updating your health care insurance, you should be proactive and contact your health insurance company directly. This will ensure your health insurance company is aware you have a new baby and you intend to seek coverage for your new baby. [2] X Research source Many health insurance companies make it easy for you to update your plan by accessing their App on your mobile phone. You can also call your health insurance company via their customer service line to speak to an insurance agent."
