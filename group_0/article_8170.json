      "title": "Treat your elbows at bath time.",
      "content": "Treat your elbows at bath time. Elbows are usually neglected in the shower which allows dirt particles to build up and create dark and rough patches. Use mild soap, warm water, and gentle circular motions to remove dirt build-up. Also, it is recommended to lube up your elbows before a steamy shower to help the lubricant penetrate deeper into dry areas. [1] X Research source Be sure to rub in moisturizer within a few minutes after toweling dry. This helps to slow the natural evaporation of moisture."

      "title": "Exfoliate.",
      "content": "Exfoliate. Exfoliation is scrubbing off dead skin cells to reveal the new and improved skin cells underneath. [2] X Research source You can use various creams and scrubbers, in or out of the shower, to slough away dead skin buildup. Exfoliation should only be completed 1-2 times weekly to avoid irritation. [3] X Research source You can use a scrubbing brush, pumice stone, or exfoliating cream to remove dead skin. Choose products which contain lactic acid which will assist in reducing superficially present keratin buildup in dead skin cells, which is a protein that can cause blockage of healthy skin pores. Keratin has an important role in maintaining the health of your skin, but an excess of keratin is called hyperkeratosis. [4] X Research source If you are experiencing this, then it is important to see your general practitioner or a dermatologist to find out what is causing it."

[7] X Research source Not only should you make sure that your body is taking in enough water, but you should also ensure that your skin is as well. Water consumption depends on size and weight. As a rule, you should attempt to consume between half an ounce and an ounce of water for every pound of body weight (daily). Look for \"skin hydrating\" beauty products to add to your regimen. Steer clear of any soaps that are antibacterial, perfumed, or that contain alcohol. Choose mild, fragrance-free soaps and moisturizing soaps.

      "content": "Don't skip the moisturizer. The constant use of the elbows as well as exposure to sun can lead to thicker skin on the elbows. In addition, because moisture retaining glands are not present in the elbows, moisture must be manually added. Try using a thick lotion to keep elbows lubricated. Try applying petroleum jelly and covering with a sock at bedtime to lock in moisture. Try lotions with ingredients like urea, lactic acid, hyaluronic acid, or alpha- or beta-hydroxy acids which are often used to help treat small bumps on the skin.
