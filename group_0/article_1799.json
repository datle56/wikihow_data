      "title": "This phrase means, “I’ve already addressed this in my last email.”",
      "content": "This phrase means, “I’ve already addressed this in my last email.” Most commonly used in corporate or professional settings, the phrase “as per my last email” lets the recipient know that you’ve already addressed their concerns in your previous email. The phrase can be useful across many areas of the workforce, from sales to customer service to academia. For example, if a sales representative is emailing a company about the status of their order, and the most recent email between them states that the order has been shipped, the company representative might say, “As per my last email, your order shipped yesterday.” [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Many consider the phrase to be negative or passive aggressive.",
      "content": "Many consider the phrase to be negative or passive aggressive. Even if the sender didn't intend to sound so harsh, it can still comes across as passive aggressive to those on the receiving end. It implies that the recipient is not paying attention or is unintelligent, often making the recipient feel belittled and inadequate at their job. It's best to avoid using this phrase in professional contexts. A “per my last email” meme made starting making the internet rounds in 2021. The meme typically features a variety of colorful characters who appear annoyed, distressed, or even ready to fight after receiving an email containing the passive aggressive phrase.

    {
      "title": "“As discussed…”",
      "content": "“As discussed…” This two-word phrase relays that the answer has already been offered without the condescending tone of referencing their last email, which can make the recipient feel foolish for not noticing. This condensed approach can be used interchangeably of “as per my last email” without ruffling any feathers. Here’s are some examples of how to use it: “As discussed, the meeting will no longer take place on the 4th.” “As discussed, the builder already has the appliances and is just waiting on installation.” “As discussed, there will be no need for working overtime this week as the queue is low.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“As previously mentioned…”",
      "content": "“As previously mentioned…” Again, this is synonymous with “as per my last email”-- minus the testy tone. It still lets the recipient know that you’ve addressed their question and provided a solution or update earlier in your email exchange, but it doesn’t as rudely imply, “I said it in our last email, why don’t you look there, dummy?” Here are few ways you can use it: “As previously mentioned, the reports will be in by the end of the week.” “As previously mentioned, Sarah and Theo will be in charge of running the wellness meeting on Tuesday.” “As previously mentioned, holiday pay will be added to your check at the end of this pay period.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“In case it got buried in your inbox…”",
      "content": "“In case it got buried in your inbox…” This is a very polite way to let your recipient know that you’ve already answered their question, but don’t mind reiterating it in case they didn’t see it. This response alludes to the possibility of a high workload and offers an empathetic nod, either offering the answer again or allowing the recipient to search for the previous email without feeling shame or embarrassment. Here are some examples on how to integrate this phrase: [3] X Research source “In case it got buried in your inbox, the meeting time on Thursday has changed to 2PM EST.” “In case it got buried in your inbox, I sent an email first thing this morning will a schedule of all the upcoming events. I’m attaching it here again.” “In case it got buried in your inbox, the email right above this one in the thread addresses all of your concerns.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“I’m circling back on…”",
      "content": "“I’m circling back on…” This term has gained a lot of traction in the corporate world. It employs a slightly different approach to redirecting the email recipient back to the information they’re inquiring about without pointing fingers. This is best used in situations where you’re waiting on a reply after a miscommunication or you sense that the co-worker in question might need more clarification on a certain project. Here are some examples: [4] X Research source “ I’m circling back on the deadline we discussed earlier– does March 1st still work for you?” “I’m circling back on the outline for this case file– let me know if there’s anything you need!” “I’m circling back on our earlier conversation– have you gotten a chance to review those files?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Just a friendly reminder that …”",
      "content": "“Just a friendly reminder that …” This is another clear cut way yet professional way to say, “I’ve already answered this.” By kindly noting that the information the recipient is after has already been divulged, the recipient is less likely to feel condescended or disrespected. Pointing specifically to the information is also very helpful. Here’s how to go about it: [5] X Research source “Just a friendly reminder that I’ve shared an answer to your question in my previous email” “Just a friendly reminder of what I stated in my previous email: there won’t be any further adjustments made for this quarter.” “Just a friendly reminder that the answers you’re looking for can be found in my previous email– please take a look and don’t hesitate to ask me any questions you may have!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Apologies if you missed the previous email…”",
      "content": "“Apologies if you missed the previous email…” This response takes empathy to the next level, assuring that the recipient doesn’t feel attacked in any way. By opening with an apology, you are immediately letting the other person know that they’ve done nothing wrong. Furthermore, it provides them with the opportunity to check the previous email without insult or injury in order to arrive at their answer, or, you can kindly restate the info for them. Consider the following examples: “Apologies if you missed the previous email: your day off has been approved!” \"Apologies if you missed the previous email but I’ve addressed all your questions there! Please take a look and get back to me.” “Apologies if you missed the previous email, HR should be in touch with you shortly with more information about the onboarding process.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“I’m following up on…”",
      "content": "“I’m following up on…” Similar to, “I’m circling back on,” this alternative also allows you to anticipate your co-worker’s needs while providing clarification. This works exceptionally well after a lull in responses and can serve as a gentle nudge to let the email recipient know that you’re waiting on them to hold up their end of the bargain, without being snarky about it. Here are some ways to use this response: “I’m following up on your draft and how it’s going. Feel free to email me the pages you have done so far!” “I’m following up on your Monday request to present at the town hall this Thursday. Are you still on board?” “I’m following up on our conversation from last week. How are you feeling about your current numbers?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Please see below…”",
      "content": "“Please see below…” This corporate response points the recipient directly to the information they’re seeking without the need to put them down for not seeing it earlier. When using this phrase, be sure to address everything the recipient is asking so that they don’t feel the need to ask for further clarification. This makes your job and their job easier! Here are a couple of examples on how to proceed: “Please see below: your quotas for this quarter have all been met and your overall performance review will take place on Friday, February 7th at 1PM.” “Please see below for a complete breakdown of all the requirements of this role.” “Please see below for a list of all participating parties.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“I’d appreciate your input in regards to…”",
      "content": "“I’d appreciate your input in regards to…” This phrase is not only polite, but also engages the recipient while letting them know how much their opinion is valued. The recipient will understand that the other party is awaiting their reply in order to make a choice and is likely to respond in a similarly polite and efficient manner– a win-win for all! Here’s how you can use it in your next email exchange: “I’d appreciate your input in regards to the fundraiser next month… are you still thinking about hosting the bake sale?” “I’d appreciate your input in regards to staging the house for showing next week. Will you be available?” “I’d appreciate your input in regards to the team building exercise we have coming up.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“I’m checking in on…”",
      "content": "“I’m checking in on…” When someone “checks in,” it’s typically a good sign, no matter the setting. It implies genuinely care or concern, whether that be in reference to something personal or professional. Beginning a workplace email with this phrase lets the recipient know that you’re there to help, which can include repeating information to make sure everything is progressing as needed. Look to the following list for some examples: [6] X Research source “I’m checking in on your progress on the project! Is there anything I can do to help?” “I’m checking in on your general understanding of expectations. Please let me know how what I can do so that you successfully meet your goals.” “I’m checking in on your mentorship request. Have you found someone to shadow who seems like a good fit?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“What do you think about…”",
      "content": "“What do you think about…” Again, this phrase places value on the recipient’s opinion instead of pointing blame or belittling the recipient about not responding sooner. It also functions as a way of reiterating and summarizing past information that the recipient may have forgotten about or may have doubts about. A significantly more polite alternative to, “per my last email,” here are some ideas on how you can use it: “ What do you think about the schedule attached below? Do all these dates and times work for you?” “What do you think about the solution I proposed earlier?” “What do you think about letting management know your ideas? I was impressed– so, they will be too!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Can you hop on a quick call?”",
      "content": "“Can you hop on a quick call?” If all else fails, asking your co-worker to get on a video or audio call to provide clarification is not a bad idea at all. In fact, verbal communication is often the clearest and most empathetic, since tone and meaning can’t get lost like they do via text. Emailing back and forth can be a hassle, so don’t hesitate to ask to chat with a co-worker if you feel that it’ll be the best course of action. Here’s how you can ask: [7] X Research source “Can you hop on a quick call? I’m afraid details are getting lost in translation over email!” “Can you hop on a quick call? I’d love to finish our conversation before lunch.” “Can you hop on a quick call? Let’s chat it up to avoid further confusion, if you don’t mind!”"

      "title": "Be polite and concise if you feel your coworker’s frustration makes sense.",
      "content": "Be polite and concise if you feel your coworker’s frustration makes sense. Receiving a “per my last email” message can feel demoralizing and upsetting. However, if you do feel like you’ve fallen behind on a project, are habitually late to work, take extended lunch breaks, or have genuinely made any other faux pas in the workplace, perhaps you can understand where their snarky tone might come from. In scenarios like these, it might be best to respond concisely and appropriately. Here are some examples on how to handle it: [8] X Research source “Thank you kindly for this reminder.” “I greatly appreciate you sending the document again.” “I’ll have an update for you by end of day.”"

    {
      "title": "Tactfully call them out if your coworker speaks to you with this tone often.",
      "content": "Tactfully call them out if your coworker speaks to you with this tone often. Receiving one harshly-worded email from a coworker is one thing, but having it be a regular occurrence is another. Things can get sticky if your coworker’s tone is often disrespectful, especially if you feel you’ve done nothing to warrant that kind of repeated treatment. In these situations, consider tactfully pointing out their lousy tone and suggesting that they change it in the future in order to not only get faster results but to uphold a respectful workplace environment. Here’s how: “I feel like your tone is a bit off and I’m sensing some frustration. What can I do for us to work on this diligently and respectfully together?” “I’m sensing some sarcasm here. Have I done something to upset you? If not, can we proceed without involving our egos?” “Please be straightforward with me as I don’t understand or appreciate your current tone.”"

    {
      "title": "Set clear intentions for your emails.",
      "content": "Set clear intentions for your emails. When writing a follow-up email, draft it ahead of time with a clear goal in mind. Ask yourself, “What outcome do I hope to get once I hit send?” It could be as simple as getting an acknowledgement that they received it, a specific reply, or a response ahead of an important deadline. Whatever it is, make sure you’ve provided the person on the other end of the screen with all the necessary details so they can answer in an informed and diligent manner."

      "title": "Fine tune your subject lines.",
      "content": "Fine tune your subject lines. A recent study shows that over 60% of users determine whether or not they want to open an email based on the subject line, so select your wording carefully. Be strategic and direct, as this is the recipient’s initial glimpse as to what the body of the email will contain. Additionally, let them know if the email you’re sending is time sensitive and/or requires an urgent response. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Put your request into context.",
      "content": "Put your request into context. Although many follow-up emails are short and to the point, some may require a bit of background info. However, front-loading the necessary information at the top can make the body of your email look clunky, and you don’t want to immediately overwhelm the recipient with a ton of details. A good fix for this is to include the additional background info at the end of your email. Think of it as an attachment, adding value at the end of a message.

      "content": "Consider the timing of your emails. The average person working in a business setting receives 121 work-related emails per day, so gaining any kind of advantage over the rest is key! According to a recent study, the best times of day to send an email are 9AM-11AM, 1PM–2PM, and 5PM–6PM. The best days of the week to send an email are Monday and Tuesday. Use that information wisely, as catching your recipient’s eye at just the right time could work out in your favor. [11] X Research source"
