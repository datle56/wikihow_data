Ask them who their favorite character is or what they like about the show. You can also ask them for other recommendations.

Using an anime pick up line also shows them that you share the same interests, so it will be easier to continue the conversation. If the person you’re talking to isn’t an anime fan, they probably won’t get the reference, so the pick up line is less likely to work. Remember to tailor your pick up line to your relationship. If you’re talking to someone for the first time, it’s probably a good idea to keep things PG. If you know them well, it may be acceptable to try a dirty pick up line if you know they’re comfortable with it."
