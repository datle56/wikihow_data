      "title": "Lay the duvet insert on top of the cover.",
      "content": "Lay the duvet insert on top of the cover. Spread out the comforter or duvet insert over the duvet cover so the corners align neatly together. Make sure the long sides of the duvet cover and insert run along the length of the bed while the short sides run along the width of the bed."

      "title": "Secure any duvet cover fasteners to the insert.",
      "content": "Secure any duvet cover fasteners to the insert. If your duvet cover and insert have ties or buttons on the corners, fasten them so the insert stays flat inside the cover. If your duvet doesn’t have any built-in fasteners, use duvet clips to secure the cover and insert together."

      "title": "Roll the insert and cover starting at the head of the bed.",
      "content": "Roll the insert and cover starting at the head of the bed. Fold the duvet cover over the duvet insert and roll them together to the bottom of the bed. Just go slowly to ensure the cover and insert roll evenly. If you are by yourself, roll the duvet cover and insert at the center. If you have someone helping you, stand on either side of the bed and roll together."

      "title": "Reach inside the cover and flip the cover over the end of the roll.",
      "content": "Reach inside the cover and flip the cover over the end of the roll. Put your hand inside the opening of the duvet cover and stuff the end of the roll inside the corner. This flips the cover right side out. Then, do the same thing on the other end of the roll. [1] X Research source Flip the middle portion of the duvet cover over the middle of the roll, too."

      "title": "Unroll the duvet and shake it out over your bed.",
      "content": "Unroll the duvet and shake it out over your bed. This flips the rest of the cover right side out and inserts the comforter inside the cover. Then, close the opening of the duvet cover and shake out the duvet so it lays flat and smooth over your bed.

      "content": "Lay the duvet insert on the bed. Spread and flatten your comforter or duvet insert so the long side runs along the length of the bed and the short side runs along the width of the bed. Just make sure the tag is at the head of the bed. Having the tag at the head of the bed ensures that the tag ends up at the bottom of the duvet cover when you insert the duvet into the cover."

      "title": "Turn the duvet cover inside out and lay it on top of the insert.",
      "content": "Turn the duvet cover inside out and lay it on top of the insert. Position the open end of the duvet cover at the foot of the bed. Then, spread out the cover so you can see each corner. Fasten your duvet cover’s closures to the corners of the insert if your cover has them. Some covers have ties or buttons. Or, put duvet clips on the corners of the cover and insert to keep the duvet in place."

      "content": "Flip the cover over the insert and shake out the cover. While still holding the corners of the duvet cover and insert, flip the cover right side out and over your arms. Then, shake out the cover and insert so the cover flips over the rest of the insert. [3] X Research source Hold on tight as you shake the duvet cover onto the duvet insert. This helps ensure that the corners of the insert spread out to the corners inside the cover. You may have to pull the bottom corners of the cover over the insert."
