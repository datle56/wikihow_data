      "content": "Invite your friends over for a bonfire if you have old wood to burn. Bonfires are a traditional part of Guy Fawkes celebrations. To light your bonfire, mark out the area with bricks to stop the fire from spreading, place some scrunched newspapers or pinecones at the base of the fire pit, and then stack small pieces of wood on top. Once you have lit the fire and it is steadily burning, place larger pieces of wood on to keep it burning. [1] X Research source Never use petrol or alcohol to kick-start a fire, as this can cause accidents. Also, avoid lighting the fire on a windy day to help prevent it from spreading quickly. Always keep water on hand in case the fire gets out of control. Also, closely monitor any children nearby, as bonfires are a high-risk activity. Light your bonfire on land that is free of trees and that you have permission to use."
