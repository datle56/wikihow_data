You can usually apply for a residential building permit on the website of your local Department of Building and Safety. [1] X Research source In addition to granting you permission to construct a swimming pool, the residential building permit will outline the exact requirements and specifications of your new pool. There may be state or local guidelines that you have to follow for your pool, like how far it has to be from your property line. [2] X Expert Source Rob Litman Licensed Landscaper & General Contractor Expert Interview. 13 October 2020. Don’t forget to also check your neighborhood’s homeowners association guidelines before moving forward with the installation—not all neighborhoods allow pools. Some municipalities may also expect you to have a separate electrical permit. However, the electrician you contract to take care of your pool’s inground wiring can often apply for an electrical permit on your behalf."

Swimming pools are typically found in the backyards of most homes, though you could also situate yours to one side if you have enough space to play with. [3] X Research source Think carefully about where your pool will go. Installing a swimming pool in certain areas may require you to add or remove other outdoor features like trees or sections of fencing, which will drive up the cost of the project. You may have a limited number of options in regards to your pool’s overall dimensions, depending on where you decide to put it.

How many entrances and exits will it have? These are all important details that you'll need to discuss with your contractor before the project gets underway. [6] X Research source Most home swimming pools come in standardized sizes like 10 feet (3.0 m) x 20 feet (6.1 m), 15 feet (4.6 m) x 30 feet (9.1 m), and 20 feet (6.1 m) x 40 feet (12 m), and may be anywhere from 4–15 feet (1.2–4.6 m) deep.

      "content": "Create the foundation of your pool with concrete to ensure that it's built to last. Most residential swimming pools are finished using 1 of 3 surfacing materials: poured concrete, fiberglass, or vinyl. Concrete is the strongest and most durable, but also the most expensive. It tends to be the best choice for large pools that are intended as a permanent addition to a home's exterior. [8] X Research source If you expect your pool to receive heavy use, investing in a long-lasting material like concrete can cut down on the cost of repairs in the long run. A well-maintained concrete swimming pool can also add to the resale value of your home, in some cases."

Fiberglass also offers the best balance of durability and affordability.

      "content": "Go with a vinyl-lined pool if you want to spend less. Vinyl swimming pool liners are essentially large, smooth sheets that are shaped to fit the contours of the completed pool. They're by far the most economical option for finishing a home swimming pool. The major downside is that they wear out much faster than both fiberglass and concrete. [11] X Research source Another disadvantage of vinyl pool liners is that they have a tendency to bubble, wrinkle, and pull loose. This means they may need regular adjusting in order to keep their attractive appearance. A vinyl-lined pool will only run you $25,000-50,000 on average, compared to poured concrete, which can cost upwards of $80,000-100,000. [12] X Research source"

This will involve covering the bottom surface with a thick layer of washed gravel subsoil, which is then raked and compressed until it’s perfectly level . There are a few different ways to grade a swimming pool. Some pools have flat bottoms, while others are built with sloping floors that establish a deep end and a shallow end.
