Keep a stash of supplies within your reach so you never have to go looking for something. [1] X Research source For all diaper changes you will need clean diapers, baby wipes, and diaper rash ointment. Try making your own baby wipes. Include in the wipes some baby soap, witch hazel extract to dry the baby, lavender to prevent diaper rash, baby oil to soften the skin, distilled water, and diaper rash cream to treat diaper rash. You may not need these items for every diaper change, but it's a good idea to keep a clean pair of baby clothes and a wash cloth within reach as well, just in case you run into an extremely dirty diaper. Gloves are also handy if you want to keep your hands clean. The bathroom is an ideal location for a changing station because you will always have access to a sink nearby."

[2] X Research source If you are changing the baby on a surface other than a changing table (like a bed or a rug), protect it with a towel or a waterproof changing pad. If you're in your home, try putting them on a towel or blanket on the bathroom floor or in the bathtub. That will help make cleanup easier.

You can use disposable gloves or thicker ones that can be washed and reused multiple times. If you don't wear gloves, at least roll your sleeves up to keep your clothing clean."

If it does not appear to be soiled, remove only what is necessary to change the diaper. [5] X Research source You may want to remove shirts and onesies by pulling them down rather than up and over their heads. This may help to prevent the feces from getting on your baby’s back and head if the diaper has exploded. If you don't already have clean clothes by the diaper changing station, be sure to get some before you begin changing the baby."

      "content": "Wipe up the mess with the diaper first. Once the baby is lying on their back on the changing table, open the diaper so that it lies flat on the table. If the front part of the diaper is clean, use that section to wipe up as much mess off of the baby as you can. Then quickly fold the diaper in half so the baby's butt is on top of the clean outside section of the diaper. [6] X Research source If the entire inside of the baby's diaper is dirty, do not try to use it to wipe the baby. Instead, fold the diaper in half right away and move on to the next step. If the diaper is dirty on the outside, consider putting a clean diaper or an open baby wipe under the baby while you clean them. This will help contain the mess while you're working to get them clean."

If you have a baby girl, be sure to always wipe her from front to back in order to help prevent vaginal and urinary tract infections. Male babies can also get penile infections, so clean the penis as thoroughly as you would clean a dirty finger. Do not pull back the baby’s foreskin if he is uncircumcised. Avoid using any wipes that contain alcohol or fragrances, as these can cause skin irritation.

You can also apply petroleum jelly or ointment to his skin in order to prevent irritation.

      "content": "Put on the new diaper. Once the old diaper is off and your baby is wiped down, put on a fresh pair of gloves (if you are wearing gloves) and put the new diaper on. Simply open the diaper up, slide it under the baby with one hand while you gently lift up his legs with the other hand, fold the front part of the diaper up, and secure the straps from behind. If there is another diaper under your baby, remove this one first before sliding the clean diaper in place. Be sure to position the diaper correctly. For disposable diapers, the tabs should be in the back."

If you use cloth diapers, roll the old one up and place it in a container with a tight lid until it's time to wash it. [12] X Research source To help contain the smell, place the diaper in a plastic bag and tie it tightly before you throw it away. Plastic bags are also great for containing soiled cloth diapers when you're out. If you need to walk away from the changing area to throw the diaper away, always bring the baby with you. Never leave him on the changing table unattended. It's a good idea to wipe off as much poop as you can into the toilet before you throw the diaper away. This will help reduce the odor. [13] X Research source If you wore disposable gloves, throw those in the trash as well. Pinch one glove with the other gloved hand to remove it, and then insert a clean finger under the inside of the other glove to peel that one off."

Also clean and sanitize the changing surface. If you wore non-disposable gloves, wash them thoroughly before you wash your hands. If you use a changing pad, be sure to wash it on a regular basis. If you removed the baby's clothing, you can put a clean pair of clothes on them now. Put the old ones in the wash as soon as possible. When sanitizing surfaces, always be sure to use a cleaner that is baby-safe."
