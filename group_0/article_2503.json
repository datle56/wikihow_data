      "content": "Bathe your turtle occasionally. Aquatic turtles spend the majority of their lives in the water and if their tanks are kept clean, rarely need a special bath. However, your turtle might benefit from a cleaning if it starts to develop algae on its shell, or when it is shedding to help remove dead skin cells. [3] X Research source When your turtle is shedding skin, you may notice flaky patches of skin on its neck, tail or legs. This is normal. If your turtle sheds a lot, however, it might mean a problem with the tank or the turtle's health, and you should consult with your vet."

Turtles can harbor salmonella bacteria, which can make humans very ill, so it is important that you not bathe your turtle in the sink or bathtub. Salmonella is very resistant to disinfectants, so the best course of action is to buy or find a special tub for bathing your turtle, and use it only for that purpose.

Remember that the turtle can feel his shell, so do not scrub too hard. Then scrub the turtle's legs, tail, and neck, but be careful with these areas as they are more sensitive. Finally, scrub the turtle's plastron (belly), and be sure to remove all algae and dirt between the scutes or scales.

      "content": "Place the tortoise in the tub and slowly add the water. The water should be room temperature. Add the water slowly until it is the depth of the tortoise's chin, or a bit shallower. Don't add more water than this, as most tortoises can't swim and could drown if their head is below water. It can also be helpful to rest the bowl on a book, so that your create a \"deep\" and a \"shallow\" end in the water. Place the chelonian with his head at the shallow end. This enables his anus to be below the water line, which is great because they drink through their anus so it's a great way of making sure he is well hydrated. Adding the water after the tortoise is in the tub ensures that you will not accidentally make the water too deep."

Usually it is sufficient to just let your tortoise soak and skip to the rinsing step, but once a week or so, you should give the tortoise a good scrub."
