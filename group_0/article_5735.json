Cancer is a moody water sign ruled by the moon (which governs emotions) who craves emotional closeness above all else. Libra is an intellectual air sign governed by Venus (the planet of love) who needs plenty of novelty and excitement to feel fulfilled."

      "content": "Libra will lay the flirting on thick to get Cancer’s attention. Libra is one of the best flirters in the zodiac and they’re most likely to make the first move on the more reserved Cancer (who will probably feel overwhelmed by Libra’s charm). [2] X Research source The first date might be a little awkward—Libra has no problem being outspoken and sharing opinions freely, but Cancer is less likely to open up at the same pace. [3] X Research source As they get to know each other, they’ll grow to value and learn from these differences and their conversations will become more free.

      "content": "Cancer calls it like it is, but Libra tends to sweep things under the rug. Cancer’s direct communication style is shocking to Libra, who likes to stay non-confrontational to keep the peace. This can make sensitive Cancer feel insecure if they suspect their Libra isn’t being fully honest with them. Thankfully, both signs can be very patient with each other and reach an understanding. When Cancer has space to let their feelings out and Libra can talk things out, there’s nothing they won’t be able to communicate about. Cancer can tell when Libra is acting evasive. A Libra won’t come out and say what’s on their mind, but they’ll stay incredibly polite and detached until the drama has passed."

Libra is fast-paced and develops a stronger bond after they’ve experienced a physical relationship (they’re also more likely to have more past partners, which might make Cancer feel insecure). [4] X Research source On the upside, this tension can ignite a striking passion. When both signs are open to trying new things to please each other, they’re in for a fulfilling, exciting time. Sex between Cancer and Libra feels more natural when they ease in from a position of friendship since they’ll have the familiarity they both need."

It might be hard to find common ground at first, but their mutual need and respect for loyalty, trust, and a fulfilling connection will inspire them to make it work. They should make an effort to get to know each other and give themselves plenty of time to consider a partnership before writing it off. When Cancer and Libra date, there’s no end to the fun, discovery, closeness, and rewards they can find. Libra should focus on honesty to communicate their needs and feelings clearly. They also should learn not to take Cancer’s blunt honesty very personally. Cancer should keep their cool during mood swings since Libra appreciates balance.
