      "content": "Bring creativity into your everyday life. Something you tend to lose as you grow older is your ability to ditch your self-awareness and be creative, even in the most mundane of situations. While cooking, don’t worry about making a mess. Cook exactly what you want and don’t worry about the mess until afterward. Decide to take up painting, writing, or dancing, even if you don’t think you will be good at it. Creativity will bring back the wonder and curiosity that you may envy in childlike behavior. Allowing yourself to be creative will bring fresh, inspiring, and new ideas into your life, which could benefit everything from your cooking skills to your career. [8] X Research source"

[9] X Research source Try sharing physical objects, too, like money, food, or clothing with someone in need. Sharing with other people will allow you to feel connected to them and will broaden your worldview, taking your mind off yourself and spending time thinking of others.

      "content": "Forgive as a child forgives. Children can be fighting one moment, and then completely forget about the fight the next, becoming friends again.

[11] X Research source Focus on people’s good intentions, rather than being blinded by their bad intentions. People are rarely treating you badly on purpose, and understanding where someone’s anger or sadness is stemming from will help you forgive and understand them. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Let yourself change.",
      "content": "Let yourself change. Children live life with a clean slate and are easily impressionable, changing with every new experience. Allow yourself to make changes in your life, following your passions and what you love to do. These changes can be as simple as painting a room a color that makes you happy to moving to the city of your dreams. [15] X Research source Children aren’t burdened by ideas of can and cannot, so greet each new experience with open arms and allow yourself to be impacted by them.
