      "title": "Plant your Dendrobium orchid in a small pot.",
      "content": "Plant your Dendrobium orchid in a small pot. Dendrobium orchids do not produce extensive root systems so they thrive in smaller spaces. Choose a pot that extends no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) beyond your plant's root mass. Do not plant this flower in a large planter or directly in the ground as it prefers the security of a tighter space.

      "content": "Use a soilless potting medium. The dendrobium orchid does not thrive or grow in ordinary soil. Purchase a potting mixture that is specially formulated for orchids from a gardening store or online. Alternatively, choose your own soilless potting medium like fir bark, coconut husks, or moss. [2] X Research source Many pre-made potting mixes for orchids contain horticultural charcoal.

      "title": "Keep your orchid in a cool to moderately warm climate.",
      "content": "Keep your orchid in a cool to moderately warm climate. Dendrobium orchids do best in an environment that is between 65–75 °F (18–24 °C). At night, they can tolerate a temperature drop to 55–60 °F (13–16 °C) It is best to keep them indoors where the temperature can be adjusted or monitored, especially in extreme seasons like summer and winter. [4] X Research source If you do put the plant outdoors during moderately warm weather, keep it out of direct sunlight and bring it indoors when temperatures drop at night. Note that temperatures on your window sills or near windows may be warmer or colder than the rest of your home."

      "title": "Give your orchid space to allow for air circulation around it.",
      "content": "Give your orchid space to allow for air circulation around it. Proper air circulation around plants can prevent problems like fungus and insect infestations. Place your orchid in a clear space with nothing around its immediate perimeter. Leave at least 5 inches (13 cm) of empty space around it to let it get sufficient air. [5] X Research source Keep a small fan near the plant to help improve air circulation when things get stuffy. When you water, make sure there is no standing water left on the surface of the soil."

      "title": "Give your orchid natural light or use grow lights to simulate it.",
      "content": "Give your orchid natural light or use grow lights to simulate it. Orchids need plenty of light to thrive. Place them near a window with partial shade so they don't get direct sun, which can be harmful. If natural light is not an option, place your orchid under grow lights for 14-16 hours during the day to simulate sunlight. [6] X Research source Orchids do best near eastern-facing windows. [7] X Expert Source Monique Capanelli Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 22 September 2020. When setting up your grow lights, use 1 warm white tube and 1 cool white tube placed under a reflector. Grow lights can be purchased at hardware stores or online. Plants should be placed approximately 8 inches (20 cm) under the lights."

      "title": "Water weekly and let the top layer of soil dry between waterings.",
      "content": "Water weekly and let the top layer of soil dry between waterings. Dendrobium orchids can store water and are more tolerant of dry soil than overly wet soil. Water them every 1-2 weeks. Allow the top 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the soil to dry before re-watering. [8] X Research source Some species of dendrobium orchids have water-storing pseudobulbs, meaning they can go 2 weeks between waterings. It is preferable to water your orchid in the morning so that its leaves are dry before night. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a diluted orchid fertilizer once a week. Purchase a balanced fertilizer designed specifically for orchids to feed your plant. Dilute it with water in a 4:1 ratio for regular fertilization. Apply the fertilizer once a week as directed. [10] X Research source Alternatively, use the full-strength fertilizer once a month to feed your plant. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Maintain a humidity level of at least 50% for your orchid.",
      "content": "Maintain a humidity level of at least 50% for your orchid. Ideally, the dendrobium orchid should have a 50-70% humidity level around them. Increase humidity by running a humidifier near your plant. [12] X Research source You can also place a shallow tray filled with water near your plant to help increase humidity in the immediate area. [13] X Research source Do not place the plant in the tray of water, as the water may rot the roots of the orchid over time."

      "title": "Prune the orchid's blooms to promote regrowth.",
      "content": "Prune the orchid's blooms to promote regrowth. After your orchid has finished blooming, use sharp scissors to cut off the flowering stem. Make the cut at a slight angle, just above the point it emerges from the rest of the plant. Doing this will allow for new growth to emerge during the next growing period. [14] X Research source Not trimming your orchid after it blooms may prevent it from blooming again."

      "title": "Increase the humidity in the room if leaves are drying out.",
      "content": "Increase the humidity in the room if leaves are drying out. If you spot dry or dead leaves on your plant, remove them by tugging at them gently. If an entire stem is dried out, use sharp scissors to remove it just above its base. Increase the humidity level of the room with a humidifier to prevent more leaves from drying out. [15] X Research source Brown leaf tips are also a sign of dryness."

      "title": "Move the orchid to a less sunny position if you see yellow leaves.",
      "content": "Move the orchid to a less sunny position if you see yellow leaves. Yellow leaves are usually a sign of sunburn or heat shock in orchids. If you see this symptom, move the plant to a cooler spot that gets less direct sunlight. To counteract any dryness, water the plant or increase the humidity level around it with a humidifier. [16] X Research source Yellow leaves can also be caused by over-watering. Check your orchid's roots for rot. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove mealybugs from the orchid with rubbing alcohol. Mealybugs are one of the main pests affecting orchids. Once you spot these tiny insects, which are usually only 0.5–0.8 millimetres (0.020–0.031 in) long, remove them right away to minimize their damage to the plant. Dip a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol and rub it over the surface of the plant to kill and remove the bugs. [18] X Research source After 1-2 days, repeat this process to remove any tiny yellowish spots you see on the plant, which are recently hatched mealybugs. Do not use other alcohols, like ethanol or methanol, as they will cause damage to the plant."
