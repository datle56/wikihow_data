[1] X Research source On the first, set an intention —anything you want to strive toward, become better at, or achieve in the coming days. Write this intention down on a sticky note or bit of paper and place it somewhere you can see it, like at your desk or on your fridge. For example, you might set an intention to spend more time relaxing or to exercise more regularly. Say your intention out loud to put the energy out into the universe. Say something like, “By performing this ritual, I intend to live a healthier and happier life this month.” Some believe the cinnamon ritual is also effective as a new moon ritual for abundance."
