      "title": "Dreaming of being chased by a bear may mean you’re avoiding something.",
      "content": "Dreaming of being chased by a bear may mean you’re avoiding something. Something scary, uncomfortable, or overwhelming in real life may be headed in your direction, and you’re reluctant to face it. Dreaming about a bear chasing after you may signify that it’s time to turn and face what you’ve been dreading . [1] X Research source While the thing you’re dreading may be uncomfortable, it’ll be better to rip the bandage off than to run from it forever."

      "title": "A bear attack could mean you’re being mistreated in real life.",
      "content": "A bear attack could mean you’re being mistreated in real life. Someone you know—maybe a partner, friend, coworker, or family member—isn’t being kind or respectful towards you. They’re not only invading your personal space, they’re being aggressive or harmful. The real-life mistreatment may be physical or emotional; either way, a bear attacking you could be how you subconsciously perceive this person. [2] X Research source The bigger the bear, or the more bears there are, the greater the threat. An aggressive bear may also represent your “shadow” self. In Jungian psychology, the shadow self represents the dark side of your personality—all your hidden desires and fears. An aggressive dream bear may symbolize all the parts of you that you try so hard to repress in waking life. [3] X Research source In the Bible, bears often signify aggression or ferocity. Dreaming of an attacking bear may represent a spiritual threat you must overcome, just as the shepherd David bravely overcame the bear attacking his flock in 1 Samuel 17:34-35. Reader Poll: We asked 133 wikiHow readers what they find most effective for dealing with nightmares, and 51% of them said I talk about them with friends or family to process my feelings. [Take Poll]"

      "content": "A bear in your house may signify someone is protecting you. If someone such as a parent or a significant other makes you feel safe and secure, your brain may interpret them as a bear. They’re in your safe space, guarding you against the dangers of the world. However, if you dream of a bear outside your home, it might mean the inverse: someone in your real life could be a threat to you—or you may perceive them as a threat, at least."

      "title": "A dream of a nice bear could symbolize a friend.",
      "content": "A dream of a nice bear could symbolize a friend. Bears are interesting creatures in that they are at once terrifying and vicious, and cuddly and cute—which is why the teddy bear is such a popular children’s toy. So while a bear dream could be bad news, a dream bear could also symbolize a friend you turn to for comfort, or perhaps someone whom you were once afraid of before you got to know them. A dream bear may also be a spiritual advisor or guide. In certain cultures, including Native American tradition, bears may be a totem of wisdom and support. They represent our positive traits—courage and strength—in addition to our darker traits—aggression and ferocity."

      "title": "Hibernating bears may signify your own need to rest.",
      "content": "Hibernating bears may signify your own need to rest . Bears are famous for their long winter naps. If you dream of a hibernating bear, it may be your brain’s way of telling you to get more sleep as well—or at least to seek some R&R. Have you been working overtime a lot lately? Traveling too much? Burning the candle at both ends? This dream could be your sign it’s time to slow down. Hibernating bears may also be signs of rebirth or renewal. The bear sleeps in the winter and rises in the spring, when everything is new again. Your dream may be a sign of optimism and hope for brighter days ahead."

      "title": "A cub could represent something you need to protect.",
      "content": "A cub could represent something you need to protect. Whether you have or want kids in real life or you’re charged with something less obvious to guard, such as the heart of a lover or the novel manuscript you’ve been writing for 6 years, a dream about guarding a bear cub could be your subconscious’s interpretation of your own protective feelings. [4] X Research source If the mama bear is nearby, a dream of cubs could be about an overbearing person. You’ve probably heard before that you should never get in between a mother bear and her babies. If you dream about bear cubs and you feel anxiety or fear because you sense the mother isn’t far away, your dream may be inspired by an overbearing person in real life."

      "title": "Dreams of being a bear may suggest you’re undergoing change.",
      "content": "Dreams of being a bear may suggest you’re undergoing change. Transforming into an animal in your dreams may indicate you’ve undergone or are about to undergo some sort of evolution in real life. Ask yourself what behaving like a bear will help you accomplish in real life. What would a bear’s traits—bravery, strength, wisdom, comfort—allow you to achieve? Dreams of being a bear may also signify that you’ve changed into something you shouldn’t have. Perhaps a stressful or dangerous real-life situation has caused you to adopt negative bear-like qualities, such as rage or viciousness, that you’d better leave behind."

      "content": "Waking a bear may mean you want to initiate something important. That “something” may be a creative endeavor, such as a painting, or maybe you need to have a tough conversation that you with a loved one. It may be overwhelming or even scary, but it’s urgent and necessary. A ball needs to get rolling, and you’re the one to set things in motion. Waking a bear may also indicate that there’s a dangerous presence in your life you don’t want to arouse or whose attention you don’t want to attract—perhaps an abusive or overbearing person."

      "content": "Hunting the bear may mean you’re in charge. If you dream about hunting a bear, it may indicate you’re confident and have the upper hand in some situation—maybe a professional situation, or a romantic relationship.

Don’t be afraid: remember, you wield the power."

      "title": "White bears may signify purity and compassion.",
      "content": "White bears may signify purity and compassion. If you dream of a polar bear, it means you are a charitable person. You do right by others, and your stainless coat suggests you don’t make mistakes. The white bear may actually signify that you are too perfect, and could benefit from being more open to trying new things. White bears may also symbolize a cold, overbearing person. While many bear dreams are of black or brown bears, dreams of polar bears may indicate the overbearing person is particularly cold or callous."

      "content": "Brown bears may signify strength and stability. Brown bears are some of the most common bears to dream of. Across different cultures, brown bears represent positive attributes—in Native American tradition, they represent wisdom and strength. [5] X Research source In Slavic cultures, brown bears signify protection, and in Japanese tradition, they stand for generosity. If you dream of a black or brown bear, it could be a sign you’re more powerful than you think. If there’s something you’re intimidated by, an overwhelming task you’ve been putting off, perhaps, now is the time to tackle it."

      "title": "Pandas may symbolize grayness or ambiguity.",
      "content": "Pandas may symbolize grayness or ambiguity. A panda’s black and white coat may represent just that: a situation that is neither black nor white, but more nuanced. If you’re struggling with uncertainty in your real life, your bear dream may speak to your ambivalence or confusion. The bear may represent uncertainty regarding how to act, or it may signify that there is no right or wrong way to act. It may be a confirmation that the situation you’re dealing with isn’t black-and-white, but complex and nuanced."

      "content": "In the end, your interpretation means the most. While there are various psychological and spiritual interpretations to bear dreams, everyone has their own personal associations with bears that influence the meaning of their dreams.
