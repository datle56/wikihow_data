Even if you applied for Medicaid in person or over the phone, you can still use your state's website to manage your account or check your status. Go to your state's Medicaid website and look for a button to register or sign up for an account. Click the button and follow the prompts. [3] X Research source If you don't know the URL for your state's Medicaid website, you can find a link at https://www.medicaidplanningassistance.org/state-medicaid-resources . You'll need an email address to set up an online account. Your state Medicaid office will use that email address to communicate with you about your Medicaid benefits and your account status. If you don't yet have an email account , you can set one up for free with an email provider such as Google or Yahoo. You'll also need to create a password for your online Medicaid account. Pick something that's easy for you to remember, but would be hard for anyone else to guess."
