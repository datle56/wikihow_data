      "content": "The Blue Steel is a comical, self-serious facial expression. The Blue Steel is a humorous and dramatic look that’s meant to poke fun at serious modeling expressions. The look usually involves furrowing your brow, sucking in your cheeks, pursing your lips, and staring down the camera with intensity. The look often involves different head movements to achieve an even more dramatic (and funny) look. For instance, you might look over your shoulder, push your head out, or tilt it slightly down or to either side."

      "content": "People use “Blue Steel” to poke fun at serious poses in photos. When striking a serious, model-like pose in front of the camera (or mirror), people often refer to themselves as “giving the Blue Steel” or “Blue Steeling.” This is a funny way to call out their silly and overly exaggerated look. People also talk about celebrities and models giving the Blue Steel in photos and on red carpets to joke about their serious looks. For instance, you might post a photo of yourself giving a dramatic facial expression on Instagram or Snapchat and caption it “Blue Steel.” Or, you might share pictures on TikTok or X/Twitter of your favorite celebrity serving face and joke about them Blue Steeling."

      "content": "The Blue Steel look comes from the movie Zoolander . Zoolander is a 2001 comedy film starring Ben Stiller, who plays the titular character Derek Zoolander. Zoolander is a male model who’s known for his signature look—the Blue Steel. The look is a satire of “serious” model expressions and involves Zoolander sucking in his cheeks, pursing his lips, and intensely gazing at the camera. [1] X Research source While Zoolander clearly thinks the look makes him look good, the joke is that he actually looks ridiculous and self-important. He pulls the look multiple times throughout the movie (as well as identical poses that are meant to look different, but don’t), making it one of best-known gags in the film. Technically, the Blue Steel comes from a short sketch shown at the 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards. Ben Stiller stars as Derek Zoolander, who talks about his famous poses, the Blue Steel and Ferrari (which look exactly the same). The sketch was so popular that it prompted Stiller to write and direct Zoolander. Zoolander is meant to be a satire of the fashion industry and modeling. It’s had a huge influence on pop culture, with many people seeing it as responsible for making the duck face, selfies , and social media influencers popular. In interviews, Stiller has said that the Blue Steel pose came from the expressions he’d make in the mirror to make himself look good. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Zoolander’s other famous looks are Le Tigre, Ferrari, and Magnum. In the film , Zoolander explains that Le Tigre and Ferrari are his other signature looks. Even though they look exactly the same to the audience, Zoolander says Le Tigre is a “softer” look. Magnum is a new look that Zoolander’s been working on for years and teases throughout the film. When he finally uses it at the end of the movie to save the day, surprise—it looks exactly like Blue Steel! Mugatu, the antagonist of the film, seems to be the only one who notices Zoolander’s looks are all the same. At the end of the movie , he loses it and yells, “Blue Steel, Ferrari, Le Tigre? They’re the same face!”"

      "content": "Furrow your brow, pucker your lips, and stare down the camera. To achieve the iconic Blue Steel look, start by bunching your brows and slightly raising them—you want a smoldering, slightly surprised look. Then, suck in your cheeks and purse your lips. Finally, squint your eyes slightly and gaze intently into the camera. [3] X Research source Stiller has explained in interviews that the look is mental, too. You need to set your intention to achieve the look and clear your mind. The look also has an arrogant and impatient vibe, like you’re telling the cameraman to hurry up and take the picture."
