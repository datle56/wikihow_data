Prepare your shoes for cleaning by brushing away excess dirt, removing the shoelaces, and stuffing your shoes with newspaper or a shoe tree to protect their shape. You can use either a shoe brush or a damp rag to clean off the top layer of dirt clinging to the surface of your shoes. Suede is soft and fairly delicate. Use gentle brushing motions to clear away dirt. You can wash your laces either by hand or by placing them in a mesh laundry bag in a washing machine."

      "content": "Remove the shoe insoles and deodorize the shoe's interior. To keep your shoes smelling fresh, don't forget to clean inside! After removing the insoles, spray them with a deodorizing cleanser to kill any odor-causing bacteria. You can also spray a rag and wipe the interior of your shoe to combat any lingering odor. Allow your shoes and the insoles to air dry. Lysol or Febreze are both cleaners that eliminate odor-causing bacteria. If you would prefer a natural option, you can use tea tree oil or other essential oil. Place several drops of tea tree oil onto a rag and wipe the interior of the shoe. For tough odors, add several drops to a paper towel and leave inside the shoe overnight. Tea tree oil is thought to have antibacterial and anti-fungal properties."
