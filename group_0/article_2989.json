      "content": "Show self-confidence through body language. Classy guys are like the magnet in the room: everyone is drawn to them. This isn’t because they show off or go out of their way to draw attention to themselves. Rather, it's simply because of their self-confidence. Even if you feel shy, appearing confident will actually make you feel more self-assured over time. Try things like: Looking people in the eye when you talk to them. Shaking hands when you meet people. Standing in a “power pose” (legs slightly apart, hands on hips, arms bent out slightly at the elbows)."

      "content": "Be considerate of others. This is the key to being classy, and without this, you will easily be mistaken for a snob. Be particularly attentive to the needs of the elderly and remember that nobody is beneath your notice. Always be polite . Classy guys do not say anything hurtful or offensive to other people. If you have to confront someone or put them in their place, speak the truth as you see it, but in moderate language and without recourse to shouting. It is important to find the right time and place for such confrontations. If you want to be a classy guy, then you should treat waiters, strangers, friends of friends, or neighbors with the same level of respect you would give to your close friends."

      "content": "Compliment people around you. Look for ways to make others feel good about themselves, and they'll start to admire you for paying attention. It's easy to do this by dishing out compliments. Just keep them genuine! Try giving simple compliments to people you know, like “Hey Karl, that jacket looks great on you!” You can also practice by saying nice things to strangers, like \"What a cute dog you have!\" Make sure not to give compliments that might be misconstrued as creepy or focus too much on physical features. For instance, instead of saying something like \"That dress really brings out your figure,\" try saying something like \"You look so elegant today!\""

      "content": "Give others a chance to talk. Classy guys will be charismatic, but not dominate conversations.

      "content": "Start conversations in a classy way. Whether you're meeting someone for the first time, or starting up a conversation with someone you already know, take things slow. A classy guy will start by asking how the person is doing, then move on to natural topics of conversation. For instance, if you're at a wedding, start by asking the person next to you if they're enjoying themselves. Ask questions, like \"So is this your first time in the area?\" to show you are interested in the person. If the conversation progresses, try to find mutual interests. For instance, you could talk about an acquaintance you have in common, or about favorite movies, travel, school, etc. Avoid asking for someone's phone number or contact info right away. Wait until you've talked a bit, to make sure the person is interested."

For instance, you could throw on a belt with a distinctive buckle, or wear fun socks to add a little flair. Try to dress appropriately for the occasion.
