Beware that not all fish are easy to care for. Some fish types will live happily in a low-maintenance aquarium or pond, whilst others like goldfish, can get ill if the pH balance is off. Goldfish are also more susceptible to illnesses like white spot, so make sure to research the species you want before you set up an aquarium. Fish are often thought to have a calming effect: simply watching them swim around may help reduce anxiety and stress."

Consider whether you can commit to regular aquarium-cleaning sessions. Cleaning an aquarium requires you to clean out pumps and filters, wash the entire structure of the tank, and prepare good-quality water for your aquatic pet to live in. Most fish need plenty of space to swim around. The larger the fish (and the more fish), the larger the tank you'll need. Research the tank size requirements for any aquatic creatures that you're thinking about getting."

Large birds can live for decades while smaller birds can live up to two years. They are also highly intelligent and are easy to care for. They don't require much attention from you but will need environmental stimulation through toys or interaction with you. Birds can also be very nurturing and even show empathy. Before considering an avian pet, you should ask yourself a few questions:"

Some birds, especially large parrots, have long life spans. African Grey parrots, for example, live an average of 50 years. Budgies, on the other hand, only live 5 to 15 years. Don't choose a bird that you're not willing to make a lifetime commitment to. [1] X Research source On a more regular scale, you'll need to commit to regular cage cleaning and bird grooming. Cages need to be cleaned weekly, and birds should be misted every few days. They also need at least several hours a day of interaction with a human. A lone bird can get bored easily. It can develop bad habits of over-grooming and over-eating which can be life-threatening if left untreated. Toys and appropriate avian companions can help mitigate this issue, but they still require interaction with the family."

Make sure that you know what it means to care for a reptile! Make sure that you're able to cater to the dietary needs of your reptile. Most reptiles are carnivores or omnivores, and will need to eat other animals like mice, crickets, rabbits, and birds. You can usually find these foods already killed and prepared at a local pet store, but some reptiles may require live food. Understand the thermal needs of your reptilian pet. Reptiles are coldblooded and will need an environment that is warm, enclosed, and properly sized. This can become an expensive endeavor, and it is known to surprise new reptilian owners. Since reptiles can be purchased quite cheaply, people are unwilling to spend money to meet their very specific needs. Consider whether you're ready to care for a reptile for many years. Some reptiles can live for up to 40 years – or even as much as 100 years. Make sure that you have enough space. Snakes and some lizards can grow to very large sizes (over ten feet long), whilst others stay very small (under one foot long), so once again it is important to decide what type you want before you set up an enclosure."

You can go online; visit your local library or bookstore; or speak to the staff at an animal shelter or pet store. Learn about the common traits, characteristics, and needs of common pets and their varying breeds. If you already have a few types of pet in mind (e.g. cat, rabbit, and iguana), ask about these animals first. Some cat breeds (like the Siamese) are very affectionate. They can't be left alone for long periods of time. Left alone, they can become depressed or develop separation anxiety. If you work long hours or can't be home all the time, you might want to reconsider owning a Siamese cat and look for another breed of cat. Climate can affect what kind of breed or species of pet you'd like to own. Most pet birds, for instance, do best in temperatures around 70 °F (20 °C). If you live in a colder environment, it's important to keep your pet bird indoors or another warm space. Many escaped birds die from exposure to the cold. Each breed of a species has its own unique grooming needs. A long-haired cat will need to be groomed daily, while some short-haired cats may only need grooming once a week."

      "content": "Choose between a young pet or a mature pet. The needs of an animal change with each stage of their life. Many new pet owners want to buy or adopt young pets such as puppies and kittens, but fail to realize that having baby animals can be difficult, time-consuming, and can become expensive. Some new pet owners may also become disappointed when their baby animals grow up into adult animals. In the United States of America, over 7.6 million pets enter animal shelters every year. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Many of them are strays and many of them are surrendered by pet owners for a variety of reasons. One unfortunate reason pet owners surrender their pets is that they realize they no longer want to care for their matured pet because it is no longer cute. So when you're thinking of adopting or buying a pet, it's important to ask yourself if a baby animal or mature animal is better for you. Young pets : Young pets need lots of attention and training. For dogs and cats, they will need to be house trained. For smaller animals like rodents and birds, constant attention and feedings will need to take place as you will be taking on the role of surrogate mother. Some young pets can also damage your home as baby animals often play bite, chew or scratch furniture, or soil your furniture. Some young pets will also need to be fixed and vaccinated. If you have young children in the home, you'll need to make sure your pets and children play safely together as both child and baby pet are quite fragile. As well, a young pet's temperament or personality may change as they become older. Mature pets: Adult pets can be difficult to bond with, especially if they had been previously mistreated or abused. It may take longer for an adult pet to warm up to you or get settled in their new environment. However, an adult pet's personality will remain the same. So what you see and observe initially about the pet, is probably what you'll be experiencing when you bring the pet home. Plus, an adult pet may need little to no obedience training. Adult dogs and cats can play and interact with young children safely. In shelters, adult pets are often never given a second chance, so adopting a mature pet means you're saving a life."

Millions of pets are euthanized each year because they were never adopted or the shelter could no longer support the amount of animals coming in each year. Adopting from a shelter potentially means saving an animal from euthanasia or a lifetime behind bars. The cost of adopting a pet from a shelter is quite reasonable and all pets are vaccinated and fixed before they're allowed to be adopted out. Shelter staff also know the animals very well and can help you choose the right pet for you. Breeders. It is extremely important that you choose a pet from a responsible and reputable breeder that is knowledgeable about the breed of pet they are selling. Breeders should always provide plenty of space, food, and water for their animals. They should also have properly socialized their animals before allowing them to be purchased and should never allow an animal to be purchased before they are properly socialized. Pets from breeders can be quite expensive, but is a good resource if you are looking for purebred pets. Pet stores. Some pet stores act as adoption agencies that work with local shelters to help adopt out pets. They may also care for and sell their own pets, allowing you to view their pets' living conditions."

Many buildings allow smaller pets but not larger ones. Some may not allow certain animals regardless of its size and some will allow pets if a damage deposit is paid. Check with your landlord or building management for rules about the specific species, breed, and size of pet that you're allowed to have. Get permission in writing and have your lease or contract updated. Word of mouth or permission granted vocally is often unreliable. Written proof can come in handy if you run into problems later on. Check your municipal, county, or provincial laws if you're planning to own an exotic animal or if you are importing an animal. If you're importing an animal from outside the country, check with airlines and Customs or Port Authority on the necessary paperwork and quarantine procedures for animals coming from the source country. These regulations can change between borders without notice at any given time, depending on health regulations. Some pets need large open spaces to live in. Most pets can live in small homes as long as they have the opportunity to go outside or have plenty of indoor stimulation through play or interaction with others."
