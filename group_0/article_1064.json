      "content": "Aegyo sal refers to the puffy area of fat under your eyes. In Korea and other Asian countries, people believe your aegyo sal (애교살 which translates to \"charming fat\") makes you look cute, innocent, and youthful. K-pop idols and K-drama actors often use makeup to highlight their aegyo sal, creating the appearance of bigger and brighter eyes. Having big and expressive eyes is one of the top Korean beauty standards for men and women. Not everyone is born with aegyo sal, however, and it’s more common in young people and children, since they have more fat under their eyes. Those with round faces, high cheekbones, or fuller cheeks are also more likely to have it because of the fat distribution on their face."

      "content": "Eye bags are located farther down on the face compared to aegyo sal. While aegyo sal is located directly beneath the lower lash line, eye bags are located under your aegyo sal (if you have any). Aegyo sal is a small and puffy pocket of fat that’s usually a brighter shade than your skin tone, while eye bags look like large swelling or puffiness under the eyes that’s dark in color. Your aegyo sal makes you look youthful and more “awake,” while eye bags make you look older and tired. Most people enhance the appearance of their aegyo sal (or enhance it with makeup). Eye bags, on the other hand, are caused by factors like fluid retention, allergies, lack of sleep, smoking, genetics, aging and other medical conditions.

      "content": "Does everyone have aegyo sal? No, not everyone is born with aegyo sal. The visibility of your aegyo sal also depends on factors, like age and facial structure. Younger people may have a more prominent aegyo sal because they tend to have tighter skin and more fat under their eyes. Having larger, rounder eyes can also help your aegyo sal look more defined.

      "content": "Who looks best with aegyo sal makeup? Aegyo sal makeup suits people with small or sharp eyes, since it can make your eyes appear bigger and softer. It also works well for those who don’t have aegyo sal or have less noticeable fat under their eyes; when you already have super obvious aegyo sal, adding more makeup to highlight can come off as creepy. With that being said, anyone who wants to try out the ulzzang look should experiment with aegyo sal makeup. Adjusting the look to fit your natural features can enhance your eyes and make them pop!"

      "title": "Why does aegyo sal makeup look creepy on me?",
      "content": "Why does aegyo sal makeup look creepy on me? Your makeup might look bad, creepy or unnatural if you’re placing the brown eyeshadow too low, choosing a color that is too dark, or using a brush that’s too big to apply and blend the shadows. Keeping the brown eyeshadow close to your lower lash line, choosing a shade that’s 1-2 shades lighter than your skin tone, and using a small brush should fix these issues. Additionally, make sure your highlighter isn’t too light or glittery. Opt for a fine shimmer or satin eyeshadow that doesn’t have any chunks of glitter."
