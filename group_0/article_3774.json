Fill a glass jar 1/3 to 1/2 full, depending on how strong you want your tincture to be, with the dried herb of your choice, making sure not to pack it down. Fill the rest of the jar with a base ingredient, such as alcohol, and stir the ingredients with a spoon. Alcohol, such as vodka or 80-proof rum, makes a good base ingredient. You can also use glycerine, vinegar, or even honey. Use whatever herbs you want, depending on what kind of tincture you're making. For example, choose chamomile for a tincture that promotes restful sleep or echinacea for immune system support when you’re battling a cold. [6] X Research source Store your tincture in a cool, dry place for 3 weeks to 6 months.

It’s important to know the limits of your knowledge and abilities. Develop a go-to list of practitioners to whom you can refer clients when their problems and needs are beyond your ability to help. Judiciously making referrals will increase your clients’ trust in you, as well, rather than hurt your business. For example, you probably aren’t prepared to take on a client who has cancer if you’ve only taken a 6-week course on herbs."
