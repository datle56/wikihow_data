      "content": "Use bigger letters. For a period of time, try using bigger letters when you write. That way, you can see if you are making letters in the right way, and you can correct as you go. [2] X Research source One way to encourage larger writing is to use wide-ruled paper."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look at the heights of your letters.",
      "content": "Look at the heights of your letters. Your letters should all come up to about the same height, and any descenders should go about the same length below the line. [3] X Research source For instance, your lowercase \"g\" and \"y\" should go down about the same length. Also, they shouldn't be cramping the line below. [4] X Research source Use a ruler to check your height. If you lay it across the top of your uppercase and lowercase letters, you can see if you make certain letters shorter or taller."

    {
      "title": "Watch out for spacing.",
      "content": "Watch out for spacing. Make sure you aren't spacing your letters too far apart or too close together. Half of a lowercase \"o\" should fit between letters, no more."

      "title": "Go back to school.",
      "content": "Go back to school. That is, if you want a new style of writing, you need to relearn the way you write, which won't be that different from the way you learned to write as a kid."

      "content": "Print off the font in lowercase and uppercase letters. You can also include pangrams such as \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" Pangrams are texts that contain every letter in the English language, so they are good for practice. Start out using a larger size for your font, such as 14 point."

      "title": "Move on to copying.",
      "content": "Move on to copying. Once you've traced the letters a few times, move on to copying the letters by looking at the letters and trying to write sentences. This forces you to look at how the letters are actually formed."

      "title": "Try it on your own.",
      "content": "Try it on your own. Without looking at the font, try writing in the same style. Though it will not perfectly match the original, you will be using a different handwriting style."

      "content": "Find the right pen. The right pen will be different for each person, but in general, you should look for one that flows well and that you won't grip too tightly. Larger grips can help you loosen your grip. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Take your time. Most of the time with handwriting, it's just about patience. Good handwriting takes time, and if you rush through it, your writing will be sloppy. If you catch yourself being sloppy, take a deep breath, slow down, and start again. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Try air writing. This method teaches you to write with your arm instead of drawing the letters with your finger, making for better writing . [11] X Research source Holding your hand in the air, mostly use your forearm and shoulder to write large letters in the air. This practice will help you feel what muscles you should be using when you write. Move to smaller letters in the air. Use paper. When you first move to paper, try simple strokes like circles and slashes. Keep them as evenly spaced as possible, while still using the muscles in your arm."
