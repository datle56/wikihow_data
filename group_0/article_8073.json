      "content": "Wash goggles without anti-fog coating with mild soap. If your goggles don’t have a special coating, it is safe to clean them with a mild soap or baby shampoo. Apply the soap or baby shampoo to a wet sponge, and use the soapy sponge to clean the goggles, including the straps and frame. Then rinse the entire goggles thoroughly in warm water to remove all soap residue.

      "content": "Leave your goggles out to air-dry. Set them aside somewhere out of the sun and where they are not in risk of being scratched, and do not place them in a case or bag until they are completely dry. Storing goggles in a case while they are still wet can promote the growth of mould and bacteria. [8] X Research source It'll probably take about an hour for your glasses to dry, so try to clean them when you don't need to use them right away."

      "content": "Remove excess dirt with vinegar. If your swimming goggles remain dirty after a basic rinsing, wash them in a solution of vinegar and hot water. Find a bowl large enough to completely submerge the goggles, and fill it with hot tap water mixed with 5 tablespoons of white vinegar. Soak the goggles in the solution for 2 hours, then remove and rinse them in cold tap water before allowing them to air dry."

Anti-fog towelettes provide another option to clear up old goggles."
