You can get this from pay stubs, paid invoices, or even your bank statement. [2] X Research source If your income is extremely regular, you may not need more than a month of income to complete an annualization. If you receive income from multiple sources, make sure you have information for all sources you want to include."

      "content": "Total your income for the period. It's easiest to annualize income using months. Add up your income from all sources to get your total income for that period. Make a note of how many months of income you used to get that total. [3] X Research source For example, suppose you have 3 monthly paychecks of $7,000, $6,500, and $6,800. Your total would be $20,300 of income over 3 months."

      "content": "Divide the number of months in a year by the months of income. To annualize your income, use the ratio of the number of months in a year (12) over the number of months in the period you used to get your total. When you divide, your result will always be a number greater than 1. [4] X Research source For example, if you totaled your income over 3 months, your ratio would be 12/3 = 4."

      "content": "Multiply your total income by the result of the ratio. Once you've divided the ratio, multiply the total income you found for the period by that number. The result will be the estimated amount of income you earn in a year. [5] X Research source For example, if your total income over 3 months was $20,300, your annualized income would be $20,300 x 4 = $81,200. You may not have to annualize your income to pay estimated taxes. For example, in the US, you pay estimated taxes based on your actual income for that quarter, not what you project you'll earn later."

      "title": "Familiarize yourself with the formula.",
      "content": "Familiarize yourself with the formula. The formula to calculate an annualized rate of return (ARR) may look fairly intimidating at first. However, once you break it down into pieces, it's not as difficult as it looks. [6] X Research source The full formula is ARR = (1 + rate of return per period ) # of periods in a year – 1. The 1 simply turns a percentage into a whole number, so you can compound it. That's why it's subtracted at the end to get your final rate. Essentially, all you do is compound the rate of return by the number of periods. If you have a monthly rate of return, you would compound the rate by 12. A weekly return would be compounded by 52, while a daily return would be compounded by 365."

      "title": "Calculate your rate of return.",
      "content": "Calculate your rate of return. To calculate the rate of return on your investment, subtract the ending value of your investment from the beginning value of your investment, then divide that number by the beginning value of your investment. Multiply the result by 100 to get your rate of return. [7] X Research source For example, if you set up a portfolio with $10,000, and it now has a balance of $11,025, you have a total gain of $1,025. According to the equation, your rate of return is (11,025 – 10,000 / $10,000) x 100 = 10.25%."

Then divide (usually 365, the number of days in a year) by that number to find out how many of those periods are in one year. [8] X Research source For example, suppose you had a 10.25% rate of return on an investment that was 65 days old. The number of 65-day periods in a year is 365 / 65 = 5.615. If your rate of return happened to be a single day or a single month, you can skip this step and compound your rate of return by 365 (days) or 12 (months)."

Complete the calculation using the x y button on your calculator. [9] X Research source For example, your equation for the ARR continuing the example would be (1 + 0.1025) 5.615 – 1 = 0.7296 or 72.96%. Your annualized rate of return on the investment, therefore, is 72.96%. There are significant limitations to an annualized rate of return. Specifically, you have no guarantee that you'll be able to continually reinvest the money at the same rate."

If you frequently use a credit card, get copies of your credit card statements for the same month. [10] X Research source Use income and expenses across the same period. In other words, if you annualize 3 months of income, you should also annualize 3 months of expenses."

Your annualized income would be $14,000 x 12/3 = $14,000 x 4 = $56,000. Be sure to include any other sources of income in your equation.

A broad category, such as \"bills,\" likely won't be very helpful if you want to figure out where your money's going. On the other hand, too many individual categories add work and can get confusing. [12] X Research source For example, you might have categories such as \"house payment,\" \"utilities,\" and \"car.\" Under \"utilities,\" you would include bills such as electricity, gas, telephone, trash, water, and sewer. Under \"car,\" you might include your car payment, car insurance, and fuel. If there are specific expenses that you think are getting out of control, or that you want to keep particular tabs on, make them their category. For example, assume you believe that you're spending too much money buying lattes from the café near your work. You might create a \"latte\" category specifically for that expense."

For example, if you get fuel for your car once every other week, the time period for that expense for your annualization equation would be 52 / 2 = 26. Expenses that only occur once or twice a year don't have to be annualized. Simply add them to your annualized total."

Financial experts recommend budgeting your money so that 50% of your income goes towards necessities, 20% towards things that you want, and 20% towards savings for the future. Organize your categories into these broader categories and see how your annualized numbers compare. [15] X Research source If this is your first time doing an annualized budget, you may find that the proportions are far off track from where they need to be. Balancing a budget takes time and effort. Identify problem expenses that you think you can decrease or eliminate entirely. For example, if you have a subscription to a magazine that you never read, you can save that cost by simply canceling the subscription."

For example, if you pay $300 in renter's insurance once a year, you would need to put away or earmark $25 each month."
