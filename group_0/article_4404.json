      "title": "Brad Pitt’s haircut in Fury is a pompadour with a disconnected undercut.",
      "content": "Brad Pitt’s haircut in Fury is a pompadour with a disconnected undercut. The style is left long on top to create a slick pompadour, and closely shaved on the sides and back. Note that the sides have a disconnected undercut—there’s no taper or fade between the long top and shaved sides. The back has a softer fade, also known as a tapered undercut. [1] X Research source Pitt went viral for rocking the unusual haircut at awards shows before revealing he got the cut for a role in the 2014 WWII film Fury . The rapper Macklemore also popularized the undercut in 2014, making it his signature look. [2] X Research source The look combines a more modern-looking undercut with an old-school, slicked back pompadour (calling back to the WWII era when Fury took place). The combo of edgy and classic styles has made this look super popular among young men in the 2010s and 2020s."

      "content": "Ask for a disconnected undercut on the sides and a soft fade in back. Request that they leave at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of hair on top. You need enough length to brush back into the pompadour. A blade shave will offer the closest, cleanest cut, though the style can also be achieved with clippers. [3] X Research source"

Finally, use a comb to section your hair into 3 sections: the sides and the middle/top. [4] X Research source Use hair clips to secure the middle/top section up and out of the way so it’s easy to shave the sides."

Start at the front near your face, running the clipper in upward motions until you hit about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the part where the top/middle section begins. Work your way back. Leave the same 1 inch (2.5 cm) barrier of hair at the top in the back. [5] X Research source Use a handheld mirror in your non-dominant hand to help you see as you shave the sides."

Comb your hair back as you blow dry in an upward direction, starting at the front of the pompadour. Once dry, run pomade through your hair with your fingers, from hairline to the back. Comb again to smooth and distribute the product throughout. [11] X Research source For a more tousled look, gently pinch out sections of hair near the back of the pompadour."

Once your hair is around 2 inches (5.1 cm) in length at the crown, feel free to get the Fury cut. [15] X Research source Undercuts on wavy or curly hair may resemble the broccoli haircut instead of the Fury cut—although the broccoli cut has more volume in the front."
