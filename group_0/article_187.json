      "title": "Learn how to write a great prompt.",
      "content": "Learn how to write a great prompt. NightCafe user adansito discovered a reliable formula for creating effective prompts. The order of these elements is crucial, with the main subject coming first. According to adansito, a well-structured prompt should include the following elements: Main Subject Secondary Subject Artist Names / Style Prompts Photography / Artistic Prompts Specific Colors (Optional) The order of these elements is crucial, with the main subject coming first. Hereâ€™s an example of a well-structured prompt: \"A deer passing through (main subject) an abandoned neon city (secondary subject), by Dan Mumford and Victo Ngai (artist names / styles), 8k resolution, a masterpiece, 35mm, hyperrealistic, hyper maximalist (photography/artistic prompts), crimson, jade (colors).\""

      "title": "Overcrowding your prompt.",
      "content": "Overcrowding your prompt. One common mistake is overcrowding your prompt with too many conflicting elements. This can confuse the AI and result in a muddled image. Instead, focus on a few key elements and describe them clearly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Being too vague.",
      "content": "Being too vague. While simplicity is important, being too vague can also be problematic. Ensure your prompt provides enough detail for the AI to understand your vision. For example, instead of just saying \"tree,\" you might specify \"a large oak tree with sprawling branches.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Ignoring the order of elements.",
      "content": "Ignoring the order of elements. The order of elements in your prompt matters. Always place the most important subject first to ensure the AI prioritizes it in the image. Follow the recommended structure at the beginning of this article for the best results."

    {
      "title": "Practice makes perfect when it comes to prompt writing.",
      "content": "Practice makes perfect when it comes to prompt writing. Start by experimenting with different combinations of subjects, styles, and artistic prompts. Pay attention to the results and refine your prompts based on what works best."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be specific.",
      "content": "Be specific. AI generators can be very literal, so be specific when writing your prompt. However, leaving some parts vague can lead to interesting results. Example: \"Five canaries sitting side-by-side on a telephone wire\" is very specific, while \"A few birds sitting in a row\" is more vague."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your prompts concise but detailed.",
      "content": "Keep your prompts concise but detailed. The words near the end of a lengthy prompt are more likely to get ignored by the AI generator, but be sure to include all relevant details. Example: Use \"a fluffy orange tabby cat\" instead of \"an orange cat with a tabby coat pattern with long and fluffy fur.\""

    {
      "title": "Include descriptors that will affect the look of the final image.",
      "content": "Include descriptors that will affect the look of the final image.

    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid uncommon words.",
      "content": "Avoid uncommon words. AI generators will often get confused if you use complicated or uncommon words in your prompts. Example: Use \"huge\" instead of \"gargantuan\" to describe a large object."

    {
      "title": "Don't describe things you don't want in the final image.",
      "content": "Don't describe things you don't want in the final image. Any word you include in your prompt could be included in the final image. If there's something you want to avoid in your image, describe it in a way that doesn't include the word. Example: Use \"an empty parking lot\" instead of \"a parking lot with no cars.\""

      "title": "Character design",
      "content": "Character design Do you spend a lot of time imagining what your original characters look like? Try these prompts to make them come to life, filling in your own character details and adding more as you see fit: Full-body concept art of a [character's gender, race, and/or class] with [description of hair, eyes, and/or skin]. He/she/they is/are wearing [description of outfit] and holding [description of weapon or other item]. They are standing in a [location].

Use these prompts to get started, and edit them to make even more detailed pieces. An abstract image that is bursting with bright and vibrant colors.
