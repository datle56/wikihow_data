      "title": "Have good hygiene",
      "content": "Have good hygiene . Cleanliness matters. Shower and wash your face every day for a bright complexion and clean hair. Brush your Teeth every night before bed for a beautiful smile. Also remember to use deodorant , and consider keeping some in your backpack if you tend to sweat. Apply facial sunscreen (SPF 30 or more) every day after washing your face so you can protect your skin. A facial sunscreen will not clog your pores. Some girls find that sweat and body odor are easier to manage if they shave their armpits . This is not required in order to be attractive, and you can decide what's best for you. Try out light perfume for a finishing touch."

      "title": "Consider wearing makeup if it interests you.",
      "content": "Consider wearing makeup if it interests you. Some girls like to wear a little makeup and others prefer the natural look. It's your choice. You may want concealer for acne, blush , lip gloss , and/or some eye makeup for fun. Feel free to experiment and find out what you like. There is no right or wrong with makeup. If you're new to makeup, start small and light. See how you like it and get good at the basics. Then branch out more as you become more skilled. You can also try tricks that don't involve makeup, like dripping water on your eyelashes to make them clump together nicely, or brushing your lips with a toothbrush so they look fuller."

      "title": "Play with your hair",
      "content": "Play with your hair . Experiment with different hairdos and accessories. Do you like ponytails, pigtails, braids, hair clips, ribbons, flowers, etc.? Some girls like to straighten or curl their hair, while others keep their natural texture. Figure out what works for you—up or down, fancy or simple. Find some styles that make you happy and let your awesome hair shine."

      "title": "Be creative and fun with your outfits.",
      "content": "Be creative and fun with your outfits. If you see something that you love, then wear it, no matter what the fashion magazines say. Wear colors and styles that make you feel happy, and the boost in mood will make you even more attractive. Try finding out which colors flatter your skin color best . A family member or friend with an eye for color may be able to help. It may help to learn what your body type is, so you can choose outfits that best show off your figure."

      "title": "Remember that modesty doesn't determine beauty.",
      "content": "Remember that modesty doesn't determine beauty. You can look awesome in modest outfits or in more revealing ones. You decide what styles work best for you. Remember that clothes don't have moral value—modest clothes don't make you a \"prude,\" and revealing clothes don't make you naughty or responsible for men's emotions. Dress in the way that makes you most comfortable and don't worry about it. Other people may have opinions about your choices. Say, \"This is what I feel comfortable in.\" Similarly, don't criticize other people for how they like to dress. Remember that your clothes don't control other people's behavior. If someone harasses you, tell a responsible adult."

      "title": "Take good care of your body",
      "content": "Take good care of your body . Get at least 8 hours of beauty sleep each night (9 or 10 is even better), fill at least 1/3 of your plate with fruits and veggies, and stay active. Try joining sports teams, going on a walk with your sister each evening, or going to the beach with friends. A healthy girl is a beautiful girl."

      "title": "Keep a straight posture and look people in the eye.",
      "content": "Keep a straight posture and look people in the eye. Posture matters not just because you look great, but because it'll help avoid backaches and other issues.Hold your head high, walk with a purpose, and let the world see that you're awesome. Practice a confident walk at home, and you'll start to really feel it, even if you don't consider yourself a confident person. Some neurodivergent people find eye contact uncomfortable. You can look at someone's nose, eyebrows, chin, necklace, or whatever is comfortable. If you have a disability that affects your posture, follow your therapist's/doctor's advice first. Remember that attitude is key, so crutches or a wheelchair don't have to get in the way of looking confident."

    {
      "title": "Work on your confidence.",
      "content": "Work on your confidence . Confidence will attract others and make people value what you have to say. Practice walking confidently and \"power posing\" at home. Make a list of your strongest traits. Surround yourself with pictures of awesome women like you. Throw out the beauty magazines. These feed insecurity, and you don't need that in your life. Recognize that your opinions and feelings are just as important as anyone else's. It's good to be nice, but it's not good to constantly defer to others and never express your wants."

      "title": "Cultivate an attitude of cheer and appreciation.",
      "content": "Cultivate an attitude of cheer and appreciation. The feeling of gratitude plays a large role in happiness, so keep a journal of the things you're grateful for. Every night, write down 2 things you are thankful for today (e.g. \"I'm thankful for my sister helping me with my homework\" or \"I'm thankful for the sunny weather\"). Practice thanking people when they do nice things for you or your community."

      "title": "Build strong relationships",
      "content": "Build strong relationships with others. Hang out with your friends, be there for them when they need you, and practice good listening skills . Staying well-connected will improve your mental health, making you all the more confident and beautiful. Consider your friends, family members, and mentors. The quality of your relationships is more important than the quantity. Having a few close friends is better than having lots of friends you aren't close with. If you want to make friends , try joining clubs or volunteer opportunities where you can meet people like you. Or, reach out to a classmate or acquaintance. Don't be afraid to reach out when you need something! Remember, people like to be helpful, and being vulnerable allows them to show their true colors and be a great friend to you too."

    {
      "title": "Try volunteer work.",
      "content": "Try volunteer work. Volunteering is a great way to give to the community and let your kindness shine. Try joining to help a cause you believe in, like feminism, antipoverty groups, disability rights, environmentalism, et cetera. This will help you feel like a productive citizen, and you can meet other nice people like yourself!"

      "title": "Work hard in school",
      "content": "Work hard in school . Intelligence and hard work are very attractive traits. Whether you're nerdy or not, education is an important aspect of your future, and potential significant others will be attracted to a girl who has the knowledge to provide for herself. Remember that girls can be great at STEM subject areas. There are many incredible women scientists, mathematicians, etc. who are left out of the history books. (Search the internet for \"women in _____\" and see for yourself!) There are tons of jobs in these fields, so you would be super attractive to employers. It's okay if you're low on natural ability. Hard work is more important than inborn intelligence in the long run. Do your best, try hard, and you'll be great!"

      "content": "Realize it's okay to be a little different. Everyone stands out in some little way—whether it's the size of their nose or the quirks of their speech. People tend not to care as much as you might think. (They may be too busy with their own troubles!) Don't let mean people make you feel ugly. Your nose is elegant, your skin color is majestic, your curves are endearing, your body is powerful, your laugh is infectious, and you are worth getting to know."

    {
      "title": "Don't worry too much about what others think of you.",
      "content": "Don't worry too much about what others think of you. Attractiveness is subjective, and nobody has the same definition. Focus most on your own health and happiness , let beauty come naturally , and don't worry if you happen to bump into naysayers along the way. Be the best you can be, and let the rest fall into place."
