Turn the watch over and find the small hole or indentation that's on the side of the watch, between the watch back and the watch itself. This indentation is created specifically to help you pry off the back of the watch. If you can't find the indentation, scan the backside of your watch with a magnifying glass. Wear a pair of dust free latex gloves when replacing your battery."

Press down heavily on the watch back until it snaps back into place. [2] X Research source It's important to line up the back of the watch perfectly or you run the risk of damaging the watch's internal parts. Some watches require a watch press to reattach the back to the watch."

To remove them, use a small screwdriver that you would use for eyeglasses and turn the screws until you can remove them from the watch. [3] X Research source Make sure to put the small screws in a safe place, like a ziplock bag, so that you don't lose them."

Snap offs will have a completely smooth back with a small cut or indentation where the back of the watch meet and watch meet. Swatches will have a slot on the back where you can fit a coin."

Insert a small screwdriver into the hole and press up with your screwdriver to disengage the clip. This should make your battery accessible.
