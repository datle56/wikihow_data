      "title": "Select an undergraduate major in the liberal arts or sciences.",
      "content": "Select an undergraduate major in the liberal arts or sciences. Invitations to join the Phi Beta Kappa Society are limited to undergraduate students majoring in a science or liberal art. Any liberal art or science major is acceptable so long as it is academic in nature and does not lead to a professional degree. Ask your college advisor if you’re not sure whether your major leads to a professional degree or not. [2] X Research source Professional degrees assert your proficiency for a specific job, like nursing, civil engineering, or primary education. If your major is also the name of a job, it is probably a professional major. Sports therapy, dentistry, business, and teaching are all examples of professional degrees. English, sociology, mathematics, and philosophy are examples of academic degrees because they qualify you for a variety of different types of work. In general, academic majors teach you how to think while professional degrees teach you how to do something specific. For example, someone with an English degree can go on to become a teacher, publisher, writer, doctor, or something else. A student with a nursing degree is really only prepared to be a nurse, though."

      "title": "Complete at least 90 semester hours to qualify.",
      "content": "Complete at least 90 semester hours to qualify. Complete your freshman and sophomore year by taking a full schedule of classes. Once you finish your junior year, you’ll be eligible if you’ve completed at least 90 of the 120 semester hours required to graduate college. If you haven’t completed 90 hours before the end of your junior year, you will become eligible after you reach the hour requirement. [3] X Research source Freshmen and sophomores are never invited to join the Phi Beta Kappa Society. You can be invited as a junior if you’re scheduled to graduate ahead of time, though. Usually, 60% of your credit hours must be completed at the school where your chapter is located. In other words, you will not be eligible if you completed your first 2 years of college at another school. If your school has a different set of graduation requirements, the Phi Beta Kappa Society will use whatever 3/4 of your required hours are to determine the eligibility threshold. For example, if your program requires 140 hours, they’ll wait until you’ve completed 105 hours."

      "title": "Maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.75 to stay eligible.",
      "content": "Maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.75 to stay eligible. While every Phi Beta Kappa chapter has its own requirements for GPA, Phi Beta Kappa candidates must usually maintain an overall GPA of 3.75. If you’re a junior, you are often required maintain a GPA of 3.85. If your GPA falls below this level while your records are under review, you will not be invited. if you are returning from a break in your education, don’t worry about classes that you took more than 5 years ago. Phi Beta Kappa won’t include them in their decision to invite you. The GPA requirement refers to an unweighted GPA on a scale from 0-4. Colleges and universities do not typically use a weighted GPA system."

      "title": "Take a variety of advanced courses in your major.",
      "content": "Take a variety of advanced courses in your major. The Phi Beta Kappa Society places a special value on prospects with a wide range of in-depth knowledge in their major. If your major only requires 2 advanced courses, take 4-5 instead. If you have a choice between several 200- and 300-level courses, take the 300-level class. Take a variety of courses in your major to get a well-rounded understanding of your subject. [4] X Research source For example, if you’re an English major with a focus on medieval literature, take some advanced creative writing and modern lit classes in addition to your core requirements. Some chapters have additional requirements to take specific classes in other key disciplines. Consult your chapter’s website or visit their on-campus office to find out what the course requirements are."

    {
      "title": "Complete at least one course in collegiate-level math or logic.",
      "content": "Complete at least one course in collegiate-level math or logic. Regardless of what your major is, you must complete at least one class that demonstrates your quantitative reasoning. Even if your major is art or English, you must complete at least one college-level mathematics or logic course. Remedial courses cannot count towards this requirement. A logic class will count so long as it’s not an abstract course. Boolean or mathematical logic are good options if you don’t want to take a pure math class. Phi Betta Kappa doesn’t list whether this requirement can be a course that fulfills a general education requirement or not, so it’s a good idea to take an extra math class just to be safe."

      "title": "Take intermediate classes in a foreign language or be bilingual.",
      "content": "Take intermediate classes in a foreign language or be bilingual. The Phi Beta Kappa Society has a foreign language requirement. You must, at bare minimum, reach the intermediate level of classes in a foreign language at your school. Take the introductory classes in a foreign language of your choice as a freshman. Once you’re eligible, sign up for the intermediate classes the following year. You automatically meet this requirement if you’re bilingual. At most schools, this means passing a 200-level foreign language class. Any foreign language will count towards this requirement so long as your school offers advanced classes in the subject. For example, a 100-level class in Hungarian will not help you meet this requirement if there are no 200-level Hungarian classes."

      "title": "Be friendly to everyone on campus and avoid unnecessary conflicts.",
      "content": "Be friendly to everyone on campus and avoid unnecessary conflicts. Phi Beta Kappa looks for candidates that are socially responsible, compassionate, and friendly. When you’re on campus, smile and strike up positive conversations with other students and faculty. Shake hands with people and do your best to stay in a good mood, even when you’re having a rough day. Avoid arguments in and out of class to develop a reputation as a level-headed, friendly student. [5] X Research source The requirements surrounding ethics and morality differ from campus to campus. If you go to a socially-conservative school, there may be additional requirements that aren’t mentioned here."

      "content": "Stay out of trouble with the law and don’t break your school’s rules. To meet the moral requirements for most chapters, you must have a clean criminal record. Don’t do anything illegal to ensure that you don’t encounter problems with the law. Avoid breaking your school’s code of conduct by drinking on campus or allowing unregistered guests to stay in your dorm. Violating your school’s rules will make you seem like an unworthy candidate."

      "content": "Avoid plagiarizing and cheating to ensure that you remain eligible. The Phi Beta Kappa Society is an organization that values academic integrity. If you cheat on an exam or break the school’s academic policy, you’re sure to not be invited to join. Make sure that everything you turn in is 100% original and don’t let your eyes wander on to anyone else’s paper during exams to avoid any accusations of dishonesty. [6] X Research source You can be accused of plagiarism if you share your work with a friend and then they copy it as their own. Keep your work private to avoid this problem."

      "content": "Join an on-campus organization or club to get involved. Getting involved in a campus-endorsed organization or club is an excellent way to get your name out there at school. Political clubs, volunteer organizations, and faith-based groups are all excellent ways to meet new students and stand out as a strong candidate. Visit your school’s website or extracurricular office to find a list of campus-approved clubs and organizations. [7] X Research source Only 1/8 of a senior class can be invited to join a Phi Beta Kappa chapter. Standing out on campus is the best way to get noticed as a strong candidate. Colleges typically host some kind of club fair where different organizations recruit new members and show students what they’re all about. Attend an extracurricular fair to find a group that suits you."

      "content": "Attend social functions and introduce yourself to other students. If your dorm is hosting a pajama party, show up with something for everyone to snack on. If there’s a big football game this weekend, show up with your face painted. Introduce yourself to students that you don’t know and do your best to appear enthusiastic, even if you aren’t. Engaging with other students will earn you a reputation as an involved student. [8] X Research source If you have a choice between an academic and social event, choose the academic one. An on-campus chess tournament is more likely than a football game to have faculty or other Phi Beta Kappa members in attendance."

While Phi Beta Kappa chapters are invitation-only, it can’t hurt your chances to express your interest in the organization. Email or call the chapter’s office. Introduce yourself by providing your name, field of study, and extracurricular interests. Explain that you’re interested in their organization and would like to be considered once you’re eligible. This will ensure that your transcripts are reviewed when it comes time for the chapter to send its invitations. Phi Beta Kappa chapters rarely have offices on campus, but you should show up and introduce yourself if they do have one!"

Depending on the chapter, you’ll need to pay a $40-100 annual fee to retain your membership. Meet with the head faculty member or chapter president to learn more about your chapter’s scholarship opportunities, meetings, or on-campus events. [9] X Research source List your membership on your resume after you graduate and start applying for jobs. It’s a major accomplishment, and you’ll be glad you included it if you’re ever interviewed by an older member!"
