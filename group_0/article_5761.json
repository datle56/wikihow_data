The later you are into the contract term, the lower the cancelation fee. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Tell the representative that you want to cancel your internet service. You will need to present a convincing excuse, as representatives are trained to try to talk you out of canceling. If you have a solid excuse that an agent cannot argue with, you shouldn't have any trouble. For example, you can say you're moving to a location that does not have Cox service or that your employer is now supplying your internet access. If you're canceling over the phone, the agent with will typically transfer you to a customer retention specialist who will try even harder to convince you to stay. The retention agent will usually offer you added features or discounts if you agree not to cancel. If you're not interested, be polite, but stay firm and reiterate that you want to cancel. If the agent will not stop pressing you to stay, ask to speak to a supervisor. If you have other services through Cox, such as cable or phone service, be specificâ€”if you want to keep other services, you'll need to let the representative know."
