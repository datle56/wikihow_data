The liver is ready when it looks very slightly pink in the middle with brown edges. If the liver looks raw or rare, continue cooking it for a few more minutes before checking it again. [12] X Research source The liver tastes best when it is very slightly pink in the middle, as this means that it isn’t overcooked. You can also check that the liver is cooked using a meat thermometer. Insert the probe into the thickest part of the liver and ensure that the temperature has reached at least 165 °F (74 °C)."
