Unlike wikiHow's New Article Booster rights to be able to change titles, on Wikipedia, as long as the user has a registered account that is at least four days old and has at least ten edits, you'll be able to change the title of an article. You'll need to enter your username and password to your Wikipedia account and click the \"Log in\" button. If you haven't created an account there already, create a Wikipedia account. (Visit the English Wikipedia Page for details.) While the sign-up process is similar to the sign-up process for wikiHow, your username for wikiHow is not transferable to Wikipedia."

      "content": "Open the Discussion page of the article that you'd like to change the title to. On any wiki, the proper word for this changing is called a \"Move\". It may tell you that it is a good idea to change the title, or it isn't a good idea. If it says absolutely nothing, you can rest assured that you've done everything you could to ensure you weren't missing any users who would be opposed to such a change. If you are unsure of what a better title should be but know it should be changed, be sure to submit a suggestion and reason why you think it should be moved to the article's Discussion page."

If you don't see a \"More\" link up at the top right corner (this could even be caused if the title you thought about changing has a user_rights issue with it), you will not be able to change its title."

      "content": "Type the designated data into the appropriate boxes. You'll need to type a new name into the \"To new title\" box, as well as why you decided to change its title in the \"Reason\" box. Most often, you shouldn't need to fiddle with the \"New title\" drop-down box which will allow you to change the namespace, but that part of the change is rather rare on Wikipedia. What reason you type in the \"Reason\" box will differ on a case-by-case basis, so no one title change will ever have the same reason."

You'll be presented with every article that's ever been moved or redirected to the original article, where this title has been linked, and must now be changed. Click the link above the list that is titled \"Show redirects only\". You'll need to change all these to the current article's title name. Open each of the article pages listed on the resultant page, and change the article title listed within the square brackets (the same concept as redirects here on wikiHow) to the new name you've moved this article to."
