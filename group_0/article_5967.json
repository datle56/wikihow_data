    {
      "title": "Find the right container.",
      "content": "Find the right container. Slugs generally do well in aquariums. An aquarium should be at least 20 centimeters by 20 centimeters (8 by 8 inches). You can buy an aquarium online or at a pet store. Make sure to provide proper ventilation. The lid should have holes for ventilation. Something like a mesh lid, for example, would work well. Slugs are very small, especially in comparison to reptiles that are usually kept in aquariums. Examine ventilation holes carefully and make sure a slug cannot creep out of these holes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Provide substrate.",
      "content": "Provide substrate. It's best to use soil, grass, and leaves from outdoors for the substrate. If you took the slug from outdoors, use soil, leaves, and grass from the area where you found it. Make sure to sift through soil before adding it to your aquarium to remove any bugs. Once a week, remove your slug and put it in a safe container with air holes. Remove the substrate and then replace it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Invest in aquarium supplies.",
      "content": "Invest in aquarium supplies. Slugs may benefit from certain aquarium supplies such as fake plants and leaves. You can also bring in real material from outside, such as twigs, for slugs to climb on. [1] X Research source If you bring anything in from outside, make sure to inspect it carefully before putting it in your slug's tank."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clean the aquarium regularly.",
      "content": "Clean the aquarium regularly. Once every three months, clean the slug's enclosure when you remove and replace the substrate. You can rinse things like twigs and aquarium supplies in distilled water and then let them air dry outside. If twigs get soggy or soft in response to water, replace them with new twigs. Slugs are very sensitive to chemicals. Only use distilled water when washing the slug's aquarium. You should refrain from washing anything with soap. Slugs are sensitive to tap water, so opt for distilled water."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep the room cool and humid.",
      "content": "Keep the room cool and humid. Slugs prefer temperatures between 60–70 °F (16–21 °C). Put a humidifier next to their aquarium to keep them hydrated. If the aquarium is too hot or cold, the slug will bury itself and produce more mucous. If it is not humid enough, the slug will dry out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Provide rinsed fruits and vegetables.",
      "content": "Provide rinsed fruits and vegetables. Slugs feed off of plants. You can give them leftover fruits and vegetables from your kitchen. You can also give them fresh fruits and vegetables, as long as you rinse them in distilled water first. It's important to remove pesticides before feeding plants to your slugs. [2] X Research source If possible, opt for organic fruits that do not make use of pesticides. In general, feed your slugs more vegetables than fruits. Slugs can die from consuming too much sugar, even natural sugar from fruits."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add plants and leaves for food.",
      "content": "Add plants and leaves for food. Slugs also feed off of plants they find outside. Add things like old leaves, grass, and other plants you find outside. Slugs feed on decaying plant matter, so if you have a plant that's dying you can feed it to your slug."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove uneaten food every day.",
      "content": "Remove uneaten food every day. Slugs may not eat everything you leave for them. Uneaten food, especially fruit, can attract fruit flies. Fruit flies can threaten a slug's health, so remove uneaten food at the end of each day. This will minimize exposure to bugs and keep your slugs safe."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a spray bottle, not a water dish.",
      "content": "Use a spray bottle, not a water dish. Slugs do not need a separate water dish, just a moist environment. You should, therefore, spray the enclosure with a water bottle each day. You should use distilled water, as tap water can be harmful to slugs. It's important to keep a slug's environment moist so they can absorb the water they need."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do not use certain sprays around your slug.",
      "content": "Do not use certain sprays around your slug. Slugs are very sensitive to chemicals and absorb sprays through their skin. Do not use hairspray or aerosol sprays in the same room where you keep your slugs. This can cause them to die."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid handling your slug.",
      "content": "Avoid handling your slug. Slugs should not be handled too often. Only handle them when you need to remove them from the tank for cleaning. If you must handle them, pick them up with wet hands. Slugs dislike being handled and chemicals on your hands from things like lotions and soaps can be harmful to slugs. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Spritz the aquarium with distilled water regularly.",
      "content": "Spritz the aquarium with distilled water regularly. Slugs need a moist environment to thrive. Each day, spritz the inside of your slug's cage with a water bottle filled with distilled after. Slugs may die if an environment is not adequately moist. [4] X Research source It's very important to use distilled water. The chemicals found in tap water can kill slugs."
