[1] X Trustworthy Source Internal Revenue Service U.S. government agency in charge of managing the Federal Tax Code Go to source Large charities like Goodwill and the Salvation Army are sure bets. If you’re donating to a smaller, local organization, call them to see if you’ll be qualified to get a tax deduction for your donation. If you’re not sure whether an organization is tax-exempt, search the charities and nonprofits database at the IRS website: https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/ . Realize, however, that some eligible organizations (such as churches) are not listed in the database. Simply giving used clothing directly to a needy person does not qualify."

It is not absolutely necessary to get this receipt for small donations, but it is helpful. If your donation was worth at least $250 but less than $500, you’ll need a written receipt that indicates the description of the donation.
