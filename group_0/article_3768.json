Most businesses start with one compelling idea — whether it's a service people need, a product that would make life easier, or something that combines both.The business world is full of great ideas (and many not-so-great ones). What will set yours apart is whether you can find a niche need to fill. [1] X Research source You don’t necessarily have to do something revolutionary or brand-new to be successful. You just have to be better at something than your competitors. [2] X Research source You will likely be more successful if you do something you know and love. Going into computer programming might make your business very marketable, but if your heart’s not in it you won’t have the energy to keep yourself going. [3] X Research source If you’re having trouble thinking of an idea, create a list of things about your target market, such as places they shop and things they purchase. Narrow the list down to about three items, keeping cost, manufacturing time, and popularity in mind. Find the easiest, most realistic product you can offer."

You can also get valuable demographic information from census data.

Your friends may try to be nice to you when you propose your idea, but critical feedback that points out weaknesses or problems will be much more useful, even if it isn’t always easy to hear."

Take stock of all your assets and figure out how much money (and time and energy) you actually have to invest. [7] X Research source In addition to considering your savings, credit, and other sources of capital, consider how long you can afford to go without making a profit. Small businesses are rarely profitable immediately; can you afford to not draw a salary for perhaps several months or even a few years?"

This type of pitch is called an elevator pitch because it should be concise and informative enough to let someone know who you are, what your business does, and why they should be interested -- all in the time it takes to ride an elevator. First, consider the problem or need that your venture addresses. This is often effectively stated as a question, which is why TV advertisements often begin with questions such as “Did you know that….” or “Are you tired of…” or “Have you ever had a problem doing…”. Second, consider how your product or service fixes the issue you’ve identified. This should be no more than 1 or 2 sentences, but should be as specific as possible without getting into jargon. Third, describe the main benefit of your product or service. This could be a description of how it achieves something for the customer, or how it outperforms your competition. Finally, consider what you need from investors to get your venture going. This part can be longer, because it needs to express your basic needs, your experience and credentials, and why your investors can trust you to succeed. Keep your elevator pitch short! Many experts suggest that it should not be longer than one minute. Remember: attention spans are short. Hook your audience quickly, or you may not hook them at all. [19] X Research source"

[21] X Research source Attending networking events such as local fairs hosted by your chamber of commerce is a great way to connect with other entrepreneurs in your area. These connections can provide you with support, ideas, and opportunities. Be generous to others. Don’t consider networking with other entrepreneurs only in terms of what they can give you. If you offer advice, ideas, and support to others, they will be more likely to want to help you as well. Nobody likes to feel exploited. Pay attention to others’ ideas.

It will also give people the opportunity to look you up and learn more about you. Look at the websites and branding of some successful companies. See what they have in common, what they do that’s interesting, and try to emulate that formula with your own brand. (Never steal or copy someone else’s intellectual property, though.)

Keep in mind that venture capitalists (often referred to in the business world as “VCs”) are focused on two things: how much money investing in your business will make them, and how soon that profit will happen. While hundreds of thousands of businesses are started every year, only about 500 a year get VCs as investors. [23] X Research source If you are providing a professional service, such as consulting, accounting, law, or medicine, consider forming a partnership with someone who is already established in that profession. Someone who is familiar with your field (and your knowledge of it) may be more likely to invest in your success.

The psychological phenomenon -loss aversion- describes why this feeling is irrational. Loss aversion makes us feel more depressed at the loss of $100 than happy at winning $100. For instance, it’s a typical mistake that stock investors make. After buying a stock, investors are likely to hold on to their stocks even though they may have lost a tremendous amount of money. People just hate to sell something at loss. They hold on to the stock although the most rational action would be to sell their loosing stocks and invest what's left of their money in a more promising stock. Cut your losses and reboot.

[25] X Research source Are you comfortable with a lot of responsibility? Entrepreneurs often have no backup and are responsible for the success or failure of their business. Do you enjoy interacting with people? Almost all entrepreneurs have to do a lot of customer service, particularly at first. If you aren’t good with people, you may have difficulty getting your business off the ground. Are you able to accept uncertainty and even failure? Even the most successful entrepreneurs -- for example, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Richard Branson -- have had businesses fail on them, often several times, before they found a formula that worked. [26] X Research source Do you thrive on problem-solving and creative solutions? Entrepreneurs at all levels face many problems that they need to find creative solutions for.
