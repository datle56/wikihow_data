Try giving them a call or sending a text asking how they've been. If there's anything wrong, this will give them a chance to tell you. And even if they don't have much to say at first, it will open the door for more questions, says Dicken. [1] X Expert Source Lena Dicken, Psy.D Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 December 2020. You could also say something like, \"Hey I haven't heard from you in a while. Is everything okay?\" “I just wanted to check in and make sure things are okay.” “How are you doing?”"

      "content": "Let them know you can tell their energy is different. Asking this will show the other person that you care about how they feel, and that you can tell something's a little off. However, it doesn't put any pressure on them to reassure you, because you're not outright asking if they're mad at you—you're asking if anything is bothering them in general. [2] X Research source Another way to ask this might be, \"Am I right that something is bothering you? Do you want to talk about it?\" Dicken also suggests, “How are you doing emotionally?” [3] X Expert Source Lena Dicken, Psy.D Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 December 2020."

      "content": "Try this if you really feel like their emotions are directed at you. Sometimes it's a little more obvious when someone is upset with you—they might give you dirty looks, answer you with short, terse responses, or get really quiet when you're around. If that's the vibe you're feeling, go ahead and ask what's going on. [4] X Research source If the person's mood seems to shift suddenly during a conversation, try asking something like, \"Did I say something to offend you? If so, I want to make it right.\" When you ask something like this in a straightforward way, be prepared for a straightforward answer. They might be holding in some things that you aren't expecting, so just sit back and let them speak their mind."

      "content": "Be curious if you're not sure what's behind their feelings. If the person does say that you did something that bothered them, but you're still not sure exactly why they're upset, don't be afraid to dig a little more. It's really important to understand exactly what happened if you want to avoid conflict with that person in the future. Dicken says to also try, “Are you open to talking about how you're doing?” [5] X Expert Source Lena Dicken, Psy.D Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 December 2020. Try to keep your tone calm and even when you ask this—if you come across like you're judging or mocking the person for their feelings, it will just make things worse. When they're talking, just listen quietly without getting defensive. Don't interrupt them to share your own thoughts—although it's fine to say things like, \"I understand\" or \"That makes sense\" from time to time. [6] X Research source"

Just make sure that when you do this, you do it in a really kind voice—don't belittle their opinions, or the argument will just get worse. For instance, you might say, \"It sounds like you're saying that it was insensitive of me to brush off your suggestion about how to paint the living room, and you feel like I don't appreciate your opinions. Is that right?\" Or, “I want to be sure I understand, so I can change my behavior in the future. Does this sound right?”"

In some cases, you might feel like if the other person understood where you were coming from, they might not feel upset anymore. Just be careful with this—it will seem insensitive if you come across like you're just trying to prove your point and make yourself seem right. Miller says asking if they want perspective is key before actually giving it. [8] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. Keep in mind that in a disagreement, it's more important how something came across, rather than the intention that was behind it. Sometimes, it's better to just apologize rather than trying to explain yourself. You might also say, “I didn’t mean any harm, but I know it hurt you. Can I tell you what I was trying to do, even if it didn’t work? I don’t want you to think I’m attacking you.”"

      "title": "Be willing to back off if they need some time.",
      "content": "Be willing to back off if they need some time. When someone is upset, they sometimes need time to process how they're feeling before they can begin to move past it. If the person says they're not ready to talk, give them a little time before you reach out to them again. [9] X Research source Dicken also recommends, “Would it be helpful to talk now, or do you need time?” [10] X Expert Source Lena Dicken, Psy.D Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 December 2020. This will be different for everyone. If you live together, you might leave for a few hours, then come home and try to talk again. If you're not super-close, you might wait as long as a couple of weeks. It really depends on the situation, how close you are, and what happened that made the person upset."

For instance, they might say something like, \"Please don't put me down in a work meeting again,\" or \"I'd rather you not make comments about my appearance.\" In that case, do your best to stick to their request so you can hopefully avoid repeating the situation in the future. [11] X Research source Or say, “I want to fix this, but I don’t want to make it worse. What can I do for you?” Don't agree to anything you can't stick to. For instance, if the person says something like, \"I want you to quit your job so I don't have to see your face anymore,\" that's a pretty unreasonable request, and it's fine to say no."

If you can see the other person's point of view, sincerely tell them you're sorry. Acknowledge your part in what happened, and ask them if they're willing to forgive you and move on. [12] X Research source Or say, “That was my fault, and I take full responsibility. I hope you can forgive me, but I understand if there’s still work to do to earn that.” If the person was offended by something you consider an important value, apologizing may not be appropriate—sometimes you do have to stand your ground. For instance, if they're angry at you because you spoke out in support of trans rights or equality for minorities, it's totally okay if you decide you're just better off ending the relationship.

Letting them know that you’re always open to hearing their feedback, and that you want to keep making sure you improve and care about their feelings, tells them that you’re open to making a change, even if you’re not sure of what you did wrong. Or, say, “Hey, I just want you to know that you can always tell me if I've done something wrong,” or, “I’d hate to hurt you somehow. Please tell me if I ever do anything out of line.”"
