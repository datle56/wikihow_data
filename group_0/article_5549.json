[6] X Research source Fixed per-minute rates do apply, so check how these compare to rates you can get through your landline or cell. If you plan to call Dubai often, you can sign up for one of the monthly subscriptions on Skype that allow you between 60 and 800 minutes of talk time to phones and landlines in the UAE.

If you are unsure, you can always check the current time in Dubai at https://time.is/Dubai .

You will have to register an account and provide a payment method. You then dial their access number, followed by the number you would like to reach in Dubai.
