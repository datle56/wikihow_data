      "title": "Battery Saver Active means your car’s battery-saver mode is on.",
      "content": "Battery Saver Active means your car’s battery-saver mode is on. When there’s an issue with the battery or alternator, your vehicle’s computer saves power by turning off non-essential electrical systems like the air conditioner, radio, and lights. [1] X Research source The purpose of the battery saver mode is to keep the car running for as long as possible, so you won’t be stranded and can get the car to a repair shop. When you see this error message, the battery is powering the car on whatever charge it has left."

      "title": "Battery issues can cause the Battery Saver Active error to appear.",
      "content": "Battery issues can cause the Battery Saver Active error to appear. A bad battery, dirty or corroded terminals, or issues with the battery cables or sensors can trigger this error message."

      "title": "Problems with the alternator can also trip the Battery Saver Active error.",
      "content": "Problems with the alternator can also trip the Battery Saver Active error. The alternator provides the car’s power while running and replaces whatever electricity the battery expended starting the engine. [2] X Research source When the alternator isn’t doing its job as well as it should or at all, the battery starts supplying power to the car."

      "title": "Inspect the battery terminals for signs of corrosion.",
      "content": "Inspect the battery terminals for signs of corrosion. Corrosion is a natural occurrence as your battery ages, but it can also be a sign the battery isn’t charging properly. Look for a crust of white, blue, or green powdery residue on your battery terminals. [3] X Research source If you see corrosion, disconnect your car’s battery and clean the corroded battery terminals with baking soda. Always wear gloves and safety glasses when cleaning off the terminals. Battery corrosion is caustic and can damage your skin and eyes. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Check the battery cables and connectors.",
      "content": "Check the battery cables and connectors. The bolts that secure your battery cable connectors can loosen over time. A loose connector or bad cable can break the connection and prevent the battery charging system from working correctly. With the car off, check for damage or corrosion on the cables and that the connectors are secured to the battery terminals. If loose or disconnected, reconnect the battery and tighten the nut on each connector with a wrench. Replace damaged or corroded battery cables yourself or take your vehicle to a mechanic. It usually costs between $326 and $352 for parts and labor for battery cable replacement, but prices may vary depending on your car and location. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Test the battery with a voltmeter tool.",
      "content": "Test the battery with a voltmeter tool. If there’s no corrosion and the battery isn’t damaged, test it yourself with a voltage meter . Testing your battery with a voltmeter is as easy as hooking it up to your battery terminals with the car off, so you can do it anywhere. If you don’t have a voltmeter, remove the battery and take it to an automotive store for testing. They will usually test your battery for free. A battery in good condition has a charge between 12.4 and 12.7 volts. [6] X Research source If it’s below 12.4 volts, charge the battery with a car battery charger or ask a friend to jumpstart your car."

A new car battery costs anywhere from $100 to $200, depending on the warranty, performance, and battery type.

The alternator is working if you get a reading above 13.2 volts with the car running. A reading below 13.2 volts means there’s an issue with the alternator or alternator belt. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Check that your alternator belt is turning your alternator.",
      "content": "Check that your alternator belt is turning your alternator. Inspect the alternator belt while the car is running to check that it’s on the pulley and turning the alternator. You may be able to fix a belt that has simply slipped off the pulley by turning off the car and fitting the belt around the pulley again. Replace the alternator belt if it’s still on the pulley but looks worn or stretched out. [11] X Research source Remove your alternator and take it to a mechanic for further testing if the belt is turning the alternator and doesn’t show signs of wear. Alternators are relatively easy to remove, even if you have little experience performing car repairs. [12] X Research source Have your car towed to a mechanic or auto parts store for testing if you’re uncomfortable removing the alternator. They’ll often test it for free."

      "title": "Repair or replace a faulty alternator.",
      "content": "Repair or replace a faulty alternator. Alternators fail due to regular wear and tear, fluid leaks, worn bearings, a slipping belt, and incorrect jumper cable usage. They can be repaired, but often, you must replace them to prevent future breakdowns. Replacing an alternator averages between $747 and $842, but the final cost depends on your location and the make and model of your car. [13] X Research source Repairs generally cost less than replacements, but they can vary drastically depending on the reason for the alternator’s failure."

      "title": "Replace the battery current sensor.",
      "content": "Replace the battery current sensor. If the battery and alternator are both functioning, the problem may be with the battery current sensor. The battery sensor is attached to the negative terminal or cable on your car’s battery and measures the current. If it fails, your car’s computer thinks there’s a problem with the system. [14] X Research source Replacing this sensor usually costs between $85 and $320 for parts and labor at a repair shop. [15] X Research source In some vehicles, the battery current sensor is attached to the battery cable, meaning mechanics must replace the entire cable when there’s an issue with the sensor."

      "content": "Reset the error with an OBD-II tool or take your car to a mechanic. After troubleshooting the most common causes for the Battery Saver Active error, check the on-board diagnostic codes with an OBD-II scan tool if you still haven’t found the problem. The tool shows you the codes for which part of the car malfunctioned. Use an OBD-II tool to reset the Battery Saver Active error. However, the message will return if you haven’t resolved the underlying issue. Take your car to a mechanic if you are unfamiliar with using an OBD-II tool or understanding the codes. They can also read OBD-II codes to diagnose battery charging system malfunctions. Running a full diagnostic can cost roughly $40 to several hundred dollars, depending on how in-depth it needs to be to find the problem."

Unfortunately, that might not be for very long. [16] X Research source If the alternator is not powering the system or charging the battery, you’ll run out of power quickly. There’s no way to know exactly how long your car will run in battery-saver mode. It depends on how much charge is in the battery and how much, if any, power the alternator is supplying. When you see the Battery Saver Active message, it’s best to get off the road as soon as possible."
