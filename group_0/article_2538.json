      "content": "Work on developing your self esteem. Gay men, in particular, may have had years of self doubt and questioning due to living with homophobia in all its forms. This takes time and effort to shake off! Take the time to identify what you think is beautiful about yourself, and nurture that beauty instead of doubting it. You should also believe other people when they tell you you are beautiful. They are telling you the truth as they see it!"

      "content": "Fight internalized homophobia. It can be hard to find stereotypically \"gay\" aspects of your composure or personality beautiful. This is because straight society has defined these things as undesirable. Instead of falling prey to these ideas, embrace your \"gay voice\" or mannerisms that are stereotypically associated with gay men."

      "content": "Focus on developing your passions and skills. Attractiveness may have less to do with physical traits than other character traits, such as a sense of humor or a sharp intellect. Become really good at something. Do projects or hobbies you love to do. Develop a career that is fulfilling. Having passions, skills, and pursuits makes you a more interesting, and attractive, person."

      "content": "Don't compare yourself to others. It can be easy to see someone and think, \"I wish I could look that good.\" This can be especially hard in the gay community, where looks and traditional attractiveness tends to take center stage. However, this accomplishes nothing. Instead of comparing yourself to others, embrace your own looks. Learn to recognize your own beauty, and let the good aspects of your looks and style make you feel more confident. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Find a gay community that embraces your beauty. There is no one way to be a beautiful and attractive gay man. Some gay men find skinny, hairless men beautiful. Other gay men prefer hairy, large men. In other words, if you want to feel beautiful you don't necessarily need to change yourself. Instead, you can surround yourself with people who like you as you are! It is undeniable that it feels good when someone else thinks you are beautiful. If you are around people that fill you with self doubt and self hatred, those people are toxic. Find other people that can see the beauty that already exists in you."

Proper dental care will help prevent bad breath and keep your teeth bright and healthy. Use an 18 inch-long piece of dental floss to get between your teeth, starting with the top row and working your way to the bottom. Form a C-shape around each tooth to ensure you get all sides (including the backs of teeth). [5] X Research source Use an antiseptic mouthwash to help kill bacteria in your mouth. Swish with mouthwash for roughly 30 to 60 seconds, then spit. Apply a pea-sized glob of fluoride toothpaste onto your toothbrush and work it across your teeth in a circular motion.

Whenever you shower, it's important to take care of yourself for a cleaner, more confident body. [7] X Research source Try to keep to a lukewarm temperature. Temperature extremes can dry out your skin. Lather the shampoo of your choice and rub it into your scalp. You should also wash your beard (if you have facial hair) with shampoo to keep it clean and odor-free. Rinse out all the shampoo from your hair. If using conditioner, apply it similarly to your scalp and wash it all out. Use soap or body wash to clean everything from your neck down. Lather, apply, and rinse thoroughly. Wash your genital area and posterior, moving from front to back. Make sure you've rinsed away any residual soap before exiting the shower/bath."

If you're interested in a personal fragrance (like cologne or body spray), find one that works for you and try it out in small doses.

[15] X Research source If you decide to thin out or trim your chest hair, use an electric clipper and move in the direction your hair grows.

[17] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Use broad-spectrum sunscreen. Make sure it has an SPF of 15 or higher, and reapply it at least every two hours. Try to avoid being in direct sunlight between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM, when U.V. rays are the strongest.

Keeping on top of the latest fashion trends can be very expensive and could deprive you of a more permanent wardrobe. Instead of worrying about what's hot at the moment, choose classics that never go out of style. If you like button-downs or polo shirts wear them, as they are always fashionable.

Try to stand up, stretch, and open up your chest for a few minutes every half hour or so. You should also try to walk around and move your body a little as often as possible.

However, changing up your style could help get you out of a rut and feel more confident and attractive. If you've never grown a beard, try growing one. Many men find that wearing a beard lends a sense of confidence and makes men look more attractive. Try the opposite. If you've had a beard for many years, shave off your facial hair and see what your bare face looks like after all this time. You might find that you feel more attractive and younger with a simple shave. Pick up one or two articles of clothing that go against your usual style. Try wearing these when you need a confidence booster."
