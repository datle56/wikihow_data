[1] X Research source It is the only way to run .exe files without a copy of Windows. [2] X Research source Since .exe files are native to Windows operating systems, to run them, you must have a compatibility layer (like Wine) or copy of Windows via a Windows emulator (which means you'll no longer solely be using Linux). While you can run many EXE files on Linux with Wine, some may not work as expected, or not at all. If you want to make a Linux file executable rather than running a Windows EXE file on Linux, jump down to How to Execute a Linux File ."

[8] X Research source Popular virtual machines include: VirtualBox , VMware, and Linux’s built-in KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine).

Linux doesn’t use file extensions to indicate which files are executable. [12] X Research source Instead, it uses permissions (the basic permissions are read r, write w, and execute x). Permissions determine which files are executable. As a result, Linux files can have different extensions (ex. .sh ) or no file extensions and still be executable."
