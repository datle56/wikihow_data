The interaction between planets and the houses they are in is a key part of astrology. We’ll briefly go over the houses here: [10] X Research source The 1st House , or The House of Self, addresses our personality, approach to life, and what makes us unique. It also is the house of our early childhood. The 2nd House , or The House of Possessions, is about what we own, especially our material wealth.

This house leverages communication and quick-thinking in order to take on challenges in life. The 4th House , or The House of Home, is the domain of our family, ancestors, and domestic life. Our traditions, family members, and history are all located within this house. The 5th House , or The House of Pleasure, speaks to procreation and children, but also the creation of art and culture.

[12] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 March 2022. There are some additional factors that can be important here, such as thinking about what signs the planets are in, the location of the planets within their houses, and if you’re working with Western or Eastern astrology. But you can still draw some conclusions even without these factors, so take a look at some of the following examples: If you have Jupiter, the planet of fortune, in the 10th house, or the House of Status, it’s generally a good sign of having a prosperous career. If you have the Moon, the “planet” of emotions, in the first house, or the House of Self, you’re generally a person who is quite sensitive, and perhaps empathetic. If you have Mars, the planet of ambition, in the 7th house, or the House of Partnership, you’re likely a very sexual, intense, and perhaps argumentative partner. If you have Mercury, the planet of communication, in the 3rd house, or the House of Communication, you’re exceptionally adept with words, and likely find it extremely easy to communicate with others. If you have Saturn, the planet of karma, in the 2nd house, or the House of Possessions, you likely feel a lot of anxiety over having enough wealth. You may have experienced financial difficulties, and spent a lot of time working through them."
