      "content": "Choose crayons in your desired color. Beeswax candles can easily be dyed with crayons. Any type of crayon you can find at a supermarket, department store, or craft store should be fine. The color of the crayon will be the color of your wax, so choose the colors you want. [1] X Research source You can also add two different types of crayons to your wax to create your own colors. If you want a very soft pink, for example, use both a white and pink crayon."

      "title": "Make molded or dipped candles.",
      "content": "Make molded or dipped candles. You can make either dipped or molded candles with your beeswax. Molded candles tend to be shorter and take more time than dipped candles, which are longer and skinnier. [4] X Research source To make molded candles, simply pour your melted beeswax into a mold in your chosen shape. Add a wick to the tip of the candle and set the mold aside until the beeswax hardens. To make dip candles, tie a fishing weight to the end of a candle wick. Dip the weight into the melted beeswax. Give the wick a few moments cool before dipping it again. Repeat this process until your candles are as thick as you want them."

A variety of herbs are commonly used in wax dyes that produce a range of colors. [5] X Research source Sunflower seeds give off a purple hue. If you want something more blueish, go with elder. Dandelions tend to give off a red color. You can also mix and match herbs of different colors to produce a shade you want. Experiment a little to find the right shade."
