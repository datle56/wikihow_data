When you think of romantic gifts, you might be thinking about a dozen roses. However, sometimes simplicity is much better and thoughtful. Listen to your partner and learn what they like. Then, use that information to get them a small gift once in a while. This small token shows that you listen to your partner and pay attention to their needs. You might know that your partner loves a particular drink from a coffee stop in town. Stop by on your way home from work and pick it up to surprise them with when you walk in. For something more permanent, try getting a photo of the two of you framed and give it to your partner. Save these little gifts for random times. Give bigger gifts for their birthday or Christmas."

But you could prepare their morning tea for them before they leave for work, making their routine easier."

      "content": "While time together is important to romance, time apart is important as well. Smothering your partner with love constantly can have the opposite effect and they could get sick of all the attention. Back off once in a while and let them have their space. If they’re in the middle of an activity they like, don’t disturb them. If they want to go out with their friends one night, don’t get mad about it. Spending time apart is key to making your relationship work. Some couples like to schedule one night a week where they spend time alone. Others prefer to be more spontaneous with their alone time. Pick the option that works best for you and your partner. If you two take nights to be with friends or by yourselves, tell each other about it afterward. You can bond over talking about what you each did. Always listen to your partner if they say they need some space. Responding negatively could drive them further away."

People love feeling appreciated, and knowing that you notice the things your partner does for you will bring them closer to you. Don’t hesitate to thank your partner whenever they do something for you. [6] X Research source Even thanking your partner for mundane tasks like taking out the garbage works to show appreciation. Always make your appreciation genuine, without any sarcasm or sounding like a backhanded compliment. Don’t say something like, “I’m glad you finally remembered to do the dishes after dinner tonight.” This sounds sarcastic. Simply say, “Thank you for doing the dishes.”"
