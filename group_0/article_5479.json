This line will cut the base of the triangle in half (and thus is the apothem of the hexagon). Label the length of the base of one of the right triangles. For example, if the base of the equilateral triangle is 8 cm, when you divide the triangle into two right triangles, each right triangle now has a base of 4 cm."

The side length of a regular hexagon is equal to the radius of the hexagon. The radius is a line that connects the central point of a polygon with one of its vertices. [4] X Research source You’ll note that the hypotenuse of your right triangle is also a radius of the hexagon, thus, the side length of the hexagon is equal to the length of the hypotenuse. For example, if the side length of the hexagon is 8 cm, then the length of the right triangle’s hypotenuse is also 8 cm.
