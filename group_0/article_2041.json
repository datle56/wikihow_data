      "content": "A Capricorn guy isn't afraid of how confident you are. This sign does not need to be the one chasing you. In fact, he’ll probably love to see that you take matters into your own hands. So, if you’re crushing on a dreamy Capricorn boy, don’t be afraid to let him know. [1] X Research source Invite him for a walk, dinner, or movie if you feel inspired. If you think he’s looking great at a party, tell him so. You can even come right out and say it: “Hey, I wanted to let you know that I’m into you. What do you think about that?”"

      "content": "Capricorn guys want compliments–but only ones they can really trust. This sign hates to feel like the people around them are being fake, and they take themselves really seriously. If your compliment feels silly or over the top to him, he might not trust you. On the other hand, there’s nothing in the world a Capricorn craves more than an honest compliment. Play it safe by praising his skills, talents, or accomplishments, and he'll be totally into it. [2] X Research source “Wow, you’re great at commanding a room. How’d you become such a great public speaker?” “You’ve got serious talent as a goalie. I can’t believe you stopped that last one.” “You got an A in AP European History? I thought those were just a myth.”"

These guys have got an amazing, dry sense of humor, but sometimes people have a hard time giving it back to them. [3] X Research source If you can find a way to meet his deadpan jokes with even funnier, more deadpan jokes, he’ll be completely hooked. [4] X Research source Try out some sarcasm . If he asks if you're in a bad mood, you could say, \"No I actually love when I forget to bring in my homework. Really adds some excitement to my day!\" If he asks you what you like to do, try a deadpan, silly response: \"My main hobbies are watching TikToks and obsessing over how much time I waste on TikTok.\""

      "content": "No matter what, Capricorn boys want elegance and class. If you’re trying to hit on a Capricorn crush (go you!), you should definitely make sure you keep things PG and polite. Some people flirt by making fun of their crush, making themselves the center of attention to gain their crush's notice, or by getting super physical. With a Capricorn, these would all be a bit too much for him. Instead, you want to go for casual, refined flirting, like simply giving him your undivided attention during long conversation and holding deep eye contact while we speaks. [5] X Research source Try some simple touches throughout the night. For instance, touch his hand gently to direct his attention towards something across the room."

All of those little achievements he’d normally breeze right past, you can help him feel proud of."

[9] X Research source If he’s spending hours responsibly planning his schedule, let him know that you think it’s great he’s so organized. If he’s talking at length about his work or school life, express that you love how ambitious he is. If he’s texting the group chat, reminding friends to bring sunscreen and be on time before a trip, thank him later for it."
