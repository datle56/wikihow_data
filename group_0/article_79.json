      "content": "2828 is a reminder to stay on your spiritual path. Life is full of distractions—perhaps more than usual lately! While it’s fine to take a detour now and again, be sure not to stray too far from the path you’re on: it’s the one that will lead you to your divine purpose. Practice good judgment and cultivate a strong inner voice to let you know when you’ve strayed too far…or when straying from the path you thought you were on is part of the divine plan! You can strengthen your inner voice by simply practicing listening to it: in moments of stress, or when you have to make a decision, do you rely on fear and desperation? Or do you go with your gut? Whatever choice makes you feel more grounded and true to yourself is usually your inner wisdom!"

If you think “yes,” now is the time to commit yourself to them, whether that means moving in or marriage or simply becoming exclusive. If you’re not sure, “taking the next step” may not involve any big gestures or overhauls; it might just mean slowing down. Consider the reasons you’re with your partner: is it convenient? Or do they make your life better? If you know they’re not the one, your angels celebrate your honesty—and ask you to do something about it. It’s painful to end a relationship , but you can stay with the wrong person out of fear."
