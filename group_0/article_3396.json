Communities are made up of a variety of people who share the same interests and often share ideas and thoughts to one another. Some people in the community make online content and become famous off that content. Doing research on other content creators or famous people will give you an understanding of the competition as well as the potential fanbase that you’ll have. Also, within communities are sub-communities or niche communities that concentrate on more concentrated subject matter. Search for other content creator's social media profiles or any video or written content that they create. Places where you can find online communities include the PlayStation Community, Being Girl, Figment, Harley Owners Group, and Lugnet.

Use your logo or profile picture and make them the same to create brand recognition for yourself. You also need to stay consistent on what you say and the type of person you are. If you say something but do the opposite, regularly break your word, or act hypocritical, the internet may turn on you and fans may leave you. [5] X Research source If you have a logo or profile picture that you use regularly, make sure that the brand is represented across the different social media platforms. Think of your brand like a company. If a company has different logos and store layouts, it may become confusing to consumers. The same can be said about your fans. Regardless if you are angry, mean, happy, or silly, fans will be confused if your personality changes overnight or you do things that don’t seem consistent."

When trying to decide on which platforms to create, consider the age of your target audience as well as what platforms they are most likely to use. Cross promote on your different platforms and always give people an easy way to follow you somewhere else. If you are trying to appeal to a younger audience, platforms like YouTube and TikTok are the best. If you are trying to appeal to an older audience, platforms like Facebook, Twitter (X), Pinterest and LinkedIn are ideal.

Lastly, a personal blog can also serve as another revenue stream if you decide to advertise or use affiliate links or promotions that lead to purchases for different product manufacturers. Make sure to create a responsive website that works on phones and different browsers. If you specialize in video, you can create vlogs instead of writing in a blog. Popular blog and website creation sites include WordPress.org, WordPress.com, Squarespace, and Wix. WordPress.org requires more technical knowledge to set up and shouldn't be undertaken by someone with no knowledge of programming languages like PHP and CSS."

Find a niche like a smaller social group, game, or topic that doesn’t have a lot of big stars. Luckily, because the internet has a ton of different groups and communities, there are a lot of choices that you can pursue. [8] X Research source For instance, reviewers that review popular movies on YouTube is an oversaturated area and you’re likely to find a lot of competition in the space. In addition to finding a niche for what you do, you can find a niche for who you are. Famous internet stars often represent an underrepresented group of people in society."

Make sure that you engage with your fans and only share quality content that you find online. If you post regularly you'll show up on some fan's feeds. Try to stay consistent with your content schedule as well. If fans are used to getting content every two days and then you take a week hiatus, some of your growth may be stifled."

If you see a huge dip in followers or a particular video or article gets negative attention, you know that it’s not good to continue doing the same things for your career. When you see a random drop in viewers or positive comments, take your time to re-evaluate what you are doing and internalize the criticism that others are giving you. Alter your image and routine to maximize your fan count. If you come out with a really controversial video or article, create another video to elaborate what you meant or to apologize for your actions."
