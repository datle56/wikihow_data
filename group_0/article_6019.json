For example, if your child has dry hair, you should look for a moisturizing shampoo. There are many children's shampoos on the market, and finding the best shampoo will require trial and error. [10] X Expert Source Danielle Chiz Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 3 August 2021. If your child has a scalp condition such as psoriasis, dermatitis, or dandruff, consult a dermatologist about the best shampoo. If your child has fine or thin hair, try a lightweight shampoo that will not weigh their hair down."

      "content": "Decide if conditioner is necessary. African-American, curly hair, and dry hair should be conditioned after the shampooing process. Conditioner adds shine, softens hair, and smooths the cuticle. The conditioning needs of your child's hair may change due to the climate. Hair may need conditioner during colder months or in drier climates."

      "title": "Choose the type of conditioner based on your child's hair needs.",
      "content": "Choose the type of conditioner based on your child's hair needs. Three types of conditioners include leave-in conditioner, deep conditioners, and instant conditioners. The type of conditioner you choose is based on the child's hair. For example, if your child has extremely dry hair, a deep conditioner would be best. Always follow the directions on the conditioner bottle. [15] X Expert Source Danielle Chiz Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 3 August 2021. Leave-in conditioners are kept in and are not rinsed out of the hair. They can make the detangling process easier. A leave-in conditioner may weigh fine or thin hair down. Instant conditioners coat the hair and create softness and shine. They do not have to be left in the hair for very long before they are rinsed out. Deep conditioners usually stay in the hair for about 15 minutes before rinsing. Depending on the condition of your child's hair, they can be used after every shampoo or once a month. A hot oil treatment can also be used once or twice a month to condition hair as well. Heat up some oil (e.g. olive oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil) and then massage the warm oil into the scalp and hair. Cover the hair with a shower cap or a warm towel and let the oil sit for 20 minutes. Rinse out the oil when finished."

Put hair into sections and then apply a palm sized amount of conditioner to each section. Focus conditioner application on the ends of the hair. Thicker and curlier hair should be divided into smaller sections to better distribute the conditioner. Work the conditioner through the hair using a wide toothed comb or your hands. Conditioner does not need to be applied to your child's scalp. Thicker and highly textured hair may need more conditioner than fine and thin hair. Adjust the amount of conditioner you use based on the child's hair type."

Completely cover the gum with peanut butter or oil using you fingers or a toothbrush and let the product sit for a few minutes. Then remove the gum from the hair and wash the child's hair. Vegetable oil works best if the gum is in the child's eyelashes or eyebrows as well."

      "content": "Be prepared for surprise haircuts. It is not uncommon for a child to cut their own hair or have their hair cut by another child at school. If this happens, you can take the child to a professional stylist to fix the hair. If the damage is not that bad, have the child try accessories such as hats, headbands, barrettes, bobby pins, or styles that can camouflage the damage. Talk to your child about the appropriated ways to use scissors (e.g. for arts and crafts). If your child is interested in styling hair, allow them to cut the hair of a doll or mannequin instead. If another child cuts your child's hair, address the matter with the teacher and the other child's parent so this does not happen again. Remind your child that other children should not touch or play with their hair. Remember that hair grows back."

You also may try hairstyles that allow the cowlick to remain in its preferred direction. [16] X Research source Cowlicks are less visible on long hair, super short hair and textured hair. Growing out the hair or having a very short hair style may hide the cowlick. Cowlicks should be brushed down while the hair is still wet."

      "content": "Detangle the hair. Always detangle hair before styling. Divide hair into sections and secure the sections with a clip or ponytail holder. Apply a leave-in conditioner or a detangler to the section, and then begin to comb the section. Start at the ends of the hair and work your way up. Be gentle as not to hurt the child or damage the hair. [17] X Expert Source Danielle Chiz Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 3 August 2021. Entertaining the child with a movie or book can help the detangling process go more smoothly. Make sure both you and the child are in a comfortable position before you get started. A wide tooth comb is a good tool to use for detangling. Once a section is detangled, either braid it or twist it so it does not become tangled again. Be extra gentle with kinky and curly hair. This hair type should be divided into smaller sections for the detangling process. You can also use your fingers to help detangle the hair. If you plan on applying heat to the child's hair later, apply a heat protectant to the hair as you are detangling."

      "title": "Avoid hairstyles that cause tension.",
      "content": "Avoid hairstyles that cause tension. Braids that are too tight, ponytails, and barrettes can cause children's hair to fall out. If the child mentions that they are in pain, loosen the braid or the ponytail. Hairstyles should never be painful. For African-American children, pay special attention to the hairline. Styles such as braids and cornrows should be done gently. Avoid excessive pulling and tension which could cause thinning of the hairline. Small bumps around the hairline can also indicate that a style is too tight."

      "content": "Use heat sparingly. Heat can be used to dry hair more quickly or to straighten kinky and curly hair. A heat protectant should always be used before applying heat. Heat puts stress on the hair and can lead to dryness. [18] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Hair should be separated into sections before blow-drying. Start at the ends first and work your way up. Thicker and highly textured hair should be blow dried in smaller sections. Blow-dryers with a comb nozzle attachment are recommended for African-American hair. If you are using a ceramic comb or iron to straighten hair, put it on the lowest temperature setting possible. Thick or coarse hair may need more heat or be divided into smaller sections before straightening. African-American hair should not be straightened more than once a week."

      "title": "Avoid harsh chemicals.",
      "content": "Avoid harsh chemicals. African-American children should not chemically relax their hair to straighten it. These chemicals can negatively affect their scalp. The tighter curl pattern of African-American hair makes it more susceptible to chemical damage. Blow-drying or ceramic combs are safer alternatives for straightening hair. If you choose to relax the hair, wait until the child is at least 12 years old and have the relaxer done by a professional stylist. Permanent and semi-permanent hair color should not be used by children under 16 years of age. [19] X Research source Use styling products such as mousse, gels, and pomades that are specially formulated for children."
