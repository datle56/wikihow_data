      "title": "Align yourself with the ball.",
      "content": "Align yourself with the ball. You'll need to move your body so that you are in catching distance of the ball, but you should also try to line up your eyes with the ball so you can clearly see it incoming. Keep your eyes focused on the ball, and: Adopt a wide stance to keep your balance when catching. It can help to keep one of your feet a little in front of the other."

      "title": "Meet the ball with your hands.",
      "content": "Meet the ball with your hands. As the ball moves through the air toward you, you're going to need to reach out with your hands to grab it mid-flight. Do not tense your hands; this can lead to pain from the impact. Instead: Keep your hands wide-spread. Keep your fingers relaxed. Reach toward the ball."
    },
    {
      "title": "Grasp the ball.",
      "content": "Grasp the ball. Depending on the speed at which the ball was thrown and the amount of spin on it, you might use either or both of your hands. For lobs and light throws, simply follow the ball with your eyes while reaching with your hands, and: Watch the ball move into your reaching hands. Squeeze your fingers around the ball to trap it in your hand. NOTE: catching with two hands may be easier while you learn how to better coordinate your catching."

      "title": "Cushion the impact of the ball.",
      "content": "Cushion the impact of the ball. This is especially important for cannon-throws or balls thrown at high speeds, which can hurt your hand. As you trap the ball with your fingers, allow your hand to follow the motion of the ball and ease it to a stop, as opposed to catching and stopping it immediately where it meets your hand. Keep your knees bent and your stance wide to improve balance when catching. Bend your arms at the elbows to help reduce the force of the ball's impact."

      "content": "Stand so that you're ready to throw. How you stand when throwing a ball can dramatically affect the outcome of your throw. When trying to throw a normal sized ball, you can achieve best results by standing so that: Your feet are shoulder width apart. You stand sideways to your target. Your throwing arm is the farthest away from the target. You are turned at the waist and facing your target. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Practice your wrist motion.",
      "content": "Practice your wrist motion. The motion of your throw should flow smoothly from start to finish. To prevent yourself from making the error of locking up your wrist, practice using it as part of your throw by holding the ball in your hand and then: [4] X Research source Bend only your wrist backward. Snap your wrist forward. Allow your elbow straighten out. Release the ball as you straighten your arm. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Add a windup to your throw. A windup is simply where you reach farther back when throwing a ball while stepping through with your leading foot to add more power and distance. Get in throwing stance, and then hold the ball in your hand straight up while keeping your elbow and shoulder at about the same height. From that position: Reach slightly backwards while keeping the ball facing your target. Raise your leading foot slightly at the backmost part of your reach. Shift your weight forward to your front foot. Follow through with your arm and wrist. Release the ball at the frontmost part of your throw, as your wrist is snapping forward. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Meet the ball with your hands as soon as possible. A goalkeeper's greatest advantage in soccer is his ability to touch, catch, and punch the ball. By making sure your hands get to the ball as soon as possible, you improve your chances of catching or punching the ball away. A foot block might be necessary sometimes, but this is often a less controlled. A goalie should use his advantage (his hands) to his benefit whenever possible. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Absorb the force of shots on net through proper form. Professional soccer players and coaches call this having \"soft hands.\" This means that a goalie must be able to engage his arms, legs, and back muscles to cushion balls shot on net. By absorbing the force of the ball, you stand a better chance of holding onto it. You should: Keep elbows at least slightly bent, even when reaching for the ball. Be ready to bend back at the waist for high kicks at fast speeds. Always move forward toward the ball, to cut down on the shooting angles of the striker. [8] X Research source"

It gets its name from the W shape a goalkeeper's hands should take when catching, with thumbs meeting behind the center of the ball and the hands slightly off to the side. [9] X Research source Goalkeepers who have smaller hands should bring their wrists close together and their thumbs almost parallel to protect the ball from slipping through their hands."

You never know when a ball is going to sail through the air at the net, so anticipate the ball by bending your knees, keeping your eyes attentive, and holding your hands open and ready. When you jump to catch an high shot on the net, you should: Jump to meet the ball at the highest point possible. Raise your knee closest to pressuring attackers, being careful not to injure any oncoming players. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Catch ground balls with proper body blockage. Ground balls can give the illusion of a simple catch, which can open you up to letting a ball through your legs. Experts agree, you can prevent letting a ball past you by getting your body behind the ball. This way, if there is, for example, a lot of spin that tears the ball loose from your grasp, it will hit your body and either be stopped or ricochet away from the net."

While playing a game of soccer, players are expected to follow strict rules regarding body position and throwing technique when throwing in a ball kicked out of bounds. Most serious soccer leagues use FIFA throw-in rules, which state: The ball must be thrown from the point where it left bounds. You must throw the ball using both hands. The ball must be thrown from behind the head. Both feet must be touching the ground at the moment of release. You may not come in-bounds, but may step on the field boundary line. The thrower may not touch the ball until it has touched another player."

Be careful not to throw the ball at a player who is offsides; this will result in a penalty. Players must be at least two meters (6.5 feet) away from the thrower before he throws. If your team is on the attack and in position while your opponents are scrambling, a quick throw in is sometimes ideal. You can also throw the ball back to your goalkeeper if you don't have many options for where to throw, though in this case a goalkeeper will have to play the ball with his feet.

By running toward the throw-in point, you can build momentum and throw the ball farther than you would normally. However, this style of throw is prone to raised feet or missteps, and can result in penalties. To take a running throw in soccer, you should: Take several steps away from the boundary line of the field. Hold the ball with both hands, as normal. Reach the ball behind your head. Run toward the throw-in location. Plant your lead foot outside the sideline boundary to come to a stop. Throw the ball the moment you stop. Drag your trailing foot to prevent fouls."
