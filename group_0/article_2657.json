If you are bigger than the virus, you will split, so make sure to only do this when you are small. If the player that is chasing you is smaller than the virus, or the same size, then this will not work."

      "title": "Split.",
      "content": "Split. Many players split themselves to try and eat other players. This can be done by pushing the space bar. Splitting can send your cell forward, allowing you to eat another cell as long as your split piece is bigger than their entire cell."
