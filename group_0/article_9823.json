[1] X Research source The bests types of steaks to grill are T-bone, sirloin, ribeye, fillet mignon, porterhouse, prime rib, and strip. Get one of these varieties for the best result. If the steak was frozen, make sure it’s fully defrosted before you start cooking it."

      "content": "Sprinkle salt, pepper, and other seasonings on the meat. The seasonings you use on the steak depend on your personal preference. Salt and pepper are the 2 most basic ones, and they really bring out the meat's flavor. Other seasonings that go well with steak are cumin, garlic, oregano, mustard powder, thyme, and sage. For more spice, add some cayenne pepper. [2] X Research source If you prefer your steak marinated, use a store-bought or homemade marinade of your choice. Leave the steak marinate for 12-24 hours before cooking it."

      "title": "Set your grill to a high heat.",
      "content": "Set your grill to a high heat. A high heat gives the steak a nice, charred outside while leaving the inside juicy. Set your grill to 450 °F (232 °C) and let it heat up. Wait a few minutes for the temperature to rise, then start grilling. [3] X Research source If you’re using a charcoal grill , then prepare one chimney-full of charcoal and pour it out. Place the steaks directly over the coals."

      "content": "Put the steak on the grill and cook the first side for 5 minutes. Place the steak on the grill and let it sizzle. Leave it directly over the heat for 5 minutes to sear the first side. [4] X Research source If you're cooking multiple steaks, leave 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) between each steak so the sides cook properly. Cook the first side of the steak the same way regardless of how cooked you want it. After flipping the steaks, you’ll cook until it reaches your desired level of doneness."

      "title": "Flip the steaks and grill them for 3-10 minutes.",
      "content": "Flip the steaks and grill them for 3-10 minutes. The amount of time depends on how well-done you want the steak. For a rare steak, let it cook 3 minutes on the second side. 3-5 minutes gives a medium-rare finish. 5-7 minutes makes it medium to medium-well, and 10 minutes makes it well-done. Remove the steak when it reaches your desired doneness. [5] X Research source If you have a cooking thermometer, you can also use this to track the steak’s cooking level. An internal temperature of 125 °F (52 °C) indicates rare, 135 °F (57 °C) is medium-rare, 145 °F (63 °C) is medium, 150 °F (66 °C) is medium-well, and 160 °F (71 °C) is well. [6] X Research source Remember that for safety reasons, the USDA recommends cooking steaks to an internal temperature of 145 °F (63 °C) to kill any bacteria."

Let the meat reabsorb the juices so it stays tender and juicy. After 5 minutes, cut the steak and serve it. [7] X Research source Don't use any plastic tools or they could melt. If you have leftovers, cooked steak will last 3-4 days in the refrigerator. Store them in an airtight container."
