For instance, you might help them feel grounded by lightly placing your hand on their arm, shoulder, or back. If you're close, you might offer them a hug, as well. If you don't know the person well or they're not comfortable being touched, you might ask them to name 5 things they can see, 4 things they can touch, 3 things they can hear, 2 things they can smell, and 1 thing they can taste. Focusing on their senses can help lessen their overwhelming feeling of panic.
