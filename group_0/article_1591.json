      "title": "Separate your hair into sections.",
      "content": "Separate your hair into sections. It's easiest to apply a mask if you separate your wet hair into roughly three or four even sections. For example, try two sections on either side of your head, one in front, and one in back. Secure the sections with clips or hair ties and apply your mask to one section at a time. [2] X Research source Longer and thicker hair may require more sections. You may need to split it into 4-8 sections of hair. If you have very short hair, however, sections may be unnecessary. Wear on old t-shirt or wrap yourself in a towel to avoid getting any product on your nice clothes."

      "content": "Cover your head with a shower cap and hot towel after applying the mask. Place the plastic shower cap over your hair after applying the mask.

      "content": "Vary the times depending on the mask's purpose. How long you leave your mask on varies. If using a commercial mask, refer to the instructions manual. With a homemade mask, however, leave the mask in for different time periods depending on what you're trying to achieve. [6] X Research source For protein treatments, leave the mask in place for 10 minutes. For hydrating treatment, leave the mask in place for five to 10 minutes. Coconut oil masks should be left on for at least 30 minutes. Olaplex masks should be left on for at least 10 minutes, but work better if left on longer. Strive to leave an olaplex mask on for 30 minutes or more."

If you notice your hair becomes greasy after using a hair mask, you probably used too much product. Next time, cut down on the amount you used and see if this fixes the issue.
