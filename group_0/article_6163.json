[8] X Research source These expenses include tuition, books, and other supplies directly related to your education. The owner of the bond must be 24 years old before the issue date of the bond, so parents who buy bonds to pay for their child’s education should put the bond in their own name and list their child as a beneficiary (and not a co-owner). That also means if you are using a bond to pay for your education, you will only be exempt from tax if the bond is in your parents’ name."

After 20 years, the bond reaches a maturity value of $200, even though the nominal value of the loan, given the interest rate, would normally be $105. After the adjustment, and until the loan hits 30 years old, it will earn a fixed interest rate. Regardless of the interest rate on your current EE savings bond, waiting 20 years before cashing in the paper bond will guarantee you an effective yield of about 3.5 percent.
