      "content": "Cook the rice. Add the rice to the pot as well, and continue cooking over medium–high heat. Bring the rice to a boil, then turn down the heat to low. Cook the rice for an additional 18 to 20 minutes on a low simmer. The best rice for this dish is Arborio, because it becomes creamy when it’s cooked. When you're cooking rice, you don’t have to wait for the stock to boil before adding the rice. To prevent overcooking, set a timer then turn it off and let it simmer."

      "content": "Prepare the cheese. Grate the cheese with a cheese grater. If you don’t have a grater, you can also cut the cheese into half-inch (1.3-cm) cubes. Keep the cubes small so they melt easily. You can use any type of cheese you like for this dish, but a mild cheese like mozzarella might get lost in the rice flavor. Good cheese choices for this dish include sharp cheddar, aged gouda, and blue cheese. Alternatively, you can also use 4 to 8 ounces (113.25 to 226.5 g) of Velveeta, cut into small cubes.

Continue cooking the rice in this way, by adding a half-cup of stock and a splash of wine at a time. This will take about 30 minutes. Remove the rice from the heat once it’s cooked and all the liquid has been incorporated. It’s important to cook Arborio rice in this way because it helps the rice release its starches, giving it a creaminess and smoothness that’s characteristic of risotto. [13] X Research source"
