      "content": "Walk on well-lit streets, close to other people. Don’t take any shortcuts through isolated spots. If you run into danger, you can easily call for help from a bystander. No dark, secluded shortcut is worth risking your personal safety! [1] X Research source If you have to walk through a dark, isolated area to get home, download a safety app to your phone. Apps like TripWhistle, Chirpey, Noonlight, and RedZone help you flag risky areas, and also get in touch with local authorities. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Tune into what’s going on around you.",
      "content": "Tune into what’s going on around you. [3] X Research source Try to make eye contact with the people nearby, so thieves won’t be as likely to target you. Also, don’t walk and text; instead, focus on your surroundings, so you won’t be taken by surprise. [4] X Research source For example, you might watch for someone following you, or someone lurking suspiciously along the side of the street. If you’re listening to music on the go, only listen with 1 earbud. This way, you can still hear what’s going around you."

      "title": "Don’t carry valuables in your back pocket.",
      "content": "Don’t carry valuables in your back pocket. As you walk, cover the zipper or fastener of your bag with your hand, so criminals don’t have easy access. As an extra precaution, only grab your wallet or phone if you absolutely need it. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "You might look vulnerable if you’re struggling with something heavy.",
      "content": "You might look vulnerable if you’re struggling with something heavy. Instead, only carry lightweight bags or packages when you’re by yourself. [6] X Research source If you have to carry or move something heavy, ask a friend or loved one for help. This will help you look a lot less vulnerable."

    {
      "title": "Dangerous people won’t want the extra attention.",
      "content": "Dangerous people won’t want the extra attention. If someone suspicious is talking to you or approaching you, start laughing loudly, drooling, or talking to yourself. Any wild, unpredictable behavior will draw attention, which is exactly what predators and criminals don’t want. [7] X Research source For example, if a stranger is giving you unwanted advances, yell out to draw attention to yourself."

      "title": "Your instincts can raise the alarm before anything dangerous happens.",
      "content": "Your instincts can raise the alarm before anything dangerous happens. Pay attention to anyone acting suspicious, or anyone who makes you feel uncomfortable. If you have a bad feeling about a situation, don’t hesitate to turn and run the other way. [8] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source If a stranger seems overly friendly and curious, you might excuse yourself instead of continuing the conversation. If you’re walking by yourself and notice someone loitering or acting suspiciously, create as much distance as you can between yourself and the stranger."

      "title": "Always act like you have a place to be.",
      "content": "Always act like you have a place to be. Walk confidently and assertively, moving your feet in a smooth, fluid motion as you go. Also, stand with alert, upright posture, and bend your arms slightly as you move. Follow the speed of the crowds around you, so you don’t stick out to potential criminals. [9] X Research source If you can, avoid taking super long steps. Criminals are more likely to target you if your walking pattern is strange."

      "content": "A cell phone can get you out of a potentially dangerous situation. Before heading out by yourself, double-check that you have your cell phone handy. Try to charge your phone frequently, so it’s juiced up when you need it. Keep your emergency contacts saved in your phone, as well as the number for a local taxi company."

      "content": "Exit routes are a great way to plan ahead. Scout out your surroundings whenever you’re in a new, unfamiliar place. Brainstorm quick, easy ways you can escape the area if you’re ever in danger. Be on the lookout for emergency phones and helpful bystanders, too—a helping hand or quick phone call might come in handy. [10] X Research source You might look for a fire escape, or a stairwell that offers an easy exit."

      "content": "A concerned friend or loved one will have your back if something goes wrong. Give someone the low-down on where you’re going, and what time you expect to be back. If you’re embarking on a longer trip, let a loved one know when you plan on checking in. If anything should go wrong, your friend can alert authorities right away.

I’ll check-in with you around noon.” You might also say, “I’m going camping over the weekend, but I’ll do my best to check in once a day. If you don’t hear from me for some reason, call the local park ranger.”"

      "content": "Don’t spend too much time with people you don’t know. It can be fun to meet new people, but you should never sacrifice your personal safety for a fun outing. Only go out and about with close friends who you know will have your back. For example, if an acquaintance you meet at a party invites you to hang out at their place, say no."

      "content": "Always put your own comfort and safety above anyone else’s. If someone is pressuring you into something risky or dangerous, come up with a quick excuse to get out of it. Don’t worry about offending the other person—your personal safety always comes first! [14] X Research source You could say, “My mom just had surgery last week, and I really need to get home and check on her” or “I promised my roommate I’d be back by 9 PM, and they’ll be really worried if I’m out too late.” You might also say, “I appreciate the offer, but I’m running late for an important meeting” or “I have a lot of schoolwork to finish up before my class tomorrow.”"
