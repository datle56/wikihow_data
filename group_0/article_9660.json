To keep your answer clear, make sure you label your answer with “seconds” after you write it down.

This should give you the original number that you started with. If it doesn’t, go back and check your math again. [4] X Research source For example, if you got 660 seconds, divide 660 / 60 = 11 minutes. Or, for 1,200 seconds, do 1,200 / 60 = 20 minutes."
