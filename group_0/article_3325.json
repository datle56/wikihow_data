      "title": "Choose your genes.",
      "content": "Choose your genes. When starting the game, you will be able to choose a few upgrades for your virus. These are unlocked by beating the game multiple times, and you may not have access to all of them. This mode is still beatable if you don't choose any upgrades. [1] X Research source The following are some suggestions if you have them available: [2] X Research source DNA Gene - Metabolic Jump. This gives you bonus DNA for popping bubbles. Travel Gene - Native Biome. Gives you bonus infectivity in your starting country. Evolution Gene - Sympto-Stasis. Keeps symptom costs from increasing. Mutation Gene - Genetic Mimic - Slows down cure research. Environment Gene - Extremophile - Gives a bonus to all environments."

      "title": "Choose a starting country.",
      "content": "Choose a starting country. Your starting country is very important, as this will determine how quickly the virus starts spreading. Start in China, India or South Africa. China and India have the largest population in the world, which hasten the spread rate of the infection. South Africa has a lack of healthcare, which allows for fast growth. Both nations have warm climates, which automatically gives your plague the ability to withstand warm weather. China and India can quickly infect neighboring countries, and since both have seaports and airports, it won't take too long for the infected citizens to migrate on planes and boats and infect other parts of the world.

      "title": "Devolve new symptoms.",
      "content": "Devolve new symptoms. Your bacteria will randomly evolve symptoms as the game progresses. Make sure to devolve every single one. Otherwise too much work will start on the cure. To devolve, tap the DNA button at the bottom left of the screen and then choose Symptoms . Tap on the gene that has generated and then choose Devolve. This can be found at the lower-right of the menu."

      "title": "Increase the spread.",
      "content": "Increase the spread. Once you start earning some DNA, you can work on increasing the transmission capabilities of the virus. Start by unlocking Water 1 and Air 1 . These will increase your bacteria's ability to spread over boats and airplanes. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Increase your bacteria's resistance.",
      "content": "Increase your bacteria's resistance. Bacterial Resilience is an ability unique to bacteria. This will thicken the Bacteria's shell, making it more comfortable in all climates. Drug Resistance allows the bacteria to spread in more developed countries. Improve the transmission and evolve the following upgrades: Bacterial Resilience 1 Drug Resistance 1 Water 2 Air 2 Extreme Bioaerosol - This becomes available after maxing out Air and Water transmission. It gives a boost to both. Bacterial Resilience 2 and 3"

      "title": "Wait for the world to become infected.",
      "content": "Wait for the world to become infected. This will probably take a while, so set the game speed to the fastest setting. Make sure to keep popping bubbles and devolving symptoms when they mutate. Once the entire population is infected, you will receive a message letting you know that there are no healthy people left. Time to unleash the symptoms!"

      "content": "Hit hard with a batch of symptoms. With everyone infected, it's time to hit the population hard and fast so that they start dying before the cure is finished.

      "title": "Slow down the cure.",
      "content": "Slow down the cure. Most of the world should be dead or dying, but you may still have the cure to worry about. Evolve Genetic Hardening and Genetic ReShuffle to slow down the cure's progress. If your Cure percentage reaches above 60%, use Genetic Reshuffle. This will make your disease harder to analyze in the lab and slows future cure research. Evolving this ability will also decrease the cure percentage to 15â€“20% percent. If the cure rate increases beyond 60% again, use Reshuffle once more, upgrading it to level 2 then level 3 if it reaches 60% again. Genetic Hardening is useful as well since this increases the time before the cure is finished. Use this to your advantage until the population in the world declines and no one is left."
