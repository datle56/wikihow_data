      "content": "Mix ¼ cup (59.15 ml) of baking soda with ¾ cup (177 ml) of water per liter volume. The water needs to be hot, but not boiling, as this can damage the bladder. Mix the ingredients until they are well combined. For example, if your Camelbak bladder holds 2 liters (8.45 cups) of water, then mix ½ cup (118.3 ml) of baking soda with 1 ½ cups (354.8 ml) of water. You may also add ¼ cup (59.15 ml) of white vinegar to the solution. If you do, the vinegar will react with the baking soda, making the solution fizz. Wait until the solution stops fizzing before pouring it into the bladder."

      "title": "Pour the solution into the bladder.",
      "content": "Pour the solution into the bladder. Then shake it for 30 seconds. Let the solution set for five minutes. If you added vinegar, open the main valve (away from your face) to let any built-up pressure escape."

Alternatively, you can use denture tablets instead of the hydraulic cleaning tablets."
