      "content": "“Circle back” means to come back to something later. When someone says they’ll “circle back” about something, they’re saying they’ll revisit the topic with you another time. [1] X Research source The phrase is usually used in business or work settings. For example, “We’re running out of time, so we’ll have to circle back to this at our next meeting.” Here are some more examples: “I wanted to go over the most recent sales report with you, but it’s not ready yet. We’ll have to circle back next week.” “I’m going out on PTO tomorrow for the holiday, but I’ll circle back with you on this topic when I get back.” “I don’t know the answer to that question, so I’ll have to ask my manager. I’ll circle back with you when I have more info.” “That’s a super interesting point. We’re out of time for our meeting today, but let’s circle back to that topic next time.” “I’m on my way out, but I do want to discuss this with you. Can we circle back to this tomorrow?” “Would you mind doing some research on that topic and circling back with me about what you find?”"

      "content": "“Circle back” can also mean to return somewhere. This usage of the phrase can occur in all kinds of situations, not just office or business settings. For instance, you could say, “I forgot my jacket at home this morning, so I had to circle back to my house to grab it.” [2] X Research source Other examples include: “They didn’t have the book I wanted at the store, so I had to circle back a few days later to see if it came in.” “The line at the buffet is way too long right now.

      "content": "Less commonly, “circle back” can mean returning to an old relationship. Some people use the term “circle back” to mean reaching out to an ex or trying to rekindle an old romance. For example, “We broke up two years ago, but now that he’s matured a little bit he’s trying to circle back.” Here are some other examples: “We went on a few dates then she ghosted me, but now she’s circling back for some reason. Maybe I’ll give her another chance.” “He has commitment issues, but I always knew he’d circle back. He just reached out to me last night after months of not talking.” “My ex always circles back. No matter how many years go by, he always reaches out and tries to start something up again as soon as he hears I’m single.”"

      "title": "Some people don’t like “circle back” because it’s corporate jargon.",
      "content": "Some people don’t like “circle back” because it’s corporate jargon. Corporate jargon is basically stereotypical workplace language, and it includes phrases like “ping me,” “let’s take this offline,” and of course, “let’s circle back.” Some people don’t like corporate jargon because they think it’s clichéd, vague, or even annoying.

      "title": "Others don’t like “circle back” because they think it’s dismissive.",
      "content": "Others don’t like “circle back” because they think it’s dismissive. Because “let’s circle back” basically means “let’s talk about this later,” some people feel like they’re being shut down or ignored when they hear it. [4] X Research source They may also feel like the other person is just trying to buy themselves time, or get out of having a conversation they don’t want to have. For example, if you tried to share an exciting idea at a meeting but your boss said the team would “circle back” to it later, you might feel like your creativity was being shut down. Or, if you asked for a raise and your supervisor said, “Let’s circle back about that another time,” you might worry that they’re blowing you off or avoiding the topic."

      "title": "When someone shares an idea they’re excited about",
      "content": "When someone shares an idea they’re excited about Since “let’s circle back” can come across as a bit dismissive at times, it’s best to avoid saying it right after someone shares an idea that seems important to them. It takes a lot of courage to speak up and share your thoughts in the workplace , so it’s important to be supportive and empathetic when someone does this. For example, instead of saying, “We’re out of time, but let’s circle back to that later,” try saying something like: “That’s a great idea, and I definitely want to revisit it next time. I’m making a note so I remember to bring it up at the start of our next meeting.”"

      "title": "When there’s an important deadline",
      "content": "When there’s an important deadline “Let’s circle back” can be a little vague, so it can cause some anxiety if the other person needs an answer by a certain date. They may also worry that you’ll forget to bring the topic again with them. Because of this, it’s better to use more concrete language when you're talking about something time sensitive. For example, instead of saying, “I don’t know the answer to that, but I’ll circle back with you,” try staying something like: “I’ll need to ask my manager about that, but I know you need an answer soon. I’ll email you with with an update later today.”"

      "content": "Not everyone has negative feelings about the phrase “circle back.” In fact, many people don’t mind it at all. However, if you’re worried about accidentally offending someone with the phrase, here are a few alternatives you can use instead: Let’s revisit this: “I’m super interested in your input, but I have to hop on another call. Let’s revisit this topic at our meeting tomorrow morning.” Let’s touch base: “I’ll be out on PTO the rest of the week, but let’s touch base on this topic on Monday.” Let’s continue this conversation: “I love this idea, but unfortunately we’re out of time for today. Let’s continue this conversation at our meeting tomorrow.” Let’s schedule a meeting: “I want to hear more, but I’m running late for my next call. Let’s schedule a meeting to talk about this later this week.” Let’s reconnect about this: “You’ve shared some really interesting insights, and I'd love to talk about them more. Let’s reconnect about this tomorrow.” I’ll follow up with you: “I’m not sure of the answer to that question, but I’ll ask my supervisor and follow up with you ASAP.” I’ll get back to you: “These are some great questions. I’ll bring them up to my manager and get back to you with any updates.”"
