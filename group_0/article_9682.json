      "content": "There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. No matter where you are in the world, this is always the case. So that means: [1] X Research source 60 seconds = 1 minute 120 seconds = 2 minutes 180 seconds = 3 minutes 240 seconds = 4 minutes 300 seconds = 5 minutes"

      "content": "Divide the number of seconds by 60 to calculate minutes. Because there are 60 seconds in 1 minute, dividing by 60 is how you'll figure out how many minutes have elapsed. If 360 seconds have passed, how many minutes have passed? We need to know how many 60 second chunks are in 360 seconds. So, we'll do this: 360/60. The answer is 6, so our answer is 6 minutes. [2] X Research source Example: How many minutes are in 240 seconds? 1 Minute = 60 Seconds 240 / 60 Answer: There are 4 minutes in 240 seconds."

      "title": "Multiply decimals by 60 to put your answer in minutes and seconds.",
      "content": "Multiply decimals by 60 to put your answer in minutes and seconds. Oftentimes the number of seconds will not perfectly convert into minutes, so your answer will include a decimal. This represents the number of seconds left over. For example, say you wanted to convert 7600 seconds to minutes: 7600 / 60 = 126.6. That \".6\" isn't really useful in terms of time, so we'll multiply it by 60 to put it back into seconds: 60 x .6 = 36 seconds. Your answer is 126 minutes and 36 seconds! Example: How many minutes are in 90 seconds? 90 / 60 = 1.5 minutes 0.5 x 60 = 30 seconds Answer There is 1 minute and 30 seconds in 90 seconds."
