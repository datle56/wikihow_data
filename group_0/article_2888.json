      "title": "Act confident.",
      "content": "Act confident. This is a 'must'. If you started to look good, the best way to make people drawn to you and your looks, is to show confidence. Even if you don't feel confident, fake it until you feel confident enough. That means having good posture, head high, looking at people in the eyes and walking like you own the place, with a little bit of a sexy sway in the hips if that's appropriate! People will see you as confident and will be interested in approaching you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have something to say.",
      "content": "Have something to say. Don't go with silly conversations like \"what class do you have?\" or \"what do you feel like doing?\". That's just the usual boring get-to-know-you chit chat that feels awkward... just start to introduce yourself, and tell funny stories about yourself, and talk naturally, so people will see you as a nice person to talk to. Just that."
    },
    {
      "title": "Engage in good hygiene.",
      "content": "Engage in good hygiene. First things first, no one is going to find you attractive if you look dirty. In order to be attractive, you MUST be clean. Shower every day and wash your hair at least three times a week. Also, brush your teeth often to keep your breath fresh and your smile white."

      "title": "Take care of any unwanted hair.",
      "content": "Take care of any unwanted hair. If you are over the age of twelve and feel the need to, shave your legs every couple of days and pluck your eyebrows into a feminine arch. You may even want to wax your bikini line if you are planning to go swimming, but remember, this is not absolutely necessary."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have clear skin.",
      "content": "Have clear skin. Drink a lot of water and eat healthy food, because this can make your skin healthier looking. Also, use acne cream/treatments for pimples and wash your face well with a product that works for you, some people find that soap dries out the skin on their face. Use cleanser often. Use lotion to avoid having dry skin."

      "title": "Remove your makeup every night.",
      "content": "Remove your makeup every night. If you are going to wear makeup, always wash your face at the end of each day. Also remember that less is more. All you really need is concealer, mascara, thin eyeliner, neutral eye shadow, blush or bronzer, and a lip product."

      "title": "Get dressed up.",
      "content": "Get dressed up. No matter where you are going, for school or whatever, don't dress down ! Read fashion magazines and buy more fashionable clothes. It doesn't have to be expensive; you can wear jeans, but make sure you still look fabulous!"
