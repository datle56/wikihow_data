      "title": "Show him how confident you are.",
      "content": "Show him how confident you are. Think of your Leo man as a lion looking for his mate. He wants someone who can rule with him, so to catch him, you have to show off your big cat energy! To do this, visualize yourself as fierce, dignified, and fearless. Carry yourself with your head held high, and look him in the eyes when you're talking to him. Confidence is all about attitude, so as long as you believe it, so will he. [1] X Research source With all that Libran grace, you should have no trouble showing him why you're the perfect choice to be his queen."

      "title": "He'll love your Libran elegance.",
      "content": "He'll love your Libran elegance. Leos love the finer things in life, and that good taste usually extends to their partner—they want someone who will look good standing beside them. When you know you're going to see him, wear something that makes you feel confident, classy, and sensual. Libras have an innate sense of style, so you probably already have the perfect outfit in your closet! [2] X Research source For instance, you might wear your hair in a sleek bun or pinned back from your face, along with a V-neck dress that shows off the curve of your neck and shoulders. Or, you might style your hair down in wild curls and wear a form-fitting dress and sleek heels."

      "title": "Leos have a tendency to enjoy luxury.",
      "content": "Leos have a tendency to enjoy luxury. If you want to really impress him, take him somewhere upscale with really stunning decor. When he's surrounded by a gorgeous setting, he's more likely to let those feelings of romance overtake him. [3] X Research source For example, the two of you might go to dinner at a nice restaurant furnished with polished wood, rich leather, and tasteful bronze accents. Or, you might go for drinks at a rooftop wine bar with a stunning view."

      "title": "This sun sign radiates cheerful energy.",
      "content": "This sun sign radiates cheerful energy. Luckily, Libras are known for being warm and gracious, so this shouldn't be too hard for you. Flash him that sunny smile, point out things you like about the meal you're sharing, talk about things you're excited about—just follow your tendency to look on the bright side. In fact, because you're both so naturally positive the combination of Leo and Libra can be one of the most exuberant sign pairings! [4] X Research source Turn that warmth to others when he's around, too. Leos are very social and they love to be in the spotlight, and he'll find you more attractive if you're comfortable sharing that attention. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "He'll love being the center of attention.",
      "content": "He'll love being the center of attention. Any time you get a chance, try to steer the conversation to be about him—his likes and dislikes, the last movie he watched, his favorite sports team, anything that gets him talking. If you spend most of the time talking about him instead of yourself, you'll seem a little more mysterious, sparking his curiosity about you. You don't have to be a totally closed book—that's not true to your Libran nature, and you do want him to know how great you are! Just keep your scales tipped so you're talking about him a little more than you talk about yourself, especially in the beginning when you're getting to know each other."

      "title": "It's no secret that most Leos are vain.",
      "content": "It's no secret that most Leos are vain. Their sign is ruled by the sun itself, and while we're not saying they think everything revolves around them, we're not not saying it, either. [6] X Research source Libras are skilled flatterers, though, so it's a pairing that works out really well. Put that silver tongue of yours to work with thoughtful, specific compliments that make your Leo feel larger than life. [7] X Research source Try saying something like, \"You have such a creative way of thinking. I could see you owning your own company one day!\" Or you might say, \"I love that suit. You're always the best-dressed person in the room.\" Reader Poll: We asked 1073 wikiHow readers what they would do if their Leo crush opened up and got vulnerable with them. 86% agreed that the best way to win his heart is by showing empathy, understanding, and kindness (like with a thoughtful compliment, for example!)

      "title": "He'll love a challenge, so let him chase you sometimes.",
      "content": "He'll love a challenge, so let him chase you sometimes. Leos tend to attract a lot of attention, so they can get bored if they feel like someone is super interested very early on. Make it a little bit challenging for him to keep him intrigued. Every once in a while, wait a few hours before you respond to his text, or maybe turn down an invite for a date in favor of dinner with your bestie. It's just going to make him want to see you all that much more. [8] X Research source Don't go too far with this—if he feels like you're cold or disinterested, he'll have a tendency to move on quickly. Just tease him enough for it to be fun for both of you."

    {
      "title": "Leos want someone adventurous and exciting.",
      "content": "Leos want someone adventurous and exciting. As a Libra, you find it easy to be enthusiastic about whatever you're interested in, so share that with him! He'll love seeing you light up when you talk about you're latest art project or the next trip you're planning. And when he suggests trying something new, don't let that Libran indecision hold you back—he needs to know that you're willing to join him on his many adventures. [9] X Research source Get his adrenaline going by inviting him on a day trip to do something daring, like going ziplining or taking a tour of a haunted house."

      "title": "Show him that you're secure.",
      "content": "Show him that you're secure. Leos like to flirt, so don't make a big deal of it if he's doing some harmless chatting with someone else. Libras are pretty flirtatious too, and you're both likely to get a lot of attention when you go out together. If you can handle the situation with grace and a sense of humor, he's going to respect you more than he would if you overreacted every time he flashed that Leo grin at someone who fawned over him. [10] X Research source Of course, it's fine to set healthy boundaries in the relationship, so rely on your Libran diplomacy as you negotiate what is and isn't okay for the two of you. For instance, you might agree that it's fine to flirt with people at a party, but not over text or on social media."

      "title": "Use your gentle touch to smooth things over.",
      "content": "Use your gentle touch to smooth things over. Leos can be a bit dramatic, and their temper tends to flare up suddenly. [11] X Research source Luckily, the storm usually passes as quickly as it appears, especially if you can keep your cool. And as a Libra, you're already well-skilled at handling tense moments in a gracious, diplomatic manner, so you'll likely be able to soothe your Leo without much effort. [12] X Research source For instance, you might just laugh and change the subject if you and he disagree about something political and he shouts, \"That's ridiculous!\" On the other hand, Leos and Libras both love a lively debate, so if the stakes aren't too high, feel free to poke the lion just a little. For instance, you might root for a rivaling sports team or argue that pineapple does, in fact, belong on pizza."

      "content": "Don't depend on him to make you happy. As a Libra, you like to give your all to a relationship, so occasionally remind yourself that keeping up with your own interests will make both of you happier in the long run. [13] X Expert Source Julia McCurley Certified Professional Matchmaker Expert Interview. 30 September 2021. Leos want to know that their partner is as capable and independent as they are, so if he doesn't call for a few days, don't sit by the phone pining. Instead, go out and live your best life—grab coffee with friends, take a yoga class, try your hand at pottery, or work on your business plan. If he knows you're satisfied on your own, he'll be that much more inclined to spend time around you because he won't feel smothered. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Ask for his opinion or help once in a while. Leos are skilled leaders, and they like having an opportunity to feel needed. While he definitely wants someone who's independent and strong, he also won't mind if you occasionally need a hand opening a jar or you ask him to help you pick out a gift for your coworker. [15] X Research source Luckily, as a Libra, nobody will be better at managing this balance than you! Asking someone for help is a form of flattery, which your Leo definitely doesn't mind!"

      "content": "Don't rush him to get serious too soon. As you get to know each other, you might find yourself falling quickly. However, even if he has a strong attraction to you from the start, a Leo man may take a little longer to commit than you'd like. Try to be patient, though. Leos are passionate, but it's hard for them to open up and build an emotional connection with someone. [16] X Research source Focus on being supportive, kind, and a good listener. Also, keep the passion alive as you get to know each other better so his attention doesn't wander."

      "content": "In return, he'll be devoted to you. It's not easy to earn the trust of a Leo man, and once you have it, it's important to keep it. If you can prove that you'll always be by his side and that he can trust you with his secrets, you might just be the one he chooses as his lifelong partner. [17] X Research source Libras tend to put a high value on loyalty, so the two of you should find it easy to commit to each other when it gets to that point. [18] X Research source"
