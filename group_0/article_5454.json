The last day of each cycle is the day before your next period starts. Keep tracking your cycle this way for eight to twelve cycles. The more cycles you have to reference, the more accurate the calendar method will be.

      "content": "Use your chart to predict the fertile period in your current cycle. It’s difficult to pinpoint the exact day you’ll ovulate using only a calendar. Instead, a calendar is useful for predicting the range of days during which you will be fertile, which can be a different length for each woman, as described below: [9] X Research source Predict the first fertile day in your current cycle by finding the shortest cycle in your chart. Subtract eighteen from the total number of days in that cycle to find your first fertile day, meaning the first day in your cycle when pregnancy could occur. For example, if your shortest cycle lasted 26 days, your first fertile day would be the 8th day in each cycle (26 - 18 = 8), counting the day you began your period as day one. Predict the last fertile day in your current cycle by finding the longest cycle in your chart. Subtract eleven days from the total number of days to find the last fertile day in your cycle. For example, if your longest cycle lasted 31 days, your last potentially fertile day in each cycle would be the 20th day in the cycle (31 - 11 = 20). Note that the more regular your cycle duration is, the more effective this method will be. [10] X Research source"

Your body produces more mucus right around the time of ovulation to help facilitate the fertilization of the egg. Once you get to know your pattern well, it’s possible to use it to predict the day you will ovulate."

Check your mucus every day after your period ends, and note the distinct changes that take place over the course of your cycle. Keep track of the changes on a calendar. Chart the days when you have your period, dry days, and days when your mucus is tacky, sticky, slippery, and wet. Note changes in color and smell in addition to texture. Note whether the mucus is cloudy or clear. Keep as thorough a record as possible, especially in the first few months when you’re still getting used to this method. Breastfeeding, infections, certain drugs, and other circumstances can affect the cervical mucus, so be sure to note these factors as well."

The body temperature rises slightly right after the woman has ovulated, then remains elevated for the remainder of the cycle, until your next period. You are most fertile during the days in your cycle directly before the temperature rise. Because the incremental temperature change from day to day is so small, regular thermometers will not provide accurate results.

[13] X Research source The most accurate readings are taken in the vagina or rectum, but there are also basal temperature thermometers designed to take readings in the mouth. Stick with the same method during the entire process, and try to measure at the same depth and angle each time."

Ideally, take it first thing in the morning, after at least five hours of sleep and before getting out of bed. Record your temperature within 1 / 10 of a degree. Use a dot or other symbol on your chart to mark days when other factors may alter the reading, including illness, restless sleep, and fever reduction medicines such as aspirin, Tylenol, and Motrin.
