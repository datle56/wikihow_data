Here’s to another year of outward smiles (and inward screams).” “Congratulations! You’re no longer a newbie.” “Here’s to hoping this message stands out amongst the many “Congrats” on your LinkedIn work anniversary post. Celebrating you today!” “Congratulations on surviving a year! Just kidding—we highly appreciate all that you’ve done here. Here’s to another year!” “Thanks for still showing up! Happy work anniversary!” “Only 40 more years until retirement.
