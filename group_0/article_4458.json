If you've only gone on a few dates and things aren't super serious yet. In that case, you might text them something like, “I've had a great time getting to know you more, but right now I'm not interested in pursuing this any further.” Reader Poll: We asked 949 wikiHow readers about how they’d prefer to end a very casual or short-term relationship, and 64% agreed that it’s okay to end these types of romantic connections over text or phone.
