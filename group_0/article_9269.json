      "content": "Determine which video outputs your MacBook has. Depending on the year your MacBook was produced and its make and model, your MacBook may use either a Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, Thunderbolt, Thunderbolt 2, Mini DisplayPort, HDMI port, or USB-A port. [2] X Research source If you have a MacBook Pro or MacBook Air produced in 2016 or later, your MacBook supports both Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C output ports. Both Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C ports have a small pill-shaped port. MacBooks that support Thunderbolt 3 have multiple output ports on them. You can use a Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C cable in any one of the output ports. If you have a MacBook produced after 2015 and it has a single pill-shaped port on the side, your MacBook supports a USB-C connection, but not Thunderbolt 3 connection. Be sure to purchase a USB-C cable and not a Thunderbolt 3. If you have a MacBook Pro produced between 2011 and 2015, or a MacBook Air produced between 2011 and 2017, your MacBook may have a Thunderbolt or Thunderbolt 2 output port. These ports are rectangle-shaped with the corners cut out of the bottom. They also have a label that resembles a lightning bolt next to them. Thunderbolt and Thunderbolt 2 output ports are the same shape and size as a Mini DisplayPort, but they are not the same as a Mini DisplayPort. Pay attention to the label next to the port to know what cable you need to purchase. If you have a MacBook Pro or MacBook Air produced between 2008 and 2010, your MacBook uses a Mini DisplayPort. It has a rectangle-shaped port with the bottom corners cut out. It also has a label that resembles a TV screen with two lines on both sides. Mini DisplayPorts are the same size and shape as Thunderbolt and Thunderbolt 2 ports, but they are not the same. Check the label next to the port to know what cable you need to use. Some MacBook models have an HDMI port on the side. This can be used to connect to a TV without an adapter. HDMI ports resemble a 3/4 inch pentogonal-shaped port with the bottom corners rounded inward. Some TVs let you connect a laptop to them using a USB connection. For this to work, your TV needs to have a USB input port and support a display over USB."

      "content": "Buy an adapter cable. You'll need a USB-C-to-HDMI adapter for MacBooks made in 2015 or later. If your MacBook uses a Thunderbolt or Thunderbolt 2 connection, you will need a Thunderbolt-to-HDMI adapter. If your MacBook uses a Mini DisplayPort, you will need a Mini DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapter. You can find your required cables and adapters in stores such as Best Buy, or you can find them online in places like Amazon and eBay. When buying an adapter, don't worry about spending more than around $15. Higher-priced cables don't necessarily equate to higher quality."

If so, make sure you have purchased the correct cable and connect it to the input port on the adapter. If your MacBook has an HDMI output, no adapter is needed."
