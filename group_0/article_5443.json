      "content": "Use the formula w = m ∗ g {\\displaystyle w=m*g} to convert weight into mass. Weight is defined as the force of gravity on an object. Scientists put that sentence into an equation by writing w = m ∗ g {\\displaystyle w=m*g} , or w = m g {\\displaystyle w=mg} . [1] X Research source Since weight is a force, scientists also write the equation as F = m g {\\displaystyle F=mg} . F {\\displaystyle F} = symbol for weight, measured in Newtons, N . m {\\displaystyle m} = symbol for mass, measured in kilograms, or kg . g {\\displaystyle g} = symbol for gravitational acceleration, expressed as m/s 2 , or meters per second squared. If you're using meters , the gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface is 9.8 m/s 2 . Always use m/s 2 for acceleration, unless you’re instructed to do otherwise. If you're asked to use feet , instead of meters , the gravitational acceleration on Earth is 32.2 ft/s 2 . This is the same unit, it's just converted from meters to feet . Luckily, you’re very unlikely to encounter a problem with acceleration written in ft/s 2 ."

Elsewhere in the universe, the acceleration of gravity is different. [2] X Research source The gravitational acceleration on the moon is different from the gravitational acceleration on the Earth. Acceleration due to gravity on the moon is about 1.622 m/s 2 , or about 1/6 of the acceleration that it is here on Earth. That's why you weigh 1/6 of your Earth-weight on the moon. [3] X Research source The gravitational acceleration on the sun is different from the gravitational acceleration on the Earth and moon. Acceleration due to gravity on the sun is about 274.0 m/s 2 , or about 28 times the acceleration that it is here on Earth. That's why you would weigh 28 times your Earth-weight on the sun (if you could survive!). [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Example #1: An object has a mass of 100 kg. What is its weight on the surface of the Earth? We know m {\\displaystyle m} equals 100 kg, and g {\\displaystyle g} equals 9.8 m/s 2 (since this is the gravitational acceleration on Earth’s surface). Plug these values into the equation: F {\\displaystyle F} = 100 kg * 9.8 m/s 2 . F {\\displaystyle F} = 980 N. In other words, on the surface of the Earth, an object with a mass of 100 kg will weigh about 980 Newtons on Earth."

We know m {\\displaystyle m} equals 40 kg, and g {\\displaystyle g} equals 1.6 m/s 2 (since the gravitational acceleration on the Moon’s surface is 1.6 m/s 2 ). Plug these values into the equation: F {\\displaystyle F} = 40 kg x 1.6 m/s 2 . F {\\displaystyle F} = 64 N.

      "content": "Example #3: An object weighs 549 Newtons on the surface of the Earth. What is its mass? For this problem, we have to work backward. We have F {\\displaystyle F} and g {\\displaystyle g} , but we need to calculate m {\\displaystyle m} . Set up the equation: 549 = m {\\displaystyle m} * 9.8 m/s 2 . Instead of multiplying m {\\displaystyle m} * g {\\displaystyle g} , we divide F {\\displaystyle F} by g {\\displaystyle g} . In other words, m = F / g {\\displaystyle m=F/g} . Plugging in our values, we get m {\\displaystyle m} = 549/9.8 m/s 2 . m {\\displaystyle m} = 56 kg. In other words, an object weighing 549 Newtons on the surface of the Earth will have a mass of about 56 kilograms."

Weight measures the force of gravity on that \"stuff,\" which changes if you move through space. Try these mnemonic devices to help you memorize your units: Mass is in units of grams or kilograms. Both m ass and gra m contain an m {\\displaystyle m} . Weight is in units of newtons. Both w eight and ne w ton contain a w .

Most physics problems use newtons ( N ) for weight, meters per second squared ( m/s 2 ) for gravitational force, and kilograms ( kg ) for mass. [6] X Research source If you use a different unit for one of these values, your calculations will be incorrect. Convert all values to scientific units before plugging them into the standard equation. These conversions may help you out if you're used to the imperial / U.S. system: 1 pound-force = ~4.448 newtons 1 foot = ~0.3048 meters"
