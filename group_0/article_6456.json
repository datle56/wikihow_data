      "title": "A cesspool is an underground concrete tank that holds human waste.",
      "content": "A cesspool is an underground concrete tank that holds human waste. The concrete walls are perforated to allow liquid waste to leak into the surrounding soil, while solid waste slowly accumulates at the bottom. Since the liquid waste leaks directly into the surrounding environment, cesspools often contaminate groundwater and nearby soil. Cesspools need to be pumped frequently to prevent perforations in the concrete from becoming blocked by solid waste. Most cesspools eventually need to be replaced as the surrounding soil becomes saturated with wastewater. Otherwise, the water will begin pooling at the surface above the soil."

      "title": "A septic system safely contains and eliminates human waste.",
      "content": "A septic system safely contains and eliminates human waste. The system works by collecting waste in an underground septic tank, where solid waste settles at the bottom. Wastewater is then separated and sent to a series of perforated pipes, which slowly distribute the wastewater over a large land area called a “drainfield.” This process minimizes soil contamination, making septic tanks an eco-friendly alternative to cesspools. [1] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source A septic system is a long-term solution to handling human waste. Though it still needs to be pumped every 2-5 years, the tank itself does not need to be replaced if it’s installed and maintained correctly."

      "content": "Cesspools are horrible for the environment. Unlike septic tanks, cesspools don’t treat waste. Instead, they leak wastewater directly into the surrounding soil. [2] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source This contaminates the soil and nearby groundwater. Wastewater can contaminate groundwater with coliform bacteria like E. coli. Consuming contaminated groundwater can cause you to develop vomiting, diarrhea, and fever."

      "content": "Cesspools are difficult and expensive to maintain. They need to be pumped several times a year, which can add up to thousands of dollars. [3] X Research source And if they’re not pumped regularly, waste will begin to pile up and blocks the pipes, causing smells and raw sewage to escape. Cesspools can lower the value of your home due to the cost of maintaining or replacing them. Given the choice, most buyers prefer a home with a septic system or sewer access."

      "content": "Cesspools are illegal in some places. In the United States, cesspools designed for multiple households, such as apartment buildings or multifamily homes, are illegal nationwide. [4] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source As for single-family homes, some states don’t even allow new cesspools to be built on residential properties. Other states, like New Jersey, require homeowners to replace cesspools with septic systems before selling their property to someone else. Given all the legal headaches surrounding cesspools, you might decide they’re simply not worth it."

      "title": "Septic systems treat wastewater and safely release it into the soil.",
      "content": "Septic systems treat wastewater and safely release it into the soil. The septic tank separates wastewater from raw sewage and distributes it over a drainfield via a series of pipes. This process eliminates harmful pathogens, making septic systems much better for the environment than cesspools.

      "content": "Septic systems are more affordable to maintain. They need to be pumped less often than cesspools, which can save you thousands of dollars a year. [6] X Research source They also don’t need to be replaced if they’re well-maintained. Whereas cesspools eventually become unusable as the soil around them becomes saturated, a septic system prevents this problem by distributing waste over a wide area. A septic tank will need to be pumped more often depending on use, such as if it supports a multi-person household. However, it’ll still need less frequent pumping than a cesspool for the same household size."

      "content": "A good septic system protects your property value. A working septic system keeps the soil on your property—and possibly nearby property—clean and uncontaminated. It also prevents contamination of nearby water sources, like streams and lakes. When the time comes to sell your home or property, the buyer will be pleased to learn that your septic system is in good working order, since they will not have to spend extra money fixing it. [7] X Research source Septic systems still require regular maintenance. Besides pumping, the owner should take care not to use too much water, since this could flood the tank. Too much water could flood the drainfield, causing a stinky mess.
