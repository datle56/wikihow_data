      "title": "Bring a valid government-issued photo ID if you're going to a gun show.",
      "content": "Bring a valid government-issued photo ID if you're going to a gun show. If you want to purchase a gun at a gun show from a private seller, you'll still have to be able to prove that you are over the age of 18 (21 to purchase a handgun). You must have a driver's license or state ID that lists your name, gender, and date of birth. [2] X Research source If you're using a driver's license issued by the Virginia DMV, it must have been issued to you at least 30 days before the day of the gun show. If you aren't a resident of the state of Virginia, you can buy a rifle or shotgun from a licensed dealer, provided you bring a secondary form of ID to prove your residence."

      "content": "Discuss your purchase with the individual selling the firearm. Provided you're a state resident, there aren't any significant legal requirements if you want to buy a gun from a private seller, whether at a gun show or elsewhere. All you need to do is agree on a price and the terms of the sale. Virginia also doesn't have any requirements regarding the manufacture or composition of a firearm, so you likely want to look it over carefully and make sure it suits your needs and doesn't have any glaring defects."

      "title": "Provide your complete name and address to the seller.",
      "content": "Provide your complete name and address to the seller. While it isn't legally required, the Virginia State Police recommends that private sellers keep a logbook that lists the name and address of anyone they sell a firearm to, along with the make, model, and serial number of the firearm and date of purchase. [3] X Research source Keep in mind that because you're buying the gun from a private individual, your name will not show up in the chain of ownership for the gun. This means if the gun is found at the scene of a crime, the seller will come up as the last owner of the gun with that serial number. The log is primarily to protect the seller, but also protects you in case the gun is stolen."

      "title": "Comply with a background check if the seller requests one.",
      "content": "Comply with a background check if the seller requests one. While there is no law in Virginia that requires an unlicensed private individual to run a criminal background check before they sell a firearm to someone else, private individuals are restricted from selling a firearm to someone they know is ineligible to purchase a firearm. If you're at a gun show, Virginia State Police will be on hand to conduct background checks for anyone who asks for one. [4] X Research source You can also order your own background check ahead of time by going to the nearest Virginia State Police headquarters and completing an application. However, these do take approximately 15 days to complete, so plan in advance if you want to bring along your own background check. If you don't want to go through with the background check, simply find an individual who is willing to sell to you without one."

      "content": "Complete the purchase of your firearm. There are no further legal requirements if you want to purchase a firearm from a private seller. All you have to do is make payment and leave with your firearm. However, you want to make sure you comply with Virginia laws regarding the carrying of firearms as you transport the gun home. Generally, you can open-carry any firearm as long as it isn't loaded. If you also have ammunition, it's a good idea to store the ammunition separately. If you purchase a handgun, you can put it in the glove compartment or a similar concealed area of your vehicle for transport, even if you don't have a concealed carry permit."

Generally, you must meet the following requirements: [5] X Research source Be at least 18 (21 to purchase a handgun) Never convicted of a felony or misdemeanor that carries a maximum sentence of 2 years or more Under indictment for a felony, subject to an active warrant, or under a restraining order US citizen or lawful permanent resident of the US Not convicted of use or possession of illegal drugs within the past year Not acquitted of a charge by reason of insanity, or found by a court of law to be insane, incompetent, or mentally incapacitated Not dishonorably discharged from the US Armed Forces Not convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence charge"

These forms require you to provide identification information as well as answer questions about your criminal background. Answer all questions and fill out the form completely. Do not lie on the forms. It is a felony offense and could result in the loss of your right to purchase firearms indefinitely. You must also pay a small fee (as of 2019, $2 for Virginia residents and $5 for non-residents) for completion of your background checks. This fee is nonrefundable."

Your primary ID must have been issued at least 30 days before the date you purchase the firearm. Your secondary ID is to prove your residence. The address shown must be identical to the one you provide on the transaction form. This ID could be a copy of your lease, a current utility or telephone bill, voter registration card, car registration, or a hunting or fishing license. If you are buying an assault weapon, you must also bring identification that proves your citizenship status, such as a US birth certificate, valid passport, permanent resident card (\"Green Card\"), selective service registration card, or voter registration card."

If the 45-day period passes and your permit hasn't been issued, the court clerk will certify a copy of your application and send that to you.

Given that it can take up to 45 days to get the new permit, you may want to apply for a renewed permit a few months before your old one expires if you want to continue to carry."
