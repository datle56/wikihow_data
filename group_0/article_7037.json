    {
      "title": "Wait for a card you want.",
      "content": "Wait for a card you want. Keep an eye on your hands for any cards you might want to hold. Remember, you won't be using this card immediately, you will be storing it for use later on. Be patient and wait for the best card to come to you. Only select a card that is in a poor hand. Play any good hands normally."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hide the card you want to keep.",
      "content": "Hide the card you want to keep. Take your whole hand under the table and leave the card you want to hide hidden somewhere on you. Bring your hand back up to the table and fold. The easiest place to hide the card is under your leg. Drop the card out of your hand and onto your lap. Pretend to drop something on the floor. Pick it up, but leave your card hidden somewhere. The best hiding places are ones that allow for easy and quick access. Move smoothly and quickly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drop your hand.",
      "content": "Drop your hand. Get rid of your poor hand after you have hidden your card. Try to remain calm and collected as you drop this hand. Keep your cards close together when you fold. Spreading your cards out makes them easy to count and can get you caught."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep playing.",
      "content": "Keep playing. Always keep in mind which card you have under your leg. Remember that the next hand could be the best time to play it or switch it for another. Wait for the right moment to make your next move. Consider if your new hand is the best time to play your hidden card. Don't be in a rush to use your card."
    },
    {
      "title": "Switch the card or play it.",
      "content": "Switch the card or play it. Take action when a better card or hand comes your way. Playing your hidden card or switching it for another will require you to make another cheating move. Try acting confused as to what to do during your play. Bring your hand down to your leg or wherever you have the card. Pick up the card and add it to your hand, or, switch it for another."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap things up.",
      "content": "Wrap things up. If you haven't yet made use of your hidden card, you will have to get rid of it. Removing the card from your hand at the end of the game or when you are done cheating is a great way to remove evidence. Use the same tactics as before to add the card to your hand again. Fold or play to get rid of your extra card. Do not get caught with an extra or hidden card after a game!"

    {
      "title": "Gather a friend or friends.",
      "content": "Gather a friend or friends. Working with friends will give you all an advantage. Remember that your goal will be to share what cards you have with each other. You will need at least one friend. Too many friends will increase the risk of getting caught."
    },
    {
      "title": "Select friends you can trust.",
      "content": "Select friends you can trust. Choosing friends who are trustworthy cheaters will work best. Selecting someone who isn't in line with your cheating can get you caught. Only select friends you have known for a long time. Make sure you feel that your friend will agree before asking."

      "title": "Decide your communications.",

    {
      "title": "Practice with your friends.",
      "content": "Practice with your friends. Do not go into a game unpracticed. Practicing your signals and methods will help you to remain calm and not tip any other players off that you are working together to cheat Practicing reduces stress, which could get you caught.

    {
      "title": "Keep your team work a secret.",
      "content": "Keep your team work a secret. Working together is certainly cheating. Do not let new groups of people know that you and your friends know each other. Playing with familiar people will require you and your accomplices to be extremely subtle. Don't give any clues or hints that you might be working together. Play as if you don't know what your friends hands are. Avoid playing too well. Make some mistakes to throw other players off."

    {
      "title": "Wait for an important card to come to your hand.",
      "content": "Wait for an important card to come to your hand. Mark only cards with a high value to make the risk of cheating worthwhile.
