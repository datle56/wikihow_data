      "content": "The amount and strength of tea you brew depends on whether you want to dye your paper a lot or a little. If you’re trying to get a very dark color, use 2 tea bags in the mug at the same time. If you want a lighter color, 1 bag will be fine. Aim to make at least 1 cup (240 mL) or enough to soak the paper entirely."

      "content": "Once you stain the paper, it won't accept ink evenly, so anything you try to write or print on it will look messy. It's best to write, print, or draw whatever you'd like on the paper before you do anything else. Let the ink dry completely before staining. [1] X Research source Any paper will work for this, from plain white copy paper to heavier paper used for painting. Thicker papers might produce a lighter result that takes longer to dry. Some inks are more likely to run when they're wet, especially if you write with a washable marker or print your design on an inkjet printer. If you can, use a laser printer or waterproof ink. If you can't, try not to rub the paper when you add the tea to help minimize smudging. If you like, you can lightly crumple the paper and smooth it out. This helps make the paper look like it's been shuffled around for a number of years. [2] X Research source To make the paper look even more worn, like for an old treasure map, tear off the edges."

      "content": "A baking sheet with a raised rim will keep the tea from spilling over the sides as you're working. The baking sheet should be a little bigger than the paper you use. For instance, if you're using an 8.5 in × 11 in (22 cm × 28 cm) sheet of paper, a 9 in × 13 in (23 cm × 33 cm) baking sheet would be perfect. [3] X Research source Tea can stain your countertop or table, so protect your work surface with paper towels or old rags. If you don't have a baking sheet, lay trash bags flat on your work surface instead."

      "content": "If you want to dye the entire page of paper, gently pour or brush the tea onto the page. Let the paper soak up the tea, adding more if and when you feel it’s necessary, for 5 to 10 minutes. [4] X Research source The longer the paper soaks, the darker the stain will be. If you’re staining more than one sheet of paper, feel free to layer them on top of each other—paper, tea, paper, tea, paper, tea."

      "content": "Holding the tea bag by the top, blot it down onto the paper. Continue doing this until you've covered as much of the paper as you want. If the tea bag starts to dry out, dip it in the mug of tea to wet it again. [5] X Research source It's up to you whether you want to cover the whole page or just a few areas. Either way, don't worry about getting a perfect application. The paper will look more authentic if the yellowing is a little uneven. Experiment with ways to get the tea on the paper. Try using a paintbrush dipped in the brewed tea, a straw, or your fingers to create different effects. [6] X Research source Once one side is stained, flip the paper over and stain the other side.

      "content": "While this step isn't necessary, adding a light coating of turmeric spice or coffee grounds can help age the paper even more. Simply sprinkle a bit of one or both ingredients over the wet paper. [8] X Research source Have fun with where and how much you sprinkle onto the page! Turmeric will give a more aged, yellow look, while coffee grounds produce a burnt or “dirty” effect. Keep in mind that turmeric can stain skin, surfaces, and fabrics, so use it with caution. Loose tea leaves can also create this effect, but it may not be as dramatic or strong."

[11] X Research source [12] X Research source If you used too much liquid or the paper is very thick, you might need more time to dry. The paper is dry when the edges start to curl up."

      "content": "Depending on your project, just yellowing the paper might not give it the authentic look you're going for. If you need it to look like it's been damaged, try crumpling the paper, singeing it with a flame , or adding another layer of stains. [13] X Research source For instance, if you're making an old treasure map, you might want to crumple it up and carefully burn the edges so it will look old and worn. If you want to create holes in the paper, crumple the sheet and spritz it with a little water, then use your fingernails to make small tears. Allow the paper to air dry. If you use a lighter to singe the edges, blow out the flame as soon as the paper catches. Otherwise, the paper may quickly burn up."
