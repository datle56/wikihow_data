      "content": "Weigh the pros and cons. Consider your future goals and be clear to yourself about what your job means to you. If you are uncomfortable with the possibility that this rendezvous could end up negatively affecting your career, then it probably is not a good idea to pursue a one night stand with a coworker. [2] X Research source Pros may include: having a one night stand with a person you're familiar with because you work together, having at least one thing in common (work) with the partner for the one night stand, and the exciting, “forbidden” nature of the affair. Some cons could be: one of you could end up being fired, things could become awkward at work between the two of you, work place gossip may spread, and your reputation might be tarnished. If you do decide to date a coworker, keep it under wraps for now. Wait until you know how you feel about the whole situation and what your future plans are before sharing with other colleagues and friends.

      "content": "Don’t confuse workplace solidarity with desire or love. Do not pursue the affair in order to escape your day-to-day work struggles. Today, many people are unsatisfied with their jobs, but this does not mean you should sleep with your co-worker who happens to sympathize with you; do not confuse sympathy with love or desire. [3] X Research source Sympathy is an understanding or common feeling between people, generally in a negative context. For example, you can sympathize with someone who you do not even know because you share a common negative experience. [4] X Research source Love is an intense feeling of affection or desire, where you want to get to know a person on a more intimate level."

      "content": "Have an exit strategy. If you do decide to pursue the affair, know your game plan. Consider the worst case scenario, and have an exit strategy if things go south. Think about whether you would be willing to quit your job, and have a possible back-up in case things end up badly. [5] X Research source Before the one-night stand, you can prepare your exit strategy by doing the following: Make sure your resume, website, or work portfolio is up to date. Contact colleagues and people you know from previous jobs for references and recommendations. Look into the company’s other departments or job banks online to see if there are job openings you can apply to, or register with a temp agency."

      "content": "Ensure your coworker is interested. Don’t just ask any coworker. Ensure they are interested by reading their body language. If they are giving you signals that they may be interested in you, then proceed. These signals can be direct, like maintaining eye contact, smiling, or touching you while they speak. Or, they can be indirect, like touching their hair, neck, or face while talking to you. If they adopt closed body language, for example, turning away from you, avoiding eye contact, or any contact at all, then chances are they are not interested. If you are truly unsure if your coworker is interested, do not fret. You can try more direct contact like asking for their phone number to see how they react. Or, you could try telling them a joke to see if they laugh, and perhaps a conversation could start from there."

Once you have gauged the interest of your coworker and you have developed a basic level of camaraderie, you can attempt to bring up the topic of the one-night stand. Your opening line could go something like this: “Hey, I really like talking with you. Would you like to take this conversation back to my place?” You can be more straightforward and ask, “Would you be interested in sleeping/having sex with me?”"

If it is simply a one-night stand that you are interested in, or if you are willing to consider the possibility of something more, be upfront about it. Let the person know your feelings and how you see the relationship developing in the future. [7] X Research source An example of how you can approach this is by saying, “Before we go through with this, I would like to be clear about my feelings and expectations.” This is also the time where you should discuss with your coworker privacy issues such disclosing details with other coworkers and posting things on Facebook about the affair."

If you have to tell someone about the affair, make sure it is a friend who has no connection to your work place.
