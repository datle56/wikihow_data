      "title": "Eat the right kinds of veggies.",
      "content": "Eat the right kinds of veggies. In general, a vegetable-rich diet is a great way to decrease the pH of urine. A lower pH signifies a higher acidic level. However, there are certain vegetables that should be avoided, since they have the opposite effect of making urine more basic or alkaline (with a higher pH level). [1] X Research source Eat plenty of servings of corn, white beans, and lentils, since these are especially effective for acidifying urine. Most salads are also helpful for lowering urine pH. Avoid potatoes, lima beans, soybeans, parsnips, spinach, and dried vegetables."

      "content": "Pick up some fruit, but skip the oranges and other citrus. Many fruits are also helpful for acidifying urine. As with vegetables, however, there are some that should be avoided, particularly citrus fruits (oranges, grapefruits, lemons, etc.). Though they are acidic, they do not react with your body to lower urine pH. [2] X Research source Eat fruits such as prunes, plums and cranberries freely. Avoid cantaloupe, raisins, dates, figs, dried fruits, in addition to citrus fruits. You can also drink fruit juices (about 16 ounces a day), such as prune, plum, and cranberry, but stay away from citrus and tomato juices."

      "content": "Load up on protein and carbs. Plenty of servings from these food groups will also help acidify your urine. There are plenty of options among them, and fewer restrictions. Try having: [3] X Research source Two hearty servings of meat such as beef, poultry, or fish each day. A few eggs per day. Nuts as a snack (but not almonds or chestnuts). At least some carbs each day (white or brown rice, pasta, cereal, and bread are all good options)."

      "content": "Get some dairy each day. Products such as yogurt and buttermilk are especially helpful for raising the acidity of urine. Up to one pint of milk as well as 3 ounces of cream or cheese a day also make good choices. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Drink cola in moderation.",
      "content": "Drink cola in moderation. The inorganic (non-naturally sourced) acid added to cola makes it a good way to lower the pH level of urine. However, drinking too much cola (whether regular or diet/sugar-free) is thought to be bad for your health. Ask your doctor whether drinking cola would be a sensible way to acidify urine.

      "title": "Take betaine as a supplement or get it from natural sources.",
      "content": "Take betaine as a supplement or get it from natural sources. Betaine is an amino acid (building block of protein) available as a dietary supplement from health and nutrition stores. It is also naturally found in several foods. Taking a 650 mg supplement three times a day with meals has been shown to acidify urine. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source You can also try eating foods such as beets, broccoli, grains (wheat bran or quinoa), and spinach. These are relatively high in betaine, but you will need to eat several servings each day to get enough of the amino acid. Betaine can interact with medications. Mild side effects include diarrhea, nausea, or an upset stomach. Talk to your doctor before you start taking supplements. If you have high cholesterol or kidney disease, talk to your doctor before taking betaine. Betaine can worsen these issues."
