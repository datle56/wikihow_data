Start in the back corner of the stove top and wipe residue toward the front. Cup your other hand under the edge of the stove to catch the pieces that came loose. Work your way across the stove in back-to-front strokes until you reach the other side. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Sprinkle baking soda over the burn marks. Pour the baking soda directly out of the box onto the stove top. Use enough to completely cover the burnt area and any other stains you want to remove. Spread the baking soda flat by hand so it forms an even layer over the surface.

      "content": "Soak a microfiber towel in a dish soap solution. Fill a bowl with 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of liquid dish soap and 1 US quart (0.95 L) of warm water. Mix the solution together until it forms suds. Put a microfiber towel that’s large enough to cover the burnt area in the bowl and let it soak until it’s completely saturated. [4] X Research source You may need to use multiple towels if you need to cover the entire stove top."

      "content": "Lay the towel over the baking soda and leave it for 15 minutes. Pull the towel out of the soapy solution and wring it out loosely to remove some of the water. Unfold the towel and place it flat over the baking soda. Allow the towel to soak the baking soda for at least 15 minutes to help break down the residue. [5] X Research source Baking soda breaks down dirt and oil when it reacts with water, so it works great as a natural cleaner. You may leave the towel on the stove top for up to 30 minutes for more difficult stains or residue."

Start in the middle of the burnt area with a cloth scrubbing pad, working in circular motions out toward the edges. Apply slight pressure as you scrub to help lift the stains easier. [6] X Expert Source Susan Stocker Cleaning Guru Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. You may also use a microfiber cloth or paper towel if you don’t have a scrubbing pad."

Continue working across the surface of the stove, replacing the paper towel whenever it gets too wet or soiled. Clean off any leftover streaks with a dry paper towel. [7] X Research source If you weren’t able to clean the burnt area completely, you may need to try using baking soda again. If that doesn’t work, you may need a stronger cleaner. Spray glass cleaner on the stove and wipe it off with a paper towel if it still has a cloudy appearance."

      "content": "Work while the surface is still warm if possible. Turn off the stove as soon as you notice something burning, and set any cookware aside on a heat-safe surface. Allow the stove to cool slightly until it’s warm enough to comfortably work on without feeling too hot. Avoid letting it cool down completely since stains may set in easier or it could be more difficult to remove. [8] X Research source If the heat is too warm for you to handle, put on an oven mitt before you start working."

Keep the handle at a 45-degree angle so you don’t scratch the cooktop. Place the edge of the blade against the stain or burned residue.

Use short forward strokes as you move the scraper over the residue. Go over burnt sections multiple times until you can’t lift up any more of the burnt section. [10] X Research source Always move the scraper’s blade away from your body so you’re less likely to injure yourself. If the blade on the scraper gets dirty, clean it with a paper towel."
