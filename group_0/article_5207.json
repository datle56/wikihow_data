      "title": "Press the skin.",
      "content": "Press the skin. Press the papaya gently with your fingertips. If the fruit is ripe, your fingers should sink slightly into it, similar to a ripe avocado. A hard papaya is not ripe. A papaya with mushy spots or shriveled areas is overripe. Avoid papayas with soft flesh near the stem end."

      "title": "Check the base for mold.",
      "content": "Check the base for mold. Look at the base of the papaya, where the stem was attached. If you see any mold or mildew, do not buy this papaya."
    },
    {
      "title": "Smell the base.",
      "content": "Smell the base. Look for a papaya that has a faint, sweet scent near the stem. Avoid papayas with no smell, which are unripe. Avoid papayas with an unpleasant or strong smell, which may be old or fermented."

      "title": "Store ripe papayas in the refrigerator.",
      "content": "Store ripe papayas in the refrigerator. Keep ripe papayas in the refrigerator to slow further ripening. While they may last up to a week, they are tastiest when eaten within a day or two."

      "content": "Store unripe papayas at room temperature. If your papayas are a little green, finish ripening them at room temperature. They should ripen within a few days. Here are two ways to speed it up and avoid mushy spots: Leave them on a flat surface, with space in between fruits. Keep out of direct sun. Rotate occasionally. Keep them in a paper bag in a cool, dark location. Optionally, add a banana, apple, or avocado to hasten ripening."

    {
      "title": "Ripen completely green papayas.",
      "content": "Ripen completely green papayas. A completely green papaya may not ripen off the tree. But if you have no other options, you can give it a try. Score your green papaya with a sharp knife, drawing three lines from tip to tip. [2] X Research source Make sure the knife penetrates the skin and lightly scores the flesh underneath. Leave at room temperature to ripen within a few days. Alternatively, use your green papaya for recipes such as green papaya salad."
    },
    {
      "title": "Freeze papaya.",
      "content": "Freeze papaya. If you have more papaya than you know what to do with, freeze the extras. Follow this method exactly to minimize mushiness and flavor loss: Peel a ripe papaya. Chop off and discard the stem end. Cut in half and remove seeds. Slice the papaya and space them out on a baking sheet. Freeze for an hour or two. Transfer frozen slices to a sealed container and return to freezer. Alternatively, puree the papaya, freeze the liquid in ice cube trays, and transfer to larger container."
