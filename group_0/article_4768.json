      "title": "Create an empty plot.",
      "content": "Create an empty plot. You will be given a free plot and a default home when you join the game for the first time. To make additional plots, it will cost you Blockbux, a currency that can be earned via daily streaks, levelling up in certain jobs, or by buying them with Robux. (The currency of Roblox costing real-life USD). If you cannot make a new plot, sell your starter house or current house. For example, if your house is worth $7,000, you'll only earn $4,900 back. If you don't want to lose money, use Blockbux to create a new plot and save your house."

      "content": "Think of a theme for your house. Decide if you want it to be modern, victorian, a farmhouse, suburban, etc. Choosing a style is normally difficult unless you know exactly what you want. Some descriptions of each house are listed below if you don't know what you want: Modern-style houses have a tilted or flat roof, wooden walls, large rectangular windows, pillars, and an aesthetic color scheme. Victorian-style houses have a gable roof, wooden/brick walls, average-sized windows, shutters, pillars, and a monochromatic or vintage color scheme. Farmhouses have a gambrel roof, wooden walls, open windows, shutters, pillars, and a warm or aesthetic color scheme. Suburban houses have a gable roof, plastic (texture) or wooden walls, average-sized windows, shutters, pillars, and a monochromatic or analogous color scheme."

      "content": "Make a plan for your house. When you build, it's maybe more difficult when you don't know what you want. Decide on the following to make building easier and more fun: What rooms do you need? How many rooms? What game passes do you have? Building on a small budget, or with a large amount of money? Will you add a pool or backyard? How about a front yard? Do you intend to have a family?"

Don't spam windows everywhere, though - instead, place them in spots where they're functional and won't be blocked by stairs, bookshelves, cabinets, beds, etc. It's helpful to place them in these types of places because you'll be able to see if someone is trying to enter your house or if someone is outside or to simply allow light in and for decoration."
