      "content": "Brush when your hair is dry to avoid breakage. For most hair types, the best time to detangle is right before you get in the shower. Work out any major tangles or knots first so you don't have to brush your hair afterwards when it's wet and more vulnerable to breakage. If you need to straighten up your hair after the shower, use a wide-tooth comb and gently comb it smooth. [1] X Research source Curly hair is the exception to this rule! If your hair tangles easily, you should work out the tangles in the shower with some conditioner and a wide-tooth comb. If your hair is very tangled, work a deep conditioner into your hair. Let it sit for a few minutes, then comb out your hair in the shower with a wide-toothed comb. [2] X Expert Source Ashleigh Grounds Makeup Artist & Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 22 April 2020."

      "content": "Avoid over-brushing your hair to keep it healthy. Although many women used to aim for 100 brushstrokes a day, this can actually stress the outer layer of your hair, making it look dry and dull. Limit your brushing to once a day. Instead of following a set number, just brush until you've thoroughly worked out all of the tangles and distributed natural oils through the strands."

      "content": "Spritz some hairspray on your brush to avoid creating static. Brushing dry hair can sometimes create static electricity, which means flyaways and frizz. To prevent this, apply 2-3 spritzes of hairspray over the surface of the brush before you start brushing. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Finish with a few brushes from roots to tips for extra shine. Brushing down from the roots will distribute the scalp's natural oils throughout the hair, giving it a healthy, shiny look. These oils will strengthen your hair, and they won't look greasy or weigh hair down. This is also spreads the natural oils out so they don't stay concentrated at the roots, making your hair look neater and less greasy."

      "title": "Work in a detangler, leave-in conditioner, or hair oil to loosen up tangles.",
      "content": "Work in a detangler, leave-in conditioner, or hair oil to loosen up tangles. If you know that your hair tends to tangle easily, start by working a product through your strands. Spray the product directly onto your hair, or pour a small amount of product into your hands and finger-comb it through your hair. Detangler is usually best for fine-textured hair. Use 3-4 spritzes all over your head to loosen up tangles. Leave-in conditioners and cream conditioners work well with coarse, medium-thick, or curly hair. Use somewhere between a dime- or quarter-sized amount, depending on the length and thickness of your hair. If you choose a hair oil, such as argan oil or macadamia oil, use between 2-5 drops. Short, thin hair will only require 2 drops, while long, coarse hair may need 4-5. [4] X Research source"

[5] X Expert Source Ashleigh Grounds Makeup Artist & Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 22 April 2020. Use a wide-toothed comb to comb in downward motions. This lets you tackle knots and tangles without dragging them all down toward the tips, which can damage the hair follicle. If you have curly hair, use a wide-toothed comb and your fingers to detangle curly hair, either while your hair is damp or while you're in the shower, after you've applied conditioner. This will let the curl pass through without interrupting the natural curl pattern. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Brush or comb at tangles with light, gentle strokes. Don't try to pull or force out the tangle, since this will only put stress on your hair. Instead, isolate the tangled section and hold it in your hand, then gently run your brush or comb over it until it loosens up. Keep working at it until the tangle is gone and you can easily run your brush through the hair. [7] X Research source If the tangle isn't coming out, try spraying on a few more spritzes of leave-in conditioner or detangler."

      "content": "Pick a brush made with quality materials. Never use a cheap brush! Low-quality plastic or metal bristles can snag and rip damaged hair at its weakest points. Instead, look for quality brushes made with boar's bristle or gentle synthetic fibers. If you invest in a high-quality brush and take good care of it, it will last for years.

The bristles are gentle on your hair and can work on knots without ripping them out. They also promote your hair's health by distributing oils throughout the hair shaft, creating a polished, neat look. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a mixed-bristle brush for medium-thick hair. The combination of boar bristle and synthetic bristle on these brushes is stiff enough to work out tangles, but gentle enough to avoid pulling out strands. The boar bristles also simultaneously provide shine by distributing your hair's natural oils. [10] X Research source This kind of brush is also great for blow-drying and styling."

      "content": "Go for a brush with sparse nylon bristles if you have thick, coarse hair. The synthetic bristles will glide through your thick hair more easily than boar bristle. Look for a brush with sparse, widely spaced bristles that can work through dense sections of hair without disrupting its natural shape. If you're looking in beauty stores or salons, this option may be labeled as a “Mason Pearson” brush. Nylon-bristled brushes are also a cheaper alternative to boar bristle."

You may need to shop around before finding a brush that works best with your unique hair. Overall, look for a brush made with gentle bristles and a curved design that allows you to tackle thick, curly sections of hair. [11] X Research source For example, you could use a Denman brush, which has flexible teeth and captures hair as it sheds. [12] X Research source"

This brush is perfect for blow-drying and brushing down short hair into a neat style without making it poofy. The spaces, or “vents,” in the brush allow hot air to reach your hair more easily and speed up the styling process.

Letting it soak, rather than scrubbing it clean, is gentler on the bristles. [16] X Research source Set a timer so you don't forget about your brush and leave it soaking for too long! Wooden brushes especially shouldn't be left soaking longer than 3-4 minutes."

This will let any trapped water drain and leave your brush feeling clean and brand-new for the next time you use it! You can also leave your brush sitting in the sun to naturally speed up the drying process."
