      "content": "Use the weight of your body to build muscle anywhere. Kids should not just take an adult’s workout plan and scale it down. Not only can this be dangerous, kids have an energy level and natural flexibility that allows them to do a variety of exercises without needed weights. Perhaps more importantly, these exercises are easily turned into games or small competitions, making them much more fun to get through then a trip to the gym. Hops, skips , and lunges all use your body weight to train your leg muscles. Climbing, whether at a rock wall on the playground, is a great workout for your arm and leg muscles. Traverse monkey bars to do modified \"pull-ups,\" or offer to push your friends on the swings to build arm muscle. You can also wear a weighted workout belt to increase the difficulty of your exercises. However, check with an adult first to make sure you’re using the right amount of weight for your body—too much weight can hurt or damage your muscles (which is the opposite of what you're trying to do!).

Push your entire body up with both hands until your elbows are barely bent, then lower yourself slowly down towards the ground. When you are about 6 inches from the floor, push up again and repeat. Try to get 10 in a row, then rest for 1-2 minutes and try again. Keep your butt down, even with your shoulders. Keep your back straight. Your hands should be shoulder-width apart. However, the further apart they get the more you work out your chest muscles. The closer together your hands are the more you’ll work your arm muscles."

Imagine them as large rubber bands—as you pull on them, they resist you and want to snap back together, making them harder and harder to pull on. Some exercises to try include: Stand on one end of the band with your right foot and hold the other in your right hand. Keep your elbow in the same place and pull the band up towards your chest with your hand. Do ten, then switch hands. Hold an end of the band in each hand. Stand on the center of the band with both feet, legs shoulder-width apart. With your arms wide apart (like you were surrendering), push the ends of the band up to the sky. Keep your knees slightly bent. Hold an end of the band in your right hand and step on the other end with your left foot. Keeping your back straight, twist at the hips towards you left foot as if you were trying to touch your toes with your right hand. Twist back out and pull the band high up to the right side of your body. Think of doing a classic “disco dance,” or pulling the cord to start a lawnmower."
