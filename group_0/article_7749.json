      "title": "Wash your hands with soapy water.",
      "content": "Wash your hands with soapy water. If you have dirt, lotion, or natural oils on your hands, you'll transfer them to your eyeglass frames. The tiny dirt particles can even scratch your frames and lenses. To prevent this, wash your hands thoroughly with soapy water for at least 20 seconds. Then, rinse your hands and dry them. [1] X Research source Don't use hand sanitizer instead of soapy water. The water rinses away grit and dirt particles from your hands. Choose a non-moisturizing soap to wash your hands. Moisturizing soaps contain oils or lotions that can get on your frames and lenses."

      "content": "Rinse your glasses with warm water and put a drop of dish soap on each lens. Running the glasses under water removes dust from the surface of the frames and the lenses. Once the eyeglasses are wet, squirt a single drop of basic liquid dish soap on each lens. Avoid using a moisturizing dish soap, which could leave a greasy or oily residue."

      "title": "Use your fingers to rub the soap over the lenses and frames.",
      "content": "Use your fingers to rub the soap over the lenses and frames. Gently massage the soap over the frames to create a lather. Rub this lather across both sides of the frames. Spend a little extra time cleaning around the bridge of the nose since it might be greasy. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Run warm water over the eyeglasses.",
      "content": "Run warm water over the eyeglasses. Hold the frames under warm running water to rinse off the soap and dirt. Remember to fold in the sides of the frames to rinse the hinges. [3] X Research source Rinse your hands well while you do this so you don't get the clean frames soapy again."

      "title": "Dry the eyeglasses with a clean cloth.",
      "content": "Dry the eyeglasses with a clean cloth. Take a soft fabric or microfiber cloth and rub it gently over the frames and lenses. Avoid using a tissue or paper towel since these could scratch your eyeglasses or leave tiny fibers behind. [4] X Research source Clean your eyeglasses frames every time you clean your glasses. Try to do this at least once a day."

      "title": "Dip a toothbrush in soapy water.",
      "content": "Dip a toothbrush in soapy water. To make a soapy solution, squirt a drop of basic liquid soap into a small bowl or dish. Pour in about 1 ‚ÅÑ 4 cup (59 ml) of warm water and swish an old toothbrush in the container to make a sudsy solution. Try to use a brush that has soft bristles since these are gentler on the nose pads."

      "title": "Brush the soapy toothbrush all over the nose pads to loosen dirt and grime.",
      "content": "Brush the soapy toothbrush all over the nose pads to loosen dirt and grime. Gently rub the toothbrush on both sides of each nose pad. If your nose pads have metal wires connecting them to the bridge of the frame, take extra care to scrub them. Don't rub the toothbrush over your eyeglass lenses because the brush would scratch them."

      "title": "Rinse the nose pads with water and dry them completely with a soft cloth.",
      "content": "Rinse the nose pads with water and dry them completely with a soft cloth. Hold the nose pads under warm running water to rinse off the soap and gunk. Then, pat the nose pads dry with a clean cloth. Let the nose pads air dry before you wear your frames so you don't trap moisture between the pads and your nose. To speed up the drying time, spray condensed air on the pads until they're dry."

      "content": "Get the frames professionally cleaned if you can't get the nose pads clean. If you can't seem to completely remove the green buildup or if the nose pads have an unpleasant smell even after you've cleaned them, take them in to your optometrist for a professional cleaning. [5] X Research source Most optometrist offices won't charge for a quick cleaning, which they can usually do while you wait in the lobby."

Keep moving the cloth so you coat the front, back, and sides of the frames. [7] X Research source If your frames were covered with a milky white film, which is normal wear, you may need to apply extra polish or oil until the white discoloration disappears."

      "title": "Let the polish or oil sit on the frames for 2 to 3 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the polish or oil sit on the frames for 2 to 3 minutes. This gives the polish or oil a chance to work deep into the plastic so the polish lasts longer. If you used lubricating multipurpose oil, it can seep into the hinges, which makes them bend easier. [8] X Research source If you're in a hurry, you can skip this step but your frames might not have as high of a shine."

      "content": "Wipe the frames with a dry cloth to remove residue. Take a completely clean soft cloth and gently rub it over the entire surface of the frames. Keep rubbing to pick up excess oil or polish so it doesn't come off on your hands when you touch your frames.
