      "title": "Choose to buy a USDA prime grade roast for the best quality.",
      "content": "Choose to buy a USDA prime grade roast for the best quality. As one of the two standing rib roast grades, USDA prime is the highest end meat and the most expensive. Order a USDA prime grade roast if you want a truly tender cut of beef with the highest degree of marbling, flavor, and maturity. Although prices will vary, prime grade roasts typically cost around 15 dollars per pound. [1] X Research source Only 2% of all beef products are USDA prime grade beef, so speaking with your butcher before entering the shop will be important to give the establishment time to prepare or order the roast for you. When talking with the butcher, make it clear that you are searching for prime grade beef, as many butchers and supermarket clerks will assume you are looking for choice grade if you simply ask for a prime roast. [2] X Research source Prime grade roasts can be difficult to find, so you will most likely need to contact a butcher rather than a supermarket."

      "title": "Decide on a choice roast to save some money.",
      "content": "Decide on a choice roast to save some money. Although choice roasts are still very juicy and flavorful, they are a step down, both in quality and expense, from prime grade beef. Ask the butcher if they have choice meat available and compare the prices of this roast to the shop’s prime grade roasts. Choice grade standing rib roasts typically cost 10 dollars per pound. [3] X Research source Choice grade roasts will be easier to find then prime grade roasts and should be available at most supermarkets. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose a roast from the small end of the ribs.",
      "content": "Choose a roast from the small end of the ribs. The meat on the small end of the ribs come from the last three ribs on the back end of the rib cage, and contain the least amount of fat. Typically, this end of the ribcage is the most flavorful and tender. Purchase the meat from this end if you want to avoid fat in your standing rib roast. [5] X Research source If you are buying a full roast, this distinction won’t have to be made."
    },
    {
      "title": "Purchase meat from the long end of the rib cage.",
      "content": "Purchase meat from the long end of the rib cage. The long end of the rib cage is defined as the first four ribs and contains more fat that the short end. Buy meat from the long end of the rib cage if you are searching for a fattier cut of beef. [6] X Research source Although there is more fat at the long end of the rib cage, the meat will still be very tender and flavorful."
    },
    {
      "title": "Decide between a bone-in roast or a boneless roast.",
      "content": "Decide between a bone-in roast or a boneless roast. Purchasing a bone-in standing rib roast will provide more juice and flavor, but purchasing a boneless roast will be cheaper. A classic standing rib roast is prepared with the bones still in the meat, so if you are presenting the roast on a table for everyone to see, it is best to buy a bone-in roast. [7] X Research source You can also ask the butcher to remove the meat and use string to tie it to the bone, which will help when preparing and carving the roast after cooking it."

      "title": "Locate and contact a specialty butcher for a prime grade roast.",
      "content": "Locate and contact a specialty butcher for a prime grade roast. Prime grade roasts can be difficult to find and are rarely found in a local supermarket. Search online for local, specialty butchers near you so that you can make a special request and order your prime grade beef. By not relying on chance at the supermarket and contacting a butcher directly, you will save time. [8] X Research source If there is more than one butcher in your area, compare reviews online to decide which shop will accommodate your needs best. Speaking with a butcher over the phone will give them time to prepare or order a standing rib roast for you."

    {
      "title": "Visit your local supermarket to purchase a choice grade roast.",
      "content": "Visit your local supermarket to purchase a choice grade roast. As choice grade standing rib roasts are more popular, you should be able to purchase a roast directly from the supermarket’s meat section. Speak with the meat department staff and let them know you are looking for choice grade beef. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Decide how much meat you will need to buy.",
      "content": "Decide how much meat you will need to buy. Most butchers will tell you to designate one pound of prime rib per person you are cooking for, with each rib of a standing roast carrying between two to three pounds. Therefore, if you are feeding a group of eight people, purchase a four ribbed roast, dividing the number of people by two. [10] X Research source Never buy less than three ribs at one time, as cooking a standing rib roast with less than three ribs will cause the beef to cook too quickly, and the roast will not be as flavorful. For leftover standing rib roasts, seal the meat in an airtight container and refrigerate the roast."

    {
      "title": "Order the roast in advance if you are buying prime grade.",
      "content": "Order the roast in advance if you are buying prime grade. Because prime grade meat is so rare and difficult to find, it is good to give your butcher time to order the meat. Call the butcher two weeks in advance, informing them of your desired pickup date, and inquire as to how long the order will take. [11] X Research source If you are purchasing choice grade meat, you will not have to order ahead, as these roasts are more popular."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid prepackaged standing rib roasts.",
      "content": "Avoid prepackaged standing rib roasts. Although prepackaged roasts will still be fresh and flavorful, it is always best to purchase a high quality roast fresh from the butcher. Do not try to find a prepackaged roast in a store aisle. This will allow you to examine the roast properly, communicate your needs to the butcher, and ensure that the roast is as fresh as possible.
