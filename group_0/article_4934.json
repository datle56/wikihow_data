      "title": "Know rabbits need to run.",
      "content": "Know rabbits need to run. Rabbits need a great deal of exercise because they are prey animals; in the wild, they must say in shape to stay alive. They will need to run and jump for at least two to three hours a day. [1] X Research source If your rabbit has the run of the house, then you don't necessarily need a run unless you feel the need to take your rabbit outside."

    {
      "title": "Understand the purpose of a run.",
      "content": "Understand the purpose of a run. A run provides a great place for your rabbit to exercise, keeping them contained. However, it also protects them from predators. Runs are enclosed on all sides and the top, so most predators cannot get in."
    },
    {
      "title": "Establish a good size.",
      "content": "Establish a good size. Any cage that you keep your rabbit in for extended periods of time should be at least 2 feet by 4 feet, at least for medium rabbits or smaller. However, if you can, you should make the run bigger for your rabbit.

      "title": "Include a hutch.",
      "content": "Include a hutch. If you plan on leaving your bunnies outside, they also need a shelter, known as a hutch. A run is great for exercise, but a hutch is the bunnies' home."
    },
    {
      "title": "Always pick a shady location.",
      "content": "Always pick a shady location. If you don't have a shady location available to you, you should cover your hutch with more than just wire. You can use anything that will provide shade, even a tarp."
    },
    {
      "title": "Gather your materials.",
      "content": "Gather your materials. You'll need a cage kit, which comes with wire modular pieces. You'll also need some zip ties or hinges or a hammer and nails, available at most home improvement stores. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Attach two pieces together.",
      "content": "Attach two pieces together. Place two pieces next to each other. Use two zip ties, one at the top and one at the bottom, to bring the two pieces together. If the pieces aren't very high, you may need to make another layer on top. Use the zip ties to add the top layer as well. You want it to be 3 to 4 feet high. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Continue moving around the pen.",
      "content": "Continue moving around the pen. Continue adding pieces to the pen, until you have one that is an appropriate size. For instance, if your pieces are 2 feet wide, you'll need at least two pieces on each side and one piece on each end. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Create a door.",
      "content": "Create a door. The easiest way to create a door is to attach one panel only one side. That way, it will swing out, up, or down. You can keep it closed with a clip or clothespin. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider replacing the zip ties.",
      "content": "Consider replacing the zip ties. You may want to replace the zip ties with a hinge or metal j clips, which are more secure and more visually appealing. The zip ties can be helpful for keeping the cage in place while you work. If you leave the zip ties, make sure they are facing outward. Your bunny is likely to chew on anything inside the cage, so point the ends of the zip ties outward. Make sure you pull them tight and clip off any excess."

      "content": "Build a floor for a more permanent run. If you plan on leaving bunnies in this run unsupervised outside, then you need to add wire pieces across the floor, too. Rabbits can burrow out from under the cage. [8] X Research source However, you need a more solid floor for your rabbit's feet, so use either wood or a very thick layer of straw on the bottom. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Indoors, you can use utility mats to cover the bottom instead of wire, as they won't burrow into your floor.

      "title": "Design your run first.",
      "content": "Design your run first. Aviary panels come in several styles. Basically, they are made with a wood frame and wire. Some are wire all along the side, while other panels have door openings or are solid wood on one end. Generally, they are long enough that you can build a pen you can walk into. However, you can also turn them so the length runs along the ground, creating a much shorter pen. For instance, you could use the kind of panels that are solid on one end to create an impromptu hutch for your rabbit."

      "title": "Buy the appropriate panels.",
      "content": "Buy the appropriate panels. Once you've decided on a design, buy panels to match your design. You should be able to find these at farm and tractor stores or home improvement stores. They were originally designed for birds, which is why farm and tractor stores may have them."

    {
      "title": "Decide on a location.",
      "content": "Decide on a location. If you put the aviary panels over concrete, you do not need to build in a mesh floor. However, if you are building it over grass or dirt, you will need to add in wire underneath the grass."

    {
      "title": "Add wire if needed.",
      "content": "Add wire if needed. Use wire meant to keep gophers out, referred to as \"gopher wire.\" You can lay it out under the cage. You can hammer in ground staples to keep it in place. Normally, this wire would go under the sod, but as that's not usually an option with rabbit hutches, you can add it on top of the grass. However, be sure to cover the bottom of the cage with plenty of fresh straw to protect your rabbit's feet and to change the straw out regularly. Be sure to push the wire ends into the ground, so no one gets scratched on them. You can also put in a wood floor, if you prefer."

      "title": "Join the panels.",
      "content": "Join the panels. You can use screws or nails to join the panels, just as you would any wooden frame. If you use screws, you can take it apart later and make it into a new configuration if you would like. [11] X Research source htpps://www.therabbithouse.com/outdoor/aviary-panels.asp Another simple option is brackets and screws. [12] X Research source To join using brackets and screws, lay the panels flat on the floor. Make sure they are as close as possible. Lay out 6 brackets along the seam. Use a drill to pre-drill holes where the screws will go. Drill in the screws. For corners, use corner brackets. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Don't forget to use a door. The easiest way to leave a door on your hutch is to use an aviary panel with a door already installed. However, you can also use hinges instead of brackets on one of the panels, so that it swings out. The hinges are installed basically the same way as the brackets; you'll also need to add a latch for your door."
