      "content": "Make your hamster’s cage safer. As much as your hamster likes to run and play, he may play a little too hard and injure himself in his cage. You will need to ‘injury-proof’ your hamster’s cage to prevent the risk of fall or injury. For example, if the cage is multi-level, make sure your hamster has a sturdy ladder or ramp so he can get from one level to the other without falling. If the cage already has wire ramps or ladders, cover them with a solid material, such as cardboard, laminate flooring, or coroplast"

      "content": "Keep a close eye on your hamster during playtime. Playtime outside of the cage is important for your hamster. However, he could seriously injure himself when he is outside of his cage. If you have him in his hamster ball, keep him as far away from the stairs as possible! A tumble down the stairs could cause injury serious enough to lead to shock. Rolling down the stairs in the hamster ball could also knock your hamster unconscious. If he is unconscious and in shock, he will need immediate veterinary care. When your hamster is in the hamster ball, keep him in an enclosed room so there is no chance he could roll near or down the stairs. Another possible solution is to lay a hula-hoop on the ground, and have the hamster ball roll around in that. If your hamster is allowed to run free in the room, make sure he does not climb on any furniture. He could suffer a serious injury if he jumps or falls from the furniture."

If you have small children, watch them as they handle your hamster. That way, if they are handling him too roughly, you can intervene and place the hamster safely back in his cage. You could also turn this time into a teaching moment on how to properly hold a hamster ."
