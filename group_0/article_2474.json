      "content": "The desire for kissing is totally natural and normal. Throughout history, people of all cultures and backgrounds have engaged in kissing to express affection, fulfill romantic desire, and feel emotionally connected to others. [4] X Research source There are also biological reasons people desire kissing—it releases mood-boosting endorphins like oxytocin, serotonin, and dopamine, and it lowers the stress hormone cortisol. [5] X Research source In other words, kissing makes you feel good and it satisfies a deep human need to be close to others, which could be the driving force behind basorexia. And basorexia is a super common experience and feeling. Most people have probably felt something similar to this at some point in their lives."

      "content": "No, “basorexia” isn't a psychological disorder. Basorexia is not a clinical disorder, and a desire for kissing is a normal emotion that many people experience. [6] X Research source However, some people have speculated that intense basorexia could be a coping mechanism for stress or anxiety, since kissing releases hormones that improve your mood. Others have suggested it could be a way to make up for unmet emotional needs, since kissing increases feelings of connection and intimacy with others. [7] X Research source It's important to recognize that just because you have a big desire to kiss or be kissed, that doesn't mean that that will happen. Consent is an absolute must, and so while you should definitely feel free to put yourself out there and see if you can connect with someone via kissing, there's always a chance that you'll end up having to cope with the desire internally on your own. The feelings of basorexia are 100% natural and nothing to feel ashamed of, but at the same time, your feelings are your own responsibility at the end of the day."

      "content": "If you’re single, focus on reducing stress and distracting yourself. If you’ve been having obsessive thoughts about kissing, you might want to try out some techniques that combat maladaptive daydreaming or rumination. Maladaptive daydreaming, rumination, and basorexia are all different things, but since they involve excessive fantasizing and/or unwanted thoughts, they may respond to similar coping techniques. [8] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Here are some suggestions: Ground yourself in the present. When you catch yourself daydreaming or thinking about kissing, try to bring your focus back to the present. Deep breathing exercises or mindful meditation can be helpful tools for this. Do an activity to distract yourself. Getting up and doing something active, going to hang out with friends, or participating in a fun hobby can all help you break the cycle when you start obsessing about kissing. [9] X Research source Try to reduce stress as much as you can. When you’re less stressed, you may be less likely to deal with obsessive thoughts or excessive daydreaming.

      "content": "If you're in a relationship, explore other forms of affection and communication. Since basorexia isn’t a psychological disorder, there aren’t necessarily any actions you need to take to address it. However, if you feel like your desire for kissing is excessive, engaging in other forms of physical affection may help satisfy that urge. This could include things like hand holding, hugging, or snuggling. [11] X Research source Talking to your romantic partner and getting on the same page about your desires can also help."

      "content": "Cultural norms about kissing can also affect basorexia. Some cultures have more conservative ideas about kissing, reserving the action for romantic partners. Other cultures are more open about kissing and even use it as a form of friendly greeting. In Spain, Italy, and France, for example, it’s seen as normal and expected to kiss someone on both cheeks to say “hello.” [12] X Research source Although there isn’t definitive research on this, it’s possible that living in a culture where kissing is more restricted could lead to a more intense desire to experience it, which could also bring some feelings of guilt or shame.
