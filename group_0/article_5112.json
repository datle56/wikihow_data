Call your veterinarian, and ask her to guide you with next steps. [1] X Research source If your pet is still alive, take her to an emergency vet in the area. The best place to feel for a pulse on a dog or cat is the inner thigh, up where the leg meets the body. You're looking for the femoral artery. Use two fingers (not a thumb) to check for a pulse. You may have a hard time feeling it on a cat. [2] X Research source If you feel a pulse, have someone time 15 seconds while you count beats. Multiple by 4, and you have the beats per minute. Your vet will likely want to know the beats per minute if possible."

If you need to keep the body in your home, you can take a few steps to keep it from decomposing. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source You can wrap the body and put in the refrigerator, though you still want to take action within a day. You can also place the body in the freezer, which will keep it from decomposing longer. If you can't use either of these options, leave the body unwrapped on concrete, as it will draw the heat out."

      "title": "Notify people.",
      "content": "Notify people. In your grief, you may not remember everyone you need to tell. For instance, it's important to notify kids who were away when the pet died. You also need to find a way to tell your children if you have young ones in your home. [4] X Research source When telling kids, try not to use euphemisms. For instance, saying the pet has been \"put to sleep\" can be confusing. Tell the child that the pet died, and explain in simple terms what that means. For instance, you could say, \"Honey, I have something sad to tell you. Our pet Kitty died today. That means that she stopped breathing and her body stopped moving. She won't be coming back to life with us.\" [5] X Research source It can help to let the child see the body, though it's okay to soften the blow by covering the body partially with a blanket or putting a beloved toy nearby. Answer any questions your child has as honestly and directly as you can, though you can say you don't know. Also, be prepared for the ways your child's grief will appear. Some children will want to write letters or leave flowers. Others may want some alone time, while still others may need more cuddles. Make sure to reach out to others for your own support as well. If you’re struggling with grief, talk to loved ones about how you’re feeling and anything that you need.

You can also look under \"pet cemeteries\" in your local area. Another option besides burial is cremation.

[8] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Be aware that you may have the option of individual cremation (where you just get your pet's remains back) or group cremation (where your pet is cremated with other animals).

In addition, you should pick a location downhill from a well and at least 50 feet away, though 100 feet is better, as well as 50 feet from other types of water such as ponds, rivers, and drainage ditches. Try to pick a place that is not shallow to the bedrock below (meaning, see if you hit rock below where you are digging), as when the pet is decomposing, it can leach into the water.

You should only allow your pet to decompose into the earth if your pet died of natural causes.

Keep in mind that you may need to go deeper depending on the size of your box. Make sure to make the hole wide enough and long enough to fit the box you put your pet in. If you want your pet to decompose into the earth, you should bury the pet in a shallower grave. The hole needs to be about a foot and a half deep, making sure that you have about a foot between the top and the bedrock below. Make sure you have a foot and a half of soil above the pet, even if you have to mound it up a bit. Making the grave shallower gives the body a chance to decompose. If you're having trouble digging in your soil, you can \"bury\" your pet above ground. Simply lay your pet out, and then cover it with soil in a mound equal to 18 inches. [12] X Research source"
