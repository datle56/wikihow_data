Instead, only apply for those contracts which your business can fulfill. If you are awarded a contract and fail, you probably won’t get another chance. Ideally, you should start small. The government will assess your past performance on contracts, so make sure you choose something manageable at first. For example, you can bid on projects worth $3,000 or less. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Identify the type of bid solicitation. When the government wants services, they put together a solicitation, called a bid package. You should identify the different types of solicitations so that you can make sure your bid is responsive. Generally, there are four types: Request for Quotation (RFQ). When contracts are worth less than $150,000, the government will typically request information and a quote. Your response is not considered an actual offer. Request for Proposal (RFP). You will be told what the government needs and what information you should include in your proposal. An RFP ultimately ends in a contract. Invitation for Bid (IFB). An IFB is also called a “sealed bid solicitation.” You submit an IFB without much discussion with the government office. Price is usually the most important factor in awarding the contract. Request for Information (RFI). The government might reach out to you directly. In this situation, the RFI is used to determine whether you are interested in a particular contract."

[6] X Research source Ask the government agency to go over what you did wrong and how you can improve in the future. Only request debriefing if you are really serious about becoming a government contractor. A debriefing session is not the time to get defensive or to challenge the government on why they rejected you. If you think you might get defensive, you should skip the debriefing process altogether."
