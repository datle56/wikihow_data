      "content": "Convert figures to their SI values. The International System of Units (SI) unit of mass is the kilogram, and the SI unit of acceleration is m/s 2 (meters per second squared). So when mass and acceleration are expressed in their SI units, we get the force in its SI units which is N (Newtons). [3] X Research source As an example, if the mass of the object is given to be 3 pounds, you'll need to convert those pounds to kilograms . 3 pounds make 1.36 kg, so the mass of the object is 1.36 kg."

One pound is equal to .453 kg, [5] X Research source so you'll need to multiply that value by your 8 pounds to determine the mass. Multiply your new value for the mass (3.62 kg) by your acceleration value (7 m/s 2 )."
