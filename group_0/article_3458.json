      "title": "Make intimacy a priority.",
      "content": "Make intimacy a priority. It's easy to get caught up in our lives and feel too busy for intimacy, especially if we've been with someone for a while. However, relationships that leave one or both parties feeling unsatisfied just can't last. [1] X Expert Source Allen Wagner, MFT, MA Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 6 March 2019. Make time for intimacy to keep the fires burning strong. [2] X Research source If you have kids that are a bit older, tell them that you've both had a very long day and you're tired so you're going to go to bed. If you have younger kids, get them into bed at a fairly early hour. Avoid only being intimate very sporadically, like when you take trips or set aside a \"date night\" once or twice a year. This is not good for a relationship."

    {
      "title": "Emphasize consent.",
      "content": "Emphasize consent. Make sure that everyone involved is happy and giving full consent before getting too serious. This is important for both men and women. If your partner is drunk enough to see giant purple mole-rats, you should not be getting intimate. Get a \"yes\", not an \"I guess\". [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Ditch the cultural hype.",
      "content": "Ditch the cultural hype. Don't expect sex to be like it is in porn and don't expect your partner to look like a supermodel. And especially don't expect yourself to look one way or another. This will make you and them insecure and uncomfortable, reducing pleasure for everyone involved."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do some research.",
      "content": "Do some research. If you want to find out more about what feels good to your partner, do some research. Read romance novels written for that gender or read advice columns online to find out ideas of what feels good and what doesn't."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be appealing.",
      "content": "Be appealing. We don't mean lose weight or get bigger (insert body part): your partner is with you because they already think you're sexy. When we say be appealing, we mean have good hygiene. Wear decent clothes. That kind of thing. Weight is subjective but very few people are turned on by the smell of week-old sweat."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch your partner's reactions.",
      "content": "Watch your partner's reactions. Watch how your partner reacts to things. If they respond well to something you do, do more of that! If they seem uncomfortable, stop! Look for the subtle cues they give you, like putting your hand in a certain place. You can even try mimicking the things that they do to you as oftentimes it is their way of asking for something in particular."

    {
      "title": "Slow down.",
      "content": "Slow down. Slow down everything about your intimate relationship. Build up to intimate acts slowly, by embracing the subtle art of The Make Out and other types of foreplay. You should slow down the act itself too! This extends and heightens pleasure for all involved parties. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Be unselfish.",
      "content": "Be unselfish. You do, of course, also need to get enjoyment from your intimate relationship, but focusing on your partner and making sure that they are satisfied and feeling amazing will go a long way towards improving the relationship and making them want to reciprocate.

      "content": "Explore your partner. We all know the few basic places our partners like to be touched, but don't forget to explore their whole body! People are sensitive in all sorts of places and to all sorts of different degrees. You may find that your partner goes nuts if you kiss them on the back of their knee! You never know!"

      "content": "Switch things up. Don't let your intimate relationship become a routine. Avoid using the same positioning or the same location or the same time of day. Making a routine takes away a lot of the romance and enjoyment for everyone. Break out of your mold and switch things up every now and again to keep your romance alive.

      "content": "Be open minded. Human sexuality, like most things with humans, is incredibly complex. Everyone is different. And because we are all different, the range for what is actually normal is incredibly large. Never close your mind to anything, because you may be surprised at how much you or your partner enjoy something you never considered before. Try things, and if you enjoy them, keep doing it!"

      "title": "Don't treat anything like a button.",
      "content": "Don't treat anything like a button. Really repetitive motions do not work in intimate situations. Her genitals are not an elevator button that you can just push repeatedly and hope to get results. The same can be said of her nipples. Think circular movements and variations in pressure, direction, and motion, and you'll be fine."

      "title": "Understand what pleasures women.",
      "content": "Understand what pleasures women. Men get stimulated with sensations on their penis, so you'd think that women would be stimulated by sensations in their vagina, right? Unfortunately, it's not that simple! Most women don't get a whole lot of pleasure from just vaginal stimulation alone. Wikipedia the clitoris."

      "content": "Be gentle, unless you're told otherwise. When you're dealing with sensitive parts, be gentle unless she specifically asks otherwise. Nibbles and pinches here and there can feel amazing for some women but not all, and you don't want to get smacked."

But did you know that she likes to hear you make sounds too (for the same reasons)? Maybe not so much with the grunting, cause it can get a little cave-manish, but say things like, \"Oh, that feels so good...\" [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Turn up the heat.",
      "content": "Turn up the heat. No, really, turn up the heat. Women have a harder time feeling as much pleasure when they are cold, studies have shown. Get under a toasty warm blanket or crank up the thermostat if she really seems to be having trouble and you've tried everything else."

      "title": "Don't hold him hostage.",
      "content": "Don't hold him hostage. Don't use your intimate relationship as a weapon in arguments and don't ever actually promise sex and then not deliver. This is cruel. It would be cruel if he did it to you and it's cruel if you do it to him. This also doesn't work in your favor, since it teaches him to associate sex with negative emotions and disappointment, which will really hurt your relationship long-term."

      "title": "Keep moving.",
      "content": "Keep moving. The major complaint that guys have about women is the classic \"dead fish\". Get yourself moving when you're being intimate. Guys need less work, but that doesn't mean they need no work. Keep your hands and legs moving, caressing him, when you're together and occasionally take some initiative and take control of the situation. You'll blow his mind. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Go all-natural.",
      "content": "Go all-natural. Take off all the makeup and go easy on the hairspray. Guys are attracted to your softness and they'll be much more turned on if they can get their fingers through you hair or kiss your cheek without getting a mouthful of powder. Gross! Ramp up the softness even further by shaving and moisturizing. We recommend a long-term Bag Balm regimen."

      "title": "Let him try some fantasies.",
      "content": "Let him try some fantasies. Guys watch porn. Almost all of them. And they think about sex a lot. This is just a fact of life. Because they do this, they get ideas, fantasies of things that really turn them on. If you want to make your man a happy man, let him act out some of those fantasies every now and again. Wear a school uniform. Play doctor. Talk to him about what he fantasizes about and then make it a reality. He'll never know what hit him. Just be sure that whatever fantasies you decide to play out, you're comfortable with what you're doing. Everyone should be happy! You can be nonjudgmental and still say no to a request. These things are not mutually exclusive. Reader Poll: We asked 745 wikiHow readers and 60% agreed that making sure both partners are comfortable is the most important part of role-playing and exploring fantasies. [Take Poll]"

Make sure to listen and see how the other person is responding to your attention at every step--the object here is to find the correct tempo that the other person is capable of hearing, seeing and fully feeling your expressions of affection.

If you really love the one you're with, and you watch them closely enough, you'll come to realize that they have certain habits and ticks that you will come to adore.
