      "title": "Ask her friends to make sure she is available to go with you.",
      "content": "Ask her friends to make sure she is available to go with you. Make sure she doesn’t already have a date, first and foremost. Ask her friends if they think she would be interested in going with you if you aren’t sure. [1] X Research source Once you’ve decided for sure who you are going to ask, then you can also use her friends as resources to decide how to ask her. Ask them questions about her and run ideas past her to decide how to ask her to prom."
    },
    {
      "title": "Decide how you are going to ask her based on her personality.",
      "content": "Decide how you are going to ask her based on her personality. Not everyone wants a big, fancy, public promposal. Think about the girl’s personality to decide if you are going to ask her in a romantic, dramatic, creative, funny, or straightforward way. [2] X Research source For instance, if she is shy and not super outgoing, you might want to make it a more straightforward promposal. If she’s extremely outgoing and always the center of attention, then you might want to get creative and come up with a big public promposal."

    {
      "title": "Personalize your promposal with inside jokes, references, or things she loves.",
      "content": "Personalize your promposal with inside jokes, references, or things she loves. She will appreciate that you took the extra time to make it a personalized promposal. Customize your promposal to things she likes or common interests or experiences you have shared. [3] X Research source For example, if she loves cats, then find a way to incorporate a cat theme into the promposal. If you two had a fun experience together, like a summer camping trip where you hit it off, try to include a reference to this when you ask her. There are infinite ways to customize a promposal. Above all, you just want to show that you put the time and effort into personalizing it for the person you want to take! She will appreciate the time and effort you put into it."

    {
      "title": "Be romantic if it’s a romantic situation.",
      "content": "Be romantic if it’s a romantic situation. Incorporate some romance, such as bringing the girl her favorite flowers or writing her a love poem, into your promposal if love is in the air. Don’t do this if you are just asking a friend or someone who you don’t want a romantic situation with. [4] X Research source This is another situation in which you can ask her friends about things she likes such as her favorite flowers or chocolates. Make sure that the situation is romantic before you decide to ask in a romantic way. You don’t want to cause an awkward situation with a friend or confuse someone you don’t have any romantic feelings for."

      "content": "Have a back up plan in case she says no or can’t go. There is always the possibility that the girl you want to ask doesn’t actually want to go with you. She might not be allowed to or have another commitment. [5] X Research source You can make a deal to go with a friend in case you both don’t get dates or decide on a second choice that you would enjoy going to prom with."

You want to hear the answer without waiting forever for the girl to put the pieces together."

      "content": "Cover something of hers in sticky notes to ask her to prom. Cover her locker, car, or desk in the sticky notes with your promposal. Get creative and create some artwork in the sticky notes, like a big heart, if you have the space. [10] X Research source One way you can do this is to stick a sticky note with the letter \"P\" on her locker. When she sees it and takes it off, sneak up and stick one that says \"R\" on it. Keep going until you've individually stuck on sticky notes that spell \"P-R-O-M?\" and you reveal your identity. Another idea is covering her desk with sticky notes that say, “Will you stick by my side at prom?” Be a gentleman and help her clean up the sticky notes when you’re done."

Serenade the girl after school near your car or in the back parking lot, or even in school in the cafeteria if you want to put on a show. [11] X Research source If you don't know how to play guitar, you can impress the girl by learning a song just for her, or you can ask a friend to play the guitar as you sing. If guitar isn’t your thing, then you could create a cute rap song and rap it to her while playing the beat from a boombox."

You don’t want her to not be able to drive home because you covered her car windows in a hard-to-clean promposal. For example, you could write on her car, “You drive me crazy, will you go to prom with me?”"

This silly dance will show the girl that you're comfortable enough with yourself to be completely goofy, and that you'll be the perfect prom date."
