      "content": "This is the central pillar of the bro code. It is the lynchpin holding the entire constitution of bro-dom in place. Always have your homie’s back. If they call you in crisis, you get in your car and head over. If they just got dumped, give them a hug and treat them to a night on the town with the boys. If they’re struggling in any way, it’s your responsibility to watch out for them . [1] X Research source This doesn’t mean that you should enable anybody’s behavior if it’s bad or unsafe in some way. If your friend wants you to “get their back” while they go rob a bank, you have responsibility to try and stop them."

Be the best possible wingman you can be to make sure that your homies get the chance to score when they’re wide open for the shot. [2] X Research source"

Things can get really messy if you date someone’s ex- or family member, even if you go into things with the purest of intentions. As a result, you’re better off just looking for romantic partners elsewhere. [3] X Research source This is one of those practical bro code rules. It’s not that it’s immoral or problematic to date someone’s ex or family member per se, but it just often gets out of hand when things go sideways."

The world already has too many people who try to make themselves feel bigger by putting down others, so don’t add to those numbers. You can’t honor the bro code if you don’t respect others. [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Don’t be mistaken by the moniker, “bro.” Girls can be bros, too. Non-binary folks as well. Bro is a state of mind, not a restrictive category."

      "content": "If someone is being rude, hateful, or confrontational with one of your friends, stand up for them. Even if you don’t say anything, get behind their shoulder and let them know you’re there. Every bro has a responsibility to look after one another, so if you’ve got a squabble on your hands, don’t shy away. [5] X Research source This isn’t to say that you should ever start a fight.

Always pay up if a bet doesn’t go your way—especially if you bet something other than money, like beer or something like that.

This includes: [9] X Research source Avoid the middle urinals if the bathroom is empty. Fill in the corners and work your way inwards skipping every other urinal. If the bathroom has only two urinals, use a stall if one of the urinals is occupied. Never pee on the seat. Always lift the seat before taking a leak. If the seat is filthy, just use the side of your shoe to lift it up. Wash your hands—even if you only peed. Don’t be that guy. Absolutely zero eye contact is allowed. In the event you accidentally lock eyes, acknowledge the moment with a quick downward head nod and avert your gaze again. Never go to the bathroom in groups. We don’t know why, but this is a core tenant of the girl code —the yin to our yang, so to speak."

Those little gestures mean a lot. A lot of guys have a problem with giving compliments to their male friends.

No good comes from the drama of bro-on-bro violence, so respect your fellow man by handling conflict peacefully . [14] X Research source It’s okay to air your grievances if you’re upset.

[25] X Research source If you’re the friend asking for help moving, don’t forget about the beer and pizza exchange rates.
