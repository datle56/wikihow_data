      "title": "Disconnect the spark plug or batteries.",
      "content": "Disconnect the spark plug or batteries. Look near the front of the lawn mower’s engine for a thick black cord housing the spark plug. Disconnect the plug to prevent your mower from accidentally starting while you’re working. [1] X Research source If you have an electric lawn mower, open the main compartment by the engine and pull out the battery. For an added layer of security, cover the end of the spark plug with a small plastic bag. This prevents the contacts from accidentally touching while you’re replacing the blade."

      "title": "Tilt the mower over to access the blade.",
      "content": "Tilt the mower over to access the blade. Tilt the mower back toward the handle and weigh it down so it doesn’t fall. It the mower doesn’t stay put, then try tilting it on its side instead so the blade is face-up and exposed. [2] X Research source If you tilt the mower on its side, make sure the air filter on the side of the engine faces up. This prevents oil from leaking onto the filter and ruining it. It’s usually best to replace a mower blade when the gas tank is empty so it doesn’t spill out when you tip it over. Either run your lawn mower until it runs out or siphon the gas out of the tank. Alternatively, unscrew the gas cap, cover the opening with a plastic sandwich bag, and screw the gap back on to seal the tank."

      "title": "Undo the blade’s mounting bolt to remove it.",
      "content": "Undo the blade’s mounting bolt to remove it. Put on thick work gloves to protect your hands. Your lawn mower blade is usually connected with a single mounting bolt, but there may be more depending on your lawn mower. Wedge a wood block between the blade and the deck to prevent it from spinning. Then, use a socket wrench and turn it counter-clockwise to loosen the bolt enough so the blade pulls straight off. [3] X Research source If the mounting bolt is stuck, lightly tap the handle of your wrench with a hammer to loosen it. Save the mounting bolt and any washers that were with it because you can reuse them with the new blade. Take a picture of the blade’s orientation before you remove it so you can install the new one the same way. Usually the sharp edge of the blade moves counter-clockwise, but double-check your mower’s manual to find the proper orientation for your model. If the underside of your mower looks caked in dead grass or debris, then use a plastic scraper to clean it off so the new blade can spin properly."

      "content": "Get a replacement blade that’s the same size as the old one. Measure the old blade or take it with you to the store to compare sizes. Make sure to use a blade that has the same mounting holes and length to ensure that it fits onto your mower."

      "title": "Install the new blade and tighten the mounting bolt.",
      "content": "Install the new blade and tighten the mounting bolt. Place the new blade onto the mounting bolt so the raised wings at the end are pointing toward the mower deck. Secure the mounting bolt by turning it clockwise by hand until it’s tight. Then, use a torque wrench to tighten the bolt until it’s snug. [4] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Be careful not to under-tighten or over-tighten the mounting bolt. Under-tightening can make the blade come loose while using your mower, and over-tightening can damage the bolt or blade."

      "content": "Stand the mower up and reconnect power. Tilt your lawn mower back to its upright position. Plug the spark plug back into the port at the front of the engine, or reinstall the battery if you have an electric mower. [5] X Research source If you emptied the gas tank, refill your mower with fresh gasoline. Otherwise, remove the plastic bag under the cap before running your mower. Wait about 30 minutes before using your mower after replacing the blade so the oil inside can return back to the motor."

      "content": "Keep your mower off with the key removed. Position your mower in an open space where you have room to work and set the parking brake. Shut your mower off completely and take the key out of the ignition so you don’t risk the mower starting while you’re trying to remove or replace the blade. [6] X Research source If you recently used your mower, give it about 5-10 minutes for the engine to cool down before you start working."

      "title": "Set the mower deck to the lowest position.",
      "content": "Set the mower deck to the lowest position. Look for the deck lever next to the mower’s seat. Shift the lever to the lowest number and height setting so the deck is against the ground. [7] X Research source This prevents the mower deck from quickly dropping to the ground when you disconnect it."

      "title": "Undo the retaining clips and belt guard to remove the deck.",
      "content": "Undo the retaining clips and belt guard to remove the deck. There are usually a handful of small metal clips on the front and sides of the blade deck securing it to the body of your lawn mower. Pull the retaining clips out by hand and set them aside somewhere you won’t lose them. Then, look for a U-shaped metal guard around the rubber belt on top of the deck and unscrew it from the machine. [8] X Research source After that, the belt will easily slip off and the deck will slide out from the side of your mower. The clip locations and parts you need to disconnect may vary between models of riding mowers, so check the user manual for your specific mower."

      "content": "Unscrew the blades from the deck with a socket wrench. Flip the deck over to expose the blades on the bottom. Wedge a piece of wood between the blades and the side of the deck to block the blades from spinning. Fit a socket wrench over the mounting bolt, and turn it counter-clockwise to loosen the blade. [9] X Research source Repeat the process for each blade on the bottom of the mower deck. The mower blades wear out around the same time, so it’s best to change them both at the same time. Wear thick work gloves when you’re removing and installing mower blades so you don’t cut yourself on the sharp edges. Take pictures of the blades before removing them from your mower so you can remember how to install the new ones."

      "content": "Install and secure new blades to the mower deck. Get blades that are the same size and have the same mounting holes as the old ones. Fit the blades on the mounting holes so the raised wings are pointing toward the deck. Screw the bolts clockwise back onto the blades until they’re hand-tight. Then, use a torque wrench to finish tightening the bolts until they’re snug. [10] X Research source Try to wiggle the blade to make sure it doesn’t move up or down. If you notice it moving, then tighten the blade more. Avoid over-tightening the blades because they could warp or damage your mower. The bolts will also tighten more when you run your mower."

      "content": "Change your mower blade yearly in the spring. Replace the blade at the start of the season so it’s sharp throughout the summer and fall when you’re mowing the most. Because the blade dulls a little bit every time you mow, it’s best to use a fresh sharp blade so your lawn stays healthy. [12] X Research source Some signs that your lawn mower blade needs to be replaced include: Split or torn grass instead of clean cuts Brown ends on your grass Uneven lawn heights Slower run speeds or difficulty pushing the mower Dents or damage on the blade"

      "title": "Sharpen your blade once or twice per year.",
      "content": "Sharpen your blade once or twice per year. Professional landscaper Grant Wallace recommends residential homeowners who mow a couple times a month can sharpen their blade to revive it. You can try sharpening the blade yourself with a file or grinder, thought it’s often easier to have it professionally sharpened at a repair shop. While sharpening helps a blade last longer, it also removes some of the metal and makes the blade thinner. If the blade is less than 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) thick, then replace the blade instead."
