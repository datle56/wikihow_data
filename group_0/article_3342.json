      "content": "Focus on your breathing when you’re lying in bed. It’s often hard to avoid negative thoughts, especially those about homesickness, before sleeping. If thinking about the positive aspects of your day proves useless, close your eyes and concentrate on your breathing. Bring your focus back to it every time you get distracted by thoughts of home or anything else. [2] X Research source Count your breaths up to 20, and start over. Try to relax your body parts, focusing on your hands, legs, head, or chest—one at a time. You can also think of an image, such as a huge ball of light in your favorite color, or a treasure box where you can lock up all of your worries. Keep thinking of that image until you feel more relaxed and sleepy."

Sharing your feelings with them will bring you all closer and strengthen your friendship."

[6] X Research source You shouldn't hide this or lie about it— parents are often understanding since many kids get homesick, and they can help you with it. Knowing you aren't stuck and that there is a Plan B should help you relax. If you feel comfortable, you can talk to your friend’s parents yourself instead. This way, your friend’s parents will also know to look out for you, and may even ask if you'd like to go home before everyone turns in for bed. It's better to tell them upfront than to wake the whole house to leave at 3 am."
