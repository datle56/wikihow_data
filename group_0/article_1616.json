      "content": "Find your local Public Housing Agency. Although HUD is federally funded, it is run on a local level through individual Public Housing Agencies (HA). You will need to determine which one services your specific area in order to get information about the programs available in your region and move ahead with the application process. Go online to this website and select your state to find the list of HA's in your area. Then scroll through the list to find the contact information (phone and/or e-mail) for the one in your city."

      "title": "Familiarize yourself with HUD’s programs.",
      "content": "Familiarize yourself with HUD’s programs. There is no one-size-fits all HUD housing. Rather, there are a variety of assistance programs (private market rentals, home-buying assistance) and types of housing (single-family homes, high-rise apartments), some of which may be better suited to you/your family and your particular situation. Among the numerous options are the following programs: Housing Choice Voucher Program : Formerly known as Section 8 housing, this program is the largest program administered by HUD. It provides vouchers for renting in the private market. Eligible applicants include low-income families and individuals, the elderly, and the disabled. [1] X Research source HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) : HOME provides low-income households with funding to build, buy, or rehabilitate housing for renting or ownership. Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) : This program provides housing assistance to people with HIV/AIDS and their families. Additional support services are also provided. Multifamily Subsidized Housing Programs : This program includes Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly and the Congregate Housing Services Program (CHSP). These programs may be especially beneficial to elderly persons, as they provide some additional services such as housekeeping and transportation. The CHSP is a very limited program, and Section 202 is available for people at least 62 years of age and with a very low income. [2] X Research source HUDVET : This program strives to reduce homelessness among veterans and their families. Additional services are provided. [3] X Research source Self-help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP) : Unlike some other HUD programs, SHOP is primarily granted to regional and national non-profit organizations, not individuals/families. It provides assistance in purchasing and renovating home sites."

      "title": "Check your income.",
      "content": "Check your income. Before spending the time to fill out a lengthy application, you can check your income against the “income limit” developed by HUD to determine who will qualify for housing. Income limits vary by area and depend on the size of your household, so it’s important to compare your income against the limit for the area where you’re seeking housing. [4] X Research source Income limits are based on the median income in your city or metropolitan area. “Lower income” limits are set at 80% of the median, while “very low” limits are set at 50% of the median. [5] X Research source You can contact your local HA to find out the income limit for your area, or you can look online. Just because your income doesn’t fall at or below the income limit doesn’t mean you shouldn’t apply. It might, however, be a good idea to speak with an HA representative first."

      "content": "Determine how you will fill out the application. According to the federal government’s HUD website, all HUD applications must be filled out in hardcopy, and you may either fill the application out yourself or get help from an HA representative. [6] X Research source Some states may, however, allow for electronic applications for certain programs. Contact your local HA to find out about their specific policies. If you are filling the application out yourself, you may be able to print it online and mail/fax it in, depending on your local HA’s policies. Otherwise you will need to make an appointment to go into the HA office and fill the application out there."

      "content": "Collect the necessary information. You will need an array of information for the application process, so collect it beforehand to ensure you’re prepared. If you’re going into the HA’s office, it’s best to have the information written down in case you forget something. You will need your current address and telephone number along with information about everyone who will be living in the housing unit (name, sex, date of birth, and their relationship to the head of household). [8] X Research source The application will require information about veteran status or whether you are currently living in substandard housing. These details may help you to qualify for specific programs. You will need to provide an estimate of your household income for the next 12 months and the sources of the income. Be prepared to give contact information for your current and previous landlords, employers, and banks. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Locate appropriate documentation. When you go to the Housing Agency to fill out your application, you should take with you birth certificates, tax returns, your driver’s license, and other information that will help the HA verify the information you give on your application. [10] X Research source Having this documentation available at the time you fill out the application will make the process run a lot more smoothly and quickly. Otherwise, you may have to spend days or weeks getting the information to the correct people and waiting for your application to be processed in the meantime."

      "title": "Fill out the application.",
      "content": "Fill out the application. The application may be fairly detailed, so expect to spend a while filling it out. If you are filling it out online, be sure to set aside enough time, as certain systems may not allow you to save your progress and you don’t want to have to start over again if you get interrupted in the middle. Apply for as many different assistance programs as you can. Most have considerable wait lists, and applying to multiple programs maximizes your chances of moving to the top of at least one waiting list in a relatively quick time frame. [11] X Research source Wait lists may only be open for a short window in a given time period. Therefore, in order to increase your likelihood of making it onto the waitlist should your application be accepted, it’s important that you meet the required deadline for applying to a given program. Having all the necessary information and documentation with you when you go to the HA to fill out the application will help you avoid unnecessary delays. HAs generally receive many more applications for assistance than they are able to accept. If you meet any criteria that count as preference or priority status, be sure to note these on your application, as these will make you more likely to move up the waiting list and be selected for housing. Priority status may be accorded to someone whose apartment has been condemned; who is living in a shelter or on the street; who is suffering a severe medical emergency; who is paying more than half his or her income in rent; who is facing domestic violence; or who is being evicted through no fault of his or her own. Make sure your application information is entirely correct. If the housing agency or a landlord finds that you have provided false information on your housing application, it can be denied."

If you’ve filled out the application in person, an HA representative will be available to answer any questions you may have about HUD housing and the application process. [12] X Research source He can give you information about different programs, the selection process, wait list times, etc. At any time during the process, you can call your local agency and ask them questions about the application process, available programs in your area, and so on. You should also be able to make an appointment to speak with a representative in the office about concerns other than filling out an application."
