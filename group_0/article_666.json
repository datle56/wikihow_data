      "content": "Check how much RAM your computer currently has installed. Before determining how much RAM you should purchase, it will be helpful to know how much RAM you already have installed in your computer. You can quickly check your installed RAM, regardless of what operating system you are using. [1] X Expert Source Spike Baron Computer Repair Technician Expert Interview. 9 January 2019. Windows - Press ⊞ Win + S to open Windows Search. Type in “About your PC” and select it to open the System Properties window. Your installed RAM will be listed in the Device specifications section. Mac - Click the Apple menu and select \"About This Mac\". Your installed RAM will be displayed in the Memory section."

      "content": "Check how much RAM your computer and operating system can support. There are several factors that will dictate how much RAM your system can support, including your operating system and motherboard limits: [2] X Expert Source Spike Baron Computer Repair Technician Expert Interview. 9 January 2019. If you are using Windows, a 32-bit version can support up to 4 GB, while a 64-bit version can support up to 128 GB. You can check what version of Windows you have by pressing ⊞ Win + S to open Windows Search. Type in “About your PC” and select it to open the System Properties window. Look for the \"System type\" entry. Even if your computer supports up to 128 GB, there's a good chance that your motherboard doesn't support that much. You'll need to check the documentation for your motherboard or run an online system scanner to see how much memory your motherboard supports. Mac users will need to check their documentation to see how much their computer support as it varies significantly from model to model. If you don't have the documentation anymore, you can look up the specs of your model on the Apple support site. See this guide for more details on determining the maximum amount of RAM your computer supports."

      "title": "Check what RAM format your motherboard supports.",
      "content": "Check what RAM format your motherboard supports. RAM has gone through several revisions over the years. The standard these days is DDR4 RAM, but if you are upgrading an older computer, you may need DDR3, DDR2 or even DDR. If this is the case, you will likely want to consider upgrading the entire computer, as older types of RAM are getting increasingly expensive. [3] X Expert Source Spike Baron Computer Repair Technician Expert Interview. 9 January 2019. You can determine what type your computer uses by referring to the documentation or running a tool like CPU-Z, a freeware utility that analyzes your system. Some laptop motherboards come preinstalled with soldered-on RAM, meaning it can’t be removed without desoldering it. This type is generally not user-replaceable."

      "title": "Determine the clock speed.",
      "content": "Determine the clock speed. RAM comes in a variety of different speeds. If there are multiple speeds installed, your entire system will clock down to the lowest speed present. This can actually hurt your performance, even if you are adding RAM. [4] X Research source The clock speed of RAM is measured in megahertz (MHz). Motherboards typically support a range of clock speeds. If you use CPU-Z to check your memory clock speed, you will need to multiply the displayed MHz value by two, since CPU-Z doesn't display the memory multiplier. All installed RAM should be the same speed for the best performance."

      "title": "Purchase RAM modules in pairs.",
      "content": "Purchase RAM modules in pairs. Nearly all RAM should be installed in pairs. The total value of each module should be within the limits of your motherboard. For example, if you are installing 16 GB of RAM, you'll need to install either two 8 GB modules or four 4 GB modules. If your motherboard has an 16 GB limit, it likely won't support a single 16 GB memory module. [5] X Research source RAM often comes packaged in pairs to make purchasing easier. Many computers will work with only one RAM module, but this is bad practice and you will have worse performance. You should only do this if necessary."

      "content": "Understand the difference between desktop and laptop memory. Most desktop computers use DIMM RAM, while most laptops use SO-DIMM, which is smaller. The notable exception is many iMacs, which also use SO-DIMM. Other than form-factor, most of the other specifications discussed in this section apply to both desktop and laptop memory."

      "title": "Power down the computer.",
      "content": "Power down the computer. If you need to move the computer to access it easier, remove all the cables from the back. Place the desktop on its side somewhere that gives you easy access. Lay it down with the ports on the back closest to the table. To power down the computer, follow these steps: Turn off the computer using Windows Key > Power > Shut down (Windows) or Apple menu > Shut down (macOS). Unplug the power cable. Unplug any remaining cables attached to the computer. Hold down the power button for 5 to 10 seconds. This will discharge residual electricity."

      "title": "Open the case.",
      "content": "Open the case. Some cases have thumbscrews for easy opening, while older cases typically require a Phillips head screwdriver. Slide the panel off or pull it open after removing the screws. Make sure to remove the panel that allows access to the motherboard. You can determine which panel to remove by looking for the I/O ports on the back of the computer. These ports include monitor, Ethernet, speaker, USB, and more. They are connected to the motherboard, so remove the panel on the opposite side. While it’s open, it could be a good time to clean your computer and remove any dust from the inside ."

      "content": "Ground yourself. Anytime you work inside a computer, you risk emitting an electrostatic discharge that could damage your components. You can reduce this risk by wearing an anti-static wriststrap, or by grounding yourself before working in the computer. Touching a metal water tap will ground you."

      "title": "Check how the RAM slots are laid out.",
      "content": "Check how the RAM slots are laid out. Many motherboards have four slots for RAM, but pairs are typically not installed directly next to each other. For example, the slots may be laid out as A1, B1, A2, B2 and you would install your first pair on A1 and B1. Refer to your motherboard documentation to ensure that you know which slots to use. [6] X Research source If you don't have your documentation handy, you can often tell which slots are pairs by looking at the coloring. They may be labeled on the edge, which each label etched onto the motherboard. These labels may be small, so you may have to look closely."

Apply even pressure directly to the top of the module until it is inserted and the latches snap into place on each side. Do not force the modules in or you may break them. [7] X Research source Nearly all RAM is installed in pairs. Some computers will have difficulty with a single RAM stick, and using only one stick will decrease performance. Try not to touch the gold pins or the chips on the RAM module. It may damage it."
