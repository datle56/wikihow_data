      "content": "Use sites like TokMatik, Twicsy, or Bulkoid to purchase TikTok followers. There are tons more sites out there where you can buy TikTok followers, but these are some of the most popular options. A simple search on Google will give you more than enough options for buying TikTok followers. Most sites require only your TikTok username and payment information when you buy followers. Never give out your TikTok password. TokMatik offers you instant delivery, 24/7 customer support, does not need your TikTok password, and also offers a great range of services, like buying likes for your videos. Twicsy not only offers TikTok followers, but you can also buy followers on other social media sites . While buying accounts might trigger TikTok into removing fake followers from your account, Twicsy offers a slower delivery service, so the new followers appear to be organic instead of bought. Bulkoid sells \"real accounts\" that you buy, hence the heftier price tag. You can purchase followers that will actually engage with your content, like reposting and sharing (if they like it)."

      "title": "Buying followers doesn't mean you'll get more engagement.",
      "content": "Buying followers doesn't mean you'll get more engagement. Some of the websites that claim to sell real followers appear spammy, or sketchy. It might not be a good idea to trust many of them with your credit card information. And while your followers will increase, your other stats might not follow suit. A paid following doesn't exactly mean that you'll have a bigger audience. Many accounts for sale are bot accounts, so those followers you purchased most likely won't interact with your content. So what's the point? A loyal fan base, one you grow from the FYP or by making great videos , will like and share your videos, but bots will not."

      "content": "You might get in trouble with TikTok. TikTok might notice that your followers are fake and remove them from your account, so you'll be out however much money you spent, with none of the purchased followers! You could also get a warning and then get shadowbanned . Buying followers might not be against the Terms of Service, but TikTok still doesn't want you to do it. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Your videos won't end up on the For You page.",
      "content": "Your videos won't end up on the For You page. With purchased followers, your account will most likely have a very disproportionate followers/following ratio. The TikTok algorithm will then decide that your content is spammy and not display it on the FYP (For You page)."

    {
      "title": "Set up a complete profile.",
      "content": "Set up a complete profile. If your account lacks a profile picture or bio, it could be seen as spammy or fake. A spammy or fake profile most likely won't appear on the FYP and won't grow organically."

      "title": "Use hashtags effectively.",
      "content": "Use hashtags effectively. When you post a video that features a cat and cucumber, make sure you use accurate hashtags, like #cat and #cucumber. If you correctly used hashtags, your video should appear in the search results for people who search for \"cat\" or \"cucumber.\" By correctly using hashtags, you are enabling your video to show up in searches that could mean potential views. You have the option to add hashtags when you're prompted to add a description to your post. Tap # Hashtags to start tagging."

      "title": "Try to make original videos.",
      "content": "Try to make original videos. Since many TikTok users lip-sync to popular songs, an original video will stand out. But don't make videos that are all the same, since that can get boring. A TikTok user that makes original and interesting content is more likely to gain more followers than a TikTok user who only produces unoriginal content. If you're interested in making lip-sync videos, make sure you keep it interesting. You can look at popular artists and mimic elements from them. Try to find a niche that you fit into that you can post content about so you can find a more dedicated audience."

      "title": "Use the right music.",
      "content": "Use the right music. You have the option to use a clip of music in every TikTok video, and choosing the right music can either increase or decrease its probability of being liked. For example, if your video is funny, don't use a sad song."
    },
    {
      "title": "Upload a video at least once a day.",
      "content": "Upload a video at least once a day. Your videos are more likely to be seen and shared if you are active on TikTok. Even if you aren't getting a lot of views, keep uploading; an active TikTok account will look more promising to followers than an account that rarely puts out new content."
    },
    {
      "title": "Interact on the platform.",
      "content": "Interact on the platform. Engage in the comments on your videos. Followers love to chat with their favorite content creators. Leave comments on other TikTok videos. People will most likely go to your account page if they see you interact within the community. Follow similar TikTok users to your own content. People who follow the person you follow will most likely end up on your profile page. Take part in challenge videos. You can either start your own challenge or you can take part in a challenge that's already ongoing. It's another way to get your content out there and viewed by the TikTok masses, which increases your chances of getting a follower."

      "title": "Connect with other social media.",
      "content": "Connect with other social media. If you link your TikTok account with Facebook, your uploaded video is shared with more places and more people. The people on those other social media platforms will also have the opportunity to follow you on TikTok as well."

    {
      "title": "Collaborate with other people.",
      "content": "Collaborate with other people. If you work in a video with a popular TikTok video producer who has their own following, you are more likely to get views and follows from that crowd."

      "title": "Use press release agencies.",
      "content": "Use press release agencies. If you have a little bit of money to invest in your TikTok account, then get the help of a social media agency. The agency will write about your TikTok account and make sure to publish it on hundreds of popular news sites that get millions of readers around the world. The goal is to get more organic followers than purchased ones."
