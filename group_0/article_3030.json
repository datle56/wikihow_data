      "content": "Keep facial hair trimmed or smoothly shaven. One of the easiest ways to appear more feminine is to remove your facial hair . Use a razor and shaving cream to shave regularly and fend off the 5 o’clock shadow. Electric razors tend to leave a little stubble behind. Use a standard razor and shaving cream to get a cleaner shave. “Before you start shaving, you can wash your face with something with an exfoliating agent,” Professional Barber Juan Sabino recommends. “Olive oil or coconut oil…would be a base, and just put some brown sugar in it. And you can use that as a pre-face wash to soften up the hair and also get rid of some of that dead skin.” Shorten longer facial hair with clippers. Lather up to soften the hair, and then shave with the grain of your hair growth to avoid irritating your skin and getting razor burn, says Sabino. Sabino also says to disinfect your razor with a spray disinfectant or alcohol after every shave to help prevent breakouts."

      "content": "Remove body hair to appear more feminine. Plucking and shaving are the easiest ways to remove unwanted hair. Plucking is best for removing individual hairs, mostly on your eyebrows. Shaving is good for your face and body hair, but the hair regrows quickly. Other methods like waxing and using hair removal cream are easy ways to remove hair for a smoother, more feminine look. Waxing involves applying hair removal wax to the body part and placing a cloth strip over the wax. Then, pull the cloth and wax quickly off to remove the hair at the root. With this method, the hair takes longer to grow back than with shaving. To use a hair removal cream , spread it on your arm, leg, chest or back. Then, wait 3-10 minutes before removing the cream with a damp washcloth. These creams don’t remove the hair from the root, so the hair grows back faster than waxing. However, it often comes back finer than before. Be aware that hair removal creams may not be a good choice for people with sensitive skin.

      "content": "Wear tighter-fitting clothing that flatters your body shape. Men tend to wear baggier clothing than women do, so updating your wardrobe to include some tighter clothing is a simple step you can take to appear more feminine. When lounging around, try some short shorts and a tight tank top or T-shirt to get used to how form-fitting clothing feels. For formal events, try tighter slacks that ride a little higher on your waist and a form-fitting suit jacket. Trade in your standard-cut jeans for some slim-fit jeans. Pack the XXL T-shirts up, and get some flattering tank tops and V-neck shirts that are a little more form-fitting. Personal Stylist Tannya Bernadette recommends adding a little flair to traditional men’s clothing by accessorizing, choosing shirts with prints, and adding brighter colors to really pop. If you have a larger body, avoid going so tight that your clothing is uncomfortable. Pick clothing items that fit you well. Oversized clothing can make you look larger than you are. Follow fashion advice for women who have fuller figures for tips on how to dress a larger body in a more feminine way. You don’t have to wear women’s clothing to be a feminine guy, but you can if you’d like! Try wearing skirts , dresses, or flowy blouses if you want to try out some women’s clothing. Feminine clothing style is all about fit and color. You don’t have to wear anything tight if that’s not your vibe, but try balancing out your outfits a little more carefully to choose coherent looks, says Bernadette."

[2] X Research source Wait 6-12 months for your hair to grow out. Brush it regularly and experiment with flat irons and curling irons to find a hair style that works for you. A ponytail is a simple choice, but you can really do it however you want. Let it hang loose in a simple straight cut, braid it , or tie it up however you’d like! Hats can be your best friend when your hair is in that in-between state where it’s longer than short hair but not quite luxurious enough to work with longer styles."

      "content": "Wear makeup to accentuate your feminine features. Women often wear makeup to feel more feminine, so it’s a great way to express your femininity. Get a high-quality foundation that matches your skin tone, and apply concealer to cover discoloration and give you an overall healthy look, says Gudaeva. Use blush to brighten your cheeks a little and make your face softer. Use eye shadow to make your eyes pop and give you the classic feminine look. [3] X Research source If you’re not ready for a full foundation, choose a BB cream or tinted moisturizer to subtly even your skin tone. Professional Makeup Artist Erica Coates recommends prepping your lips by exfoliating them and then applying a moisturizing product, like a lip balm. Gudaeva recommends using an angled brush with some eyeshadow for a subtle eyeliner look. If you’re uncomfortable with wearing makeup, skip it! Your brand of femininity doesn’t need to match everyone else’s picture of what femininity is."

      "content": "Trust your intuition and listen to your instincts. Women are better at making intuitive decisions. [8] X Research source To get in touch with your personal vision of femininity, recognize that ego, social norms, and logic are going to get in the way. Leave your reservations aside and start to trust your natural instincts. Be confident that your own emotional truths are worth exploring. Engage with them to develop a better sense of what it actually means to be emotionally intuitive. As you learn to ignore your ego , you’ll notice it’s easier to feel like yourself without shading your self-image with society’s expectations for you. Being sensitive just means that you accurately identify your feelings and respond accordingly. This is commonly seen as a feminine trait because men are stereotypically perceived as more logical and prone to ignore the way they feel."
