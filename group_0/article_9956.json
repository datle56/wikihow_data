      "content": "Add 2 inches (5.1 cm) of cold water to the pot and bring it to a boil. The amount of water will vary based on how large the pot is, but aim to fill it a couple inches. The basket or colander should keep the lobster tails out of, but close to, the water. Then, cover the pot with the lid and bring the water to a boil on medium-high heat. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut the lobster tails down the center and remove the vein. Use sharp kitchen shears to cut the exoskeleton, or shell, of the lobster tail down the center. Avoid cutting the meat or cutting into the tail fan. Spread the shell apart with your hands, then pull or cut out the vein running down the middle. [3] X Research source You can also cut lobster tails in half with a large chef knife. This can be easier to cook, and looks better for the presentation."

The size of the lobster tails dictates how long they should cook for. [4] X Research source Cook 3-6 oz. (85-170 g) tails for 4-6 minutes. Cook 6-7 oz. (170-198 g) tails for 6-8 minutes. Cook 8-10 oz. (227-283 g) tails for 8-10 minutes. Cook 10-16 oz. (283-454 g) tails for 9-11 minutes. Cook 16-20 oz. (454-567 g) tails for 10-12 minutes."

Check to make sure the meat in the center of the tail is fully cooked—it should be an opaque, white color. If it’s not, steam them for another minute or 2. [5] X Research source"

Then, dunk the lobster tail meat in the butter and enjoy! [6] X Research source You can also pull the meat up out of the shell (leaving the tail end connected) and serve. This makes the meat look bigger and more succulent."
