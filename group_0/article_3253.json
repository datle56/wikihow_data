      "content": "Choose clothes made of breathable, stretchy fabrics. Part of the appeal of being a tomboy is being able to wear comfortable clothes most of the time. Look for clothes made of materials like cotton, jersey, or performance knitâ€”these are likely to be less restrictive than materials like silk or polyester, and they'll help keep you cool if you're being active. [1] X Research source Performance fabrics are especially helpful at wicking away sweat, so opt for these if you know you're going to be playing hard. The tomboy style is heavily associated with a relaxed personality. [2] X Expert Source Natalie Tincher Style Strategist & Wardrobe Specialist Expert Interview. 13 August 2020."

      "content": "Look for clothes in solid, neutral colors. Choose garments that are black, white, gray, navy blue, and so on. Feel free to mix in a few other colors if you like them, but keep in mind that very bright colors like teal, pink, and purple tend to look more feminine, as do patterns like polka dots or chevron."

      "title": "Opt for shorts or pants most of the time.",
      "content": "Opt for shorts or pants most of the time. As you embrace your tomboy style, you'll probably want to stay away from skirts, dresses, tight-fitting jeans, and short shorts. Instead, stick with styles like relaxed-fit jeans, joggers, cargo shorts and pants, and athletic shorts. [3] X Research source Typically, loose-fitting shorts and pants will allow you more freedom of movement, helping you stay more comfortable throughout the day."

      "title": "Wear comfortable tops that express your style.",
      "content": "Wear comfortable tops that express your style. When you're building your tomboy wardrobe, look for graphic tees, polo shirts, button-downs, and athletic shirts in colors and cuts that you like. As a tomboy, you may feel more comfortable in shirts that provide you plenty of coverage and room to move, so avoid shirts that are very tight or low-cut, unless that's what you want to wear. [4] X Research source Remember, it's most important to carve out your own style, so don't feel like you have to wear certain styles or avoid certain pieces just because you're more of a tomboy. If you want, you might wear all black every day, or you might wear a pink top with athletic pants when you're working out. Try mixing and matching pieces from different departments. For instance, you might prefer the fit of T-shirts, polos, and dress shirts from the men's department, but you might prefer athletic tank tops cut for a woman's body."

      "title": "Mix athletic wear in with your regular clothing.",
      "content": "Mix athletic wear in with your regular clothing. Tomboys are typically associated with a more sporty style. Even if you don't play sports, you might find some style inspiration by checking out the workout gear section of your favorite store. Consider trying on clothes from both the men's and women's athletic sections to find the cuts that fit your body and your style the best. Then, create outfits by mixing your athletic wear with your regular clothing, like jeans and T-shirts. For instance, you might wear a pair of basketball shorts with a baggy T-shirt for a comfy, relaxed look. You could also wear a sporty tank or performance tee with a pair of jeans and sneakers for a school-ready outfit."

      "title": "Choose a suit, jumpsuit, or comfortable dress for fancy occasions.",
      "content": "Choose a suit, jumpsuit, or comfortable dress for fancy occasions. While you're probably most comfortable in comfy, casual clothes for most of your daily activities, you might not be sure how to stay true to your style when you have to attend a dressier occasion. Luckily, there are still plenty of options that you can be comfortable in, including pantsuits, dressy jumpsuits, and simple dresses. [5] X Research source If you're more comfortable in masculine clothing, a tailored suit can be a great way to flatter your figure while still feeling like you're dressed like yourself. A dressy jumpsuit is a nice middle ground between a feminine dress and a traditional suit. If you lean to the more feminine side of being a tomboy, you might opt for a sheath dress. These fit close to your body, which may be more comfortable for you because there's not a lot of extra fabric to deal with. However, you might prefer a slightly flowier, less restrictive style."

    {
      "title": "Avoid form-fitting, low-cut, or overly feminine clothing.",
      "content": "Avoid form-fitting, low-cut, or overly feminine clothing. As a tomboy, you may not want to wear clothes that are revealing or that fit super close to your body, as these can emphasize your curves and make you look more feminine. In addition, you might want to avoid wearing clothes that seem especially girly, like anything with ruffles, lace, sparkles, or the color pink. [6] X Research source Try buying clothes that are 1-2 sizes larger than you normally wear if you want a more relaxed fit. However, some clothes, like your undergarments or sports gear, should still fit closer to your body."

    {
      "title": "Choose comfortable, supportive undergarments.",
      "content": "Choose comfortable, supportive undergarments. When you're shopping for undergarments, look for items made of stretchy, breathable fabrics. In addition, choose full-coverage fits so you don't have to worry about your underwear creeping up or the cups of your bra cutting into your breasts. Sports bras are a great option because they'll give you full coverage without restricting your movement. Your underwear style is a personal choice, so try on different styles to see what feels most comfortable for you. For instance, you might prefer bikini, brief, boyshorts, or boxer underwear."

      "title": "Stick with versatile, sturdy footwear.",
      "content": "Stick with versatile, sturdy footwear. When you're choosing shoes, think about the activities you participate in each day. If you're athletic, you'll probably be most comfortable in sneakers, whereas if you spend a lot of time outdoors, you might prefer hiking boots. In warm weather, you might prefer flip-flops or slide-in sandals, and if you're dressing up, you might prefer loafers or sensible flats. [7] X Research source If you need to wear heels for a nice occasion and you're not used to them, practice walking in them at home until you feel comfortable. Start out a few minutes at a time, until you can comfortably wear them for an hour."

      "content": "Toss on an oversized hoodie or a zip-up jacket if the weather's cold. There's nothing cozier than a big slouchy hoodie on a cold day, so having a few of these on hand is a tomboy staple. You can wear a pullover hoodie if you prefer, or opt for a zip-up style if you'll need to be able to take the jacket on and off throughout the day. [8] X Research source If the weather is cool, but not cold, try wearing an unbuttoned flannel shirt to stay warm. Of course, you might also prefer to wear nicer outerwear, like a leather or canvas jacket. Find what you like!"

      "title": "Stick with simple, heavy-duty accessories.",
      "content": "Stick with simple, heavy-duty accessories. Just because you're a tomboy doesn't mean you have to skip accessories altogether, although you certainly don't have to wear any if you don't want. However, if you do want to add a little flair to your outfit, opt for accessories like a thick chain necklace, leather cuff bracelet, chunky watch, plain band, or stud earrings. [9] X Research source As a tomboy, you probably don't want to wear much dainty jewelry. Not only do delicate pieces look more feminine, but they'll also be more likely to break if you're playing a little rough. If you want to wear a hat, beanies and baseball hats are both good options!"

      "title": "Wash your face twice a day.",
      "content": "Wash your face twice a day. Whether or not you wear makeup as a tomboy, taking good care of your skin is important. Wash your face morning and night with a cleanser formulated for your skin type to keep it looking great. For instance, if you have oily skin that's prone to breakouts, you might use a foaming cleanser with an acne-fighter like benzoyl peroxide. If you have dry skin, you might opt for a creamy moisturizing cleanser."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear light makeup or skip it altogether.",
      "content": "Wear light makeup or skip it altogether. Being a tomboy doesn't mean you can't wear any makeup at all, but you'll probably feel more like yourself when your face is fresh and clean. However, you might still choose to use a little concealer to cover up any blemishes that pop up, or you might wear lip balm if your lips start to get dry. If you do wear makeup, remember to wash your face at the end of the day. Otherwise, the makeup could clog your pores, leading to more breakouts."

      "title": "Choose a no-fuss hairstyle.",
      "content": "Choose a no-fuss hairstyle. Of course, there's no one way to wear your hair if you're a tomboy. However, you'll probably feel most comfortable with easy-to-maintain styles. For instance, you might wear your hair in a chin-length bob, or if it's longer, you might pull it back into a neat ponytail or wear it parted it down the center and tucked behind your ears. [10] X Research source If you prefer shorter hair, try using gel or mousse to hold a style that you like."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your fingernails short and unpolished.",
      "content": "Keep your fingernails short and unpolished. Long, polished nails look more feminine, so if your style is more tomboyish, you'll probably prefer to keep your nails bare. In addition, keeping them clipped short will allow you to still look neat and put-together, and it will also be easier to keep them clean. [11] X Research source If your nails are prone to splitting or breaking, try painting them with a clear coat of nail strengthener once a week."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be tough.",
      "content": "Be tough. Part of being a tomboy means you aren't afraid to show everyone how tough girls can be! Go outside and play, get dirty, and don't shy away from things that might seem gross to girly girls, like bugs or slugs. [12] X Research source Part of being tough might mean playing sports like football or basketball, but you can still be a tomboy even if you aren't athletic. It's fine if you prefer to ride bikes with your friends, or even if you'd rather stay inside and read all day!"

    {
      "title": "Have a more relaxed posture.",
      "content": "Have a more relaxed posture. Typically, tomboys aren't known for having perfectly upright posture or sitting with their legs daintily crossed at the ankles. While you should always practice standing up straight with your shoulders back, it's fine if you tend to be more relaxed when you're sitting or standing. [13] X Research source For instance, you might find it more comfortable to sit with your knees and slightly apart."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch or play sports, if you like them.",
      "content": "Watch or play sports, if you like them. Tomboys are often considered athletic, but even if you're not especially coordinated, you can still follow a sport that you enjoy. If there's already a team you like, watch them play and try to learn the rules and names of the players so you can chime in when your buddies are talking about the game. If you don't have a team, ask your family and friends who they like, then bond by rooting for them together! If you are more athletic, try joining a school team, like basketball, softball, or track."

      "title": "Listen to harder-hitting music, and avoid light pop.",
      "content": "Listen to harder-hitting music, and avoid light pop. While everyone's taste in music is unique, if you're a tomboy, you probably won't be interested in hearing the latest soft pop chart-topper. Instead, look for music with a stronger beat and lyrics that speak to you. For instance, even if you're into pop music, you might opt for more alternative singers like Miley Cyrus and Billie Eilish than feminine singers like Taylor Swift or Adele. However, if you find songs you like from those singers, that's okay too! You might also choose to listen to hard rock, old-school country, EDM, or rap music."

    {
      "title": "Keep an even-keeled demeanor.",
      "content": "Keep an even-keeled demeanor. If you want to be less girly and more of a tomboy, try to keep your emotions in check, no matter what's going on around you. Although it's not always true, being outwardly emotional is often associated with being more feminine. [14] X Research source Being generally calm doesn't mean that you can't ever experience or express strong emotions. If someone does something to you that genuinely upsets you or offends you, feel free to speak up for yourself!"

    {
      "title": "Hang out with the guys.",
      "content": "Hang out with the guys. Tomboys are typically associated with having more male friends than female. If you want to have a tomboy image, spend more time around your guy friends, and participate in some of the same activities they enjoy, like playing video games or skateboarding. [15] X Research source If you have close female friends, don't neglect your relationships with them! Just don't feel like you have to spend all your time hanging with groups of girls at school if you're more comfortable talking to boys."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do what you love, whether it's seen as feminine or masculine.",
      "content": "Do what you love, whether it's seen as feminine or masculine. Don't change who you are to conform to what people think you should be like, whether that's feeling pressured to be girlier or more of a tomboy. Embrace who you are, and always do what makes you feel good about yourself. [16] X Research source Sometimes tomboys might have a hard time with their self-esteem because they don't always fit in with other girls, but they're not always completely accepted by the guys. If you struggle with your self-image, try spending time in hobbies and activities you love, and surround yourself with people who build you up."
