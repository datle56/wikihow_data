When making your daily schedule , highlight the three most important tasks you need to get done each day (aside from actually going to work or going to school).

[5] X Research source By setting clear boundaries in your schedule, it’s easier to unplug and step away at the end of the workday. For instance, you might block off your whole morning to an important project, and then block off smaller chunks of time for less time-sensitive tasks in the afternoon."

A busy box is filled with a variety of toys and activities that are meant to keep your child entertained while you work. For example, a busy box might include, crayons, clay, a coloring book, stickers, puzzles, and other toys for your child. Prepare busy boxes the night before and place them near your workspace. You can use an empty shoe box or other small box and select from your child’s toys and other items to create the box. You might even throw in a surprise now and then, such as a new coloring book or a new package of stickers. You can even create themes for busy boxes. For example, if you want to teach your child about colors, you can make boxes with collections of red items, blue items, etc. Or, you might create a theme for a busy box based on one of your child’s favorite movies, books, shows, or characters."

Being able to work and engage with your kids at the same time is a skill, but you can develop this skill with practice.
