Though Americans almost always measure height in feet, centimeters are much more common. For example, say you are 180 cm tall. [1] X Research source It is almost always easier to convert to inches, then convert to feet later. However, you can directly convert to feet if you have a calculator, which may be more accurate, too. To check your work, know now that 180cm is roughly 5'10 in feet."

For estimation purposes, this means your height in inches is roughly 39% of your height in centimeters. To make this easier, round up to 40%. Now, since percentages in multiples of ten are so easy to figure out, you can get a quick approximation of your conversion. [8] X Research source Remember that 10% of any number simply moves the decimal one move to the left. Percentages always add to 100%, but can also be added anywhere in between. Thus, if you need to figure out 40% of a number, you can add 10% + 10% + 10% + 10%."

This division doesn't have to be hard, since there are really only a few options for human height: 12 inches = 1 foot. 24 inches = 2 feet 36 inches = 3 feet 48 inches = 4 feet 60 inches = 5 feet 72 inches = 6 feet 84 inches = 7 feet [9] X Research source"

Just like any other decimal this can be converted to a percentage, meaning 1 centimeter is actually 3.3% of each foot ( note: you convert a decimal to a percentage by multiplying it by 100 ). And, if you divide 10% by 3, you get roughly 3.3%. Now, just substitute your actual percentage for 10% in this equation and you have your estimation! 1 c m = 3.3 % f e e t {\\displaystyle 1cm=3.3\\%feet} 180 c m ∗ 10 % = 18 {\\displaystyle 180cm*10\\%=18} 10 % 3 = 3.3 % {\\displaystyle {\\frac {10\\%}{3}}=3.3\\%} 18 3 = {\\displaystyle {\\frac {18}{3}}=} 6 feet, or 72 inches Remember that a decimal in the answer is not the number of inches.

      "title": "Understand that these estimations will always come out a little taller than reality.",
      "content": "Understand that these estimations will always come out a little taller than reality. Remember the original estimation for centimeters and inches? You converted .39 to 39%, which was then rounded up to 40%. While this makes the solution easier, it slightly overestimates the conversion by adding this percentage point. As a result, you should know that all estimations will be just a touch higher. You can make this slightly more precise by subtracting 1% from your initial number. So, instead of using 180cm, use 178.2cm. This is extra helpful if, instead of 180 cm, you get something more difficult, like 182cm. Knowing it will overestimate, cut it to 180. When using precise decimals, 180 cm = 5' 10.9\". When estimating using the above methods, 180 = roughly 6 feet. They are only about an inch off -- but they are still different."
