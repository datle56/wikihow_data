This prefix means \"1000\" (one thousand). Kilo- is abbreviated as \"k-\", so a kilogram is \"kg\" and a kilometre is \"km\". [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Convert kilometres to metres.",
      "content": "Convert kilometres to metres. Since kilo- means 1 000, one kilometre (km) is equal to 1000 metres (m). Multiply the number of kilometres by 1 000 to get the same measurement in metres. [2] X Research source For example, 75 kilometres = 75 k m ∗ 1 000 m k m {\\displaystyle 75km*1\\ 000{\\frac {m}{km}}} = 75 000 metres. To make sure you've set up the conversion correctly, try reading it in plain English: 1000 m k m {\\displaystyle 1000{\\frac {m}{km}}} means \"1 000 metres per kilometre\"."

[5] X Research source Here are a couple conversions that use these prefixes: A 3 megawatt (MW) factory produces 3 M W ∗ 1 000 000 W M W {\\displaystyle 3MW*1\\ 000\\ 000{\\frac {W}{MW}}} = 3 000 000 watts (W) of power.

That's when you use prefixes that represent a fraction of the base unit. Here are the most common prefixes of this type: [7] X Research source centi- (c) means \"one hundredth\" (0.01). 1 centimetre = 0.01 metres. milli- (m) means \"one thousandth\" (0.001). 1 millimetre = 0.001 metres. micro- (µ) means \"one millionth\" (0.000 001). 1 micrometre = 0.000 001 metres. nano- (n) means \"one billionth\" (0.000 000 001). 1 nanometre = 0.000 000 001 metres."

There are several ways to catch this mistake: Check the units in your equation. If you set it up correctly, the original units should cancel out. For example 75 k m ∗ 1000 m k m {\\displaystyle 75km*1000{\\frac {m}{km}}} gives you an answer in terms of k m ∗ m k m {\\displaystyle {\\frac {km*m}{km}}} . The km units are on top and bottom, so they cancel out and leave you with m (metres). Compare the units logically. The smaller unit should always have the larger number next to it. Metres are smaller than kilometres, so it takes more of them to fill the same length. For example, a result of 75 000 metres = 75 kilometres makes sense, since a larger number of metres equals a smaller number of kilometres."
