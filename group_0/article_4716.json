      "content": "Be your own hype person and stay upbeat about changing. Maintain clear reasons for why you want to control your behavior and remind yourself that you can do it. Try to find your inner motivation and journal about it. You could also keep a list of the benefits of changing on a small piece of paper and keep it in your wallet. [1] X Expert Source Amy Wong Leadership & Transformational Coach Expert Interview. 30 April 2020. For example, say you’re trying to develop self-control to stop smoking. You could write down the cost of buying cigarettes, the effects on your health, the smell, caring for your teeth, etc. You might make a list of all the positives of quitting smoking, including having more money to spend on other things, whiter teeth, breathing easier, or whatever reasons you can think of that will motivate you to quit."

      "content": "Trying to change everything overnight will be overwhelming. The most likely way you’ll fail while trying to cultivate self-control is getting frustrated with yourself for not changing immediately. Quitting anything cold turkey will just be too daunting. Set yourself up for success in your efforts by setting realistic goals that help you slowly taper away from whatever behavior you want to change. [2] X Research source Be realistic about what kind of changes you can make that will fit into your life, your time, and your ability. If you try to change everything at once, as ambitious as this may be, you can risk self-sabotaging your efforts and giving up. For example, if you're building self-control to avoid compulsive eating, switching to nothing but fruits and vegetables all at once is too ambitious. Instead, try to add some veggies to dinner every day. After a few weeks, switch your snacks to fresh fruits. There’s nothing wrong with going slow!"

      "content": "Having a positive attitude can prevent things from getting overwhelming. Don’t be too hard on yourself if you feel like you are not reaching your goals. Keep your focus on continually making the effort, and let go of perceived failure. You can always try again! You can use your journal to reframe negative statements if you feel you gave in to impulsivity instead of reaching your goals. For example, if your goal is not to spend money impulsively but you went on a shopping spree, take another look at your goals and remind yourself you had a really bad day. Take some time to journal what you could do differently next time, such as going to yoga class. Congratulate yourself on your awareness and get ready to try again."

[3] X Expert Source Julia Yacoob, PhD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 July 2021. Nurturing awareness around your impulsive behaviors will help you feel more in control of yourself and can also help you make decisions about how you want to build self-control. It’s all about what feels right for you, and building self-control starts with awareness of why you sometimes feel impulsive. [4] X Expert Source Amy Wong Leadership & Transformational Coach Expert Interview. 30 April 2020. Think about binge eating. If you aren’t aware of how you feel when you want to binge, it’ll be a lot harder to change that behavior. Do you notice that you tend to binge eat when you are stressed? Maybe you binge eat to celebrate. Do you find yourself binge eating when you feel anxious or sad? Monitoring your underlying headspace will help you deal with the feelings instead of relying on the coping mechanism."

Most of us know what drives us off track, so locate what those triggers are for you and remove them from your environment or daily schedule. [5] X Research source If you want to build your self-control when it comes to diet, don’t buy those extra “treats” and skip the soda when you’re grocery shopping. If you’re trying to improve your daily productivity and social media is a huge time sink, delete Facebook and Instagram from your phone. If you want to be more productive at home but you can’t stop watching Netflix, move the TV out of your office and block the website on your computer ."

Instead of immediately giving in, set your phone timer for 5 minutes and focus on breathing from your belly. Put one hand on your stomach and slowly inhale. Feel the air entering your chest and going down to your diaphragm. After a few minutes, the craving should dissipate.

      "content": "Impulse control is a lot easier if you’re well-rested and feel good. Get at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep each night. It might sound like this has nothing to do with self-control, but there’s a massive relationship between getting enough rest and being able to avoid impulsive behavior and urges. If you want to be focused and in control during the day, skip the all-nighters. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Like forcing yourself to exercise, forcing yourself to maintain a consistent sleep schedule probably reinforces your sense of control. It’s a lot harder to avoid your impulses if you’re exhausted. For example, it’s a lot harder to cook a healthy meal and a lot easier to order fast food on DoorDash if you’re super tired. Maintaining good sleep hygiene also helps you avoid decision fatigue. By “sleeping on it” instead of forcing yourself to make a decision before bed, you’ll prevent yourself from getting mentally strained. In the morning, you'll be clear-headed, rested, and ready to decide."

      "content": "Tracking how you spend your day will provide key feedback. It’s hard to maintain self-control if you aren’t paying attention to when you are or are not successful. Keep a small journal on you and track when you do or do not give into temptation during the day. Pay attention to how you feel at the end of each day and ask yourself, “Why do I feel this way?” These daily monitoring activities will help you identify problem areas and improve slowly over time.

      "content": "Let go of the hardcore intensity you’re putting on yourself. Human beings are not designed to be raw machines of focus and productivity. Time wasters, daydreaming, boredom, and relaxation are all important pieces of the self-control puzzle. The harder you are on yourself, the harder it will be to cultivate a productive and meaningful sense of self-control. Be easy on yourself. It’s a marathon, not a race. [11] X Expert Source Julia Yacoob, PhD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 July 2021. Treating the journey of cultivating self-control as a zero-sum game will only reinforce the black-and-white thinking that makes avoiding temptation so intense and serious. For example, if you’re trying to exercise more often and you fall asleep after work so you don’t get a daily run in, don’t get upset! Your body needed rest and you did nothing wrong."

      "content": "Pick a go-to activity that’s more productive than your urge. Instead of sitting around trying to fight an urge, actively replace that behavior with something more meaningful. A substantive alternative to an urge will give you something to distract yourself with. This way, you can beat the urge and accomplish something productive instead! [12] X Research source For instance, if you’re trying to stop spending money, you can go for a walk in a green space where you won’t even have the opportunity to shop. Or if you’re trying to control snapping at people, you can develop the habit of hitting the gym to blow off steam when you're stressed."

      "content": "Use your support system to help you achieve your goals. Let your friends and loved ones know that you are trying to change your behaviors. Ask people in your life who are supportive if you can call or text them if you need support. Part of believing in yourself and creating change also means allowing others to help you. Although empowering yourself is a large part of building self-control, letting others in your life give you pep talks, motivate you, and listen when you need it will help immensely. [15] X Research source For example, if you’re trying to quit smoking and you’re tapering down, ask your roommate to hold your cigarettes for you and only give them out at specific times. If you’re trying to get better about keeping a schedule, ask your parents or partner to remind you to fill out your planner every night."

      "content": "Give yourself something rewarding as you hit big milestones. This is the ideal way to keep the momentum up as you’re making progress. Rewarding yourself for practicing self-control will help reinforce positive behaviors to replace impulsive behaviors. You could buy yourself something, take a day off of work, or celebrate with others. [16] X Research source For example, if you are trying to get better about socializing every week, you could buy yourself a new fancy TV in exchange for hosting a weekly movie night with friends."
