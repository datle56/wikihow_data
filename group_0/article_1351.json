      "content": "Find a quiet, private setting. Start by finding a quiet area in your house where you can address your sister in private. This may be in a room you share together or in your sister’s room. Making the apology in a private, quiet space will show your sister that you are serious about your apology and want to discuss the matter away from others. [2] X Research source Try to make your heartfelt apology in person, face to face. Texting or emailing an apology can seem disingenuous and may not hold as much of an emotional impact as an in-person apology. You should also choose a time that is most convenient for your older sister. Do not try to apologize to her when she is in a rush and on her way out or when she is hanging out with friends at home. Choose a time when she is alone and can focus on your apology."

[5] X Expert Source Michelle Shahbazyan, MS, MA Life Coach Expert Interview. 18 March 2020. Taking responsibility for your actions will show your sister that you realize you behaved badly and want to make amends for your behavior towards her. [6] X Research source Avoid mentioning your sibling’s own behavior and do not try to blame your sister or make her feel bad. You are apologizing for your actions, not putting your sister on trial for her actions. Blaming her will only make her more upset. You may say, “I know that I acted badly when I read your diary” or “I can see now that my unkind words toward you were hurtful and unfair.” You may also say, “I was mad at you but I should not have taken my anger out on you.”"

      "content": "Use “I” statements in your apology. Make sure you own up to your actions by using “I” statements in your apology. This will show your sister that you are standing by your words and willing to acknowledge that you acted poorly towards her. [7] X Research source You should say “sorry” once to your sister, with intention and feeling. Avoid saying “sorry” multiple times as it may sound hollow or empty after you say it once. Maintain eye contact with her when you make your apology. This will let her know you are serious and genuine. For example, you may say, “I’m sorry for what I did to you,” or “I apologize for being hurtful and unfair toward you.”"

If your sister responds to your apology with feedback or comments about your behavior, you should listen to it without judgement. Be willing to listen to what she has to say and use this feedback to improve your behavior towards her in the future.

      "content": "Write her an apology letter. Sometimes it’s hard to say “I’m sorry” in person, especially if you feel you have really hurt or upset your older sister. It can also be intimidating to apologize to your older sibling, as you may look up to her as a role model. If you are nervous about apologizing to your older sister in person, you may want to write her an apology letter and give it to her to read on her own time. [10] X Research source You can start the letter with “Dear Sis”, and then lay out your apology. First, you may acknowledge your sister’s feelings and then take responsibility for your actions. You may end the letter with a heartfelt “I’m sorry for what I did” and a note that you understand it may take your sister some time to accept your apology. You may also offer to talk in person when she is less angry and end the letter with “I love you” to let your sister know you still care for her."

You may end the poem with a line that says, simply, “I’m sorry for what I did to you.” You may then sign and date the poem and give it to your sister so she can read it in private."

You should think of a unique gift that will show her you feel bad about how you treated her and that you want to make amends for your actions. [12] X Research source For example, if you stole your older sister’s diary, you may give her the gift of a new diary with a better lock and key system. Or, if you broke your sister’s favorite item, you may try to find the same item and replace it as a gift. You may also want to tie an apology gift to your heartfelt apology. Telling your sister how sorry you are and then presenting her with an apology gift could end up winning her over. She may be more likely to forgive you if you offer up a gift with your apology."

You may find yourself in conflict with your older sister often, even as you both get older. You can avoid conflicts with her by taking the time to focus on her positive qualities. Often, it can be easy to ignore her positive traits and qualities, and instead only focus on the negative. [14] X Research source For example, maybe your sister tends to complain and nag you often about your life choices. You may try to focus on the positive aspects of her behavior, as she is likely nagging you because she is concerned about you and cares about your well-being. You may also try to keep in mind that though your sister nags you, she is also there to support you when you fail or when you are having a hard time. Her positive qualities may outweigh her negative qualities, especially when it comes to her treatment of you."

Or maybe your approach to a certain issue seemed faulty from her perspective. Be willing to consider and respect her point of view, even if you may not completely agree with it.

You could then consider your childhood through her eyes and realize how much pressure and expectation was placed on her growing up. You may be more empathetic toward her if you view the situation from her point of view."

You are both then less likely to get into a conflict or a fight if you are treating each other with respect and consideration. [17] X Research source Be willing to tell your sister the things you admire or appreciate about her. You may say, “I like that you have a good sense of humor, even when you are having a bad day,” or you may say, “I appreciate it when you stick up for me in front of the bullies at school.” Complimenting her on her behavior will help to create a relationship with her that is respectful and honest."
