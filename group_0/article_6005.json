      "content": "Watch your dog around small children, if applicable. Belgian Malinois are great family dogs and enjoy being around children. They are extremely loyal to their owners and families and can be wary of strangers if they perceive them as a threat. This makes them great guard dogs, but they must be taught not to be overly protective of small children through proper socialization. They are very loving with children but due to their larger size, they can unintentionally knock children over when playing. They also have strong herding instincts and may try to herd small children if not corrected. [5] X Research source Small children should be watched closely around pets since kids have a tendency to pull on dog's fur, ears, and tails, which can hurt a dog."

By exposing them to new people in safe environments, they learn that new people are not a threat. [8] X Research source Introduce your dog to your neighbors, friends, and family. Use a friendly tone of voice and be excited to see the new person. This lets the Malinois know that you do not perceive these new people as a threat.

      "content": "Teach basic obedience commands. Belgian Malinois are a very intelligent breed and will learn new tasks and tricks easily. They are bred to be working dogs so they have a strong drive to follow directions and carry out tasks. Basic commands like sit, stay, and come are all good first commands to begin with. Teach your Malinois to sit by showing them a treat. When the dog looks up at the treat, move the treat close to the dog's nose, then slowly back over the dog's head. When the dog tries to follow the treat with its eyes and nose, it will usually sit down. When this happens, give the dog the treat and say \"Sit.\" Stay and come can be taught in tandem. Have the dog sit in front of you while you are standing. Take a few steps backwards as you say, “stay.” If the dog gets up to follow you, instruct them to sit again and repeat the process. When the dog has learned to stay, you can begin to use the “come” command to instruct them to follow you as you back away."

However, they do need to be taught to walk on a leash and to follow your commands. [12] X Research source Belgian Malinois are very strong and can pull while on a leash. If your dog begins to pull while you are walking them on a leash, you can stand still and wait until they reach the end of the leash and are forced to walk back to you. You can also use treats to encourage dogs to stay close to your side and to match your gait. [13] X Research source Do not use retractable leashes. They are often not strong enough to be used with larger dogs, and they reinforce bad leash habits like walking far ahead or behind you. They can also negatively impact the socialization work that you’ve already done. If you retract the leash anytime another dog or person comes close to you, you are signaling to your Malinois that you perceive that person or dog to be a threat."

You will need to spend time each day - depending on your dog’s obedience level it may be numerous 15 minute intervals - practicing the commands and tricks that you want the dog to learn. Most Belgian Malinois will enjoy training since it gives them an opportunity to spend time with you and provides mental stimulation.

Daily walks are not enough exercise for a Belgian Malinois unless you are an avid runner who jogs several miles each and every day. Belgian Malinois do best when they have large fenced in yards to play in. Many Malinois enjoy retrieval games, participating in agility trials, running, hiking, biking, and spending time with their owners outdoors.

By knowing what sort of conditions they are susceptible to, you can take preventative measures early on. [20] X Research source Like most larger dog breeds, they are at risk of hip dysplasia. Responsible breeders will genetically test for hip dysplasia before breeding puppies, but you may not know a dog’s genetic background if it is adopted. Veterinarians are able to X-ray the dog’s hips to check for the condition. Some Belgian Malinois are at risk of hereditary juvenile cataracts. Cataracts can develop as the dog gets older and can often be removed through surgery. There is some evidence to suggest that Belgian Malinois may be slightly more susceptible to epilepsy, though extensive research has not been completed. If your dog begins to show signs of epilepsy, take them to the veterinarian immediately. [21] X Research source"
