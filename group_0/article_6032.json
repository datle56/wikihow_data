      "content": "Stay home for at least 12 to 24 hours after your dog’s surgery. While it may not be necessary to watch your dog the entire time she's recovering, keep a close eye on her for the first day after surgery. Don’t plan on leaving the house or running errands for at least 12 hours, so you can help your dog with all her needs and stay by her side. If you don’t have a choice but to leave the house, have someone you trust watch and care for your dog. Note that some dogs may need your undivided attention for more than 24 hours. You know your dog best, so do what you can to make her the most comfortable, whether that means staying by their side or giving her more space. Typically, dogs can be left alone after their sutures have dissolved 10 to 14 days post-operation."

      "content": "Carry small dogs in and out of cars and up and down steps. Right after surgery, your dog will likely be extremely lethargic and may have a hard time walking. This is completely normal as the anesthetic wears off. [2] X Research source If your dog is small, carry her whenever she’d normally step or jump up. Hug your dog to your chest and avoid putting pressure or a hand on her incision. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source If you have a larger dog, consider setting up her recovery space in an area without steps so she doesn't have to climb. Place your dog in a carrier or crate (one large enough that she can stand and turn around) to ensure she doesn’t jump up on anything."

      "title": "Feed your dog a small amount in the first 12 hours after surgery.",
      "content": "Feed your dog a small amount in the first 12 hours after surgery. Once the anesthetic starts to wear off, your dog may get hungry. If she does, offer her a smaller, light snack rather than her regular meal. The anesthetic can make your dog feel nauseous, and eating heavier, full-sized meals may cause her to get sick. [4] X Research source So, opt for a small portion of boiled chicken with plain white rice. [5] X Research source If your dog has special dietary needs, talk to your vet about the best way to feed them after surgery. Switching your dog back to her normal diet 24 hours after surgery is usually fine. Just make sure to watch your dog closely. If she throws up, contact your vet. [6] X Research source Keep clean, fresh water near your dog at all times. This ensures that they won’t have to travel far to get a drink and will stay hydrated throughout recovery. [7] X Research source Remember that it’s normal for a dog to not poop after surgery. However, if your pup hasn't gone to the bathroom in over 2 days, call your vet."

      "content": "Keep your dog’s environment calm and quiet. Once your dog comes home, she’ll need all the peace, quiet, and rest she can to recover. So, turn down the TV and music and talk in a hushed tone. Avoid planning any extravagant parties, and keep the lights dim. [8] X Trustworthy Source Animal Humane Society Leading animal welfare nonprofit organization providing medical care, training education, and resources for animal owners Go to source Resist the urge to invite people over to see your dog. Seeing people outside of who she usually lives with may make her too excited and make it harder for her to rest."

      "title": "Prevent your dog from running, playing, and jumping.",
      "content": "Prevent your dog from running, playing, and jumping. If your dog overexerts herself after surgery, it may cause her stitches to pop. Avoid playing with her in the first few days after the operation. Instead of running or playing fetch, opt for a simple puzzle or chew toys she can play with lying down. [9] X Research source Consider putting up a child’s gate to prevent your dog from running throughout your room or going up and down stairs. Hide your dog’s toys away until she’s well enough to play with them. This way, she won’t be tempted. If you have other dogs, consider asking a friend to watch and play with them while your dog recovers. This way, they won’t be tempted to play with her, and she won’t feel left out. Talk to your vet if you have a hyperactive dog, as they can provide a personalized solution to how you can manage your dog’s energy during recovery."

[11] X Research source If your dog is going stir crazy and has lots of bottled up energy, check with the clinic to see if short walks here and there are okay. If they are, keep your dog on a short leash and take her for a short walk. Typically, vets advise waiting 3 to 4 days after the surgery to take your dog on gentle 5-minute walks."

      "title": "Get your dog an Elizabethan collar to keep her from licking the wound.",
      "content": "Get your dog an Elizabethan collar to keep her from licking the wound. One of the worst things your dog can do is lick her incision wound. While she’s only trying to help, her innocent licking can lead to infection or break the stitches. So, to prevent this, place a cone collar on her. [12] X Research source Most vets will provide you with one after the surgery, but other collar variations can be purchased online. The narrow end of the collar should sit around your dog’s neck like a regular collar, and the wide end of the cone should project 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) beyond the nose."

      "content": "Put an old T-shirt on your dog if you have other dogs. If you have several dogs, any number of them might try to lick your recovering dog’s wound. To prevent this, find a T-shirt large enough to cover your dog’s whole body, down to where the incision was made. Have your dog wear the T-shirt for 10 to 14 days or until the incision is fully healed. [13] X Research source Tie the t-shirt loosely around the waist if it’s too big for your dog, or consider cutting holes in the underside for her back paws to go through. Opt for a cotton T-shirt as these are the most breathable."

      "content": "Avoid contact with male dogs for 8 to 10 days after the surgery. If your dog was in heat at the time of the surgery, make sure she stays away from male dogs for at least 8 days. She may still have the odor that attracts the opposite sex (despite not having reproduction organs). If a male dog tries to mount her, it could cause complications at the surgical site. [14] X Research source Similarly, you may notice vaginal discharge a few days after surgery if your dog was in or near heat beforehand. This is entirely normal, but if it persists for more than 3 days, contact your vet."

It’s normal for there to be a small amount of blood immediately after surgery, and some redness and swelling is expected. [15] X Trustworthy Source Animal Humane Society Leading animal welfare nonprofit organization providing medical care, training education, and resources for animal owners Go to source Keep the incision dry.

Contact the vet immediately if excessive amounts of blood or pus is leaking from the incision. These could be signs of an infection or complications. [17] X Trustworthy Source Animal Humane Society Leading animal welfare nonprofit organization providing medical care, training education, and resources for animal owners Go to source Typically, blood comes from small blood vessels leaking out into the fat layer beneath the skin rather than major internal hemorrhage; however, it’s always best to call your vet just to be sure. Likewise, pus is usually a sign of a superficial infection at or just beneath the skin rather than an infection tracking out of the abdomen; however, your dog may need antibiotics to settle the infection."

      "content": "Give your dog painkillers if your vet prescribed them. As with any major surgical procedure, ensuring the patient is not in pain is important. Most clinics use a combination of painkillers (an opioid and a non-steroidal) on the day of surgery and send your dog home with an oral painkiller to continue taking at home. Follow your vet’s instructions on when and how long to give your dog their medicine. [20] X Research source Keep in mind that some dogs are more sensitive than others. Typically, pain relief is required for 4 to 5 days post-operation, but your dog may need more or less time. Never use painkillers that aren’t prescribed by your vet, as this could put your dog’s health at risk."
