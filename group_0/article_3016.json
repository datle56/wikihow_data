Here's a list on how you could meet them. One Direction has upcoming tours(not). Find out if the band is visiting your area (or a nearby area). Remember, tickets sell out fast, so know ahead of time when tickets go on sale. If the band isn't coming to a nearby area, tweet about it. Who knows, maybe they'll notice a trend on Twitter and add concerts near your area! Try to visit them at Meet and Greets or signing. Search online ahead of time for meet and greets near you and see how you can obtain a wristband. Do not show up at any of the members house. There's a huge difference between a creepy stalker and a Directioner. Don't give up! You never know, you might run into one of the member(s) at a movie theater or park. Unfortunately, it's true that not all Directioners won't get to meet One Direction, but it's important to keep believing!"
