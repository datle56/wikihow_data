      "content": "Get a sharp knife. And it should be sharp. This is especially important for basil, which will \"bruise\" if you use a dull knife. A knife that's not sharp will crush the edges, letting the juices seep out instead of making a clean cut. What's more, they'll be prettier, too. Make sure you're holding it correctly. Your fingers should be curled so your knuckles face outward on top of the handle, close to the blade. Your four fingers should all be on the same side. This is called the \"claw grip\" and it's how chefs do their quick, efficient work. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Gently rinse the leafy ingredient. The chiffonade technique is good for all leafy vegetables like lettuce and spinach, but also basil, mint, arugula, or sage. All of these need to rinsed under cold water before beginning. For basil, keep in mind that you don't really need it until the very end. If you want to hold off on cutting the basil and adding it to your dish, you can. It's delicious raw and the short blast of heat brings out its flavors. That and once you chiffonade, you don't want to give it a chance to brown."

      "content": "Gather the clean leaves into a stack. Start with the largest leaf on the bottom and build up from there. For herbs like basil and mint that are made up of smaller leaves, you can get away with stacking around 8 to 10. For larger leaves, like lettuce, you may want to stick to only three or so."

      "content": "Roll the stack of leaves together tightly in a cigar shape. Hold the leaves horizontally in front of you and begin wrapping them tightly into a roll. Hold it in place as you pick up your knife with your dominant hand. This is why you started with the largest leaf on the outside – it'll hold your roll together."

      "title": "Finely slice the \"cigar\" roll into ribbons.",
      "content": "Finely slice the \"cigar\" roll into ribbons. Begin slicing across the \"cigar\" at a 60° angle. Let your knuckles be your guide (but be careful not to cut yourself). The closer your cuts, the smaller your shreds will be. Most people chiffonade at about 1/8\" wide (.3 cm). Use a rocking motion so you don't have to pick up the knife every time; this will seriously speed up your cutting time. Use a cutting board underneath your leaves to avoid marring your countertop or table."
