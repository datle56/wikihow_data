Locating the tank now saves time and money later regardless if you or an inspector clean the tank.

      "content": "Dig out the top of the tank. Your tank may be buried underground. Before inspection, take a shovel and remove the dirt around the top of the tank. Your tank will have an access port lid which should be strong and on tight. Risers can be added on top of the tank. These help you locate and access the tank without digging. Septic system pumpers can add these. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Inspect the tank for cracks.",
      "content": "Inspect the tank for cracks. Look along the tank, including the inside, for damaged areas. Cracks need to be repaired by a professional once the tank is pumped so the system doesn’t fail. Look for any rusted or broken pieces on the inlet and outlet pipes required for drainage. Check any distribution boxes or pump chambers, if your tank has one attached. It is useful to run some water from your house, such as from the toilet or washing machine, to see if the water makes it to the tank and then drains properly."

      "content": "Pump the tank every few years. Many people make the mistake in thinking that the tank doesn’t need to be treated as long as the plumbing appears to be functioning. By maintaining the tank before it clogs with sludge and liquid stops draining, you will end up saving thousands of dollars in costly repairs. This should be done every one to three years or whenever you measure that the sludge and scum levels occupy about a third of the tank or are approaching the outlet pipe. [10] X Trustworthy Source State of Massachusetts Official website for the State of Massachusetts Go to source The smaller the tank, or the more people the tank services, the more frequently it will need to be treated. A 750 gallon tank, standard in a two-bedroom home, will last two residents about four years without pumping. For four residents, it will last less then two years without pumping. [11] X Research source Annual treatment will, at the cost of a couple hundred dollars, keep the tank clean and allow any problems to be detected before they turn into serious septic failures."

      "content": "Pump out waste. Pumping involves using a cast-iron pump that can be switched on. The pump sucks out the solids that can’t be broken down by bacteria and removes them to a container such as the inside of a tanker. Once the sludge and scum are removed, you don’t need to reintroduce bacteria or water. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Dispose of septic waste. Even if you attempt to pump out the tank yourself, you need to dispose of the waste in a legal manner. The waste has to be transported by a tanker to a government-chosen location away from water and areas where people gather. For this reason, it is better to let a professional handle it."
