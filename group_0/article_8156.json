      "content": "Use plain soap and water for routine washing. You don’t need anything fancy to wash your navel. Warm water and gentle soap will do the trick just fine! Apply some soap and water to your fingers or a washcloth and gently rub it into your belly button to get rid of lint , dirt, and grime. When you’re done, carefully rinse away all the suds. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In general, the soap or cleanser you use for the rest of your body should work fine for your belly button. Use a gentle, unscented soap or body wash if scented soaps cause drying or irritation. You can also use saltwater to gently cleanse your belly button. Mix 1 teaspoon (about 6 g) of table salt with 1 cup (240 mL) of warm water and dip a washcloth in the solution. Carefully massage the saltwater into your navel, then rinse it away with plain water. Saltwater can kill germs and loosen dirt, and you may find it less drying and irritating than soap."

      "content": "See your doctor for a diagnosis if you have infection symptoms. If you think you have an infection, make an appointment with your doctor right away. They can evaluate what kind of infection you have and tell you how to treat it properly. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The appropriate treatment will be different depending on whether your infection is caused by bacteria, fungus, or yeast. Don’t try to guess what kind of infection you have, since using the wrong treatment could do more harm than good. If the symptoms are severe, your doctor may “do a swab of it and send it for culture,” says board-certified dermatologist Indy Chabra, MD, PhD. This can help them determine what’s causing your infection."

Your doctor may prescribe medication or instruct you to buy one over the counter. Treating the infection should also get rid of any nasty odors or discharge.

      "content": "Ask your doctor to drain a belly button cyst if you have one. Sometimes a cyst can form in your belly button, potentially leading to swelling, pain, and bad-smelling discharge. If you have an infected cyst in your belly button, your doctor will probably drain it in their office. They may also prescribe oral or topical antibiotics to help clear up the infection. Follow their home care instructions to help the cyst heal properly. [11] X Research source Ask your doctor for detailed instructions on how to clean and care for your cyst at home. They may recommend putting a warm, dry compress over the area 3-4 times a day. If they applied a dressing, you will need to change it at least once a day until your doctor says you can stop using it. [12] X Research source If your doctor packed the cyst with gauze, you’ll need to return to have it removed after 2 days. Wash the wound with warm water once a day until it heals (usually within 5 days). If the cyst comes back, you might need to have surgery to remove it completely. For deep cysts, such as urachal cysts, the surgeon will probably make a tiny incision and remove the cyst using delicate instruments, guided by a camera. [13] X Research source You will likely need to stay in the hospital for 2-3 days after the surgery, and should be able to return to your regular activities in about 2 weeks.

They can use forceps to gently pull out the stone. In many cases, navel stones don’t cause any symptoms. Sometimes, however, they can cause sores and infections.
