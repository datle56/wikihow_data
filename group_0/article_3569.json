      "content": "Practice Zumba. Before you can teach Zumba, you will have to first master the style and choreography of the fitness program. If you haven't already, enroll in a Zumba class and attend at least 3-5 days per week. Be sure that you can keep up with Zumba classes of all different levels before you consider teaching a class. You must be in excellent physical condition to teach this or any other exercise class. Take Zumba classes at different studios and with different instructors. This will help you pick up on the various techniques, and choose what kind of teacher you want to be. Pay attention to which classes seem to attract the biggest group of students, and notice unique elements (whether it is the dance moves, music choice, or overall energy) that that particular instructor brings to the table. That's a good way to see what style you like. Try speaking with the instructor and ask them if they can share some tips as well. It's extremely important to have great communication with your classroom. Make eye contact with your participants and make sure that you're delivering the class for them more than for yourself. Be sure to learn how to read your class well. Ask for feedback and do your best to make everybody feel welcome and comfortable."
