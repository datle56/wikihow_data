While iTunes can play most protected audio files, you will be unable to recover unprotected versions through iTunes Match if the music is old enough or if you didn't purchase it to begin with. You can use a work-around by burning the protected music to a CD and then ripping the CD to MP3 in iTunes. There are a few caveats, however: You'll need to be authorized to play the protected M4P files in iTunes in the first place in order to burn it to a CD. There will be a small drop in quality. You'll want to use a CD-RW if possible if you have a lot of files to convert, otherwise you'll need a lot of blank CD-Rs. You can reuse a CD-RW up to 1000 times, which can be a lifesaver for large libraries."
