      "content": "Find the address you need. You will need to send your letter of recommendation to the admissions office at a college. If you're a student, you often have to provide your teacher with an addressed envelope when requesting a letter of recommendation, so make sure you know the proper address. [2] X Research source If you are a student, the address should be specified somewhere in the application instructions. You can also find the address of a college's admissions office online. However, you should call the office to double check this is the proper place to send application materials. If you are a teacher, your student should be able to provide you with this information. If your student cannot provide the information, you can also check online and call the admissions office."

[3] X Research source The first line of the address should say something like, \"Office of Admissions\" or \"Admissions Office.\" The second line should include which university the letter is being sent to, like \"Michigan Technological University.\" The third line should include the address of the admissions office. For example, \"123 Maddison Street.\" The last line should include the city, state, and zip code. For example, \"Houghton, Michigan 49931.\" You can also use your own computer or a typewriter to print address labels for an envelope. This may be a good idea if you have sloppy handwriting."

If you're filling out an application for a student, simply put your home address. [4] X Research source The first line should just be your name, or the name of your teacher. For example, \"Elizabeth Hart.\" The second line should include your address, or your teacher's address.

[5] X Research source In the lower left hand corner, write \"Re\" followed by a colon. From there, include some specific information about what the letter is regarding. You can write something like, \"Letter of Reference for Jane Meyers, fall admission.\" If you're applying to something like early admission, it may be a good idea to include that information as well."

Personalizing a letter always appears the most professional. [8] X Research source Your best option is to ask the student who requested you write the letter. The school your student is applying to may have provided him or her with specific information on addressing letters of recommendation. It's always best to ask the student first before attempting to write your salutation on your own. You also may be able to find the name of the head of admissions online. However, make sure the information is up-to-date. You do not want to address the letter to someone who is no longer affiliated with a given school."
