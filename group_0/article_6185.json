One study from 2020 showed evidence that cats blink slowly at humans when they feel positive emotions. [1] X Trustworthy Source Nature Respected Multidisciplinary Scientific Journal Go to source So when your cat slow-blinks at you, you can interpret those relaxed eye movements as subtle kisses, like when you covertly blow a kiss to someone you love from across the room."

      "content": "Purring If your cat always purrs when they're around you, that's their way of vocalizing happiness and contentment in your presence. Cats also purr for other reasons besides pleasure, though. They might purr to let you know they're hungry or want you to shower them with affection (especially when you come home after a long day of work or school). Additionally, studies have shown that cats purr at a frequency that promotes healing, so they might also purr to comfort you or themselves. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Bunting",
      "content": "Bunting A cat bunts when they press or butt their head against a person or an object and then rubs their cheeks on it. It's a common type of \"cat kiss\" felines use to mark people or things they like with pheromones, which they produce naturally in scent glands on their cheeks, lips, the top of their head, and their tail. The act of bunting helps cats bond with other creatures, including humans. So, if your cat does this, that means they love you and identify you as part of their family. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Sleeping on or close to you",
      "content": "Sleeping on or close to you Cats are most vulnerable when they're sleeping, so they're very careful about with whom they decide to bunk at night or during nap time. A sure sign of affection and trust from your cat is when they lie on top of or near you to sleep. [4] X Research source Even if they don't often give you other cat kisses like bunts or slow-blinks, they've at least determined you're safe for them to close their eyes around — which is basically as good as saying, \"I love you\" in the cat kingdom. Did you know? Cats also sleep next to you or on top of you for warmth. Your body heat helps them stay cozy and comfortable while they snooze."

      "title": "Kneading",
      "content": "Kneading Kittens knead (or make biscuits) on their mother's belly to stimulate the flow of milk through her nipples, so they can nurse . When these kittens grow up, they tend to knead their favorite people, too — not because they expect to get milk from you, but because they still associate \"making biscuits\" with feeling friendly and contented. [5] X Research source Even as your cat pokes you with their claws while they knead you, know that it comes from a place of true love."

      "title": "Raising their tails",
      "content": "Raising their tails Does your cat raise their tail high in the air and curl it at the end when they see you? If they do, science has shown 2 ways we can interpret this behavior. First, they raise their tails to show a desire to be friendly, which could mean they're also open to being petted (but not always; each cat differs in the kind of affection they want and when they want it). Second, they raise their tails in recognition of your higher ranking in the household. So a raised tail can mean that not only do they like you, but they also respect you. [6] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source That's a pretty big compliment coming from a cat! Your cat might also wrap their tail around your leg, sort of like a sideways hug. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Licking or grooming",
      "content": "Licking or grooming Most people think that licking and grooming is the closest a cat can get to giving a kiss like humans. We're not sure if cats think of it that way, but grooming you is nevertheless a good way to gauge what they think of you. Cats lick themselves (and others) with their sandpaper-like tongues to keep clean and also to socialize and bond. They won't groom another cat or a human they hate, so congratulations: if your cat licks you, you're on your cat's \"I don't hate you\" list!. [8] X Research source Did you know? Cats also groom one another to establish dominance without being aggressive. For example, the dominant cat in the household will lick cats in the \"lower ranks\" around the cheeks and neck — their most vulnerable body parts — on purpose to remind them who's boss."

      "title": "Bringing gifts",
      "content": "Bringing gifts Undomesticated cats regularly hunt for food such as birds or mice, kill it, and then bring it back to their den to share with their kittens or eat later. House cats tend to still have these instincts, but instead of live prey, they'll bring toys or trash they've \"caught\" to wherever their human is to share. But they're not just doing it because their instincts tell them to: they're also bringing you gifts because they love and care for you. [9] X Research source So, while it may seem weird, know that gifts are just another way your cat shows affection."

      "title": "Love biting",
      "content": "Love biting One \"cat kiss\" many humans misunderstand is the love bite. After all, why would a cat bite for any other reason except to express irritation or anger? While that can sometimes happen, love biting is different. It's a tiny little nibble that normally doesn't hurt much, if at all, nor does it typically break the skin. It's a behavior they learned from their mother, who would have nibbled on them when she was grooming them as kittens. [10] X Research source If your cat does this to you, try not to react harshly — they mean it as a sign of love, not aggression. Love bites can also be signs of encouragement. For example, your cat might give you a love bite when you've stopped petting them to tell you they want to keep going. If your cat bites you hard and breaks the skin, they may feel overstimulated and are warning you to stop whatever you're doing to them (such as petting them). Just stay calm, put your hands behind your back, and remove yourself from their vicinity as quickly as possible. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Nose touching",
      "content": "Nose touching Cats commonly touch noses with each other and will even touch their noses to their humans. This is another way they like to greet someone they're familiar with. Even cats that don't know each other will sometimes bump noses as a sign they're ready to be peaceful. [12] X Research source While it's not a \"kiss\" in the way we think of kisses, you can still take this behavior as a sign that your cat is happy to see you. Did you know? If your cat gives you most or all of the above \"kisses,\" they may have imprinted on you ! Imprinting is when a cat selects a specific person (or more than one person) as their favorite in the household."

Even though cats can't kiss the way humans can, experts think they still understand why humans kiss them with their lips. After spending enough time with a human who kisses them regularly, they likely interpret it as our way of leaving our scent on them — something cats do to humans and each other all the time.

      "content": "Some cats like kisses, whereas others would simply rather not be kissed. Even if a cat understands that humans use kisses to show their love, that doesn't mean the cat has to like it. Some cats do, and some don't; it just depends on their personality. Felines who enjoy being kissed might place their head close to your lips and rub against them. Those who'd rather not be kissed might lean away every time you try to come in close for a smooch. Read your cat's body language to determine whether they're open to kisses or not. Their mood might change throughout the day, too, so you may just have to wait until they're feeling more affectionate and docile. If your cat always leans away from you when you try to kiss them — or worse, if they bite or scratch you — check out other ways to show your cat affection below."

      "content": "Some cats give and enjoy hugs, whereas others couldn't care less. A hug from your cat might look like them wrapping their paws around your neck when you pick them up and hold them close. It might also look like them splaying their legs around you when they're laying on top of you. Your cat might also \"hug\" your arm or hand and bite it as a form of play — or to let you know they've had enough of your shenanigans! Each cat is different, so don't assume that every feline you come across is going to love hugs or being picked up. Some cats hate feeling confined in any way and won't appreciate you trying to hold them in your arms."

      "content": "Pet your cat on the head, neck, spine, and the base of their tail. There's an art to petting cats . According to DeVoss, \"[Cats] like to have the side of their face rubbed, chin scratched, ears rubbed, and sometimes the top of [their] head scratched.\" They may also enjoy it when you pet or scratch them from their head to the base of their tail — \"and some will even raise their hind end in response to show you they like it,\" DeVoss adds. Avoid petting your cat's belly unless they let you do so without biting you or wriggling away. \"Most cats don’t like to be touched on the stomach or under belly, \"says DeVoss, since \"these are areas of vulnerability.\" DeVoss also suggests gently rubbing and handling your cat's feet and toes when they're kittens. This makes cutting their nails when they're older a lot easier."

      "content": "Slow-blink at them. Look at your cat from across the room or close up, make eye contact, and slowly blink your eyes open and shut a few times. If your cat slow-blinks in response, you may have just successfully communicated with them in their \"cat kiss\" language. If they look away, though, don't be discouraged! They may not have seen your blinks (cats are a bit farsighted, says Dr. Bourquin, so you might be too close to them), or they may not understand what you're trying to do. Just keep trying. Dr. Bourquin says that sometimes just being near them and blinking at them is enough to make your cat feel appreciated. \"[T]hey may not want to be loved up and down,\" he says, \"but they may be happy just being in your presence.\""

While that can be true to a certain degree, cats still need attention, and playing with them with their favorite toys is one of the easiest ways to bond with them. Set aside some time every day to throw their ball or mouse for them or use a fishing pole-style toy with feathers at the end to get them moving. [14] X Research source"

But remember that cats sleep with people they love and trust. If you want to reciprocate, consider letting them join you in bed at night or during naptime. If you don't want them to sleep on your or your sheets, make them their own bed to sleep in and train them to use it."

Cat treats tend to have a high amount of calories, so it's usually not a good idea to give your feline lots of treats on top of their regular meals. [15] X Research source But a little bit of a treat now and then is a good way to get on your cat's good side. It also gives them something to look forward to and helps them associate you with something positive. Limit your cat's daily treat intake to 10% of their total diet."

      "content": "Stop giving them affection when they clearly don't want it. With some cats, the best way to show affection is simply not to give it to them. That may sound counterintuitive, but most cats don't like being petted and scratched all day long. Pay attention to the signals your cat gives you when they're ready for you to leave them alone. For example, Dr. Bourquin says, \"if the cat at any point starts whisking their tail back and forth\" or \"the ears starts to flatten,\" stop whatever you're doing to them and back off."

It may not be pleasant to think about, but your house cat licks and eats a lot of things that you really, really don't want to live in your mouth. They groom themselves all over their bodies (and we do mean all over ). They use a litter box and eat things that would make a human sick (like raw meat or bugs). They can also develop bacteria in their mouths, which aren't harmful to them but can cause infections in humans. [16] X Research source Bottom line: if you do kiss your cat, stick to kissing the top of their head and stay away from their mouths."
