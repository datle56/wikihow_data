To clean your lid in the dishwasher, place it on the upper rack with the bottom of the lid facing down. Always make sure that your lid has cooled down after cooking with it before placing it in the dishwasher, or you’ll risk burning your hands. You don’t need to wash it after every use, but a dishwashing cycle will help prevent odors and residue buildup after multiple meals have been prepared with it."

[6] X Research source The anti-block shield is the small knob on the interior of your lid. It has six small holes punched into it. It leads steam to the release valve so it occasionally gets condensation trapped in it. The steam release valve is the small black lever on top of your lid. It’s the mechanism that releases excess steam, so it can get quite moist and dirty. The condensation collector is the small clear container affixed to the side of your lid. This piece collects run-off condensation from your pot, so it’s often exposed to food particles."
