      "content": "Fold your pages in half and stack them folded. Make sure the fold is crisp by using a bone folder or running the top of your nail over it to smooth it down. You can fold pages individually or fold multiple pages together. Folding individual pages is better as it will ensure each page is folded precisely, but folding multiple pages at once will save you time. Stack the pages together folded, not open. If you have too many pages to fold crisply, try creating packets of signatures. A signature is a group of 4 sheets folded down the center. [1] X Research source Most books are folded hamburger style (i.e., by folding the shorter ends of the paper together), but you can fold however you want."

      "title": "Open your pages and staple them together at the crease.",
      "content": "Open your pages and staple them together at the crease. Be sure to staple with the crease facing down, so the flat part of the staple faces out and the staple “arms” rest on the inside of the crease. Use a long reach stapler if your regular stapler can’t reach the middle crease. Staple your pages 3 time at even intervals. [2] X Research source If you made signatures, staple each signature separately and then stack your stapled signatures. Leave the stack unstapled."

      "content": "Use a pencil to mark a 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) margin. If you don’t give yourself a large enough margin, some of the page’s contents may be obscured. Any words printed within 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of the crease will become part of the binding and therefore be impossible to read. [3] X Research source If you’re binding a book of material printed from Microsoft Word, make sure your pages have a “gutter” margin of about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) before you print them. The gutter margin is the inside margin, the margin that will be partially obscured when the book is bound. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut a piece of binding tape about 2 inches (5.1 cm) longer than your book. Make sure your tape is strong enough to hold the book together— linen tape or cotton tape will give your book the support it needs. Your tape can be colorful or simple: it won’t be seen once the book is finished. [5] X Research source Avoid using masking tape or clear tape. These tapes won't be strong enough to support your book."

      "content": "Apply the tape lengthwise to the spine, with half the tape on each cover. Instead of attempting to place the tape on the book, place the tape on a flat surface sticky-side up and press the book into it: this will ensure you maintain a straight, even tape line. Press the book into the middle of the tape, and fold the rest of the tape to cover the other side of the book. [6] X Research source If your book is thick, leave a larger margin of tape so you have enough tape to cover the spine and still reach the other side. Use your fingers to press the tape around the book’s spine so that it covers both the bottom of the book, the spine, and the top of the book. If your book has many pages or several signatures, you might want to tape it more than once to reinforce it. Repeat the process of taping the book until the book’s binding feels secure."

If you printed your pages using Microsoft Word, you should automatically have 1 inch (2.5 cm) of border. If you wrote your pages by hand, make sure the writing has a margin. If you don’t have a margin, any words on the left-hand edge will be impossible to read. [8] X Trustworthy Source Read Write Think Online collection of reading and writing resources for teachers and students.

      "content": "Use a ruler to measure how long the spine is and divide it by 6. This bookbinding method requires 5 holes at the crease. They should be equally spread apart, but the spacing between the dots will depend on how large your paper is. For example, if you have a paper that’s 8.5 by 11 in (22 by 28 cm) printer paper, dividing that by 6 gives you 1.4 inches (3.6 cm), meaning you'd space your holes 1.4 inches (3.6 cm) apart. If you know your page measurements, you don’t have to measure. If you don’t know, or if you’re not using a standard page size, make sure you measure precisely."

These dots are known as stations, with the first station being the one on the “bottom” of the page and the fifth station being the one on the “top” of the page. For example, if you have a paper that’s 8.5 by 11 inches (22 by 28 cm), your first dot will be 1.4 inches (3.6 cm) from the edge. Then, each progressive dot will be 1.4 inches (3.6 cm) up from the previous dot. Your fifth dot should be 1.4 inches (3.6 cm) away from the top of the page."

Hold the remaining thread with your non-dominant hand to make sure you don’t accidentally pull too much through. Leave the rest of the thread on the spool for now to ensure you have enough to stitch the whole spine. You can use whatever color thread you like, but remember your thread will be visible!"

Running tape along the spine edge of each piece of paper you will be binding will help reduce the chances that your stitching will tear out. Place half of the tape on one side of each piece of paper, and fold it over to the other side. Repeat with every page. [15] X Research source In single sheet binding, you don’t fold your pages like you do for other bookbinding methods, but this means that you run the risk of the stitching tearing out of your pages if they are not reinforced well enough.
