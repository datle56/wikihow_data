      "content": "Determine your budget. Before you look for a hotel and make a reservation , you want to ensure the hotel will meet your budget and your needs. You should first determine your budget , or how much you can spend, when booking a hotel room. This will help you narrow down your search and be efficient with the time you spend looking for a hotel and booking a room. [1] X Research source Having a limited budget does not mean you will end up staying in a cheap, dirty hotel. In fact, there are many discount options available for visitors on a budget. On the flip side, you may be travelling for work and have the ability to expense your accommodations to your company’s account. In this case, an affordable hotel rate may not be as much of a priority for you."

If you are traveling with your family, you may need two queen beds and one large bathroom. If you are traveling solo, you may just need one queen bed and one decently sized bathroom. [2] X Research source If you require disability facilities, call the hotel to confirm if they are wheelchair accessible or offer disability amenities. Consider whether or not you require extra amenities, such as a spa or a fitness center. If you need a solid internet connection, look at hotels that offer free Wi-Fi as part of the nightly rate. If you are traveling as a family or in a big group, you might want to consider booking a suite with separate living area and bedroom so that the whole group can be accommodated without space and privacy constraints."
