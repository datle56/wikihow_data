      "content": "AMRAP is an acronym that stands for “as many reps as possible.” It’s a high-intensity workout model where you do as many reps of a given exercise as you can in a set amount of time, instead of just finishing a predetermined number of reps. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source It also sometimes stands for “as many rounds as possible.” In this case, a “round” is a series of workouts, and you try to cycle through the series as many times as possible. AMRAPs are mostly used for measuring your fitness abilities, but can also be used as rigorous workouts that target specific muscle groups or fitness goals. AMRAP workouts can be focused on cardio, strength training, or a mix of the two. Sometimes, “AMRAP” is followed by a number, like “AMRAP 4.” This number indicates how many minutes to perform the reps or rounds for."

Trainers often have you do a round of AMRAPs once to see what fitness level you’re at, then they’ll have you do it again later. By comparing your results, you can see exactly how far you’ve come, and how much further you need to go to reach your goals.

When you’re pushing those goals to the limit, you’ll inevitably see more growth and better results.

      "content": "AMRAPs can adjust to any level of fitness. How many reps you can do will be different than how many someone else can do, and that’s okay! You’ll still be getting a workout of the same intensity when that intensity is maxed out, only your workout will naturally be adjusted for your own body and abilities. That means AMRAPs are useful for both fitness beginners and long-time pros. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "AMRAPs give you both strength and cardio training. AMRAP workouts tend to focus on either cardio or strength, or both. But even when you’re focusing on just one, going all-out makes it a test of stamina and endurance, meaning a cardio workout also starts to train your muscles, and a strength workout starts to train your stamina and cardio abilities.

      "content": "Go slow at first. Yes, the goal is to see how many reps or rounds you can do, but you’re only competing against yourself! Those reps won’t have good form or maximal benefits if they’re sloppy, and you may end up injuring yourself if you’re in a rush.
