      "content": "Scrape off any old caulk. If your toilet already has a caulk seal around the base, remove it rather than applying new caulk directly over it. Run a caulk removal tool along the joint between the toilet and the floor to scrape it out, or use a utility or razor knife to loosen the caulk at one end. Aim to pull it up in 1 long strip.

      "title": "Clean the base of the toilet.",
      "content": "Clean the base of the toilet. After clearing the joint of any caulk, scoop out any debris, such as paint chips, dirt, or rust, to get the area as clean as possible. Use a general purpose bathroom cleaner and a rag to clean in and around the joint. The cleaner you can get the area, the better of a seal you’ll be able to apply. After cleaning, wipe the area with rubbing alcohol to disinfect it. [2] X Research source Press a tissue around the base of the toilet to check for moisture. If you find a leak, remove the toilet and replace the wax ring before continuing. If any water or other liquid gets in the joint, do your best to dry it. If you can’t quite reach it, let it dry completely (typically overnight) before applying the caulk. Caulking over liquid will trap it, which can damage your flooring. Ensure the toilet is even and tight to the floor. If it moves, tighten the bolts or use a shim to straighten it out. Don’t use the caulk to secure the toilet to the floor if it’s loose or uneven."

      "title": "Apply masking tape to the floor.",
      "content": "Apply masking tape to the floor. Not only will this help you get a straighter, smoother seal, but it will prevent any caulk from getting on your floors. Put masking tape on either side of the joint, one following the toilet’s base and the other along the floor. If you’re worried about your caulking abilities, use a second strip on either side to double the width of the masking tape and protect more of your floors. [3] X Research source Since most toilets have a round base, you’ll probably have to use several strips of tape to properly follow the curve. Tear up pieces a few inches long and apply them to the floor, following the curve of the toilet’s base. Alternatively, buy curved masking tape that is more flexible than typical tape. This will save some time when taping your floor."

      "title": "Choose 100% silicone caulk.",
      "content": "Choose 100% silicone caulk. This caulk is best for use on a toilet because it’s more water-resistant than other types of caulk, like acrylic. Silicone caulk is typically a bit more expensive than other types, but that extra money will save you the problems that come with an improper seal. Look for the phrase “waterproof” on the tube.

      "content": "Insert the caulk tube into a caulk gun. Cut the tip off of the caulk tube and puncture the end with the metal rod attached to the gun. While the tube holds the sealant, the caulk gun is what allows you to deliver it. At the back of the gun’s body, push the metal release (usually shaped like a trigger) forward to pull back the plunger. Then, insert the caulk tube and push the plunger into the back of the tube.

      "content": "Pull the caulk gun along the joint between the toilet and floor. To use a caulk gun , pull on the trigger and keep the caulk gun at a 45-degree angle. Move the gun slowly and smoothly around the base of the toilet, keeping consistent pressure on the trigger. Do this around the whole toilet, leaving a small gap at the back of it. [6] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Department of Energy Official site for the U.S. Department of Energy, which provides resources related to energy safety, conservation, and efficiency Go to source Use the hand not holding the gun to press the tip of the caulk tube against the joint to ensure that the caulk is pushed into the joint. Pushing the caulk rather than pulling it along will make it more difficult to create a consistent seal. Leaving an unsealed gap at the back of the toilet allows the air to circulate. If there’s a leak, it prevents the water from getting trapped under the caulk where you can’t see it. To prevent caulk from dribbling onto your floors, keep a piece of cardboard nearby to lay the gun on if you need to stop for any reason. If you have trouble getting the caulk gun behind the toilet, try using caulk in a squeeze tube for more flexibility"

This also allows you to scoop off any extra caulk, resulting in a cleaner joint. Dip your finger in water or rubbing alcohol if you’re worried about the caulk sticking to your finger. Discard any caulk buildup directly into the garbage, or collect it on a piece of cardboard to dispose of later.

If you're having trouble smoothing the caulk down with your finger, Fricke recommends pushing the bead line down with masking tape. He says to “get it nice and smooth,” then remove the tape before the caulk gets tacky. You should have a perfect caulk line without as much of a mess.

If you got caulk on the tape, be careful as you peel it to avoid spilling the sealant on your floors. Masking tape usually shouldn’t leave any sticky residue, but if it does, use a product like Goo Gone to get rid of it. [9] X Research source"
