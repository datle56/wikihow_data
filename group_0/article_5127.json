If you can, put your money into a bank account. This way, you will accrue interest. Talk to your employer and/or bank about setting up an automatic transfer. If you never see the money coming out of your paycheck in the first place, you're a lot less likely to miss it."

      "content": "Figure out your budget . Work out how many people you want to give a gift to and how much money you have. Stick with your budget. Don't dilly-dally or use the budget as a rough estimate; a budget is a promise, so keep it. [2] X Research source Use software to help you budget. In the age of the internet, budgeting has become easier, faster, and more intuitive. Use budgeting software to help you meet your goals! Don't count on windfalls or bonuses.

      "content": "Think about making gifts. It is the thought that counts for gifts and not how much money you spent on it. [3] X Research source Make a necklace for your sister, or a stuffed animal for your baby cousin. Here are some other items to consider crafting if you're that sort of person: A leather-bound scrapbook or sketchbook is easier than you might think. A trivet using leftover wine cork, assembled into a nice snowflake or star pattern. Turn a mason jar into a quirky, retro lamp. Make flower lights out of an egg carton simply and quickly. Great for lasting holiday value! A wreath or other door-decorations for that special person to show their holiday spirit."

      "content": "If you have the time, look for items you have but don't want. One man's trash is another man's treasure, but only if that treasure is still intact, useful, and respectable. You don't want to give anyone a broken faucet just because it's lying around your garage. Once you run out of money, that's it. Don't justify spending extra money because it's such a great deal or you have to have it. Find other, creative ways to get around the money constraint."

      "title": "Figure out the personality of the person you're buying a gift for.",
      "content": "Figure out the personality of the person you're buying a gift for. Buying a gift successfully depends on knowing what the person likes. That may seem like a no-brainer, but we often buy gifts that we think are cool or appealing. Always keep the perspective of the gift recipient in mind. [4] X Research source For example, if your cousin is a music promoter, consider getting her a CD or vinyl LP of an up-and-coming artist that she might enjoy. If, for example, your brother is an avid explorer, consider getting him a travel guide or a photography book about a place he's interested in going to. Balance out the interests of the gift recipients with the need to stay frugal. You can get your friends and loved ones great, appropriate gifts without breaking the bank."

      "title": "Find out what the person has and doesn't have.",
      "content": "Find out what the person has and doesn't have. Peruse their room, office, or closet for items. This will give you both an idea of what the person likes, and what the person doesn't already have. Ask yourself when you do a little reconnaissance if the person is technology-oriented, book-, music- or media-oriented, travel-oriented, food-oriented, or any number of other interests. Ask the gift recipient's family or friends what sort of gifts they think the person might want to receive. Sometimes, you won't be able to snoop your way through their closet like Sherlock."
