      "content": "Soak the rice for 30 minutes to reduce cooking time and boost flavor. If you’d like, pour enough warm water over your rice to cover it 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm). Soak the rice for 20 to 30 minutes, then pour the rice through a fine sieve to drain the water. Soaking is optional, but it will reduce your cooking time by about 20 percent. Shorter cooking time will result in more flavorful rice."

If, for instance, you’re cooking 1 cup (240 mL) of rice, use 2 cups (470 mL) of water. Pour the water into a medium pot, add a pinch of salt, then bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. [2] X Research source If you want to make 4 servings, use 1 cup (240 mL) of rice and 2 cups (470 mL) of water. Divide those measurements in half to make 2 servings or multiply them by 2 to make 8 servings. Just stick to the 2 parts water to 1 part rice ratio."

[3] X Research source If you soaked the rice, remember to drain it through a fine sieve before adding it to the boiling water. Add soaked rice slowly to the boiling water to avoid splashing. It will have absorbed some of the water, so it'll be a little heavier than rice that hasn't been soaked."

If you have unsoaked converted rice, it’ll only need to cook for 20 to 25 minutes. If you soaked the rice, cook it for 15 to 20 minutes.

While American-style converted rice is precooked, other parboiled varieties actually need to be cooked longer than regular white rice. These varieties need to be cooked for around 45 minutes.

Stir the ingredients together in a microwave-safe container. You'll need to cover the rice while it cooks, so use a container with a lid. The rice will expand when it cooks, so make sure the uncooked rice and water fill the container less than halfway. Use 1 cup (240 mL) of rice and 2 cups (470 mL) of water to make 4 servings. Stick to the 2 parts water to 1 part rice ratio if you need more or less than 4 servings.
