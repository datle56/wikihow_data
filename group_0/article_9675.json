      "title": "Purchase earring converters.",
      "content": "Purchase earring converters. You can buy earring converters online or your local craft store. The converters are usually located in the jewelry making area. Look for a converter that has a small tube/barrel on the back. [1] X Research source Most posts will fit into the barrel of the converter, but check the size of your posts just to be sure."
    },
    {
      "title": "Insert the post into the barrel.",
      "content": "Insert the post into the barrel. Slide the post into the barrel of the converter. Then bend the post about 90Â°. Bending the post will make your earrings have a more natural position on your ear. Use a slow steady motion to bend the posts. If the posts are kind of thick, bend them with pliers before you insert them into the barrel. Once you bend the posts, the earrings cannot be used as pierced earrings anymore."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try a no bend converter.",
      "content": "Try a no bend converter. If you do not want to bend the post or would still like the option of wearing them as a pierced earring, you can use a no bend converter. Simply place the post in the barrel and then put the earrings on. The earrings will sit below your earlobe. Pierced stud earrings usually sit around the middle of your earlobe so it may look a little weird if you use this type of converter. [2] X Research source Drop and dangle earrings with posts are better suited for no bend converters."

      "title": "Purchase fish hook converters.",
      "content": "Purchase fish hook converters. Go online or visit the jewelry section of your local craft store. Look for converters that are made for fish hook earrings. These converters replace the pierced earring hook instead of working in conjunction with the pierced earring. [3] X Research source These converters will have a small extra hoop in the front that will be used to attach the earring."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the fish hook.",
      "content": "Remove the fish hook. Use jewelry pliers to gently remove the piece that goes through your ear. Open the small hoop on the converter and place it around the hole on the pierced earring. Use the pliers to close the loop. Your earrings are now ready to wear. [4] X Research source If you do not want to remove the fish hook, you can use a hoop converter instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a hoop converter.",
      "content": "Use a hoop converter. A hoop converter is a thin metal hoop that you attach to the pierced earring. If you use this with a fish hook earing, use your pliers to close the opening of the pierced earring first. Once the fish hook is closed, hang it on the hoop converter. [5] X Research source This method is one of the quickest. The pierced earring remains intact because you do not have to remove any pieces. Keep in mind that this type of converter will add extra length to your earrings. If the pierced earrings are heavy, you may want to use a fish hook converter instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use clip-on cushions.",
      "content": "Use clip-on cushions. Go to a jewelry store or to any store that sells jewelry and purchase clip-on earring cushions. Some of the cushions use adhesive to stick to the clips. Other cushions slide over the clips to create some extra padding for your ears. If using adhesive pads, the foam should be placed on the part of the clip that touches the back of your ear lobe. [6] X Research source Most of these cushions are reusable. You can also use adhesive backed foam pads from the hardware or craft store. Cut the pads to whatever size you need."
    },
    {
      "title": "Loosen the tongue.",
      "content": "Loosen the tongue. The most common types of clip on converters are paddle-back clip-ons. These clip-ons have a metal tongue that makes your clip-ons fit nice and tight. If your ears are hurting, use a pair of tweezers, a thin screw driver, or a clip-on comfort key to gently lift the tongue. Lift the tongue a little bit and then try your earrings on to see how they feel. Continue to do this until you find a fit that is snug yet comfortable. If you loosen the tongue too much, your earrings will not stay on your ear. Lifting the tongue too quickly can cause the tongue to break off. A comfort key is a special tool used for adjusting clip-on earrings. You should be able to find one wherever you bought your other supplies."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear for short periods of time.",
      "content": "Wear for short periods of time. If cushions and/or loosening the tongue does not help, you may need to limit the amount of time you wear your earrings. Your earrings may feel fine for the first few hours that you wear them and begin to hurt later. Also, you may be able to wear some earrings all day and others for only a few hours. It may be helpful to wear your clips-ons around the house first to see how your ears feel over time. Then you will know your limits for each pair of earrings that you have."

    {
      "title": "Clean your ears and earrings.",
      "content": "Clean your ears and earrings. To clean your earrings, mix one drop of baby shampoo with water and use a cotton swab or soft toothbrush to clean. Quickly rinse with cool water and use a hairdryer on cool setting or a soft hand towel to dry. There is no hard and fast rule for cleaning earrings, but the earrings you wear more should be cleaned more frequently. [7] X Research source Avoid using anything acidic like vinegar or baking soda to clean. If you notice any green stuff on your earrings, use a toothpick, soft toothbrush, or cotton swab to remove it. Put rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball or pad to clean your ears. This will remove any germs."
