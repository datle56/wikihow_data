      "content": "A CQ is an open-ended call that anyone can answer. Usually, when you use ham radio, you’re talking to specific other users. When you call CQ, though, you’re sending out a message and inviting anyone who hears it to speak to you on that frequency. [1] X Research source Think of it like calling a pay phone in a city—you never know who might pick up! It’s unclear why CQ became the code for an open call, but you can remember it because it sounds like “seek you.”"

      "content": "Look for a clear frequency by asking, \"Is this frequency in use?\" You should only call CQ on frequencies that aren’t in use. Otherwise, you may be interrupting other users. Find your desired frequency, then say, “Is this frequency in use?” Then identify yourself by your callsign by saying, “This is [your callsign]”. [2] X Research source Wait about 20-30 seconds for a response, then say it again, just to be sure. If the frequency is already in use, try a different frequency. If you’re on CW, or continuous wave, use the code “QRL?” to ask this."

      "title": "Start your call with, “CQ CQ Calling CQ. This is [your call sign].”",
      "content": "Start your call with, “CQ CQ Calling CQ. This is [your call sign].” When you give your call sign, spell the phonetic name, as well, so that other users can clearly identify you. For example: [3] X Research source \"CQ CQ Calling CQ. This is ABC123, Alpha-Bravo-Charlie-One-Two-Three.\" To request to speak with a foreign operator, you might say, “CQ DX CQ DX Calling CQ DX.” DX is the code for foreign stations. When you do this, also give your own location."

      "content": "Include your reason for calling, or your location, if you like. If you’re calling for a particular reason, like for a contest, also say that, then repeat the CQ call. You can also include your location, if you want. For example: “CQ CQ Calling CQ. This is ABC123, Alpha-Bravo-Charlie-One-Two-Three. Calling for wikiHow contest. My location is California. CQ CQ Calling CQ. This is ABC123.” [4] X Research source Or say, “Calling for anyone, anywhere,” to make it clear that anyone at all is welcome to respond.” When giving your location, it’s also best to spell out the location phonetically. Location can also be called with the code QTH."

      "content": "Wait 30-60 seconds to call again, and call up to 3 times. Give anyone else on the frequency a little time to respond. Generally, ham radio users will try to call CQ 3 times on a frequency. If nobody responds in 3 calls, there’s probably nobody on that frequency. Feel free to switch to another frequency if nobody responds. Just remember to ask if the frequency is clear first!"

      "content": "Enjoy your talk, and end your conversation with your call sign. Talk about anything you like, from what equipment you’re using to the weather to asking the other operator about their day. Generally, though, ham radio operators avoid subjects of politics and religion. When you’re done, say both your own call sign and the other operator’s, and say “signing off.” [5] X Research source It’s also customary to sign off with the code 73, which means “best regards.” For example, you might say, “Good talking to you, XYZ123; this is ABC123 signing off, seven-three.” You may also want to give a signal report, to give the other operator more information about you."

[6] X Research source For example: “ABC123 ABC123, this is XYZ789, Xray-Yankee-Zulu-Seven-Eight-Nine.” If you’re joining a conversation in progress, mention any call signs you’ve already heard.

If they don’t, feel free to dive in yourself."
