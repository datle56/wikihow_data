      "content": "Decide what sort of YouTube account you'll have. Do you upload music videos? Do you make funny videos? Are you going to do tutorials? Are you a stand-up comedian? Do you tell stories? Choose whichever one you like to do. It can just be a mix up of everything also. [1] X Research source One way is to get inspired by others. Watch the funniest videos on YouTube. Then think about ways to mix them up, making parodies or remixes. Choose anything you basically love to watch, taking note of what your friends find funny too."

      "title": "Show off your own talents.",
      "content": "Show off your own talents. If you know some dance moves, sing well, can tell a great tale, etc., keep practicing your art to become even better at it. When you feel ready, think about making videos of you showing your friends how to do whatever it is you're excellent at. For example, if it's dance, make a movie about the moves, or create a video dance that is brand new (it might turn into a popular dance if it goes viral)."

      "title": "Create your channel.",
      "content": "Create your channel. Decorate it however you like, and make it original! Don’t make the text hard to read. Don't use a white background with yellow text, or blue background with purple text. A white background with black text usually works best. [2] X Research source Pick a good profile name. For example, don't put your name but a weird or witty sounding name. Don't make it too long; most people won't type a 94- letter long name. Use a good profile picture. Don't make it too dumb, because people won't think what you want them to think, and don't make it too cool, because people will know that you got that off the internet. Make your profile photo you or something not too funny."

      "title": "Create a video with the info you want.",
      "content": "Create a video with the info you want. If you want to make a tutorial, make it simple and easy. If you want to make a funny video, do random things, and use the jump cut effect. If you make tutorials, don't make them look complicated and hard. Use clear, short instructions and promise that the end result is something anyone can manage."

    {
      "title": "Edit the video.",
      "content": "Edit the video. Here is where you ensure the jump cuts. Cut all of the things that you don’t want. Make sure that it looks professional and is easy on the eye and ear. Less is often more. Keep that in mind."

      "title": "Be aware of what tends to catch people's eye.",
      "content": "Be aware of what tends to catch people's eye. When deciding whether to watch a new video (especially from a new YouTuber), people want a catchy title. Additionally: Include a catchy introduction fanfare at the beginning of every video. This will make your videos seem more professional and interesting. It also helps to build your brand if you use something that identifies your videos each time. You can also include an outtake at the end of each video. Introduce yourself and to say your name clearly so viewers will understand you. If they like your video and know who it's by (you), they will watch more. Talk with ease and laugh a little at your mistakes. Depending on how interesting they are, you could even make bloopers at the end. Sure people will laugh at you, but you will most likely get a thumbs up."

      "title": "Make one or more videos each week.",
      "content": "Make one or more videos each week. When someone searches a video, there is a tab under the title saying \"NEW\". Once a week passes, the tab will vanish. Most people want a YouTuber who is current on YouTube. [4] X Research source Keep your videos short. Most people don't have time for a 46-minute video. Even if they do, they will probably stop it in the middle of your video."

      "content": "Approach \"baiting\" carefully. Clickbait refers to all the methods you can use to encourage viewers to view your video. [5] X Research source Use this aggressive tool at the right level: too little will not attract people and too much will give you a bad reputation. The goal is to promise impressive content to the viewer. The limit is not to promise more than your video actually provides. On YouTube, clickbait mostly concerns the thumbnail and the title."

    {
      "title": "Use the title to spotlight the most notable features of your video.",
      "content": "Use the title to spotlight the most notable features of your video. Do not summarize all of your content—only spotlight the most unusual part to make your video unique. It's not important if the title does not describe the entire content. It only cites the reason why the video deserves to be viewed. Example: you have made a ten-minute video on body training but at 7:23, you have broken the bar."

      "title": "Use emotional features in your title.",
      "content": "Use emotional features in your title. To create clickbait, you have to search what makes the people react. People react to animals, deaths, births, accidents... If your video is related to this, put the most emotional element in the title."

      "title": "Use shocking concepts, within reason.",
      "content": "Use shocking concepts, within reason. In western civilization, most people share common values. A video talking about (not supporting) controversial ideas is likely to intrigue the people, make the people react, and make them click on the video. Cite any destabilizing facts mentioned in the video."

      "title": "Use the thumbnail to spotlight the most important features.",
      "content": "Use the thumbnail to spotlight the most important features. As with the title, keep the key elements. Choose symbols or iconic images to instantly describe the subject. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Zoom to the most important elements.",
      "content": "Zoom to the most important elements. It's okay if the thumbnail is not realistic—it's only a symbolic representation of the content of the video. A thumbnail is small. The viewer should be able to quickly identify the elements. Example: feature your head and a ball if you are talking about soccer, even if the proportions are not respected."

      "content": "Tell all your friends and family about your channel. Tell everyone to check your videos out. Also, subscribe and send friend requests to a bunch of people on YouTube.

      "title": "Make lots of good quality and interesting videos.",
      "content": "Make lots of good quality and interesting videos. The more interesting they are, the more people will be attracted to them. And if there are lots, people will start to take you seriously as someone who is willing to keep feeding their interest. Usually, good quality videos are considered to be 720p HD or 1080 p HD."

      "title": "Focus your video content to what is popular.",
      "content": "Focus your video content to what is popular. That way, it might be mentioned in popular channels. For example, if you make something that is an epic fail, submit it to FailBlog and with a little luck, you can be mentioned on FailBlog and maybe RayWilliamJohnson!"

    {
      "title": "Don't leave your fans hanging.",
      "content": "Don't leave your fans hanging. Once you get a decent amount of views, make and add more content on a regular basis. Make videos focused on you, your friends, pranks, randomness, etc. Or keep building on your original storyline, such as the adventures of your puppy, the learning curve you experience cooking healthy food, or the challenges you've set yourself to learn something new. Respond to comments and messages so you can interact with your fans."

      "content": "Market your brand. Making the video and setting up a channel isn't enough. You have to market your \"brand\" too, so that you get known by people beyond your circle of friends and beginner fans. Subscribe to these people; it's an implied way of suggesting they owe you for subscribing! If you personally know a popular YouTuber, ask them to give you a shoutout on their videos."

      "title": "Be persistent and patient.",
      "content": "Be persistent and patient. It can take a while to build up popularity and it really is a waiting game. If you think too hard about being popular, it can do your head in and you may give up. Instead, keep persevering, adding quality material, and expect more interest in about six to twelve months' time. Of course, after a year has passed, if you're not well known despite doing all you can, you need to reassess what you're doing."
