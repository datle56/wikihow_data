      "content": "The phrase “back to the grind” evolved from slang usage of the word “grind.” Literally, “grinding” something means breaking it down into small pieces or powder by pressing it between two hard surfaces (like grinding pepper or coffee, or grinding a sharp edge to make it smooth). [2] X Research source Because the process of grinding can be repetitive, monotonous, or difficult, many people adopted the term “daily grind” to refer to their regular routine at work or school. [3] X Research source Getting “back to the grind” therefore means getting back to this routine. The earliest recorded use of the term “daily grind” was in 1853. [4] X Research source “Back to the grind” may also be related to the common expression “on the grind,” which means to work tirelessly and relentlessly toward a certain goal. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Try to schedule a “catch-up day” before your official return. Instead of jumping right back into work or school after taking time off, try to schedule a buffer day to ease yourself back into your routine. For example, if you get back from a 2-week long international trip on a Tuesday night, don’t try to return to work the next morning—this is bound to make the transition difficult. If you can, take Wednesday off, too, and use the day to get everything back in order before your return to work.

Instead of scheduling lots of activities or social outings on the last day of your break, keep that day free to take care of any tasks or chores you need to get done before work or school. [7] X Research source This will help you get back into a productive mindset and make the transition from relaxation mode to work mode much less jarring."

Remember, breaks and time off are a normal part of life, and research shows that they are actually beneficial for your performance and productivity.
