      "title": "Create your own Barbie mansion to play house with Barbie.",
      "content": "Create your own Barbie mansion to play house with Barbie. If you bought a playhouse just for Barbie, great! If not, empty a bookshelf or stack empty boxes on top of one another on their sides to create your own. You can fill it with furniture and have Barbie decorate her home, use her kitchen, lounge in her bedroom, or chat with friends in her living room. [1] X Research source Have Barbie throw a dinner party in her home, inviting other dolls and eating great food. Barbie could host a sleepover at her house and watch a funny movie."

      "content": "Turn Barbie into a doctor to have her help patients. Pretend that Barbie is a doctor or nurse and create an office for her to see sick patients. Use other dolls or toys to be the sick patients, and have Barbie check their throat, ears, nose, temperature, and breathing to see if she can help them get better. Pretend Barbie is a surgeon and is operating on another doll to save its life, or have Barbie fix up another doll’s broken arm or ankle."

      "title": "Take Barbie to the beach by playing in a sandy spot.",
      "content": "Take Barbie to the beach by playing in a sandy spot. Use an outdoor sandbox, sandy section of your yard, or build your own beach by pouring sand into a plastic tub indoors. Let Barbie relax on a towel under a beach umbrella in the sand while she reads a book or talks to a friend. [2] X Research source Use a piece of fabric or a washcloth as Barbie’s beach towel. Put Barbie in her bathing suit so she can soak up some sun. Create a beach umbrella using a decorative drink umbrella, or by cutting an umbrella shape out of paper and sticking a toothpick or pencil through the middle. Add a small tub of water next to the sand to create an “ocean.”"

      "title": "Send Barbie to the hair salon to fix up her hair.",
      "content": "Send Barbie to the hair salon to fix up her hair. To smooth out any tangles in Barbie’s hair, dip her hair in a mixture of fabric softener and water and then use a brush to brush out the tangles. Curl Barbie’s hair using pipe cleaners and hot water, or dye her hair with food coloring mixed with water. [3] X Research source To curl Barbie’s hair, take small sections of her hair and roll each section up on a small piece of pipe cleaner, just as you would real hair curlers. Dip her hair in hot water and let it dry. Mix a drop or 2 of food coloring in a bowl of water before dipping Barbie’s hair into the colored water. This works best if Barbie has blonde hair."

      "title": "Let Barbie be a teacher to teach other dolls new things.",
      "content": "Let Barbie be a teacher to teach other dolls new things. Set up a school room with rows of chairs and desks for the doll students to sit and learn, and have Barbie write lessons on a chalkboard to teach everyone things like math, science, or foreign languages. You can even create small books for everyone to read and learn from! Barbie doesn’t just have to be a school teacher - have her teach other dolls how to ride a horse, how to make a cake, or how to swim. Tape a piece of paper up on the wall to use as the chalkboard. Make books by cutting paper into sections that are roughly 1 in (2.5 cm) wide and 2 in (5.1 cm) long. Fold these sections in half and add a staple right on the folded line."

      "title": "Have Barbie star in her own movie using a video camera or phone.",
      "content": "Have Barbie star in her own movie using a video camera or phone. This could be an action movie where Barbie is involved in a high-speed car chase, a romantic movie where Barbie falls in love with someone, or any other genre that you like. Use a phone or video camera to film each scene so you can watch it later on. [4] X Research source Plan out each scene before filming, such as which props you’ll need and what Barbie will say. Ask friends or family members to help you shoot the movie so that you can have more characters in it. For example, you could film the movie outside and pretend that Barbie is stuck on an island and needs to be rescued."

      "title": "Take Barbie on a road trip if she has her own car.",
      "content": "Take Barbie on a road trip if she has her own car. Pack up Barbie’s car with snacks, clothing, and any other gear she’ll need for a road trip, or use your imagination and use a cardboard box as her car. Have Barbie travel from room to room, meeting new people and trying new things. [5] X Research source Barbie could also travel by plane, bus, boat, bicycle, or train. For example, you could pretend that each room in your house is a different country, and Barbie takes a plane to France, Greece, and Japan to try out their food. Take Barbie on a road trip to go shopping, hear music, or experience a festival."

      "content": "Create a dress out of a piece of fabric. Look around the house to find spare pieces of fabric used for sewing or projects. To make a super simple dress, cut a circle out of the fabric with a diameter of about 1 foot (30 cm). Cut a small hole for Barbie’s head right in the middle, and then 2 arm holes on either side. Slide the dress over Barbie’s head and use a ribbon or piece of string to tie it at the waist. [7] X Research source Make sure the main hole in Barbie’s dress is big enough for her head to fit through. Design more complicated pieces of clothing , such as pants or long-sleeve shirts, if desired."

      "content": "Cover sponges in fabric to create a comfy couch. Find pieces of fabric for sewing or crafts around the house and cut them into squares large enough to fit over the sponge, leaving 1 in (2.5 cm) of extra fabric on each side. You can either sew the fabric to create a cover for the sponge, or you can glue the fabric onto the sponge. Do this with at least 2 sponges and then place one flat on the ground with the other up against a wall as a backrest. [8] X Research source For a super comfy couch, make the seat of the couch out of 2 sponges stacked on top of one another. To create a long sectional, use 4-6 sponges to form the couch."

Place the matchboxes on top of one another, adding drops of glue in between each layer to keep them all in place. Place Barbie’s things, such as her hairbrush, phone, mirror, or books, in the drawers. [9] X Research source If you only have one matchbox, prop the matchbox up on something like a piece of cardboard or paper clips and turn it into a one-drawer nightstand. Cover the new drawers with stickers, glitter, or pictures."

Do this all the way around the hair tie to create a fun tutu. [11] X Research source Use different colored or patterned ribbon to make the tutu super colorful. If your hair tie is too big and won’t fit Barbie, find a rubber band and cut it before tying a new knot to make it the perfect size."

By bending these strips of cardboard, you can create simple chairs or chaise lounges. If you want the chair to stand up off the ground, bend paper clips to form chair ends and use glue or tape to attach them to the bottom of the chairs. [12] X Research source Fold a 6 in (15 cm) long piece of cardboard in half to create a simple chair. Fold a 9 in (23 cm) long piece of cardboard into thirds to form a chaise lounge."
