Gross income is the total amount of money you make in a year before taking taxes or deductions into account. [1] X Research source It serves as your starting point for calculating net income. If you are on a salary or work stable hours, this should be fairly easy to calculate. Take a pay stub from one of your pay periods. If your employer takes out taxes, look at the total amount before the deductions. This is your gross pay for the period. Figure out how often you are paid, and multiply the gross pay accordingly. If you're paid monthly, multiply the number from your pay stub by 12 to get your gross annual income. If you're paid weekly, multiply it by 52. If bi-weekly, multiply by 26. If you work irregular hours, you'll have to add up all your pay stubs for the year to get an accurate measure of your annual income. If you work multiple jobs, take all of them into account in this calculation. In most cases, gifts and inheritance do not factor into gross income. These are still taxable, however, so remember to account for them when filing your taxes. [2] X Research source"
