      "content": "Speak to an imam to learn more about Islam. Visiting a mosque and speaking to one of its leaders, known as an imam, gives you the chance to ask any questions you might have and helps you get familiar with your local Muslim community. So long as you dress in modest attire (stick to wearing clothes that cover most of your body), you’re welcome to visit any mosque. [1] X Research source You can also learn more about Islam by getting in touch with a Muslim community center or, if you’re in college, a Muslim Student’s Association.

      "content": "Recite the Shahada to complete your conversion. Converting to Islam is actually a really easy process—all it requires is saying the Testament of Faith, also known as the Shahada, with the honest desire to become a Muslim. Say the following Arabic words: “La ilaha illa Allah, Muhammad rasoolu Allah.” The Shahada is the first of the 5 pillars of Islam. This testament translates to: “There is no true god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.” Although Allah knows all, and therefore you don’t technically need witnesses, Muslims are encouraged to convert in the presence of 3 witnesses: 2 adult male believers, and an imam. [3] X Research source If you’re in a country like the Philippines that requires a certificate of conversion in order to marry a Muslim, you can ask the imam to provide you with one after reciting the Shahada."

      "content": "You may need to convert to Islam depending on the community you’re marrying into. Traditionally, Muslim women were expected to marry Muslim men exclusively, while Muslim men were permitted to marry women who were “People of the Book” (Jews or Christians). Today, however, there are varying interpretations—some people believe that all Muslims are required to only marry Muslims, while others believe that Muslim women can marry Jews and Christians without any required conversions. [7] X Research source If you’re marrying a Muslim, it’s best to follow whatever their interpretation of Muslim law is. Their community may have certain expectations, and your potential spouse is better equipped to understand them."

Like other faiths, such as Christianity, Islam is a religion that encourages the conversion of non-believers. For your future Muslim spouse, sharing a faith with you is a meaningful sign that you’re committed to a common spiritual journey. Most Muslims consider the conversion of others (also known as “reversion,” since Islam is seen as humanity’s original nature) to be spiritually righteous.
