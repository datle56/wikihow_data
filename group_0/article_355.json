      "content": "Take a moment to calm down. You will likely be angry, scared, shocked, nervous, guilty, or a combination of all of these emotions in the aftermath of an accident. The calmer you are, the better you will be able to deal with the situation. Take a few deep breaths or count to ten to steady yourself. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Determine any injuries.",
      "content": "Determine any injuries. The most important thing to do immediately after a car accident is to assess any injuries you or the other drivers and passengers have received. Determine your own safety, then check with the other people involved and, if necessary, immediately call for an ambulance. [3] X Research source If someone is unconscious or has neck pain, moving them may cause serious harm. Leave them in place until medical personnel arrives, unless leaving them in place would endanger them (i.e. they are lying in traffic, their car is on fire, etc.)."

      "title": "Move your vehicle to the shoulder, if possible.",
      "content": "Move your vehicle to the shoulder, if possible. If you can safely drive your vehicle, move it off to the side of the road and out of the path of oncoming traffic. This will keep you at a safe distance from traffic while you exchange information with the other drivers and make it easier for police and ambulance workers to reach the scene of the accident.

[5] X Research source That way you will have an official record of the accident, which will help protect you in case the other party sues you or disputes your account of the accident. Police can also dispatch assistance in the event of a serious accident. Stay on the phone with the police until they arrive or instruct you to hang up. Many 911 operators can provide safety instructions. [6] X Research source Ask that a police report be filed. This report will help when filing insurance claims and in the event of a lawsuit. In some states, police will only file a report if injuries are involved. In this case, file a state vehicle accident report, available at police stations or on the Department of Motor Vehicles website. [7] X Research source Obtain the name and badge numbers of the police who arrive, in case your insurance agent or lawyer needs to contact them."

      "content": "Stay in your car with your seatbelt fastened. Don’t try to cross traffic to get off the road, and don’t stand next to a car that is stranded in traffic or on the shoulder. People who get out of their car are killed or injured more often than those who stay inside. [9] X Research source However, if you smell gas, get out of your car right away. This could signal a fuel leak that could lead to a fire or explosion. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Exchange information.",
      "content": "Exchange information. Get the names and phone numbers of all the other drivers involved in the traffic accident. Write down the make, model, year and license plate number of each vehicle. Be sure to obtain all insurance information including the company, policy number and any insurance agent contact information the driver can provide. [11] X Research source Be polite, but do not apologize. If you say, “I’m so sorry I hit you,” you may be admitting legal liability for the accident. Try not to admit guilt unnecessarily like this, as it may not be clear who was at fault in the immediate aftermath. Be wary of identity theft. Criminals sometimes stage fender-benders in order to obtain the information needed to steal another motorist’s identity. Never give out your social security number or let another driver take a picture of your driver’s license. For safety reasons, don’t provide your home address, either."

      "content": "Take pictures. Photograph damage to your car and the other vehicles involved in the accident. Also take photos of the accident location and the people involved.

[12] X Research source Also provide the insurance company with information on the other driver. Immediately filing a claim will speed up the process of getting your car repaired and securing a rental vehicle, if necessary. Do not lie when stating the facts of the accident, as this can result in denial of your coverage. The other driver may suggest not filing claims in the event of a small accident, as filing a claim will raise your rates. However, it is always a good idea to file a claim to protect yourself. The other driver may later change his mind and file a claim, even claiming injuries that weren’t apparent at the time of the accident. You want to be sure your insurance company has your version of the accident as soon as possible. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Get an insurance company damage valuation. This will determine how much your company, or the other motorist's company if they were at fault, is willing to pay to replace or fix your car. If you think the number is too low, get your own independent estimates, and then discuss them with your adjuster."

    {
      "title": "Do not talk to insurance companies.",
      "content": "Do not talk to insurance companies. After being involved in a car accident, you may get a call from the insurance company. If they call you, hang up. The caller is an adjuster who is trained to obtain statements that can later help the insurance company use against you in denying your claim or paying you less. Insurance companies are always employing attorneys to help save them money. In case they tell you that you do not need an attorney, you will know they're lying to you. They are trying to make you feel guilty for retaining counsel. Some injuries – particularly back and neck ones caused by whiplash – might not show up or reach their maximum level of pain until weeks or even months after the accident. Every insurance company uses the tactic delay, deny, defend to minimize the value of the victim's injuries for as little as possible. This tactic has proven to work against people who do not have a personal injury attorney and has helped insurers save a lot of money for decades."
