      "content": "Decide if you need outside help. If you are working a large plot, it can take a lot of time. You should also inspect your land to see if there is anything that would make clearing it especially difficult, like very large trees or steep hillsides. If you don’t have the time, tools, or know-how, this is a job you should get a contractor or other expert to help out with. Depending on the complexity of your project, you might hire a contractor to do all of the land clearing for you. [1] X Expert Source Benjamin Hansen Licensed Landscape Contractor Expert Interview. 6 October 2020. Alternatively, you could hire people to take care of some aspects of the land clearing and handle others yourself. For instance, you might feel prepared to clear brush and fell small trees, but could hire an arborist or logging company to handle any that are especially large."

      "content": "Check and see if you need a permit. Depending on where you live, there might be protected vegetation, concern about soil erosion, or other factors that impact land clearing. Before you take on a big project, check with your local land planning agency to determine if you need permits. [2] X Research source If you hire a contractor, they may be able to handle the permit process for you."

      "title": "Set a budget.",
      "content": "Set a budget. Contractors may work on a fixed price per square foot or land. If you have a large plot, this means the overall cost can rise quickly. Even if you are planning on clearing the land yourself, expect to have some costs for running and maintaining your equipment, buying any necessary tools or supplies, paying for the removal or dumping of debris, etc. [3] X Research source Contractor costs will vary depending on your location, and the equipment needed. Demolition, haul away, and excavation can be done in many different ways depending on the size of the project and whether the parcel is on a hillside.

Ask a few to give you an estimated price for clearing your land, then choose the best contractor you can within your budget. Contractor costs will be based on things like: [6] X Research source The size of the plot How quickly the land needs to be cleared Whether the plot has any features that make clearing difficult (steep hills, remote location, unusual soil types, etc.) The time of year Whether any subcontractors will need to be hired"

      "content": "Demolish any existing structures. If there are any old buildings, sheds, stables, or other structures on the land, you’ll need to knock these down. Use a wrecker, bulldozer , or other heavy equipment to take care of the job quickly. When you’re done, dispose of the debris. [7] X Research source Check with local sanitation companies to see if you can rent a large construction dumpster for the debris."

      "title": "Remove standing debris.",
      "content": "Remove standing debris. Rocks, fallen limbs, and trash will all need to be out of the way. Picking these things up will make it easier to get equipment in to clear vegetation and trees. Consider checking with local excavation companies, sand and gravel suppliers, and other heavy equipment dealers to see if you can rent a debris grate. This is a large, heavy, front-loading piece of machinery that may help in the debris removal process. If there are any boulders you need removed, wrap a heavy-duty chain around them. Then, attach the chain to a tractor and drag them out of the way."

      "title": "Mark and protect all desired vegetation that can’t be temporarily moved.",
      "content": "Mark and protect all desired vegetation that can’t be temporarily moved. Fence off any trees that you want to keep with brightly colored construction fencing or wrap landscape fabric around their base to protect them. Install fencing around smaller plants as well. Use brightly colored forestry flagging ribbon to clearly mark all desired vegetation. Mark all low tree branches with ribbon to avoid damage caused by operating equipment under the tree canopy. Continue providing water to the plants as needed."

      "title": "Fell any trees",
      "content": "Fell any trees . If you know how to work a chainsaw, you can handle a small plot without much trouble. If you have a large plot with lots of trees, however, rent some professional equipment to make the job quicker and easier. You can have the felled trees hauled away. Or, if you prefer, you can cut the trees into firewood or put a mulching attachment on a skid steer machine to make them into mulch. Very large trees, or ones with dangerously decayed limbs, are best left to professionals."

      "title": "Grub any remaining tree stumps.",
      "content": "Grub any remaining tree stumps. To remove a tree stump (called “grubbing”), start by digging down to the roots all around it with a shovel. Attach a heavy-duty chain around the stump, and then use a tractor to pull it out."

      "title": "Clear brush.",
      "content": "Clear brush. There are many options for clearing out vegetation. You could use hand-held trimmers to cut the vegetation at ground level if the job is not too big. If there’s a lot of land to cover, rent a brush machine to tear through it more quickly. You can compost , burn, or shred the debris, according to your preference. If you have low ground vegetation, you can use grazing animals like sheep or goats to clear it. Sometimes, these animals can work surprisingly quickly. Goats can even eat poison ivy without being harmed, saving you from some potentially irritating trouble. In some locations, you can rent grazing animals for this purpose."

      "title": "Fill in holes and grade the land.",
      "content": "Fill in holes and grade the land. If you have any holes created by removing stumps, boulders, or other debris, shovel loose dirt into these. Tamp the dirt down into the holes until it is compact. Add more dirt if necessary, and repeat until the surface is level. If you are planning to construct something on the cleared land, a contractor will most likely use a professional grader to smooth things out."

      "title": "Plow if you want to farm or landscape the area.",
      "content": "Plow if you want to farm or landscape the area. Turning the soil with a plow is an extra step to make sure the ground is even. If there is any organic matter (like grass or leaves) on top of the soil, plowing will also mix this in so that valuable nutrients are added back in. Avoid plowing wet or steep land. Instead, let native vegetation cover the area. This helps prevent soil erosion."
