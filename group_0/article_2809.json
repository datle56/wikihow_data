      "content": "Work on accepting yourself . If you aren't okay with being autistic, then you may not feel ready for being openly autistic. Get comfortable with yourself and allow yourself to be different. Take small steps if need be, and reach out for support.

      "content": "Recognize the benefits of being publicly autistic. Disclosing your autism will allow people to understand you better, and allow you to focus on things besides appearing non-autistic. Here are some things to consider: Mental health: \"Passing\" as non-autistic can be incredibly draining. Autistic people who spend less energy on hiding their autistic traits have better mental health. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source [3] X Research source Being understood: People may be more accepting of your differences if they know that they're caused by autism and not by negative personality traits. They may be more patient if you do something odd, since they might be more likely to assume you meant no harm. Explaining yourself: People may be more accommodating with you if they know that your struggles or social slip-ups are related to a disability and not a lack of effort. They may end up being more patient and helpful when you need it. Teaching others: Getting to know you as an autistic person can help others gain a better understanding of autism, including breaking negative stereotypes."

      "content": "Recognize the drawbacks of others knowing you are autistic. In an ideal world, people could be themselves without anyone making a fuss over it. Unfortunately, this is not an ideal world, and some people may be unfriendly or rude. You never need to listen to those who speak this way, but you may still find it upsetting. Discrimination: Ignorant people may judge you based on your diagnosis or your autistic traits. Some may decide to exclude you or be rude to you. Stereotypes: People's opinion of you may change. They may apply negative stereotypes or treat you like a child. Explaining yourself: Some people may try to argue with you about what autism is or whether you are \"truly\" autistic (even if you have a paper diagnosis!)."

      "content": "Consider how permanent your decision is. The way you feel now may be different from the way you feel in 15 years. If you are young, you may wish to avoid identifying yourself as an autistic person in the media, in case you decide in the future that you don't want employers to know. Once something is on the internet, it is on the internet forever. If you want to write extensively about autism, consider using a screen name. For example, your future employer will not know if you wore a cute autism shirt in college. They will know if you published an essay on autism or were interviewed by a newspaper at an autism acceptance event. Whether you'd like that is up to you."

      "content": "Recognize that it isn't black-and-white. It's a little more nuanced than people thinking you're autistic vs. thinking you're not. You can disclose that you are disabled or that you have different needs without saying that you're autistic. What you choose is up to you and your comfort zone. \"I'm a little quirky, and I have some unusual needs.\" \"I have a disability that causes _____.\" \"I have a developmental disability.\" \"I'm autistic.\""

Scripting and practicing your responses can make it easier. \"Autism is a common but misunderstood social and developmental disability. I have difficulty understanding people sometimes, sensitive ears, and unusual body language. On the bright side, I'm really good at code.\" \"Being autistic comes with good, bad, and neutral parts. My body language is a little different, and I'll be really good at some things and need extra help with others.\" \"There are a lot of myths about autism.\" \"Hollywood stereotypes autism as much as it stereotypes jocks and nerds. Autism Speaks isn't known for being truthful either. There's a lot of misinformation, so a good deal of the things you may have heard about autism might be false.\""

Let yourself be yourself. There is nothing wrong with being disabled in public. Use the body language that is comfortable to you. You don't have to sit perfectly still or make eye contact if it feels unnatural to you. Obviously, not all stims are suitable in public. Don't use stims that invade someone's personal space (e.g. playing with their hair without permission), and choose non-distracting stims when people are focusing."

Exercise can include taking a walk with a friend, biking, rollerblading, stimming, swinging, hiking, and playing with kids. Exercise can be fun!

Think about a disabled friend. Would you talk to them the way you talk to yourself? Treat yourself like a friend, and don't tell yourself things that you wouldn't say to a friend. Think about your strengths. What are you good at? How do you help others? Think about strengths related to autism (pattern recognition, focus, special interests) and strengths unique to you. Volunteer. Visit a soup kitchen, work at an autism acceptance event, or edit articles about autism or your special interest on wikiHow. Knowing that you help others can help you feel better about yourself. Talk to someone. If you feel sad about yourself, tell a loved one, a doctor, or a therapist. Talking can help you feel better, and if you have an illness like depression, it is the first step to recovery."
