The oils in your skin also tend to make the eyebrow color look darker, so going 1-2 shades lighter than your hair color will ensure the color does not become too pronounced or defined. [1] X Research source You may try an eyebrow color that is 1 shade lighter to start and then go for an even lighter shade if you do not want your brows to appear too dark when you color them in."

      "content": "Pick an ashy blonde color if you have light skin with pink undertones. You usually have pink undertones if you tend to turn pink or red when you blush. Complement your skin tone by using a light blonde color that looks a bit ashy so it does not appear too yellow or orange. [6] X Research source You may also try a light brown color that is ashy if you have light skin and darker hair. Try to avoid using reddish or warm tones for your brows even if you have warm blonde or brown hair. Eyebrows tend to be ashier than the hair on your head, so using a cooler shade will provide a more natural look."

      "content": "Test the color on your skin before applying it to your brows. Find out if the eyebrow color is a good fit by dabbing or swabbing a small amount of color on your cheek or the skin beside your eyebrow. You can test an eyebrow pencil or gel this way. The color should look 1-2 shades darker or lighter than your hair color, depending on your hair color and skin tone. It should complement your skin tone and hair color, rather than create an obvious contrast. [9] X Research source Keep in mind that the oils in your skin will make the brow color appear darker, especially as it sets throughout the day. It's usually best to err on the side of caution and start with a lighter shade first."

      "title": "Use an eyebrow pencil with a fine tip to make your eyebrows appear more full.",
      "content": "Use an eyebrow pencil with a fine tip to make your eyebrows appear more full. Do not try to fill in any gaps in your brows with the pencil. Instead, fill in above and below your brows with the fine tip for a more natural look. Avoid a hard outline and instead use short, quick strokes or flicks of the pencil to create lines that look like strands of hair. Then, use a spoolie brush to brush the color in an upward and outward motion. [10] X Research source Some eyebrow pencils come with a fine tip on one end and spoolie brush on the other end for easy application. You can buy eyebrow pencils at your local beauty supply store or online. You may want to shop for an eyebrow pencil in person at a store so you can try out the color before you buy."

Use a spoolie brush or an angled brush to apply the eyebrow gel on your brows in an upward and outward motion. Eyebrow gel can also help to keep your eyebrows in place throughout the day and lock in the color so it does not flake off or fade. Shop for eyebrow gel at your local beauty supply store or online. Shopping for the product in person may be ideal so you can try it out before you buy."

      "content": "Try filling your brows in with eye shadow for a softer look. Shadow can be a great alternative to more defined pencils and gels. Load up a small, angled brush with a shadow color that matches your brows. Then, gently flick the brush up from the base of your brow toward the top. This helps create hair-like lines, instead of a single hard outline. Continue this process until your brows are to your liking, using a spoolie to help blend the shadow into your natural brow.

      "content": "Get your eyebrows tinted for a semi-permanent option. Tinting your eyebrows can help your brows appear full for 3-4 weeks with minimal touch ups. The dye is applied to just your eyebrow hairs and not your skin, leaving you with well shaped, defined brows. Get your eyebrows tinted by a professional cosmetologist at a brow bar or a beauty salon to ensure they look their best. [12] X Research source If you want to try tinting your eyebrows at home , do so with caution, as you do not want to tint them too dark. Look for a color that is the same level or a level darker than your natural brows. Eyebrow tinting is a better, and safer option than dying your brows a specific color, as it is less harsh on your hair and skin. Even with tinted eyebrows, you may still need to use a pencil to fill in thin spots or to balance out the shape of your brows."
