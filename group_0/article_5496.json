      "title": "Determine your reaction’s products and reactants.",
      "content": "Determine your reaction’s products and reactants. Any chemical reaction involves two categories of chemicals — products and reactants. Products are the chemicals created by the reaction, while reactants are the chemicals that interact, combine, or break down to make the product. In other words, the reactants of a reaction are like the ingredients in a recipe, while the products are like the finished dish. To find ∆H for a reaction, first identify its products and reactants. [1] X Research source As an example, let’s say we want to find the enthalpy of reaction for the formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen: 2H 2 (Hydrogen) + O 2 (Oxygen) → 2H 2 O (Water). In this equation, H 2 and O 2 are the reactants and H 2 O is the product."

      "content": "Determine the total mass of the reactants. Next, find the masses of your reactants. If you don't know their masses and aren't able to weigh the reactants in a scientific balance, you can use their molar masses to find their actual masses. Molar masses are constants that can be found on standard periodic tables (for individual elements) and in other chemistry resources (for molecules and compounds). Simply multiply the molar mass of each reactant by the number of moles used to find the reactants' masses. [2] X Research source In our water example, our reactants are hydrogen and oxygen gases, which have molar masses of 2g and 32 g, respectively. Since we used 2 moles of hydrogen (signified by the \"2\" coefficient in the equation next to H 2 ) and 1 mole of oxygen (signified by no coefficient next to O 2 ), we can calculate the total mass of the reactants as follows: 2 × (2g) + 1 × (32g) = 4g + 32g = 36g"

      "content": "Find the specific heat of your product. Next, find the specific heat of the product you're analyzing. Every element or molecule has a specific heat value associated with it: these values are constants and are usually located in chemistry resources (like, for instance, in tables at the back of a chemistry textbook). There are several different ways to measure specific heat, but for our formula, we'll use value measured in the units joule/gram °C. [3] X Research source Note that if your equation has multiple products, you'll need to perform the enthalpy calculation for the component reaction used to produce each product, then add them together to find the enthalpy for the entire reaction. In our example, the final product is water, which has a specific heat of about 4.2 joule/gram °C ."

      "title": "Find the difference in temperature after the reaction.",
      "content": "Find the difference in temperature after the reaction. Next, we'll find ∆T, the change in temperature from before the reaction to after the reaction. Subtract the initial temperature (or T1) of the reaction from the final temperature (or T2) to calculate this value. [4] X Research source As in most chemistry work, Kelvin (K) temperatures should be used here (though Celsius (C) will give the same results). For our example, let's say that our reaction was 185K at its very start but had cooled to 95K by the time it finished. In this case, ∆T would be calculated as follows: ∆T = T2 – T1 = 95K – 185K = -90K"

      "title": "Use the formula ∆H = m x s x ∆T to solve.",
      "content": "Use the formula ∆H = m x s x ∆T to solve. Once you have m, the mass of your reactants, s, the specific heat of your product, and ∆T, the temperature change from your reaction, you are prepared to find the enthalpy of reaction. Simply plug your values into the formula ∆H = m x s x ∆T and multiply to solve. Your answer will be in the unit of energy Joules (J). For our example problem, we would find the enthalpy of reaction as follows: ∆H = (36g) × (4.2 JK-1 g-1) × (-90K ) = -13,608 J"

      "title": "Determine whether your reaction gains or loses energy.",
      "content": "Determine whether your reaction gains or loses energy. One of the most common reasons that ∆H is calculated for various reactions is to determine whether the reaction is exothermic (loses energy and gives off heat) or endothermic (gains energy and absorbs heat). If the sign of your final answer for ∆H is positive, the reaction is endothermic. On the other hand, if the sign is negative, the reaction is exothermic. [5] X Research source The larger the number itself is, the more exo- or endo- thermic the reaction is. Beware strongly exothermic reactions — these can sometimes signify a large release of energy, which, if rapid enough, can cause an explosion. In our example, our final answer is -13608 J. Since the sign is negative, we know that our reaction is exothermic . This makes sense — H 2 and O 2 are gasses, while H 2 O, the product, is a liquid. The hot gasses (in the form of steam) have to release energy into the environment in the form of heat to cool to the point that they can form liquid water, meaning that the formation of H 2 O is exothermic."

      "title": "Use bond energies to estimate enthalpy.",
      "content": "Use bond energies to estimate enthalpy. Nearly all chemical reactions involve forming or breaking bonds between atoms. Since, in a chemical reaction, energy can be neither destroyed nor created, if we know the energy required to form or break the bonds being made (or broken) in the reaction, we can estimate the enthalpy change for the entire reaction with high accuracy by adding up these bond energies. [6] X Research source For example, let's consider the reaction H 2 + F 2 → 2HF. In this case, the energy required to break the H atoms in the H 2 molecule apart is 436 kJ/mol, while the energy required for F 2 is 158 kJ/mol. Finally, the energy needed to form HF from H and F is = -568 kJ/mol. We multiply this by 2 because the product in the equation is 2 HF, giving us 2 × -568 = -1136 kJ/mol. Adding these all up, we get: 436 + 158 + -1136 = -542 kJ/mol ."

      "title": "Use enthalpies of formation to estimate enthalpy.",
      "content": "Use enthalpies of formation to estimate enthalpy. Enthalpies of formation are set ∆H values that represent the enthalpy changes from reactions used to create given chemicals. If you know the enthalpies of formation required to create products and reactants in an equation, you can add them up to estimate the enthalpy much as you would with bond energies as described above. [7] X Research source For example, let's consider the reaction C 2 H 5 OH + 3O 2 → 2CO 2 + 3H 2 O. In this case, we know the enthalpies of formation for the following reactions: C 2 H 5 OH → 2C + 3H 2 + 0.5O 2 = 228 kJ/mol 2C + 2O 2 → 2CO 2 = -394 × 2 = -788 kJ/mol 3H 2 + 1.5 O 2 → 3H 2 O = -286 × 3 = -858 kJ/mol Since we can add these equations up to get C 2 H 5 OH + 3O 2 → 2CO 2 + 3H 2 O, the reaction we're trying to find the enthalpy for, we can simply add up the enthalpies of the formation reactions above to find the enthalpy of this reaction as follows: 228 + -788 + -858 = -1418 kJ/mol ."

      "title": "Don’t forget to switch signs when reversing equations.",
      "content": "Don’t forget to switch signs when reversing equations. It's important to note that when you use enthalpies of formation to calculate the enthalpy of a reaction, you need to reverse the sign of the enthalpy of formation whenever you reverse the equation of the component reaction. In other words, if you have to turn one or more of your formation reaction equations backwards in order to get all of your products and reactants to cancel properly, reverse the sign on the enthalpies of the formation reactions you had to flip. In the example above, notice that the formation reaction we use for C 2 H 5 OH is backwards. C 2 H 5 OH → 2C + 3H 2 + 0.5O 2 shows C 2 H 5 OH breaking down, not being formed. Because we turned the equation around in order to get all of the products and reactants to cancel properly, we reversed the sign on the enthalpy of formation to give us 228 kJ/mol. In reality, the enthalpy of formation for C 2 H 5 OH is -228 kJ/mol."

      "content": "Grab a clean container and fill it with water. It's easy to see the principles of enthalpy in action with a simple experiment. To make sure that the reaction in your experiment will take place without any foreign contamination, clean and sterilize the container that you plan to use. Scientists use special closed containers called calorimeters to measure enthalpy, but you can achieve reasonable results with any small glass jar or flask. Regardless of the container you use, fill it with clean, room-temperature tap water. You'll also want to conduct the reaction somewhere indoors with a cool temperature. For this experiment, you'll want a fairly small container. We'll be testing the enthalpy-altering effects of Alka-Seltzer on water, so the less water used, the more obvious the temperature change will be."

Take a temperature reading of the water — for our purposes, the temperature of the water will represent T1, the initial temperature of the reaction. Let's say that we measure the temperature of the water and find that it's exactly 10 degrees C. In a few steps, we'll use this sample temperature reading to demonstrate the principals of enthalpy."

You should notice it immediately start to bubble and fizz. As the tablet dissolves in the water, it breaks down into the chemicals bicarbonate (HCO 3 - ) and citric acid (which reacts in the form of hydrogen ions, H + ). These chemicals react to form water and carbon dioxide gas in the reaction 3HCO 3 − + 3H + → 3H 2 O + 3CO 2 . [8] X Research source"

As soon as the tablet finishes its reaction (or seems to have slowed to a crawl), measure the temperature again. The water should be slightly colder than before. If it's warmer, the experiment may have been affected by an outside force (like, for instance, if the room you're in is especially warm). [9] X Research source For our example experiment, let's say that the temperature of the water is 8 degrees C after the tablet has finished fizzing."

      "title": "Estimate the enthalpy of the reaction.",
      "content": "Estimate the enthalpy of the reaction. In an ideal experiment, when you add the Alka-Seltzer tablet to the water, it forms water and carbon dioxide gas (the latter of which can be observed as fizzing bubbles) and causes the temperature of the water to drop. From this information, we would expect the reaction to be endothermic — that is, one that absorbs energy from the surrounding environment. The dissolved liquid reactants need extra energy to make the jump to the gaseous product, so it takes energy in the form of heat from its surroundings (in this case, water). This makes the water's temperature fall. In our example experiment, the temperature of the water fell two degrees after adding the Alka-Seltzer. This is consistent with the sort of mildly endothermic reaction we'd expect."
