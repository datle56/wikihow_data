Compared to a typical social club, Masonic organizations also hold more formal and ceremonial gatherings. [1] X Research source These gatherings can include spiritual activities like prayer, but Masonry is not officially part of any religion. [2] X Research source The conspiracy theories about Masons are overblown. While they do use many special symbols and clothing, most of these are public knowledge, not secret or sinister. [3] X Research source There are some secret ceremonies for members only. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Freemasonry exists in many different local forms. There is no single worldwide Masonic organization. Instead, each country, state, or region has a \"Grand Lodge\" that decides on rules and membership, and many smaller local lodges. There are many differences between lodges, but most fall into one of two main categories: Lodges that call themselves \"regular\" tend to be more traditional. They don't accept atheists or women (though woman can sometimes join a sister organization). [5] X Research source Most Masons in the English-speaking world and the former British Empire are this type. [6] X Research source \"Liberal\" or \"continental\" lodges, most popular in France but found worldwide, typically accept women and atheists as members. [7] X Research source"

They also require members to believe in a \"Supreme Being.\" You don't need to follow any specific religion (at least officially), but atheists and agnostics can't join. [8] X Research source Since 2018, the most influential Masonic Grand Lodge (the UGLE) has officially allowed trans men. [9] X Research source Other lodges might not."

[10] X Research source They sometimes also relax the men-only restriction, although there is still a lot of disagreement on this between individual lodges. [11] X Research source Even in more traditional areas like England, there are women-only organizations like The Order of Women Freemasons. The larger male organizations might not officially recognize these as Masons, but they can still have fairly close ties. [12] X Research source"

Check your local lodge's website for a petition form to fill out asking to join, or for the lodge secretary's contact info.

Be ready to talk about anything in your past or present life. It's not a dealbreaker if you've made mistakes in the past, as long as you own up to them and talk about how you've changed. The lodge members usually take several months to think things over, but it depends on how busy they are and how well they already know you. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Climbing the ranks to Master Mason takes months or years. As soon as a lodge accepts you, you are an apprentice. By demonstrating your commitment at meetings and studying Masonic symbolism, you can earn the 2nd degree of Masonry, called Fellowcraft, and finally the 3rd degree. Once you have your 3rd degree, you can call yourself a Master Mason and visit other lodges, not just the one you joined. [18] X Research source The length of time this takes depends on your lodge and how much time you have available. A few months is typical in many US lodges, while liberal-style lodges often add and expect the process to take at least 2 years. [19] X Research source Liberal lodges may also have additional degrees to study for beyond Master. [20] X Research source"

      "content": "Yes, most Masons pay annual dues plus an application fee. As with most of Masonry, the details depend on the lodge. In the United States, a typical lodge charges you $300 to apply, which also covers your first year of dues if you get in. After that, you'll have to pay about $50 to $200 per year, depending on the lodge. Some lodges charge quite a lot for the formal dinners they hold after each meeting, but attending these is optional. [21] X Research source There might be some one-time costs as well, but these aren't usually too steep. For instance, the Illinois lodge charges an extra $100 total for climbing the ranks of membership. [22] X Research source"

Each Mason has a duty to improve himself morally and spiritually, and to support all his brother Masons on their own journeys. Freemasonry stresses honor, personal responsibility, personal integrity, and charity. [24] X Research source Traditional Masonic lodges talk about moral principles in religious terms. They require a belief in a Supreme Being, but forbid talking about specific religions at meetings. Protestant Christianity has the strongest ties to Masonic ritual, and a Bible is open at meetings, but some lodges add other holy books from their members' other religions. [25] X Research source \"Liberal\" Masonic lodges have no religious requirement for membership. Unlike regular lodges, they often allow discussions of specific religions (or atheism), but do not expect their members to agree."

Masons spend time together socializing, sharing meals, fundraising for charity, and hosting events that have little or nothing to do with ceremony or secrets. If you want to become a Mason, find a lodge with members that you enjoy spending time with. [26] X Research source You aren't expected to attend every single event, of course, but it can be a pretty serious time commitment. Masonic organizations sometimes say that their members should put family first, job second, and Freemasonry third. [27] X Research source"

Masons describe the ceremony as something like a play loosely based on Biblical allegories. If you join, you might be expected to wear a special apron, recite lines, and participate in symbolic rituals. [28] X Research source Different lodges follow different traditions, with the Scottish Rites being one of the most popular. [29] X Research source Since each lodge also has a lot of control over what it does, you can't really know exactly what to expect before joining."
