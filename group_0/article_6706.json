      "content": "Turn on your Windows 10 device and wait for it to take you to the lock screen. If it is already on and in use, press Ctrl+Alt+Delete and select Lock from the menu that appears before you. If it isn’t on: Press the power button on your device to turn it on. The power button is typically located at the top of your keyboard if your computer is a laptop, or on the monitor if it is a desktop. The power button on a computer is typically indicated by the power symbol - a circle with a line going through the top. After pressing the power button, wait 30 seconds to a minute for your computer to boot up. Windows 10 should automatically take you to the lock screen. This lock screen should look something like the one below. The background can differ, but the general look should be the same. If this isn't the case, your device may be using something other than Windows 10, which this article isn't meant for."

Click on the leftmost icon, representing Internet Access (this may look different from the picture above depending on your connection). A pop-up menu should now appear above the Internet icon."
