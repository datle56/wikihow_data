      "content": "Sleep naked. Not topless or in your underwear, completely naked. Research shows that sleeping naked keeps you cooler, which can promote relaxation and improve the quality of your sleep. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source On warm nights, strip down to let your body breathe and get a good night’s sleep. Try opening a window near your bed (keeping the blinds closed) to let a breeze in. Remember that part of being a naturist is to feel closer to the natural world. If you find sleeping naked difficult, work your way up to it. Shed one piece of clothing, such as your pajama top or shorts, and when you’re accustomed to sleeping without that, shed the next piece, and so on until you’re sleeping nude."

      "content": "Spend as much time as you can around the house naked. Stay naked after a shower. Towel dry and go about the rest of your routine naked. Advance to being naked while you’re eating, while you’re cleaning, and especially while you’re relaxing, be it in front of the TV, with a good book or sunning in your backyard. If you exercise at home, do it naked, unless it's uncomfortable not to wear a sports bra. Remember to respect others' boundaries when it comes to nudity. When you're naked in your house, keep the blinds and curtains closed, and stay away from windows that can’t be blocked. Don't sunbathe nude in the yard unless you have a high privacy fence."

      "title": "Talk to your partner about nudism.",
      "content": "Talk to your partner about nudism. Being naked in a nonsexual way with your partner may take your intimacy to the next level, plus it means you'll be able to stay naked when they are in the house. Discuss whether this is something you could explore together. If your partner isn't into it, ask if they would be comfortable with you doing it by yourself. Not everyone feels the same way about being naked, and that’s okay too. Acknowledge your partner’s opinion and remain calm so you can maintain an open discussion. You could say, “Would it be okay if I started wearing fewer clothes around the house?” or “I just discovered that there are tons of health benefits of being naked. Do you want to join me?” As long as you don’t treat nudity as something that is sexual or profane, there isn’t any reason to feel shame when you or your partner aren’t wearing clothes.

      "title": "Locate a nudist community.",
      "content": "Locate a nudist community. Many towns have resorts that are specifically designated for practicing nudists. Just search “local nudist communities” on Google to see if there’s one near you. By joining a nudist community, you’ll be free to roam around at will without fear of judgment or legal repercussions. You can hang out with other nudists, ask them questions, and gain insight into their way of life. Remember to be polite toward other nudists. It takes courage to be naked in front of others, so there’s no room for harassment or ridicule. If you’re in the United States or Canada, you can join the American Association for Nude Recreation (AANR) or The Naturist Society (TNS) for more information. Be sure you know the rules and expectations of the community before visiting. Some encourage sex, so you want to be aware of whether that's something you want to experience. Don’t let feelings of inadequacy stop you from going. Once you visit a nudist community, you’ll realize that everyone isn’t worrying about their bodies, or yours, and they’re simply there to enjoy the pleasure of naturism in a friendly environment.

      "content": "Recognize that nudity is natural. We are born naked and it is our natural state.

      "content": "Get to know the purpose of nudism. Nudism, also called naturism, is more than the simple act of being nude—it's also about getting closer to nature. In your natural state, there are no boundaries between yourself and the natural world.

Many people choose naturism to reach this particular height of happiness."

      "title": "Understand that nudity isn't always sexual.",
      "content": "Understand that nudity isn't always sexual. Yes, people have sex naked, but nudity itself does not have to be sexual. Revealing clothing is often more sexually suggestive than being totally naked, since it leaves more to the imagination. If you're worried that becoming a naturist means you're opening yourself up to unwanted sexual encounters, know that for many naturists, it's about being free and natural, not lecherous. [6] X Research source Being a naturist is not about having public sex or exposing yourself to others. Many naturists are modest people who choose naturism for the above reasons, and not in order to sexually connect with people. That said, nudity can be pleasing to the senses in a sexual way. The feel of air or water flowing uninterrupted across your entire body awakens the senses and may be arousing. This is healthy and natural, and you should not feel ashamed to have or explore these sexual feelings. [7] X Research source Suppressing your feelings is unhealthy in general, and suppressing sexual feelings in the context of naturism negates the healthy benefits of a naturist lifestyle."
