A 2025 report by the NGC Price Guide suggested that 1971 Kennedy Half Dollars in uncirculated condition have sold for up to $3,100. [1] X Research source Uncirculated, mint-condition coins aren’t incredibly rare, but they are worth more than circulated coins. The coin that sold for $3,100 had a mint state grade of 68. A grade of 70 applies to a perfect coin, so this one had to have been incredibly well-preserved. [2] X Research source"

However, if you have a proof coin, it could go for $5 to $6. [5] X Research source One proof coin even sold for $1,821 at auction in 2013. [6] X Research source Your coin may be a proof if it has a mirrored surface across the coin’s negative space and the designs on the coin are frosted—what’s officially known as the “cameo” effect. [7] X Research source If you’re unsure, consult a professional grading company. Proof coins are high-quality coins that are minted as collectibles. They’re not intended to be circulated for use as currency. The “S” means the coin was minted in San Francisco. Spot the mint mark below Kennedy’s profile. [8] X Research source"

Planchets are the blank metal discs with rims that are struck (stamped with a design) to become coins. Value: A coin with this error and a grade of MS61 sold for $13,000 in 2018. [11] X Research source Another one sold for $9,900 in 2021. [12] X Research source One way to check if your coin is silver is to view the rim. If the rim has a solid silver edge, it could indicate the coin is silver and not copper-nickel clad. [13] X Research source To be sure, it’s best to take it to a professional coin grader."
