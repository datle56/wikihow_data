      "title": "Dave offers advances up to $500.",
      "content": "Dave offers advances up to $500. Unlike other cash advance apps, Dave doesn't require you to have a full-time job—though they do look for account activity and regular deposits. After you sign up for Dave and connect your bank account, you can open an ExtraCash™ account. Dave will determine how much you can advance, up to $500. You can put the money in your Dave Spending account, or transfer your cash to your bank account or debit card. Express fees may apply. You'll be given a repayment date, but Dave doesn't charge late fees if you can't pay on that date. Advance eligibility is determined by many factors, including deposits into your account. If you don't have a job or get regular deposits (such as paychecks or government assistance deposits), you may not be eligible for the full advance limit. Dave requires at least $1,000 deposited into your account per month to get a higher cash advance amount (i.e., closer to the maximum of $500) but doesn't have specifics for lower advance amounts. [1] X Research source Funds are available instantly for Dave Spending accounts for a 3% fee (minimum $3). Funds can be transferred to an external bank account in 1 to 3 business days for no fee, or an external debit card in less than an hour for a 5% fee (minimum $5) fee. Dave also offers a Spending account, a Goals account for saving, and a \"Side Hustle\" feature that can help you find extra ways to earn money, such as taking surveys. Designed by Dave, not a bank. Evolve Bank & Trust, Member FDIC, provides banking services. Advances are subject to eligibility requirements, and are provided as an overdraft, which causes the ExtraCash account to have a negative balance. The average approved advance is $160, updated quarterly based on the prior 6 months. See the Dave ExtraCash™ Deposit Agreement and Disclosures for details. Dave is available on the App Store and Google Play Store ."

      "content": "You can work up to a higher advance limit with MoneyLion.

      "title": "Empower transfers your cash advances quickly.",
      "content": "Empower transfers your cash advances quickly. Once you sign up for Empower and connect your bank account, Empower will determine how much they can offer you for a Cash Advance. Cash Advances range from $10 to $250 depending on factors like recurring deposits, so you may still qualify for a lower amount if you get paid infrequently.

Empower has a 14-day free trial for new members and is $8 per month after that. Cash advance eligibility is determined by many factors, including deposits into your account. If you don't get regular deposits (such as paychecks or government assistance deposits), you may not be eligible for the full cash advance limit.

      "title": "SoLo is a peer-to-peer lending community.",
      "content": "SoLo is a peer-to-peer lending community. All the lenders on SoLo are other members, backed by SoLo's lending marketplace, so your employment status isn't factored into whether or not you can get a loan. You can request up to $575 on SoLo, and your request will remain in SoLo's Marketplace for three days or until it's funded (whichever comes first). You can choose your repayment date, but you must manually repay it. If you miss your repayment date, you'll be charged a 10% late fee, and SoLo will attempt to contact you regarding the payment. There is no membership fee to use SoLo, but you can tip your lender (a fellow SoLo member) up to 12% of the total advance amount as a way to say thank you. As SoLo isn't a traditional cash advance lender, your deposits and bank account history don't affect if your borrow request is accepted and paid out by another SoLo member. You can transfer your funds to an external bank account for free via ACH. You can also transfer your funds instantly for a 1.75% fee. You can both be a lender and a borrower on SoLo, and SoLo also offers mobile banking services. SoLo is available on the App Store and Google Play Store ."

      "title": "Cleo doesn't have a minimum direct deposit requirement.",
      "content": "Cleo doesn't have a minimum direct deposit requirement. Cleo doesn't ask for your employment information, nor does it have a minimum direct deposit requirement, which makes it an ideal choice for gig workers or freelancers who get paid consistently. You can get up to $250 with Cleo, though you'll start with a smaller amount ($20 to $70) and work your way to a higher limit with successful repayments. Cleo has multiple tiers of monthly subscriptions, including a free tier. While Cleo doesn't use the same eligibility requirements as other cash advance apps, they do have an AI algorithm that analyzes your information to determine your eligibility. The results of that algorithm may influence how much money you're allowed to borrow. Your advance will be sent to your account within 3 to 4 business days for free, or you can pay a $3.99 to $9.99 fee to get your funds the same day. Cleo also has a credit score feature, savings tools, and cashback offers. Cleo is available on the Google Play Store ."

      "content": "Brigit can advance you up to $250 as often as you want. Brigit doesn't specify that you need employment to get an advance, just that you need regular bank account activity.
