      "content": "Take a wheelchair skills class. Individuals in wheelchairs may feel limited by things such as moving while holding things. Many places offer wheelchair skills classes to increase your feeling of independence and inspire you to rethink what your future holds. These classes cover the basics including pushing forwards and backwards, but they also address more complex moves like pushing with 1 hand, going up and down ramps and even stairs, and navigating curbs. [2] X Research source Ask your doctor, physical therapist, or other wheelchair users if they know of any wheelchair skills classes in your area. Look for online programs to teach you wheelchair skills. Organizations such as the University of Washington or the United Spinal Association offer online wheelchair skills training. Make sure that you have a physical therapist or trained spotter on hand to prevent falls. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Maintain a positive outlook. You might feel like you can do less in a wheelchair. But this isn’t the case: you can do as much as someone who isn’t in a wheelchair, from participating in races to cooking meals and even skydiving. Keeping your outlook positive and expectations for yourself high can help boost your confidence. It can also show others how capable you are, which will keep them from expecting less from you. Take time to explore all of the things you can do with a wheelchair, including things that wheelchair users may not be able to do. For example, you can try things such as skydiving, parasailing, waterskiing, basketball, hunting, kayaking, rock climbing, golf, skiing, and bowling. Doing these types of activities can boost your mood—and your confidence. Recognize that you can also do things such as preparing a big meal for your family, attend concerts, and even go on a vacation. Talking with a peer support group of other wheelchair users can help you adjust to being in a wheelchair and figure out ways to stay positive. [4] X Research source"

[6] X Research source Seek out encouragement from friends, family members, and other wheelchair users. These people can boost your confidence and help you tackle anything that you put your mind to. Meet with a therapist who specializes in working with wheelchair users. This person can give you techniques to overcome your fear, concern, and anxiety.

This doesn’t mean that you are any less dependent, but understand your boundaries. This can also help others know when you may need a little assistance. Recognize that many people might want to or offer help. Decline the person or people politely and with a smile. For example, say, “Thank you so much for your kind offer, but I think I’ve got this.” Reach out for assistance to loved ones if you need it. You can say, “Hi Allie, I’m sorry to bother you, but my transportation service just called to cancel. Would you be able to run me to the store or pick up a few things for me. I am running low on food and some other necessities.”"

In many cases, you can subsidize modifications to make your home more maneuverable. Check your flooring to see if you can easily move on it. It may be difficult to navigate with thick carpeting or area rugs. Look for any obstacles that might get in your way. This can be tables, chairs, or even the corners of items in your home. Keep your basic necessities within arm’s reach. This includes toiletries and medications as well as food and kitchen items. Add ramps and grab bars where you might need them, such as in the bathroom and at entryways to your home.
