      "content": "Gather your new strings, wire cutters , and a string winder . Restringing a guitar doesn't take a lot of tools. Most string winders come with a notch that you can use to pop out the bridge pins (if you have an acoustic guitar). Wire cutters come in handy for trimming the long tails off the ends once you're done, so they don't poke or scratch you. [2] X Research source Choose your new guitar strings based on your personal taste, your budget, and the sound you want from your instrument."

Experienced luthiers have equipment specifically built for this, but all you need is a stack of books at the right height to keep the neck nice and level.

      "content": "Turn the tuning knob to unwind each string. Start with the highest, thinnest string and loosen it up. You might pluck the string to make sure you're turning the correct tuning knob in the right way—if the pitch lowers, you're unwinding it. Go ahead and loosen all of the strings, moving from the highest to the lowest. [4] X Research source You don't need a string winder for this—you can just use your fingers—but the string winder makes the job go a lot faster."

      "content": "Remove the strings from the bridge of the guitar. Use the slot on your string winder to pop the pins out . A set of needle-nose pliers works just as well if your string winder doesn't have the slot for the bridge pins. Once you pull the pin out, pull the string out and away from your guitar. [5] X Research source Since the strings are off the neck, it doesn't matter what order you go in here. While all the strings are off, you have a great opportunity to clean your guitar and the fretboard. Despite what you might have heard, nothing bad is going to happen to your guitar if you take all the strings off at once. You can do them one at a time if you want, but the whole process will likely take you longer. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Insert each new string into the bridge and secure the bridge pins. Bend the string at a 90-degree angle just above the ball-end so it'll catch. That'll keep it from sliding down too far when you put the bridge pin back in. Now, push the pin back in with your thumb. Go ahead and do that with all 6 strings.

This keeps the sharp points of the string from scratching or poking you as you play your guitar. [10] X Research source If you're not confident that the string won't slip, wait until after you've tuned your guitar to trim the excess string. That way, it'll be easier to thread it back through and rewind it."

There are a couple of special styles, though, that have a different system: [13] X Research source Floyd Rose and tremolo systems : snip off the ball-end and poke the end of the string into the saddle until it's centered, then trap it there. Les Paul-style : feed the non-bell-end of the string through the guitar's tailpiece and keep pulling until it hits the bell-end and stops."

Feed each string through the inside hole of its tuning post so that it goes out the other end. If your guitar doesn't have a locking nut, feed the tail end of the string back around the tuner and under the string. That creates a kink in the string that will help hold it in place.
