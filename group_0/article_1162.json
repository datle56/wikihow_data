      "title": "Focus on red, yellow and orange vegetables.",
      "content": "Focus on red, yellow and orange vegetables. Vegetables are an important food group to prevent a variety of diseases and cancers. However, red, yellow and orange vegetables have high levels of vitamins and antioxidants that can help keep your colon healthy. [2] X Research source What makes these vegetables that particular color are the vitamins and antioxidants that are found in them. Red, yellow and orange vegetables are particularly high in an antioxidant known as beta carotene which is an orange/red color. This antioxidant is often associated with Vitamin A as it is a precursor to becoming Vitamin A in your body. Adequate intakes are also associated with a decreased rate of colon cancer. Include a one cup serving of any of these colored vegetables. You can try: red, yellow and orange bell peppers, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, butternut squash and carrots."

      "title": "Include folate-rich foods.",
      "content": "Include folate-rich foods. Another group of foods that can help protect your colon and resist the formation of polyps are folate-rich foods. Luckily, folate can be found in a wide variety of foods. Studies have shown that an intake of 400 IU of folate every day can help prevent the formation of polyps but also helps prevent colon cancer as well. [3] X Research source 400 IU of folate is easily consumed if you eat a balanced diet and focus on folate-rich foods. Specific foods that are high in folate include: fortified breakfast cereals, spinach, black-eyed peas, asparagus, broccoli, green peas, whole wheat bread and peanuts."

      "title": "Consume calcium-rich foods.",
      "content": "Consume calcium-rich foods. Calcium is another commonly found mineral that has been shown to prevent the formation of colon polyps. Including regular servings of foods high in calcium can help protect your colon. One study in particular showed that those people who consumed 1200 mg of calcium daily (which you can get from three servings of calcium-rich foods), had a 20% less recurrence of cancerous colon polyps. Calcium is found most commonly in dairy foods. You can have milk, yogurt, kefir, cheese or cottage cheese to get in an adequate serving of calcium. In addition, calcium is found in other plant-based foods outside of the dairy group. Almonds, broccoli, dark greens, and fortified orange juice or soy milk offer another source of calcium."

      "title": "Focus on healthy fats.",
      "content": "Focus on healthy fats. Some foods contain a certain type of fat called omega-3 fats. Often known as heart healthy fats, these fats are also beneficial to your colon. [4] X Research source Studies have shown that omega-3 fats help maintain and even improve cell health in the colon. Include regular servings of healthy fats to help prevent colon polyps. Healthy fats are found in a wide variety of foods. Include a serving of these foods daily to help protect your colon and prevent the formation of polyps. Include foods like: avocado, olive oil, olives, salmon, tuna, sardines, mackerel, walnuts and flaxseeds."

      "title": "Drink more water.",
      "content": "Drink more water. Although water is not a specific food or a nutrient, it's essential to overall health. Specifically, studies have shown that a lack of adequate water can lead to dehydration and polyp formation in your colon. [5] X Research source When you don't drink adequate amounts of fluids, your body will harvest free water from other areas - like your stool or other cells. This causes dehydration and constipation. Decreased bowel transit time and the concentration of carcinogenic compounds that are found in cells can increase your risk for the growth of cancerous polyps. Health professionals recommend drinking about 64 oz or 8 glasses of water everyday. However, you may need to increase your water intake to prevent constipation.

      "content": "Eat an adequate amount of vegetables daily. Vegetables are high in a variety of nutrients that can keep your body healthy. However, they're also high in fiber which can help protect your colon. Fiber is essential to keeping your bowels moving at a healthy speed. When your bowel transit is slow, you increase your risk for colon polyps and cancer. [7] X Research source To meet your recommended fiber intake, include three to five servings of vegetables everyday. Measure out one cup of vegetables or two cups of salad greens.

      "content": "Go for 100% whole grains. One specific group of foods that are also known for being very high in fiber are grains. However, choose 100% whole grains over the refined grains for the most nutrient dense choice. Whenever you choose to eat grains (like bread, rice or pasta), go for 100% whole grains. These foods are less processed and much higher in fiber compared to refined grains (like white rice or white bread). Include two to three servings of whole grains every day. Measure these out to 1/2 cup of cooked grains or 2 oz per serving.

Legumes are not only high in protein, but are also very high in fiber. These are a great food group to add to your diet to help increase your overall fiber intake. Legumes are a plant-based group that include foods like beans, lentils and nuts. Since they do fall into the protein group, they follow the recommendations for those serving sizes. Measure out 1/2 cup of these foods per serving.

      "content": "Choose foods fortified with extra fiber. Since fiber plays such an important role in general health, many food manufacturers have been adding fiber to their products. This is a great way to help people meet their daily needs. Fiber is found in a wide variety of foods, but it can still be difficult to meet your daily needs. Men need 38 g of fiber daily while women need about 25 g of fiber daily. [12] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In addition to choosing foods and food groups that are high in fiber, also look for foods that have added fiber to them. This fiber is added during the processing of the food and can help you meet your needs. Foods that are commonly fortified with extra fiber include: yogurt, soy milk, cereals, breads, orange juice and granola bars."

      "content": "Limit your intake of saturated fats. Although there are many foods that you should eat more often to help prevent colon polyps, there are foods that you should limit or avoid. Saturated fats, unlike omega-3 fats, have been shown to increase your risk for the formation of colon polyps and colon cancer. [13] X Research source One study in particular found that for every additional 100 grams of red meat that you consume (which is higher in saturated fat) your risk for colon cancer increases by 14%. Limit meats: fatty cuts of beef, salami, hot dogs, bacon, sausage and deli meat. These are highly processed and high in saturated fat. If you do choose to have these foods occasionally, stick to the appropriate portion of 3 to 4 oz total per serving.

      "content": "Decrease your sugar consumption. You may not realize that another group of foods that has been linked to colon polyps and colon cancer are sugary, sweetened foods. Limit these in your diet. The sugar from sweetened foods increase your glucose levels. Studies have shown that with increased glucose levels, your risk for the formation of colon cancer increases as well. [15] X Research source Foods that are high in sugar and that should be limited include: sweetened beverages, candy, cookies, cakes, pies, ice cream, sugary cereals, pastries and fruit juices. If you do choose to have these foods, make sure they are small portions and something you only eat occasionally - not on a regular basis."

      "content": "Try to avoid burned, charred, or fried meats. In addition to avoiding or limiting certain foods, you should also take care of how you prepare certain foods. Charring or burning foods when you cook them may increase your risk of colon cancer. [16] X Research source When you cook foods, especially over a grill, you can char or burn them. Although this may taste good, this charring creates carcinogenic substances in the food which have been associated with higher rates of colon cancer. If you are grilling foods try to avoid foods from becoming overly charred. When eating, avoid the blackened bits or areas that are charred. Remove with a fork and knife so they are completely removed from your serving. Another trick is to grill or cook foods over aluminum foil. This helps prevent foods from becoming too charred or burned."

      "content": "Limit your intake of alcohol. In addition to sweetened beverages, alcoholic beverages have also been linked to the formation of colon polyps. You should limit your overall intake of alcoholic beverages. Studies have shown that regular consumption of alcohol (more than the recommended limit of one to two glasses daily) is associated with increased risk of colon polyp formation. In addition, those people who have had a history of colon polyps are at an increased risk for those polyps becoming cancerous with more excessive intake of alcoholic beverages. Try to limit how much alcohol you consume. Women shouldn't consume more than one drink daily and men should limit their intake to two drinks or less per day."
