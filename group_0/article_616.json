      "title": "Check your game's patch level.",
      "content": "Check your game's patch level. The Sims 4 still receives frequent updates, and if you install a mod meant for an older version of the game, it can cause problems or even corrupt your saves. You'll need to know your patch level to know if a mod is compatible with your game. Open File Explorer or Finder . Go to Documents. Open the folder called Electronic Arts . Open the folder called The Sims 4 . Double-click on the file named GameVersion.txt . Check the patch number listed in the file."

      "title": "Download a mod.",
      "content": "Download a mod. Many creators publish mods through sites like Mod The Sims, but some also post mods on independent websites or social media sites like Tumblr. Make sure the mod is compatible with your patch level. Most modders will list patch compatibility on the mod's information or download page. If you're running the Legacy Edition, check to see if the mod is compatible with the Legacy Edition. Some creators have old versions of their mods available for Legacy Edition players; others do not. Some popular mods as of July 2021 include MC Command Center, TwistedMexi's T.O.O.L. and Better LastExceptions, roBurky's Meaningful Stories, KawaiiStacie's Slice of Life, Weerbusu's More Columns in Create-a-Sim, Turbodriver's WonderfulWhims, Scarlet's and LittleMsSam's Faster Homework, and LittleMsSam's Random Bug Fixes."

      "content": "Extract the mods from the RAR or ZIP file. Mods are often stored in .zip, .rar, or .7z files, but the game can't read these files. You need to extract the files first. Windows: Use 7Zip, right-click on the .rar or .zip file, and choose Extract to \"*\\\" . Mac: Use The Unarchiver and double-click the file to extract it."

      "title": "Open your Mods folder.",
      "content": "Open your Mods folder. The Sims 4 comes with the necessary files and folders for mods by default. Open File Explorer or Finder . Open Documents. Open the folder called Electronic Arts . Open the folder called The Sims 4 . Open the folder called Mods . (There will be a file inside it called Resource.cfg - don't touch this file.)"

      "content": "Place your mods into the Mods folder. You can either drag and drop your .package and/or .ts4script files into the Mods folder, or you can cut and paste them using Ctrl + X and Ctrl + V (or ⌘ Cmd + C and ⌘ Cmd + ⌥ Option + V on a Mac). If you want to organize your mods, you can create subfolders within the Mods folder. .package files can be placed up to five subfolders deep (e.g. Mods\\CAS\\Clothing\\Child\\Shoes\\Package ). However, .ts4script files can only be placed up to one subfolder deep (e.g. Mods\\Scripts )."

      "content": "Enable mods in your game. The Sims 4 doesn't always enable mods by default, so when you install a mod, you'll need to make sure the game is reading it. Click on the ... in the upper right-hand corner of your game to pull up the menu. Click Game Options . This will bring up the Game Options menu. Go to the Other tab. Check the boxes next to \"Enable Custom Content and Mods\" and \"Script Mods Allowed\". Click Apply Changes in the lower right-hand corner of the menu, close the menu, and restart your game."

If you placed a .zip, .rar, .7z, .txt, or .png file into your Mods folder, that's not the mod, and the game can't read it."

      "title": "Know when mods aren't working properly.",
      "content": "Know when mods aren't working properly. Mod conflicts or bugs can be obvious, but other times they can be fairly subtle and mistaken for normal in-game glitches. However, if mods are causing an issue in your game, you might encounter issues such as: Sims not completing actions. They might \"jump\", stop the action midway through, or do the action for hours without completing it. Sims freezing or getting stuck in a \"T-pose\", where their arms are sticking out. Odd behavior in general - objects might not work properly, you have empty options when clicking on things, or other abnormalities. Your game running unusually slow, when this wasn't a problem before. Your game crashing or refusing to start, and clearing your caches doesn't fix it. Flashing blue squares in place of family portraits or buffs. (Don't save your game in this state - it will corrupt your save!) MC Command Center or TMex's Better Last Exceptions giving you popups about errors, particularly when the game first starts up."

      "title": "Use the 50/50 method to narrow down the problem.",
      "content": "Use the 50/50 method to narrow down the problem. The 50/50 method is commonly used to rule out which of your mods are causing issues and which aren't. Open your Mods folder and move about half the files somewhere else onto your computer. Start your game, load a saved game, and see if the problem goes away. If the problem persists, close your game and remove half of your files again. Repeat the process until you stop experiencing problems. Once you've stopped experiencing the problem, begin adding in your mods one at a time and then loading your save again. Eventually, after adding one of the mods, you will start experiencing the bug again. This means that the mod you added back is what's causing your problem. Quit your game and remove the mod you just added back."

      "title": "Check that you have all the necessary mod packs.",
      "content": "Check that you have all the necessary mod packs. Some game mods require expansion packs, game packs, or stuff packs in order to work properly - otherwise, they won't work right or will cause problems. If you've accidentally put a mod in your game that needs a pack you don't have, you'll start getting errors or glitchy behavior, and you'll either need to remove it or get the pack. Sites like Mod The Sims will list any required packs on the download page, and modders using independent sites will typically list any required packs as well."

    {
      "title": "Update all mods after patches.",
      "content": "Update all mods after patches. Major (or even minor) updates to The Sims 4 can often break mods. While the game will automatically disable mods after an update, you need to update your mods before you enable them again, or else you can encounter game-breaking bugs. Keep track of all the mods you download and check the modder's download page for information on updates. Many modders will have mod status pages listing whether a mod is compatible with the latest patch or needs to be updated. Modders can go inactive. If a mod hasn't received updates for several patches, remove it from your game."
