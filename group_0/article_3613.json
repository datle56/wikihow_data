[4] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 21 July 2020. For example, an unrealistic thought might be something like, “My roommate never does anything to help keep our apartment clean! I do everything!” Before you allow yourself to get angrier due to this thought, take a moment to decide if this is really true. Does your roommate do different things than you do to keep the apartment clean? If so, then the word “never” in this statement is not realistic. Try rewriting the thought or statement into something more realistic, such as “I wish my roommate would pitch in a little more than she does with household chores.”"

Instead of letting frustration build to rage, speak up and confront the source of your frustration.

[6] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source If you've felt disrespected or hurt by someone, you may want to inflict the same emotional pain upon them. Instead of doing this, let them know that they hurt your feelings and that you felt disrespected by their actions. Instead of letting your anger build, let the person know what they did wrong. Say something like \"I don't like that you did that. It really makes me angry and upset.\""

Being able to listen well and communicate in a constructive, assertive way may also help you to feel in control of your anger and be kind to others. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Communicating your feelings and emotions will help other people understand your frame of mind and relieve a lot of stress. Often arguments or disagreements can arise because of a lack of communication and a lack of understanding when it comes to people's motivations. Try to be more truthful in conversation, even if it makes the situation less than perfect, or you think that the person may not like you for it. Do not skirt around issues that make you feel uncomfortable. Put away distractions and give the person your full attention. As you listen, try to suspend judgment. Just try to understand what the person is saying and where they are coming from. When you express yourself, use “I” statements instead of “you” statements. Try saying things like, “I feel frustrated when you forget to pick up your dishes.” Don’t say things like, “You never clean up after yourself!” Communicating effectively also means sometimes being vulnerable and talking about things that could be embarrassing. For example, if a friend does something you don't approve of, instead of yelling and saying things that you'll regret, say something like, \"When you made that joke, and everyone laughed, it made me feel sad. I was humiliated, and even though you didn't think it was a big deal, it really hurt my feelings.\""

[14] X Research source This can spiral into having a negative view of the world, and it can put you in a constant state of anger. Don't put down other people's work or effort.
