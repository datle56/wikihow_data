      "content": "Start early. If you are serious about Olympic-level figure skating, you should start training as a child. [2] X Research source Some Olympic-level skaters (such as Johnny Weir) started as late as their early teenage years, but this is rare. Many figure skaters start around 5 years old. However, there are successful figure skaters who began in the 7-12 age range. If you're willing to work to catch up to your peers if you need to, then don't be discouraged by your age."

      "title": "Choose a rink.",
      "content": "Choose a rink. Find an ice skating rink in your area where you can practice figure skating regularly. You will want to find a rink nearby. Elite skaters spend 3-5 hours on the ice, and about 2-3 hours off the ice, nearly every day. If you are serious about becoming an Olympic - bound athlete you also need to consider the resources that each rink offers. Does the rink host any competitions or shows that could give you exposure? Do other higher-level skaters already train there? Sometimes a close by rink might not be able to let you reach your full potential."

      "content": "Assemble a team of adults and professionals to help you. Firstly, find a coach and take lessons. Plan for 1-2 private lessons per day. It’s okay to start with group lessons, but find a coach who is available to teach you multiple times per day, such as before and after school. Most Olympic skaters also have more than one coach. One for expression and the performance aspect and another for skills and jumping, depending on the level. Find a choreographer. You will need someone who is familiar with all the rules of skating and what elements would be allowed, as well as what elements you are good at. A good program can win almost by itself and a good choreographer can insure this. Find an off ice athletics pro/teacher as well. This person will be skilled in yoga and personal training and will be able to lead you in activities/drills to improve your on ice skating. Find a manager. This person will help organize all the paperwork and other things needed to compete. This person will keep track of your schedule and when the next competitions are as well as deadlines for entry forms. They can also help organize press and other media if you become famous."

If you do wish to continue, push through the low period with training and exercise, but also make time for things you need to avoid burnout, such as time listening to your favorite music or a professional massage."
