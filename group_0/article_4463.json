However, they don’t believe that spells of any kind are guaranteed. Even when you properly prepare your spell, follow all of the steps, and have the proper intention, the outcome you desire may not happen because it’s simply not meant to be or the timing isn’t right.

      "title": "Are break-up spells a bad idea?",
      "content": "Are break-up spells a bad idea? It depends on your intention. If you’re casting a spell to break up a couple that is truly in love for selfish or vengeful reasons, it may not work. And some believe the negative energy you put out will come back on you threefold, meaning it’s 3 times as bad for you as what you originally intended for the other person.

[25] X Research source Use Mars' energy to evoke combativeness, but be careful. It’s also associated with violence, danger, and cruelty. Time your spell at dusk or midnight during a waning moon for the best results. [26] X Research source"

      "title": "Do break-up spells weaken over time?",
      "content": "Do break-up spells weaken over time? It’s possible a break-up spell will weaken over time. Even the most powerful break-up spell can become less powerful against a couple with deep emotional bonds. The spell might cause conflict, but it can’t take away the bonds they share. [27] X Research source A break-up spell that interferes with someone else’s relationship without their consent is not ethical and may be hard to maintain."

      "title": "Do break-up spells work as well as binding love spells?",
      "content": "Do break-up spells work as well as binding love spells? There’s no straightforward answer for whether break-up spells work better than binding love spells. It depends on who is casting the spell, what their intention is, and whether they have faith in their ability to change reality. It can also depend on the type of spell they use. For example, a white magick break-up spell with a focus on the best outcome for everyone involved may have a more positive result than a black magick spell that seeks to bend the will of another. [28] X Research source There are two main types of binding spells. The first binds two people together magically and spiritually as in a handfasting ceremony. The other binds a person to prevent them from doing something. Most famously, the New Forest Coven of Great Britain led by Gerald Gardner cast a spell to bind Hitler and prevent him from invading England during WWII. [29] X Research source"

      "title": "Is it possible to resist break-up spells?",
      "content": "Is it possible to resist break-up spells? Yes, a person’s free will is extremely powerful. Even if the spell is initially successful, it may not be able to continue to manipulate a person who hasn’t consented to the spell. Plus, if they’re aware that a spell has been cast on them, they can take steps to remove , reverse , or break it. [30] X Research source A break-up spell is a type of love spell because it interferes with a person’s love life."
