      "content": "Wait a full day to treat your soapstone following installation. After having your soapstone surface put in, hold off on handling it for at least 24 hours. This will give the adhesives used during the installation process time to finish curing, ensuring that each piece stays remains secure for a good long time. [1] X Research source Putting off cleaning or oiling your soapstone for a while will also give you time to consider whether you want to oil it at all—some homeowners prefer to let the stone develop its own unique patina organically through regular use."

      "content": "Clean the surface with soap and water. Before you begin oiling your soapstone, saturate a soft, clean, lint-free cloth, microfiber towel, or sponge with a mild soapy water solution and use it to go over the entire surface. [2] X Expert Source Regina DeCorte Residential Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 11 February 2022. Then, wring out your cloth, re-wet it with clean water, and wipe the surface again to rinse it. [3] X Research source Be sure to soak up any standing water or traces of soap remaining on the surface prior to proceeding. A quick wipedown will help remove dust and other debris so it doesn’t end up in your initial coat of oil."

      "content": "Drizzle a small amount of mineral oil onto the surface. Use just enough oil to spread a thin coat onto the surface by hand. Pour the oil directly onto the soapstone—it’s naturally non-porous, so it won’t absorb oil or moisture. [4] X Research source The fact that soapstone has a solid finish also means you won’t have to worry about it feeling slick or greasy as a result of becoming clogged with oil. of oil for every 1 square foot (0.093 m 2 ) of soapstone should be plenty.}}"

It should appear faintly glossy all over. If you’ve missed a spot, it will be obvious. If you apply the oil unevenly, some sections of the soapstone make turn out darker than others."

      "title": "Allow the oil to sit for about half an hour.",
      "content": "Allow the oil to sit for about half an hour. Remember, the oil won’t actually soak into the soapstone. What it’s doing is trapping moisture against the outer surface of the stone, which will eventually cause it to oxidize and take on a deep, rich, near-black color. Soapstone fresh from the quarry is a very light gray color. After a few coats of mineral oil will darken it to a more robust earthy tone."

      "title": "Use a separate cloth to remove any excess oil.",
      "content": "Use a separate cloth to remove any excess oil. Take a second clean, dry, lint-free cloth or paper towel and run it over the top of the soapstone. Doing so will pick up any lingering oil residue, leaving the surface sleek and ready for use. [8] X Research source The oil left on the soapstone will safeguard against spills and minor wear and tear while also giving the material an elegant aged look."

      "content": "Re-oil your soapstone surface once a week for the first 1-2 months. For subsequent applications, simply dab a little oil onto a folded cloth and use it to lightly buff the surface from corner to corner. Frequent treatments will encourage the stone to deepen in color even further. [9] X Research source There’s no need to re-oil the surface at all following its initial treatment, if you don’t want to. In fact, many homeowners opt to let their soapstone return to its original light gray color."

      "title": "Continue oiling the surface as needed when its water-resistance wears off.",
      "content": "Continue oiling the surface as needed when its water-resistance wears off. After the first couple of months, you can cut back to applying oil on a provisional basis and reduce the amount of attention you give your soapstone. A good rule of thumb is to polish on a fresh coat whenever you notice that water is no longer beading on the surface, or forms dark stain-like spots where it collects on the stone. If you want to add oiling your soapstone surfaces to your cleaning schedule, once every 2-3 months is a good interval to shoot for. [10] X Research source Discoloration caused by moisture is temporary, and won’t affect the look of your soapstone surfaces in the long run."

No expensive products or complicated techniques required—just stir a few drops of liquid dish soap into a container of warm water and wet a clean cloth, microfiber towel, or non-abrasive sponge or scrubbing pad.

It’s perfectly alright to break out that bottle of multi-surface cleaner when you’re battling stuck-on gunk or just don’t have time to prepare a gentle soap solution. Most ordinary cleaning chemicals are mild enough to clean soapstone without harming it. Give it a spritz and a wipe and call it a day. [12] X Research source The best chemical cleaners are non-abrasive and feature organic surfactants and disinfectants as their primary active ingredients. [13] X Research source Disinfecting wipes can make a great cleaning aid when you want to sterilize soapstone countertops in a hurry after working with raw meat or similar ingredients."

      "content": "Avoid using vinegar, citrus, or harsh chemical cleaners on soapstone. Cleaning products containing strong acids are a particularly big no-no. These can actually eat away at the soft stone over time, robbing it of its luster and leaving it vulnerable to serious damage like etching, pitting, or breaking.

If you’re a stickler for natural ingredients, you can mix up a quick, simple soapstone-safe cleaner using a combination of water, rubbing alcohol, and mild liquid dish soap. Add a few drops of your favorite essential oils to give your homemade cleaner an irresistible scent! [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Sand and oil deep scratches to minimize their appearance. One of the only downsides of soapstone is that it is possible to leave noticeable scratches or gouges in the soft material if you’re not careful. Fortunately, a little nick isn’t the end of the world. Just buff the scratch with a sheet of high-grit sandpaper and immediately rub on a coat of oil to protect the newly-smoothed finish. When you’re done, it should look as good as new! Go with an ultra-fine 120- to 22-grit sandpaper to avoid doing any more unwanted damage to the scratched surface. To decrease the risk of a bad scratch, always use a cutting board to prepare food items, and never set hot pots or pans directly on your soapstone surface."
