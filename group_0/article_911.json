      "title": "Write “The (Surname) Family” for formal occasions.",
      "content": "Write “The (Surname) Family” for formal occasions. When addressing an envelope to an entire family rather than a single individual, you have two options: use the family name to represent the entire family or specifically address the envelope to some (or all) of the family members. Writing “The (Surname) Family” is the more formal option, though it’s also appropriate for general communication, like friendly letters. [1] X Research source However, this option may be unwise if it’s important to know who the letter is specifically for (like wedding invitations ). For example, if you’re writing a letter to Tim and Janet Jones and their children, Emma and Peter, address the envelope to “The Jones Family.” Claytor says, “On the envelope, make sure it says “family” so whoever opens the mail realizes the message is for everyone.” [2] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 20 May 2021."

      "title": "Use the plural form of the family name for casual letters.",
      "content": "Use the plural form of the family name for casual letters. It’s also acceptable to simply use the plural form of the family’s surname as the first line of the envelope’s address. In this case, the plural family name is always preceded by the word “The” so that the final result is in the form of “The Smiths,” “The Garcias,” and so on. [3] X Research source This is generally considered the more casual option, so it may not be appropriate for formal letters. Do not use apostrophes to make a last name plural. Apostrophes are used to convey possession. Most family names simply need an “-s” at the end to become plural (e.g., Thompsons, Lincolns). However, names that end with an “s,” “sh,” or “x” sound usually need an “-es” at the end (e.g. Roses, Foxes, Welshes). For example, if you’re writing a letter to the Jones family, you would write “The Joneses.”"

      "content": "Include all surnames if the family doesn’t share the same one. Claytor says, “We now have families where not everyone shares the same name, so you would put the last name of both adults and [include] family after that.” [4] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 16 February 2022. In the case of blended families, unmarried couples, or any other family that has different surnames, address each person’s surname to show respect. For example, if you were writing to Jim Green and Donna Smith, address the envelope to “Mr. Jim Green and Ms. Donna Smith.” Another option is to write “The Green-Smith Family” to simplify the address. [5] X Research source Depending on the situation, it may also be appropriate to send an individual letter to each person. For example, if you were writing to the divorced parents of a child, address one envelope to “Mr. Jim Green” and another to “Ms. Donna Smith.”"

      "content": "Address the rest of the envelope as normal. Regardless of the method you use for the first line of your envelope’s address, the rest of the address is written as it would be for any other letter. Under the first line containing the family name, write the street number or PO box. On the next line, write the city, state/province, postal code, and so on. If writing internationally, write the name of the country below on a separate fourth line. Write your return address in the same fashion in the top left corner of the envelope. [6] X Research source For example, a final address might look something like this: The Jones Family (or \"The Joneses\") 21 Jump Street Anytown, CA, 98765"

      "title": "Begin with the parents’ names and titles.",
      "content": "Begin with the parents’ names and titles. When addressing an envelope to an entire family, another option is to name some or all of them individually. This method is useful for letters, for which it’s important to convey who the letter is specifically for, such as wedding invitations. On the first line of your address, write the parents’ names, using their appropriate titles (ex: Mr. and Mrs. Jones). Mr. and Mrs. are usually safe, while titles like “Dr.,” “Judge,” and so on are usually optional outside of formal or professional contexts. [7] X Research source It’s also acceptable to use the traditional form of describing married couples, in which the husband’s full name serves for both partners: “Mr. and Mrs. Tim Jones.” However, this method isn’t necessary, and some couples may find it outdated. Another option is to write each partner’s full name, sans titles: “Tim and Janet Jones.” This is typically used in familiar, informal contexts, as using someone’s first name rather than their title can be seen as rude if you don’t know them well. For same-sex couples , you might consider including both individuals’ first names to avoid any confusion when pluralizing titles. For example, “Mrs. Ashley Young and Mrs. Rosa Young” or “Mr. David Lewis and Mr. Patrick Lewis.”"

Provide the family name once at the end of the list of names (e.g., David, Chelsea, and Gabriela Richardson), or leave it out entirely (e.g., David, Chelsea, and Gabriela). If you know the ages of the children, list them from oldest to youngest.

In this case, on the second line where you would normally name the children, write “and Family” instead. You may also use “and Children” to make your intent more specific. For example, the first two lines of your address might look like this: Mr. and Mrs. Jones and Children"

If the contents of your letter don’t pertain to the children, name the relevant recipients in the first line, then proceed immediately to the street address without using a second line to list additional family members. [9] X Research source For instance, if you only want to invite the parents of the Jones family to a party, use the standard “Mr. and Mrs. Jones” without naming any of their children."

If the family contains any children over 18 (or the traditional age of adulthood in the recipient’s community), send those children their own separate letter in addition to the one you send their parents. Receiving your own mail is a sign of adulthood. Though it’s relatively minor, it can be perceived as somewhat insulting to, for instance, be invited to a party via a letter addressed to one’s parents. [10] X Research source"

If multiple generations of adults live in the same household, it’s important to address them all so that each generation is properly acknowledged. For example, write “Mr. John Smith Sr., Mr. John Smith Jr., and Family.” For less formal occasions, however, it’s usually okay to address the entire family as “The (Surname) Family.” Another traditional option is to write “Mr. and Mrs. John Smith, Mr. and Mrs. George Smith, and Family.” If each generation has a different surname, be sure to list each one. For casual events, it’s also okay to simply address each individual by their first name."

If you’re addressing a child directly rather than the parents or the whole family, write their first and last names the way you would for an adult. For formal letters, write “C/O (their parents’ names)” on the second line. This stands for “care of.” [11] X Research source For example, an envelope addressed to a child named Nicole Lopez might look like this: Nicole Lopez C/O Mr. Jorge Lopez and Mrs. Maria Lopez Claytor provides an example of when you might want to send a child their own envelope: “If there are young children in the house—say they’re about 7 or 8—they’d like to get a card.

In these situations, a small, usually pre-addressed reply envelope is often included inside the outer envelope. These two envelopes are usually addressed slightly differently when the recipient is an entire family. To start, address the outer envelope with only the names of the parents or heads of household. [13] X Research source For example, if you’re inviting the entire Jones family to your wedding, address the outer envelope as “Mr. and Mrs. Jones,” “Mr. and Mrs. Tim Jones,” or “Tim and Janet Jones.”"

[14] X Research source If you’re only requesting a response from the parents, however, only write their names on the first line, then proceed to the street address.

      "content": "Include a stamp on the return envelope. Regardless of who you’re requesting a response from, it’s a sign of courtesy to pre-stamp your letter’s return envelope. Including a stamp is more a sign of respect and care than financial aid, so avoid a minor faux pas by taking the time to give your letter’s return envelope a stamp. [15] X Research source Remember to send separate letters to children who are over 18. When sending a letter with a return envelope, this means you’ll need to address and stamp each return envelope with the name of the over-18 child in the return address, as well."

      "title": "Consider the event’s formality.",
      "content": "Consider the event’s formality. How formal or casual the event is will determine how you should address the family you’re writing to. For formal letters , use full names and titles (e.g. Dr., Mrs., Reverend, etc.) and list each family member individually to show respect and attention to detail. Avoid using nicknames or abbreviations (e.g. Ave instead of Avenue), as well. [16] X Research source For casual correspondence, it’s okay to use first names only or address the family as a unit. Nicknames and abbreviations are also acceptable. Claytor says, “I would say if it’s close relatives, the Mr. and Mrs. isn’t necessarily required, but I always put that because I’m a traditionalist.” [17] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 16 February 2022."

      "title": "Be sensitive to family dynamics.",
      "content": "Be sensitive to family dynamics. If the parents of a family are divorced, it’s generally a good idea to send separate invitations to each parent, especially if the event is formal. For blended or multi-generational families, consider the relationships within the family and acknowledge each family member or generation appropriately. For example, if individuals have different surnames, be sure to include all names to show respect. If you know the family’s dynamics are more relaxed and it won’t offend anyone, it may be okay to address everyone together as “The (Surname) Family.” If you’re not sure how to address a certain family, ask them! For example, some separated couples may be fine with receiving a joint invitation."

    {
      "title": "Use titles correctly.",
      "content": "Use titles correctly. Using proper titles is an important way to show respect. If you know someone is a doctor or reverend, for example, address them as such rather than using “Mr.” or “Mrs.” Be sure to pair each title with the appropriate name. [18] X Research source If multiple people have a title, make sure to address them all as such. For example, if Beth and David Green are both doctors, address them as “Dr. Beth Green and Dr. David Green.” Boys and men without a specific title should usually be addressed as “Mr.” Girls under 18 should be addressed as “Miss,” unmarried women are addressed as “Ms.,” and most married women are addressed as “Mrs.” Some married women may prefer “Ms.,” however, especially if they kept their maiden name. Some non-binary people use the title “Mx.,” but check with them first to find out how they prefer to be addressed. Using the proper title shows respect to the recipient. Claytor says, “For example, if you’re sending [a letter] to the President of the United States, you would say President Joe Biden. You wouldn’t say Mr. Joe Biden, right?” [19] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 16 February 2022."

      "title": "Be clear about who you’re inviting.",
      "content": "Be clear about who you’re inviting. Regardless of formality, make sure your recipient knows exactly who the letter or invitation is addressed to. Avoid any abbreviations that could cause confusion, and be direct if the recipients are allowed to bring additional people. [20] X Research source For example, if you’re inviting a couple to a child-free event, don’t address your envelope to the family as a whole. This may imply that the couple’s children are invited, as well. On the invitation itself, specify that the event is child-free."
