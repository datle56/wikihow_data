      "content": "Write the date and the judge's address in the top left. Use left aligned text to write today's date, followed by the judge's full address. If you are not sure how to format this, see the section on addressing the judge on the envelope."

      "title": "Write your own address beneath this.",
      "content": "Write your own address beneath this. Add your own, full address, beginning two lines beneath the judge's. Include your name, street address, city, and zip code."

      "title": "Write \"Dear Judge (surname),\" to begin the letter.",
      "content": "Write \"Dear Judge (surname),\" to begin the letter. For almost all judges, write \"Dear Judge\" followed by the judge's last name to begin the letter. Write this on its own line, followed by a comma. Address justices of the UK Supreme Court as \"Dear (Lord/Lady) (surname)\" instead. If writing to a U.S. state or federal Supreme Court, use “Dear Justice” instead. If a judge's title is \"Chief Judge\" or \"Chief Justice,\" you may use that title instead. \"Judge\" or \"Justice\" is also acceptable."

    {
      "title": "Use the language in which you write best.",
      "content": "Use the language in which you write best. Many judges have access to professional interpreters, so do not feel you have to write the letter in English. [1] X Research source If the language you prefer is rare in your area, however, you may wish to find a native English speaker to help you write a letter. For example, if you are a Spanish speaker living in the United States, it is likely that a judge can find someone to translate your letter. On the other hand, if you speak Romanian in the United States, the judge would probably have a harder time finding an interpreter."

      "content": "Refer to the name of the case (if relevant). Each criminal case has a specific name and number. If you are writing to a judge about a specific case, refer to it by this name and number in the first sentence of your letter. If you do not know the name of the case, write \"I am writing to you concerning the case with defendant (name of defendant) .\""

      "title": "Make the purpose of your letter clear.",
      "content": "Make the purpose of your letter clear. Start out the letter by describing your purpose for writing. This should be in the first paragraph, and preferably in the first sentence.

Take the time to check spelling and grammar mistakes, or ask someone to help you with this. The judge will take your letter more seriously. [3] X Research source You do not need to try to sound like a lawyer or businessman if it makes you uncomfortable. Judges are used to accepting correspondence from all types of people.

      "content": "Don't include new evidence for a case. If you believe that you have new evidence for a civil or criminal case, you should hand it over to the parties or attorneys in the case, not to the judge. Due to ethical guidelines, the judge will have to share the evidence with all parties in the case regardless. If someone other than a party or attorney in the case brings evidence before the judge, the judge will most likely turn that evidence over to the police or another agency to decide what to do with it."

      "title": "Start the address on the envelope with \"The Honorable (full name).\"",
      "content": "Start the address on the envelope with \"The Honorable (full name).\" For example, on the envelope addressed to Judge John Matthew Pool, write \"The Honorable John M. Pool.\" [6] X Research source You will need to include a second line with the judge's title, so do not write the court address yet. In the United Kingdom and many Commonwealth nations, judges are often addressed on envelopes as \"(His/Her) Hon Judge (surname )\" or \"(His/Her) Hon (Mr/Mrs) Judge (surname) \" instead. If the judge is a United States Supreme Court justice, instead write \"Justice (surname).\" If addressing the chief justice of that court, currently John Roberts, write \"The Chief Justice of the United States\" without a name."
