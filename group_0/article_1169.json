The player that has been touched adds up the number of fingers they were touched by and extends that number of fingers.

Adding and splitting is mostly what the entire game consists of, so it's important that each players understands the basic concept of how it's done. Basically, when someone touches your hand, you have to add 1 finger. If you're getting close to having a “dead” hand (5 finger up), then you can choose to touch your hands together to add a finger to a hand that has only 1 or 2 fingers up. [4] X Research source For example, if you had 4 extended fingers on your left hand a 2 on your right, then you would split that and extend 3 fingers on each hand."

This situation, however, can be forced into a win as well. Once your opponent splits 2,0, tap their 2 hand. If you try to split 2,0 as well your opponent will just split back to 1,1 and it will go in a never-ending loop. From 3,0 your opponent has to split to 2,1, you then split to 2,0. Their only option is to hit you with their 2 hand to be 4,0. Now you split to 2,2. [7] X Research source If your opponent taps one of your 2 hands with their 1, tap out their 2. Your opponent will then have no choice but to tap your 2. Then you will be left with 3,3.
