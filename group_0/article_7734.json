[14] X Research source Over time, your styling tool sucks up dust and debris and may get hair styling products stuck in the filter. [15] X Research source Cleaning the filter keeps the air flowing smoothly so you can keep styling. Dyson Airwrap stylers don’t use extreme heat—instead, they use the Coanda effect. The Coanda effect is when air follows an adjacent surface and pulls in the surrounding air. [16] X Research source"
