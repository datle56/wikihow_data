Once the app is open (it has an icon resembling a multi-colored brush stroke), simply tap on the image of the project you want to work on since the app usually opens to the main Gallery screen. If it’s already on a different project, tap “Gallery” in the upper-left corner of the screen and then proceed to select the project you want. [1] X Research source To create a new art project, tap “Gallery” and then tap the plus icon (+) in the upper-right corner of the screen.

When you tap “N” for the layer you want to adjust, you’ll see the layer’s entire blend mode panel with an opacity adjustment option (as well as different blend modes like darken, lighten, color burn, and linear burn). [6] X Research source You’ll only see an “N” icon If the layer’s blend mode is currently set to “normal.” For example, if the layer’s blend mode is set to darken color, you’ll see the icon “Dc” next to the layer instead of “N.” If it’s set to color burn, you’ll see “Cb.” You can still change the opacity of a layer with a blend mode other than “normal.” Simply look for the abbreviated icon matching the layer’s blend mode (instead of “N”)."

Then, move to another layer you want to merge and slide your finger to the right to highlight it in blue as well. Repeat this for every layer you want to merge until they’re all highlighted, and tap on the “Group” option on the top right of the screen.

So, if you’re wondering why a previously filled layer seems to be totally empty, check its opacity to see if it’s really empty or just transparent at the moment. If its opacity is at 0%, that means it’s fully transparent. [11] X Research source Instead of decreasing the opacity for a layer when you need it to be temporarily transparent, deselect it in the “Layers” menu by unchecking the box to the right of the layer’s name. Deselecting a layer will make it vanish, and you can always make it re-appear by checking the box in the “Layers” menu again."
