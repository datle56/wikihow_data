      "content": "Soak the quarter in very hot water. Fill a plastic container with very hot water and dip the quarter inside. Do not use metal, glass, or china because their hard finishes will scratch your quarters. Metal containers may also react with the surface of the quarter. You can also hold the quarter under running hot water, but make sure that you have the drain covered. Hold the quarter by the edges, between your thumb and forefinger. If you are soaking more than one quarter at a time, make sure that there is enough space between each one. If they are all touching, they are more likely to get scratched or dinged. Check the dates of the quarters to avoid soaking two different kinds of metals together. Quarters minted in 1964 and earlier were made mostly from silver. Quarters minted in 1965 and after were made from copper and nickel."

If the dirt is stubborn, you can very gently rub it off using your fingertip or a soft bristled toothbrush (such as a baby toothbrush). Work in an outward direction, from the center of the coin to its edges, until the dirt is gone. If the dirt is very gritty, do not rub it off. The tiny particles may scratch the surface of the quarter. Instead, consider soaking the quarter in the soapy water for longer. You can also move the quarter around under the running water to dislodge the grit."
