She doesn't owe you anything further, even if she did enjoy your company. You could ask her for her number or give her yours. When giving out your number, you could try saying something that appears to be off-the-cuff and smooth by saying, “Hey, can I give you my number real quick before we go?” and then write it down or enter it into her phone (if she offers it). If you have a business card, you can simply hand that to her instead of writing out your contact information, though this is a more formal approach."

Would you be interested in going out with me?” Always choose a public place for a date; you want her to feel comfortable. Have a place in mind if you do ask, or ask her if she knows of a good place. If you discover through talking to her that you share an interest or hobby, you can suggest that you work on that interest/hobby together in a casual way. For example, you could say, “Some friends and I like to go out with our cameras and take photos of the skyline on the riverwalk on Saturday afternoons, would you like to join us sometime?” Inviting her to an event or activity that is public and involves others will make her feel more comfortable and take some of the pressure off of both of you."
