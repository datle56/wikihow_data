      "content": "Find a grading scale. The most common grading scale for schools in the United States is a four-point scale. Using this scale, a grade of A = 4 points, B = 3 points, C = 2 points, D = 1 point, and F = 0 points. This is called an unweighted GPA. Some schools use a weighted GPA, which allots 5 points for more rigorous classes, such as honors, Advanced Placement (AP), and International Baccalaureate (IB). Other classes are weighted the same. Students who take the 5-point classes can end up with GPAs above a 4.0. [1] X Research source Some schools use plus and minus grading, which values a plus as +.3 and a minus as -.3. For instance, a B+ is worth 3.3, a B is worth 3.0, and a B- is worth 2.7 points. [2] X Research source If youâ€™re unsure what your school uses, try asking your teacher or an administrator."

Generally, credit hours are based on mode of instruction, number of hours spent inside the classroom, and number of hours spent studying outside the class. Find out the number of credit hours assigned to each course you are taking. It should be listed on your transcripts or in the school catalogue. [6] X Research source Some schools mostly offer 3 credit hour courses, other colleges 4 credit hour courses, and some schools do a mixture. For many schools, labs are 1 hour.

[7] X Research source If your school allots 5 points for upper level classes, such as Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB), you will be using a weighted GPA scale. Add .3 for each plus value or subtract .3 for each minus value. If you have an A- in a class, mark it as 3.7.
