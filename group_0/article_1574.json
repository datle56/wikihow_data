      "content": "Apply clear gloss to your model. When the area of your model that you want to place the decal is painted and dry, begin applying layers of clear gloss such as Testors Model Masters High Gloss to it. Apply coats according the gloss directions and allow it to dry between coats. The glossier you make your model the better, because this will make a smooth area that the decal will suction well to."

      "content": "Cut your decal from the rest of the decals sheet with your hobby knife. Your model likely came with a sheet of decals, so cut the decal you’d like to use away from the rest. Trim it with the knife to get the exact size you want."

      "content": "Soak the decal in a little bit of water for 1-2 minutes. Set your decal into a small tray of water and allow it to soak. While you’re waiting, rub some water onto your model surface, where you’re applying the decal, with a cotton swab. Adding a bit of water to the model itself will aid in suctioning a little better."

      "content": "Use tweezers and your hobby knife to get the decal onto the model. Set the decal gently onto the model with tweezers, with backing paper still on. Use the tip of your knife to slide the backing paper out from under the decal, holding the decal in place with your tweezers. Move the decal gently to exactly where you want it with your cotton swab. You can also use the cotton swab to smooth any edges that wrinkled in the application process."

      "content": "Brush decal softener onto the decal. Once the decal is dry and exactly where you want it, take your decal softener such as Mr. Mark Softer and brush it all over the decal, making sure it doesn’t move. If it does move, quickly realign it with your hobby knife before the solution starts to work. Dab any excess softener with paper towel. The softener will make your decal look like it’s melting a bit. That’s ok; it forms back into shape flatter and more suctioned to the model when it is set."

Try to match the decal as closely as you can, but don’t worry if it’s not exact because you will get to trim the excess later."
