      "content": "If you want to change the world, make sure you’re open to change and different perspectives. When you judge other people, you can sometimes shift blame off of yourself and may not be tackling the real issues. Try to view life from the other person’s point of view so you get a better understanding of where they’re coming from. As long as you stay open-minded, you’ll be able to make a lot more changes for the better. [1] X Research source Look for choices that you feel good about making so you’re less judgemental of others. For example, if you feel good about how you look, you shouldn’t judge other people for how they look. Rather than bringing someone down, look for something nice to say about them instead to help reframe your thoughts."

Don’t do things to make people like you or to boost your ego, but do them because you’re actually interested in them.

      "content": "Even flashing a quick smile can brighten someone else’s day. No matter where you are or who you meet, give them a warm smile when you’re around them. When you smile, you make the other person feel good and encourage them to smile too. If that person does the same, then you’ve set off a chain reaction of kindness! [4] X Research source You don’t have to know the person to spread kindness! Try smiling at strangers as you walk past them. Make sure the smiling fits the situation. For example, you don’t want to smile when someone’s giving you bad news."

Say something that shows your appreciation for how they handle themselves emotionally or treat other people. Make sure you act sincere when you give your compliment so you come across as genuine. Even a few small words can have a huge impact on them. [5] X Research source For example, you can say something like, “I really appreciate how patient you are when you’re listening to someone speak,” or “It means a lot to me that you took time out of your day to clean up the house when I was tired.

Avoid comparing yourself to other people and thinking of ways you can one-up them. Instead, really look at what they accomplished and appreciate the work they’ve done. As you uplift the other person, you may influence them to do the same in the future. [6] X Research source Avoid taking credit for other peoples’ accomplishments."

Genuine kindness involves acting friendly, caring, and considerate no matter the circumstances. Stay aware of the people around you and look for opportunities where you’re able to help them. For example, if you see someone struggling to carry groceries, you can offer to help them to their vehicle. [7] X Research source Remember to treat yourself kindly as well so you take good care of your mental health. Use positive affirmations and avoid being too hard on yourself."

Check with your utility provider so you can see how much water you’re using so you can start cutting back. If you have landscaping outside, choose plants that naturally grow in your area since they’ll usually thrive better without additional watering.

As you’re shopping for products, check the packaging for words like “energy-efficient,” “recycled material,” or chemical-free” since they’ll have less of an impact on the environment. If you’re buying groceries, visit a farmers’ market to support local growers, shop in the organic section, and look for products that don’t contain any toxins. [11] X Research source For example, you can switch from incandescent lightbulbs to more energy-efficient LED bulbs. When buying animal products, look up the company to see if the animals are treated well before buying.

Even though it’s convenient to drive everywhere, look for some opportunities where you can use an alternative mode of transportation. If you don’t need to go very far and it’s a nice day, go for a walk or ride a bike instead. Otherwise, you can cut back on emissions by taking public transportation or carpooling with other people. Talk to your boss and see if working from home is an option for you. Even if you can work remotely a few days a week, you won’t have to burn any fuel during your commute. Electric vehicles also work well since they run on a battery rather than gasoline."

Write some social media posts explaining why the cause is important and why other people should pay attention to it.
