More often than not, complicated relationships occur when partners have different expectations or boundaries.

If you’re in a long-distance relationship, establish a communication schedule with your partner to keep the spark alive.

More often than not, when someone says their relationship is “complicated,” they’re trying to deflect the conversation. They likely don’t want to get into the nitty-gritty of their dynamic with their partner. There are likely larger circumstances affecting the relationship. [22] X Research source Maybe they’re unhappy with the partnership or simply don’t know how to define the relationship. “It’s complicated” doesn’t necessarily mean someone’s single or taken. They’re likely seeing someone, but the relationship may not be exclusive or committed."
