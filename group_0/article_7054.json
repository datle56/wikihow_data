      "content": "Decide on a phrase. Part of the fun in getting a vanity plate is coming up with a personalized or clever phrase to include as the identifying number on the license plate. You should think about what you want it to say, but make sure it is not inappropriate because that probably won’t get approved. Come up with several variations, possibly including numbers or alternative spellings, in case your first choice is unavailable. For example, if you want your license plate to read “TOOFAST,” you might consider “2FAST,” “TOFAST,” or “2FASST” as alternative options in case someone else already chose the one you originally wanted."
