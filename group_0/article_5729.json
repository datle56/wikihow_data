      "content": "You can use body wash shampoo in a pinch, but it may dry out your hair. It can also strip away your hair’s natural oils and clog the pores on your scalp. While both body wash and shampoo are designed to remove dirt and oil, body wash often includes ingredients that are too harsh for your hair. It’s also more difficult to rinse out of your hair than traditional shampoo is, so it tends to weigh down your hair or cause it to feel greasy. [1] X Research source It’s not very harmful if you need to use body wash as shampoo once or twice in an emergency. Continued use of body wash as a shampoo, however, can lead to dry, frizzy hair with split ends and an itchy, flaky scalp (due to the lack of conditioning and detangling agents in body wash). If you have to use body wash as shampoo as a last resort, dilute it with warm water before applying it to your hair and scalp. Rinse your hair thoroughly and use a conditioner afterward so your hair and scalp are replenished with enough moisture."

      "content": "If you have to use body wash as shampoo, look for natural ones. If you have to use body wash as shampoo, look at the ingredients label on your body wash to find out if it has parabens, sulfates, and phthalates. These additions are not often used in hair care products, because they can lead to dryness, frizz, color fading, hormone issues, and sometimes hair loss. Body washes including natural ingredients like aloe vera, shea butter, coconut oil, honey, and essential oils are less likely to treat hair as harshly. Ahead are a few popular body wash brands and how they scored as stand-in shampoos: [2] X Research source Dove : Paraben and sulfate-free, but not as complete a cleaning agent. Lynx : No, as it contains fragrances that cause build-up for your hair. Native : OK as a temporary alternative due to natural ingredients."

      "content": "You can use shampoo as body wash when necessary, but do so sparingly. It’s less problematic than using body wash as your shampoo because shampoo is gentle enough to use on your body, but it might not be as effective. Prolonged use of shampoo as body wash can dry out your skin because shampoo is designed to meet the needs of your hair and scalp. The pH level of shampoo is meant for your head hair and scalp, so using shampoo in place of a body wash can sometimes lead to irritation, dryness, or sensitivity in the long-term.

      "title": "PH Levels",
      "content": "PH Levels Shampoo typically has pH levels between 6 and 7, while most body washes and soaps have a pH of 9 to 10, The skin’s natural pH is closer to 5.5. People who have sensitive and acne-prone skin have to be more careful about finding products closer to their natural pH, due to their tendency to break out and experience redness. [4] X Research source The pH of body washes, shower gels, soaps, shampoos, and conditioners can affect the skin and hair/scalp’s overall appearance and health."

      "title": "Cleansing Agents",
      "content": "Cleansing Agents Both shampoos and body washes are made up of surfactants, which are cleansing agents that bind onto the oil or fat on your skin yet wash away easily. [5] X Research source Shampoos contain milder surfactants (cleansing agents) than body washes do, primarily because when you wash your hair, you don’t want to get rid of all the essential oils present. [6] X Research source Shampoos also contain conditioning molecules, which are positively charged chemicals that are attracted to and cling to the hair shaft, which makes your hair easier to brush. [7] X Research source Shampoos also include other ingredients that include moisturizing or conditioning agents, pearlescent pigments, colorants, and fragrance."

      "title": "Formulation",
      "content": "Formulation Shampoos are generally more acidic and come closest to the natural pH level of hair; because they’re mildly acidic, they don’t cause the hair shaft to swell or strip hair of natural oils. Many shampoos also include a conditioning component, while body washes are formulated as an emulsion or gel base of water and detergent made to cleanse and rinse off the skin of the body easily.

      "title": "Conditioner",
      "content": "Conditioner Using only conditioner on your hair in place of shampoo is called “co-washing.” Conditioners contain fewer surfactants (cleansing agents) than shampoo, so they clean hair without overly cleaning it. Benefits of co-washing include keeping more of your hair’s essential oils, a hydrated scalp, less hair breakage, and reduced frizz. It’s also a way to spend less money on haircare products. [9] X Research source It’s recommended to co-wash every 2 to 3 days, especially if your hair is dry or damaged. Co-washing all the time isn’t a good idea, because there aren’t enough cleaning agents in conditioner alone to properly clean your hair long-term. Allen also suggests leave-in conditioners as the best way to tame frizzy hair if your shampoo isn’t working."

      "content": "Baby Shampoo Baby shampoo contains milder cleansing agents and a more neutral pH that makes it sensitive enough for a baby’s skin and hair. It’s acceptable to replace your shampoo with baby shampoo, as long as your hair isn’t overly colored or chemically treated. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Baking Soda",
      "content": "Baking Soda Using a mixture of baking soda and water instead of shampoo can help remove excess oils and buildup while restoring pH levels to your hair. To use, measure 2 tbsp (40 g) baking soda in a glass jar or bottle. Once your hair is wet, fill the jar with water and stir to dissolve the baking soda. Scrub the mixture into your hair wet and rinse. [11] X Research source Baking soda and water is a natural cleansing agent that can be less harsh than traditional shampoos (and is considered a greener alternative). However, it isn’t recommended for color-treated hair. Nguyen believes that “baking soda can be great as an exfoliator of your scalp when shampooing or when you want to use it to clarify your hair.” “Since it is very good at removing buildup on the hair,” continues Nguyen, “using it frequently can dry your hair. It also increases blood circulation to your scalp, which is needed to feed your hair and scalp.”"

      "content": "Apple Cider Vinegar Apple cider vinegar can be used in a pinch to wash your hair if you’ve run out of shampoo—just dilute the apple cider vinegar with a few spoonfuls of water, scrub it into your scalp, and rinse it out thoroughly. While you can use it in a pinch, it’s actually not recommended to permanently replace your shampoo with apple cider vinegar. If you want to start using ACV on a daily basis, use it as a rinse after shampooing your hair instead. A combination of apple cider vinegar and water has been said to clarify hair, remove buildup, reduce frizz, and add volume. Apple cider vinegar is also an anti-inflammatory, which means it can relieve an itchy scalp or dandruff. To use, add 1 ⁄ 2 tablespoon (7.4 mL) of apple cider vinegar to 1 cup (240 mL) of water after shampooing your hair. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Bar Soap",
      "content": "Bar Soap If you’ve run out of shampoo and only have bar soap on hand, you can use that to cleanse your hair instead! Just rub the bar soap between your hands as you normally would until it creates suds, then work those suds into your locks before rinsing the soap out completely. As with body wash, it’s ok to use bar soap instead of shampoo in a pinch, but it’s not recommended to use bar soap on your hair regularly because it can strip the hair of natural oils and negatively affect its pH level (which may cause dry, frizzy hair and an itchy, flaky scalp). TLDR; Grab bar soap once or twice if you have to, but don’t rely on it as a long-term replacement for shampoo."

      "content": "Are 3-in-1 soaps effective? Using a 3-in-1 soap or shampoo only meets the bare minimum—it cleans your hair. It doesn’t meet your hair’s needs in the long-term, which include moisturizing and conditioning. The main reason is that 3-in-1 shampoo contains a variety of sulfates, which can disrupt your hormones and cause frizzy hair. Most brands also contain a type of paraben that has been linked to breast cancer, in addition to fragrances and dyes. For these reasons, 3-in-1 shampoos isn’t worth the convenience they promise.

Make sure your brand of baby shampoo is free from artificial dyes, synthetic fragrances, or parabens, which are preservatives that are often linked to hormonal side effects. Ones that are hypoallergenic are usually gentle enough for sensitive skin. [14] X Research source"

Its purpose is to add moisture back into your hair once it’s been cleansed, but it isn’t the best cleansing agent for your body. Some have suggested using conditioner as body lotion or shaving lotion, but when it comes to washing your body, stick to body wash or soap if possible. [15] X Research source"
