      "content": "Gather your supplies. A few simple household supplies can be used to test the safety of an infant's mattress. If you don't have all the supplies, you can get most of them at a department store. You will need the following: [1] X Research source A ruler A pen or marker Plastic cling wrap or a thin plastic bag Two full, one-liter (or one-quart) cartons of milk or juice, in square bottom cartons A stack of 12 CDs or DVDs"

      "content": "Draw a ring around one of the cartons. Take your pen or marker, and your ruler. Place your ruler at the bottom edge of the carton. Measure up an inch and a half (40 mm). Make a mark here and then draw a line running parallel to the bottom edge. [2] X Research source Draw similar lines on the other three sides of the carton. You should now have one carton with a ring drawn all the way around it. It is not necessary to repeat this with the other carton."

      "content": "Wrap the CDs in plastic cling wrap (or in a thin plastic bag) and set them on the mattress. Wrapping will make sure the CDs stay in a pile. It will also prevent damage to the CDs. Stack all 12 CDs up in a neat pile. Wrap them securely. [3] X Research source Make sure to take the CDs out of their cases. When you are done, set the CDs on the mattress. Pick the softest part of the mattress. This is important. Your baby could roll anywhere on the mattress during the night, so it's important to test the softest part and, especially, where the baby's head will be placed."

      "content": "Determine your mattress's safety. A mattress should be firm enough that an infant is not at risk of suffocating if he or she sinks into the mattress. Look at the overhanging portion of the lower carton. This is the portion below the ring you drew earlier. This should not be touching the mattress. [5] X Research source If the overhanging portion of the carton does not touch the mattress, it is safe for use. If the overhanging portion is touching the mattress, the mattress is too soft. You should replace it. You want to make sure the mattress you use is safe for your baby."

Check the packaging of any mattress you purchase. See if it says anywhere on the packaging that the firmness has been tested for safety.
