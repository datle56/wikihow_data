      "content": "Get a propane tank for a gas grill. Propane tanks are measured by weight; if you plan on doing a lot of grilling, get a heavier tank with more gas inside. If you're only going to be using the tank a few times, opt for a smaller propane tank. You can find propane tanks at your local supermarket or hardware store."

      "content": "Attach the grill hose to the valve on the propane tank. The grill hose is the hose attached to the underside of the grill. Turn the propane tank so the valve is facing the grill, and connect the end of the grill hose to the valve; you should feel the end of the hose click into place. Once the end of the grill hose is attached to the valve, turn the knob on the end of the grill hose clockwise to tighten it into place. Continue turning until the knob won't turn anymore.

To locate the ignition burner knob on the grill, look for the knob with a lightning-bolt symbol or the word “ignition” next to it. [5] X Research source Don't worry if the grill doesn't ignite after you turn the knob; that just means the grill has an electric starter and you'll need to press the electric ignition button to ignite it."

If you're only barbecuing a small amount of food, turn off the grill knobs for the sections of the grill you won't be using.

[13] X Research source Avoid the traditional high-sugar, salty, and high-calorie barbecue food. Some healthy barbecue food choices are skinless chicken, baked beans, fresh fruit, raw vegetables, corn on the cob, and baked potatoes with a salsa topping. Also, you can make kabobs with lean meats and fresh vegetables. [14] X Research source"
