      "content": "Examine the exchange rate for the currency you want to buy based on the currency you want to sell. Look at how values for your chosen currency pairs have fluctuated over time. Currency exchange rates are quoted in pairs of currency. The exchange quote tells you how many units of currency will receive based on the currency you want to sell. For example, a USD/EUR quote of .91 means that you’ll receive 0.91 euros for every US dollar you sell. [1] X Research source The value of currencies frequently fluctuates. Anything from political instability to a natural disaster may cause a fluctuation. Make sure you understand that ratios between currencies are constantly changing."

      "content": "Develop a trading strategy. To make a profit on your transaction, aim to buy currency that you expect will increase in value (base currency) using currency that you expect to decrease in value (quote currency). For example, if you think that Currency A, which is currently $1.50, will increase, you could purchase a \"call contract\" for a certain amount of that currency. If its value increases to $1.75, you have made money. Assess the likelihood of big changes in currency values. The better that a country is doing economically, the more likely it is that its currency will remain stable or increase in value relative to other counties. Factors like interest rates, inflation rates, public debt, and political stability can all affect the value of a currency. [2] X Research source Changes in economic factors like the country’s Consumer Price Index and Purchasing Managers Index can indicate that a currency’s value is about to change.

      "title": "Recognize the risks.",
      "content": "Recognize the risks. Buying and selling foreign currency is a fraught prospect, even for expert investors. Many investors use leverage, the practice of borrowing money to help them buy more currency. For example, if you wanted to trade $10,000 of currency, you would probably borrow at a leverage rate of 200:1. You could deposit as little as $100 into your margin account. [4] X Research source However, if a trade goes sour, you may end up not only losing your own money but owing your broker a great deal more than you might on stock or futures trades. Additionally, it can be difficult to manage how much currency to trade at any one time and when to do so. Prices of currency rise and fall rapidly, sometimes within hours. [5] X Research source For example, during one 24-hour period in 2011, the US dollar dropped 4% to a record low against the Japanese yen and then rose 7.5%. For this reason, only about 30% of \"retail\" trades -- the kind that individual currency investors make -- are profitable. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for brokers that offer low spreads.",
      "content": "Look for brokers that offer low spreads. Forex brokers don't charge traditional commissions or fees. Instead, they make money off the spread, which is the difference between how much a currency can be sold for and bought for. The higher the spread is, the more money you pay to the broker. For example, a broker that will buy a U.S. dollar for 0.8 euros but sells a U.S. dollar for 0.95 euros has a spread of 0.15 euros. [9] X Research source Before you sign up for a brokerage account, check its website or the website of its parent company and ensure it’s registered with the Futures Commission Merchant and regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission."

      "content": "Start placing currency transactions with your broker. You should be able to track the progress of your investments with visual software or other resources. Do not \"overtrade,\" or purchase too much currency at once. Experts recommend sticking with investing between 5% and 10% of your total account balance in any single currency trade. [10] X Research source Pay attention to currency rate trends before you make the transaction. You have a better chance of making money if you trade with the trend than against it. For example, say that the U.S. dollar has been steadily rising in value against the euro. Unless you have a good reason to think otherwise, you should choose to sell euros and buy U.S. dollars.

      "content": "Set stop-loss orders. Stop-loss orders are a crucial part of currency trading. A stop-loss order will automatically exit a position -- i.e., sell off your trade -- once it hits a certain price. This limits the amount of loss you take if the currency you purchased begins to take a nosedive. [12] X Research source For example, if you are purchasing Japanese Yen with the US Dollar and the Yen is currently ¥120, you could set a stop-loss order for a certain price threshold, such as $1 hitting ¥115. The opposite of this is the \"take-profit\" order, which is set up to automatically sell out when you have hit a certain profit. For example, you could set a \"take-profit\" order to automatically cash out when $1 hits ¥125. This would guarantee you the profit made from the sale at that point."

      "content": "Record the cost basis for your transactions. In many countries, you will need a record of this information for annual income tax filing. Note the price that you paid for the currency, the price you sold the currency for, the date that you bought the currency, and the date that you sold the currency. Most major brokerage firms will send you an annual statement that contains this information in case you didn’t collect it yourself."

      "content": "Limit the amount of currency trading you do. In general, because currency trading is so fraught, experts recommend that you limit the amount of currency trading you do to a small percentage of your overall portfolio. [13] X Research source If you do end up on the wrong end of the deal -- as 70% of retail currency trades do -- limiting how much you trade, and how much of your portfolio currency trades represent, will help limit the damage."
