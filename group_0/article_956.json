      "content": "Open the cabinet door and locate the screws used for aligning the door. Cabinet door hinges have 2 vertical fixed door screws that attach the hinge to the door and 2 vertical adjustable cupboard screws that attach the hinges to the cupboard. Each hinge has a horizontal adjusting screw (closest to the front of the cupboard) and a horizontal locking screw (closest to the back of the cupboard). You will be using all of the screws for adjustments except for the screws that hold the hinges to the doors. In other words, you will only be adjusting the screws that hold the hinges to the inside of the cupboard."
