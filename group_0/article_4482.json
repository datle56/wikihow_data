While your laptop computer or smartphone may have a built-in wireless adapter, chances are it does not support monitor mode or packet injection. For this, you will need to purchase a separate wireless adapter. You can order a compatible wireless adapter online. Most range in price from $30 to $70. The following is a list of suitable wireless adapters: [2] X Research source Alfa AWUS036NH Alfa AWUS036NHA Alfa AWUS036NEH Panda PAU09 N600 Panda PAU 06"

Kali Linux (formerly known as Backtrack) is a Linux distribution that is specifically designed for network penetration testing and security research. It comes with all the tools and software you need pre-installed. You can download Kali Linux for free here . Kali Linux can be installed as your primary operating system, or on a virtual machine . It can also be installed on a Raspberry Pi or on a bootable CD or USB drive. If you boot Linux from a CD or USB drive, all data will be lost when you reboot your computer, unless you allocate a partition on a USB drive for persistent storage. [3] X Research source"

If you are using a different Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu, you will need to use the following steps to install Aircrack-ng: [4] X Research source Press Ctrl + Alt + T to open the Terminal. Type sudo apt-get update Type sudo apt-get install -y aircrack-ng Enter your user password. Press Y when prompted."

Additionally, the network should have at least 1 person connected to it. The more people using the network, the more data you will be able to collect in order to break the network encryption. Ideally, the network should have multiple people using the network and connecting and disconnecting their devices."

Finally, replace \"[network adapter name]\" with the current name for your network adapter. This launches an attack against the network using the \"Besside-ng\" tool. The attack should take about 2 - 10 minutes. The \"Besside-ng\" tool first attacks first using packet injection and then by flooding the network. All data that it gathers is saved to a \".cap\" file. [5] X Research source Warning: Entering the \"Besside-ng\" command without the proper network parameters will result in the Besside-ng tool attacking all available networks in range. Warning: Launching an attack against a network that you do not have authorization to audit or attack is illegal. Law enforcement will often set up WEP-encrypted networks specifically to catch criminal hackers. If you get an error that says \"Network is down\" or similar during the attack, simply run the command again to continue. You can also run the type the command airmon-ng check kill to automatically stop any processes that may be taking your network adapter out of monitor mode."
