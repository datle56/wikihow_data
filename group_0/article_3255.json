      "content": "Be your true self. If you want to be tough, you first have to start accepting yourself for who you are. If you prefer staying up late to read science-fiction, as opposed to keeping up with the hottest television show, so be it. If a group of people think something’s funny, but you don’t, so what? Pretending to be someone you’re not is an obvious sign of insecurity or weakness. People can easily pick up on it, and you surely won’t look so tough if someone calls you out on it."

      "content": "Improve your self-confidence. This goes hand-in-hand with step 1. If you’ve accepted who you are, then you have the groundwork you need to become self-confident. What does this have to do with being a tough girl? Easy. If you’re confident and comfortable in who you are, then you can confidently handle any situation that comes your way. You’ll be confident in your beliefs and the decisions you make. And you won’t be afraid to let others know it. Here are some ways you can improve your self-confidence. [1] X Research source Make a list of things you admire about yourself, your strengths, and achievements on a sheet of paper. Turn a blank sheet of paper horizontally and either fold into thirds or simply draw two vertical lines to create three columns. In each column, write at least five things you like about yourself, at least five things you feel you’re great at, and at least five things you’re proud to have achieved. Do you think you have a great smile? Do you have a knack for making people laugh when they’re feeling down? Are you proud of the evening you spent feeding the homeless? Write down whatever comes to mind. Read over your list often as a reminder of how great you are. Think positively about yourself. Pinpoint a couple qualities about yourself (maybe some that you wrote down in your list) and think about them often. Another tip: take those negative thoughts and reverse them. If you’re thinking, “I hate the way I look,” you could say: “My eyes are really pretty.” [2] X Research source Use affirmations to boost your confidence. Call a friend or somebody who is super supportive and get positive reinforcement from them. Dress to feel better about yourself. If you feel your wardrobe doesn’t reflect the real you or make you happy, find clothes that do. If you have a favorite top, find more tops with similar qualities. Choose clothing that enhances the physical features you admire. If you have a great pair of legs, put on a pair of shorts or find a dress that lets you show them off. Part Two on how to look like a tough girl will show you how to update your wardrobe to reflect your new tough girl persona. Exercise regularly. Go walking or jogging daily. Take up a sport or participate in a group exercise you might enjoy. While this will help you feel better about yourself, it will also help you feel tougher as your muscles grow."

      "content": "Quit worrying about what others think. Tough girls could care less what others think of them because they realize one very important thing: what another person thinks has nothing to do with them. Tough girls don’t measure their self-worth by other people’s opinions. Once you let go of the importance of what people think, you gain power in difficult situations, and you become tougher.

      "content": "Don’t take things personally. When you learn not to take things personally, you become better able to deal with rejection and criticism. Most people who don’t feel tough, feel they can’t handle challenging situations. Being tough means you push through those difficult moments. So when faced with a situation where someone confronts you, be cool and calm. Don't let it faze you. Act as if that person is wasting your time."

Cultivate an inner calm that can't be unsettled by other people. You can walk around acting tough all day long, but if you are easily upset, your toughness will be perceived as a façade.

      "content": "Maintain a healthy relationship with your significant other. Intimate relationships are a good place to gauge how tough you are. There’s usually one person in the relationship who takes on the more dominant role. It’s a good idea to make sure the dynamic of your relationship is a healthy one. Take notice of how you act around your significant other. Do you find yourself mostly doing activities, watching certain movies, or eating meals that appeal only to your sweetheart? If so, you need to toughen up and take a more assertive role as a partner. To be tougher in your relationship, start by speaking up about what you like. If you’d prefer to a nice hearty burger instead of sushi, let your significant other know. If you want to watch a romantic comedy instead of a thriller, suggest watching your preferred movie one night and your significant other’s the next. Healthy relationships have balance. Allow equal time for your significant other and you to explore both of your interests together. If you have a disagreement, don’t think you need to scream and shout just to stand up for what you believe. Let your significant know that you acknowledge his or her feelings or point of view, and then be honest and open about your feelings and needs. State your opinion directly, without being apologetic."

      "content": "Revamp your wardrobe. If your current wardrobe consists primarily of floral prints and bright colored frocks, you’ll need to make a change. The color black is a primary color in the tough girls’ wardrobe. So consider wearing all-black outfits or outfits in which a primary piece is black. Wear ripped denim, and clothing with a skull and bones theme. As long as you have a parents or guardians permission. Pick out ripped denim and clothing with a skull and bones theme. If you don’t already own these two items, make sure you purchase a motorcycle jacket and a nice pair of leather boots. Incorporate tough-girl accessories. Accessories will help pull your outfit together, and help emphasize your tough-girl image. Spikes are a common accessory that can be found on bracelets, rings, or parts of your clothing, like the collar of a blouse or the sleeves of a jacket. You can also look for jewelry with the skull and bones image. Pick up a pair of dark sunglasses to toughen up your look. Hiding your eyes will make you seem mysterious and unapproachable."

There are two ways to be assertive – through your body language and by what you say. To show your assertiveness towards someone: face them directly, keeping your back straight, and look them straight in the eye. Remain calm, but firm when you speak. Make sure whatever you say is direct and honest. State your point of view without being hesitant and without being apologetic. To sound tough, start off by saying to someone \"Listen...” Speak strongly and get right to the point. And then at the end say \"You understand me?\" and wait for their response."

      "content": "Be the person in authority. When things need to get handled, tough girls step in. You must be willing to take control of a situation. If you’re with a group of friends, move to the front of the pack, so people know you’re the leader and the one they’ll have to deal with. If you and your friends are getting picked on or treated unfairly, speak up. Stand your ground by standing in their way or getting in their personal space. You can do this without expecting things to suddenly get physical. At about a foot and a half from someone you’re considered to be in their personal space. Once you get close, speak firmly."

      "content": "Take on a physical activity to help channel your aggression and develop your self-defense. Physical activity is a great way toughen up physically and mentally. You’re not only strengthening your body, you’re also developing the discipline you need to handle difficult situations. Lift weights to tone your body and build muscle mass. Join a self-defense class like kickboxing or martial arts. While you’ll not only learn how to better protect yourself, you may also gain a new group of tough-girl friends. Participate in a contact sport, like flag football, roller derby, or soccer. Participate in activities that force you to push yourself. Being tough is about being able to handle what comes your way, and being able to hang in there even when you’re outside of your comfort zone. Marathons are a great way to do this. Join 5K marathon, if you’re just starting out. If you’re daring, or looking for something more adventurous, look for a themed marathon. The Dirty Girl Mud Run is a good example."
