      "content": "Brown the lamb shanks. Season the shanks with salt and pepper on all sides. Place them in the hot oil and brown them on all three sides. Brown each side for about 4 minutes, enough to get a good sear on each side. Don't cook the lamb shanks all the way through. Browning them will bring out the deep flavor of the shanks, but longer cooking will bring about the soft, fall-apart texture you want. Make sure the oil is nice and hot before you put the shanks in the pot."

Pour the wine over the entire contents of the pot. Let the red wine come to a boil, and boil it for three minutes. Add the water and reduce the heat to bring everything to a quick simmer. Boiling the wine for three minutes will lower the alcohol content a bit, leaving the deep flavor of the wine behind. With the addition of the water, the shanks and vegetables should be fully submerged in liquid. If they aren't, add a little more water."

[2] X Research source After 1 hour and 30 minutes, the shanks should be quite tender. If they aren't, return them to the oven and continue braising, checking every 15 minutes until they've reached the correct texture."

Pour the braising liquid through a fine-mesh sieve to strain out the vegetables and keep the liquid. Pour the liquid into a saucepan and cook it over medium heat, stirring often, until it has reduced and become a thick sauce. Season it with salt and pepper to taste. To make the sauce thicker, create a slurry with equal parts cornstarch and cold water mixed together. Then, add that to the sauce, stirring constantly. Adding dry cornstarch to a hot liquid will cause clumping and gumminess, rather than the desired thickening effect."
