      "content": "Place the can opener into a jar pour white vinegar in. A glass jar, coffee can, or any similar container will work. Take the can opener and insert it top-first into the jar. Then, pour white vinegar into the jar so it covers all of the can opener's moving parts. [1] X Research source You can use a bowl instead of a jar as long as all of the can opener’s moving parts fit inside it. Vinegar's acidity helps to break down built up rust and gunk. White vinegar is sometimes called distilled vinegar."

      "content": "Let the can opener soak for 20-60 minutes. The vinegar needs some time to loosen the gunk and rust. Let it sit for at least 20 minutes, and up to an hour. Some of the gunk may start flaking off and floating in the vinegar, indicating that it’s working. [2] X Research source If your can opener is so dirty or rusty that the moving parts don’t work well, then you’ll have to soak it longer. Try leaving it overnight so the vinegar can really work at the gunk. [3] X Research source"

Dip a toothbrush into the vinegar, then scrub the can opener. Focus on the gears and moving parts. Scrub in a circular motion to work off the gunk and rust. [4] X Research source Depending on the can opener type, you may have to open it up to reach the gears. If rust is built up outside the moving parts, scrub here as well."

If yours works this way, look for a switch or knob to detach the bracket. Then lift it out of position. [9] X Research source Different models may have different methods for detaching the bracket. Check the instruction manual for your can opener for the correct process. If your can opener bracket is not detachable, you can still clean the gears with a toothbrush and white vinegar."

Then leave it undisturbed for 30-60 minutes so the vinegar loosens all the rust and grime. [10] X Research source If your can opener was so rusted or dirty that the gears wouldn't move, then leave it soaking longer. Wait overnight so the grime loosens better.
