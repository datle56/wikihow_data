      "content": "Locate your computer's audio-out port. On desktop PCs, this port is typically on the back of the CPU box, while iMacs have a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack on the back of the monitor. On laptops and MacBooks, it will generally be on the right or left side of the keyboard. Some common audio-out methods include the following: Optical — A pentagonal port. Optical cables will usually work with high-end, modern speakers. RCA — These are red and white color-coded ports. These ports receive 3.5-millimeter cables of the same colors. Headphone jack — The 3.5-millimeter headphone jack can reliably be found on most computers somewhere on the side of a laptop or the back of a computer case. For speakers or headphones, the plug is sometimes color-coded in green and usually has a headphone symbol identifying it. The pink jack is for microphones, and the blue jack is for Line-In, similar to an aux input. Many headsets have a single 3.5mm jack for both the audio and microphone. HDMI — HDMI slots work the same on your computer as on your TV, including audio transmission. USB — Some audio devices can be connected to your computer using a USB port. You can connect to any free USB port on your PC or Laptop"

If you're connecting a device that needs separate microphone input (e.g., some gaming headsets), you'll need to know where the microphone port is."

      "content": "Determine whether or not you need a converter. If your audio device's output cable doesn't match the inputs on your computer, you will likely need to purchase an adapter, such as an HDMI-to-USB adapter. If your headset has two 3.5mm cables for the audio and the mic, and your PC only has one input for both, you can purchase an adapter that combines both the audio and mic into a single 3.5mm input. You can find audio converters, also known as \"audio extractors\", in most tech departments in retail stores or online. If you have to use an audio extractor, you'll also need to purchase a separate set of cables to attach the extractor to your computer."
