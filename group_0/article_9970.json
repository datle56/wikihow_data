      "title": "Preheat your oven to 350 °F (177 °C).",
      "content": "Preheat your oven to 350 °F (177 °C). Before you turn on your oven, move one of the racks to the middle position so your fish cooks evenly. Turn your oven on and let it preheat completely before you start cooking. While your oven warms up, prep your ingredients so you can start baking right when it reaches the right temperature.

    {
      "title": "Arrange the fillets on a baking tray.",
      "content": "Arrange the fillets on a baking tray. Choose a rimmed baking tray so nothing drips over the edge while you’re cooking. Evenly space the fillets on the tray so they aren’t overcrowded, or else they won’t cook as evenly. [3] X Research source If you want to make it easier to clean up later on, cover the baking tray with aluminum foil. When you’re finished, you can just throw away the foil and the tray should stay clean."

    {
      "title": "Sprinkle salt, pepper, and lemon juice on the fish for a simple seasoning.",
      "content": "Sprinkle salt, pepper, and lemon juice on the fish for a simple seasoning. Nile perch has very mild meat, so it doesn’t require a lot of seasoning. Take a pinch of salt and pepper, and spread it evenly across the tops of your fillets. To add a hint of citrus to the meat, brush or rub the fillets with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of lemon juice. [4] X Research source You can use prepackaged juice or squeeze it straight from a fresh lemon."

    {
      "title": "Marinate the fillets with garlic and parsley to add more flavor to your meal.",
      "content": "Marinate the fillets with garlic and parsley to add more flavor to your meal. If you’re looking for something that tastes a little stronger, chop up 3 cloves of garlic and 2 cups (55 g) of fresh parsley to make a gremolata. Brush the marinade onto the fillets and gently press it into the meat. [5] X Research source Let the fish soak up the marinade for around 30–40 minutes before you start cooking your perch."

    {
      "title": "Coat the perch in mayo and bread crumbs if you want it crispy.",
      "content": "Coat the perch in mayo and bread crumbs if you want it crispy. If you like fried fish but want a healthier alternative, you’ll want to try this breading. Brush your fillets with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of light mayonnaise so they’re evenly coated. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon (7 g) of breadcrumbs on top of the fillets to give them a light coating. [6] X Research source If you want to make the mayonnaise a little tangier, try stirring in 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of lime juice into it before putting it on your fish."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cover the tray with aluminum foil.",
      "content": "Cover the tray with aluminum foil. Rip off a piece of foil that’s large enough to cover and wrap around the edges of the tray. Set the foil on top of the tray and fold the edges over to help trap the heat inside. That way, your fish will cook through faster and heat evenly. [7] X Research source If you’re covered your perch with breadcrumbs, then you don’t need to use foil. If you do, the breading might not get as crispy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bake the fish for 25–30 minutes.",
      "content": "Bake the fish for 25–30 minutes. Place the tray on the center rack of your oven and leave it alone while it cooks. Leave the oven door shut so the heat doesn’t escape, or else your fish might take a little longer to cook. [8] X Research source Everyone’s oven runs a little differently, so you may need to let your fish cook a little longer or shorter."

      "title": "Check that the internal temperature is at least 145 °F (63 °C).",
      "content": "Check that the internal temperature is at least 145 °F (63 °C). You can catch foodborne illnesses from undercooked fish, so it’s important that you bake it thoroughly. Take the fish out of your oven and stick a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the fillet. If the temperature reads at least 145 °F (63 °C), then it’s safe and ready to eat.

      "title": "Serve your fish while it’s still hot.",
      "content": "Serve your fish while it’s still hot. Enjoy your fish as soon as you take it out of the oven. Nile perch pairs really well with vegetables like green beans, tomatoes, and onions, but you can eat it with any side you’ve prepared. Garnish the perch with fresh parsley or lemon. [10] X Research source If you have leftover perch, store it in an airtight container in your fridge for up to 3–4 days. After that, it will start to spoil and won’t be safe to eat.

      "title": "Season your perch with salt and pepper.",
      "content": "Season your perch with salt and pepper. Since Nile perch is a really mild fish, a lot of seasoning might be a little overpowering. Sprinkle a pinch of salt and pepper over your fillets and lightly rub it into the meat so it can absorb the flavors. [12] X Research source Try experimenting with other seasonings to see what you like. Try using chives, lemon zest, or orange zest. [13] X Research source Or, spice it up with some paprika.

      "content": "Dredge the fillets with flour. Coating your fish in flour will help make the meat crispier. Put 2 tablespoons (18 g) of flour into a small bowl and toss in your fillets. Cover the meat with the flour and shake off any excess. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Heat vegetable oil in a pan over medium-high heat.",
      "content": "Heat vegetable oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Pour 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vegetable oil into a non-stick pan and put on your stove over medium-high heat. Wait for the oil to start bubbling and smoking before you start cooking, or else it won’t be hot enough to cook the perch thoroughly. [16] X Research source Be really careful when you’re heating oil since it could burn or potentially start a fire if it gets too hot. If there is a fire, turn off the burner and cover the pan with a lid to smother it."

      "title": "Cook the fish for 2–3 minutes on the first side.",
      "content": "Cook the fish for 2–3 minutes on the first side. Slowly lay the fish in the pan so they’re evenly spaced apart. Be careful not to overcrowd the pan, or else the oil will drop in temperature. Don’t move the fish around while it’s cooking so the meat crisps up and turns golden-brown. [17] X Research source Nile perch usually doesn’t come with the skin attached, but place it skin-side down if your fillets have it. The skin is completely edible so you don’t have to remove it if you don’t want to. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Flip the fillets with a fish spatula and cook them for another 2–3 minutes. Perch is really delicate as it cooks and could flake apart, so use a spatula specifically made for fish. Gently turn your fish over to the other side and leave the fillets alone to fry. [19] X Research source"
