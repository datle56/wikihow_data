      "content": "Change directions if you're suspicious of someone following you. Even if you think you’re being followed, it might be a coincidence that the person is just walking the same direction as you. If you want to find out if they’re truly following you, change directions at the next street corner or crosswalk even if it takes you out of your way. As you turn, quickly glance over your shoulder and get a look at the person so you’re able to recognize them. Keep adding more turns to your route and watch for the person to see if they’re still following you. [1] X Research source If the person is following you in a vehicle, turn around and go back the way you came. [2] X Research source That way, the person has to make a quick turn to find you again and will be easy to notice. If you think you’re being followed but aren’t sure who it is or where they are, trust your instincts and immediately find somewhere safe to go, such as a crowded store, police station, or area with a lot of foot traffic.

      "content": "Go into a crowded public area or store to try and lose the person. Walk into the nearest business that’s open and has a lot of people. Once you’re inside, keep your eye out to see if the person following you stops as well or walks in after you. If they do, find an employee or security guard to let them know you’re being followed. They may let you use their phone to contact the police or lead you to a different exit so you can lose your attacker. If there isn’t a public place that you can go inside, keep moving so your attacker doesn’t catch up. Learn the hours of the businesses in the area where you normally walk so you know where you can go in case you’re followed late at night."

      "content": "Turn and look at the person once you know they’re following you. Most attackers use the element of surprise, so show them that you know they’re there. As you’re walking, look over your shoulder and make eye contact with them. If they just happen to be walking in the same direction as you, they may give you a confused look back. However, if it was someone truly following you, you've let them know you’re wary of them and ready to react if something goes wrong. As you’re looking at the person, make mental notes of their appearance so you’re able to report them."

Dial the number for your local emergency services and give them your name and location.

      "content": "Scream or blow a whistle to draw attention to yourself if they get closer. If the person approaches you and you feel like they’re going to attack, start yelling as loud as you can and running away. If you have a personal alarm or whistle, use it to make even more noise. Once someone else comes to your aid, let them know that someone was following you and reach out to the authorities. [6] X Research source It might feel embarrassing if you yell and the person wasn’t actually following you, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. Loud noises might be enough to deter your attacker since they don’t want to draw any attention to themselves."

If the person is approaching you quickly and you’ve determined they’ve followed you for a while, take your wallet and keys out of your bag. Let go of your bag and let it fall to the ground so you have a free hand. Walk away as quickly as you can to put some distance between you and the other person. Remember, your safety is more important than what’s in your bag. If you truly feel like you’re in danger, you can always drop your material possessions now and replace them later."

Hopefully, you won’t have to resort to it, but if worst comes to worst, you may need to protect yourself from danger. React quickly by pushing your thumbs into their eyes, hitting them in the throat, or kicking them in the groin to stun them. As soon as you land a blow, make a lot of noise and get to somewhere safe as fast as possible. [7] X Research source Only defend yourself if you absolutely need to.

      "content": "Lock your doors and roll up your windows. Even though it might just be a coincidence that the person is going the same direction, double-check to make sure you locked your doors. Keep your windows closed to make it more difficult to get into your vehicle. Be sure to shut the sunroof as well if you have one. That way, if you’re caught in traffic, no one can get in your vehicle. [9] X Research source Most newer vehicles lock your doors automatically once you start driving. Lock your doors right away when you get in your vehicle so you don’t have to worry about it later on."

Avoid accelerating or braking suddenly as well as swerving around the road since you’re more likely to lose control of your vehicle. Follow the rules of the road so you don’t cause any confrontations. [10] X Research source Never pull over if you’re being followed by an unknown vehicle, even if they flash their lights at you. You might be tempted to watch the other vehicle in your rear-view mirror, but focus on what’s in front of you so you aren’t distracted."

If you notice the same car behind you for a long period of time, don’t panic yet since they may truly be going the same direction as you. To see if they’re really following you, take a route that stands out against normal traffic. In a residential area, make 4 right turns. If you’re on the highway, take the next exit and immediately get back on the entrance ramp. If the vehicle is still tailing you, then there’s a good chance they’re following you. [11] X Research source Avoid going down remote roads without a lot of traffic since it gives the person following you a chance to attack."

Pay attention to the color and type of vehicle and commit it to memory. Then do your best to see the person driving. Try to remember their approximate age, gender, and any other defining characteristics. When you have a chance to safely pull over, write everything down so you don’t forget it. Don’t try to acknowledge the person too much. If they know that you’ve noticed them, they might slow down and that will make it harder to get enough details about them to report to the cops. If you have a passenger, ask them to write things down for you so you can focus on driving."

If it’s safe to do so, like if you’re stopped in traffic, look up the nearest police station and head straight there. [14] X Research source Avoid going back home right away, or else you may lead the attacker there. If you don’t know where the closest police station is or if you don’t have enough gas to get there, pull into a busy gas station or well-lit parking lot and stay in your vehicle."

Hopefully, the noise will be enough to deter the person. Otherwise, wait for someone else to approach your vehicle, slightly roll down your window, and let them know about what’s going on.

Stay alert and act like you know where you’re going even if you’re new in the area since attackers are more likely to strike people who look lost. Maintain good posture to show that you’re alert and ready for action in case something goes wrong. This might be enough to deter an attacker from targeting you in the first place."

Stick to sidewalks and areas that have a lot of foot traffic since attackers are less likely to strike if there are witnesses. Even if you have to take a longer way to your destination, you’ll feel a lot more comfortable and safer surrounded by others. [16] X Research source Let another person know that you think you’re being followed and ask if you can walk with them for a little while. People are less likely to attack if you’re in a group.

Avoid looking at your phone or down at the ground since a potential attacker may notice that you’re not paying attention and think you’re more vulnerable. The sooner that you recognize someone is tailing you, the more time you’ll have to react and get away safely. [18] X Research source Avoid wearing headphones or playing loud music if you’re walking alone. Make brief eye contact with strangers as they approach you. That way, you convey the message that you can identify them later on if they attack. [19] X Research source"

Before you get to a vehicle, take your keys out of your bag or pocket so you don’t get distracted looking for them later. Keep your head up and pay attention to any other people to watch for suspicious behavior. If you see anyone that makes you feel uneasy around your vehicle, go back to where you came from and ask someone for help. Park in well-lit areas so you’re able to see other people easily and to deter someone from breaking into your vehicle Look for exits if you’re in an underground or enclosed lot so you know where you can escape if you feel threatened."
