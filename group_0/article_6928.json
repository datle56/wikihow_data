      "content": "Get new tag lights that are compatible with your vehicle. Plan on replacing both of your tag lights at the same time, since the second one will usually burn out soon after the first. Look up what kind of tag lights are available for your vehicle’s make and model online or at an auto supply store. You can either get LED or incandescent bulbs to use for your tag lights. Choose white light bulbs so they illuminate your license plate without causing any distractions while you’re on the road. [1] X Research source Tag lights only cost about $2-3 USD. You may also check your vehicle’s user manual to find what kind of tag lights you need."

      "title": "Loosen the screws on the lights’ covers if your vehicle has them.",
      "content": "Loosen the screws on the lights’ covers if your vehicle has them. Look for the lights above your license plate near the latch that opens your trunk. Locate the screws holding the covers against your vehicle and use a screwdriver to turn them counterclockwise. Once you have the screws loose, pull the covers off of your vehicle to expose the light bulbs underneath them. [2] X Research source The covers may also have rubber gaskets attached to them. Make sure the gaskets stay attached to the covers when you take it off. Without the gaskets, water could get into the light bulbs and cause it to short out."

      "title": "Rotate the bases of the lights from underneath if they’re attached to the bumper.",
      "content": "Rotate the bases of the lights from underneath if they’re attached to the bumper. Lights attached to the back bumper usually don’t have screws. Go underneath your vehicle near the license plate, and look for the black wires leading to the circular ports on the back of the bumper. Rotate the bases of the wires counterclockwise in each of the ports and pull them straight out to access the bulbs. [3] X Research source Use a flashlight to help you find the wires leading to the back of your bumper."

    {
      "title": "Pull the light bulbs straight out.",
      "content": "Pull the light bulbs straight out. Grab the light bulbs gently so you don’t accidentally break them when you remove them. Pull the lights straight out from the bases to remove them. If the lights don’t come out, look for plastic or metal tabs holding them in place. Press down on them so the light bulbs come loose. [4] X Research source You can throw away the old tag lights as soon as you remove them. Don’t try to remove the bulbs while your vehicle is running since you could get shocked."

      "title": "Push the new tag lights into the slots.",
      "content": "Push the new tag lights into the slots. Wear cotton gloves when you’re handling the new light bulbs so you don’t smudge or damage them. Align the new tag lights so the prongs on the bottom line up with the holes on the bases. Push the light bulbs into each base until they click in securely. [5] X Research source Don’t force the bulbs into the bases or else you may shatter them."

      "title": "Turn your vehicle on to check if the lights are working.",
      "content": "Turn your vehicle on to check if the lights are working. Before putting the covers back on or securing the bases, start your vehicle and turn on your headlights. Check that the tag lights are lit to make sure your repairs worked. If the tag lights turn on, then turn off your vehicle so you can continue working. [6] X Research source If they aren’t lit up, then there may be an issue with your vehicle’s wiring and you’ll need a mechanic to check it for you."

      "title": "Reattach the covers to secure the lights.",
      "content": "Reattach the covers to secure the lights. Position the covers back over the light bulbs so the screw holes line up. Turn your screwdriver clockwise to tighten the screws back onto the covers to secure them. Once the covers are attached, your repairs are finished! [7] X Research source If you had to remove the bases from behind your vehicle’s bumper, then slide the bases back into place and rotate them clockwise to secure them."

      "content": "Get tag lights that are compatible with your vehicle. Plan on replacing both of your tag lights at the same time, even if only one of them burns out. Check in your vehicle’s user manual to see if the type of tag light you need is listed. Otherwise, search for your vehicle’s make and model online or at an auto body shop so you can easily find which lights you need. You can either use LED or incandescent bulbs. Tag lights usually cost about $2-3 USD a piece. Most states and countries require you to use white tag lights since they aren’t distracting and make your license plate easy to read."

      "content": "Remove the plastic fasteners holding the top trunk liner in place. Your trunk’s liner is usually held in place by plastic fasteners that look like screws or bolts. Shimmy the end of a screwdriver underneath the head of the fastener that’s closest to the vehicle’s license plate, and pry it out of place. Continue removing the fasteners along the edge of your liner so you can peel it back and enough to access the lights. [8] X Research source Always check if there are screws on the light covers outside your vehicle before removing the liner. Store the plastic fasteners in a small bowl or container so you don’t lose them."

Grab the bases of the lights and turn them counterclockwise until they come loose. Pull the bases straight out from the ports on your vehicle to expose the light bulbs. [9] X Research source If you have trouble removing the bases by hand, use a wrench or pair of pliers to get a better grip."
