In 1929, the stock market crashed and triggered the Great Depression, a major economic downturn that led to severe rates of unemployment and business failures. On top of this, the Dust Bowl began in 1931. The Dust Bowl was a series of droughts during the ‘30s that devastated farmland throughout the Great Plains region, turning workable soil into dust that flew around in dangerous wind storms.

      "content": "“Hash house” cooks and servers used amusing phrases for diner orders. The 1930s were the peak of diner lingo, or the sometimes crazy-sounding names that diner workers used for customers’ orders. Diners or “hash houses” were popular places to eat in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and customers back then were just as amused with the terms they used as we are today! Sadly, diner lingo phased out as more chain restaurants emerged later in the 20th century.

      "content": "Prohibition inspired new, secretive terms for homemade or illegal alcohol. The 18th Amendment to the US Constitution prohibited the making, selling, or transporting of alcohol from 1920 to 1933. This era of Prohibition didn’t stop people from drinking though—many gathered in illegal, secret bars called “speakeasies” to drink, and some went so far as to make their own wine, beer, and liquor (which was often quite strong and low-quality). Even though Prohibition was repealed by the 21st Amendment in 1933, the lingo from the time hung around throughout the decade. [5] X Research source Booze, hooch, or giggle juice: Whiskey Cadillac: 1 ounce of cocaine or heroin Gin mill: Any place that serves liquor, sometimes illegally Jive, muggles, or weed: Marijuana Plonk: Cheap or low-quality wine Rotgut: Bad or cheap homemade liquor Speakeasy: A bar disguised as something else or hidden behind an unmarked door Swacked: Drunk, intoxicated"

      "content": "Gangsters used and inspired slang for violence, crime, and police. From 1924 to 1938, thousands of professional crime rings and gangs were operating in the US, particularly in major cities like Chicago. The gangs, led by iconic figures like Al Capone and Bugs Moran, used money from illegally selling alcohol during Prohibition to pay off politicians or police officers and buy lots of guns. It was a violent time with high murder rates, and law enforcement was woefully unprepared to handle the surge in organized crime.

      "content": "Radio entertainment, jazz, and their associated slang dominated the ‘30s. Radio programming boomed in the ‘20s and ‘30s, often broadcasting live performances since the Great Depression made it too expensive to make many records. The ‘30s also encompassed the Swing Era, when big band jazz music was the “pop” music of the time. Major networks played swing music over the radio to lift the spirits of struggling Americans who wanted to dance and forget their economic troubles.
