      "content": "Calm your anxiety before going into the party. If you're nervous about entering a party when you don't know anyone there, it's a good idea to calm yourself before trying to meet anyone. Take a deep breath, breathing all the way down to your belly, and breathing out slowly through your nose. Repeat this slow, deep breathing several times. Make sure your feet are placed firmly against the floor, so that you’re well-grounded. Bring to mind a positive visualization. For example, imagine yourself looking sleek and sexy on the dance floor, or someone attractive laughing at your sense of humor. Realize that no one’s paying attention to you, so there’s no need to feel self-conscious. After all, most people attending parties are also nervous. Repeat this process anytime you start to feel nervous at the party."

Making small talk might lead to deeper conversations, or it might not. Small talk is often less about the information shared than the good feelings that it provides.

      "content": "Be an active listener. When you're nervous about not knowing anyone at a party, it might be difficult to concentrate on the conversations that come up. It will help your focus to repeat parts of what another person has said to assure them you've heard what was said. Use nonverbal cues, such as nodding, eye contact, and leaning towards the person, to let the other guest know that you're actively listening to what she has to say. Try to avoid talking over the other person while she’s talking, even if she’s talking about a topic you’re interested in. Ask plenty of open-ended questions about topics the other guest has brought up in order to keep the conversation going. Be sensitive to the emotions that the conversation is bringing up in the person. Generally, party conversations tend to be fun and light. If you find your conversation getting too intense or emotional, it's okay to back off a little."

Look for subtle signals in body language to help you gauge whether you should change the topic or find someone new to talk with. Be observant--these are signs you should be able to notice in almost everyone you meet. For example, if someone is making eye contact with you and nodding, they're interested in the conversation. Keep talking to them and doing what you're doing! If they're facing partially away from you or glancing around the room, they're not very engaged. Change the topic back to them with a question or find another person you haven't yet introduced yourself to."

You can always say, “I have to get up early tomorrow,” or even just, “Please, excuse me. I need to find the ladies’.” You can say, “It was nice to meet you,” or “Great talking to you!” Some people like to shake hands, but at some parties this might be too formal.

You’ll need to let others know that you’d like to talk by physically moving closer to them than you might at a quieter party. [15] X Research source Large parties are often more chaotic, with people interrupting one another, or talking quickly to make sure they get their point across. One way to effectively join in a group conversation is to repeat the last phrase that another person said, and join it with your own thoughts. For example, if someone’s just shared a story about being in Paris in April, you might echo, “Yes, Paris in April is beautiful, and for my college graduation, I was able to go to Rome, which I thought was wonderfully diverse.” Topics often change very quickly in a group conversation, so don’t worry too much about being exactly on topic. Being friendly is the main consideration."

Each person has her own way of getting energized for a party. You might listen to the music, and try to get into the rhythm of it. Or, you can think of party scenes from some of your favorite movies, and imagine yourself in the role of the heroine. [16] X Research source Even if you’re not totally at ease about being at the party, trying act as if you’re comfortable can help speed the process. (This is sometimes called, “Fake it until you make it!”) If you find yourself getting drained, make an excuse to get away for a short time.

If you really appreciate the kind of focused conversation that can happen between two people who know each other well, you’ll have to adjust to the fact that this isn’t likely to happen at the large party. Rather than becoming grumpy about what’s not going to happen, it’s a better idea to rescale your expectations. [17] X Research source Conversations in groups tend to be very broad, about a wide range of rapidly shifting topics. The goal of party conversations tends to be less on exchange of information and ideas, than on sharing a common good feeling. Good conversational choices for talking in groups include: short funny anecdotes, joking around, wordplay. Topics to avoid include: detailed analysis of a topic, anything that might unintentionally offend others, including political discussion, or discussions of religious faith and practice."

Little side conversations often break off of larger group conversations, either related to the topic the larger group is discussing or completely unrelated. [18] X Research source It’s okay to talk while others are talking when you’re in a large group; it’s not rude to have a side conversation. Sometimes the conversation might end abruptly if the group conversation shifts to something more interesting. It’s okay to move back and forth between the small side conversation and the larger group conversation."

See if you can signal your willingness to help him by making eye contact with him, nodding or smiling. [19] X Research source Sometimes you can help support another person who’s trying to make a point. For example, by asking a clarifying question about the subject he’s brought up or restating what he’s said in a new way. If you’re good at talking in groups, make sure that you’re not taking up too much of everyone’s attention. One way to do this is to use your skills to help others join in the discussion."
