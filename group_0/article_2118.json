      "content": "Aura farming is trying to look cool and build “aura.” Aura is basically a form of cool, suave energy, kind of like swag. Aura farming is trying to build that suave energy through acts that can be considered cool, mysterious, and/or nonchalant. These actions are typically intentional, but not always. The term is typically used to refer to cool poses, acts, or body language employed by people (or characters) to look cool, like Duke Dennis or Piccolo from Dragon Ball Z. [1] X Research source For example, if you walked into the lunch room and your friend was standing in the corner with a hard fit and a nonchalant look, they’d be aura farming. Piccolo is known for entering scenes in a cool way, with his arms crossed and his cape flowing in the wind. Before he springs into action, he removes his cape and turban, which results in many fans saying he’s aura farming. Duke Dennis is often known for holding a straight face and casually, nonchalantly doing things on camera, and many fans say he’s aura farming whenever he does this. Aura farming is often used in a joking manner to poke fun at people trying to look cool."

      "content": "Piccolo’s Entrances In the popular anime Dragon Ball Z , the character Piccolo typically enters the scene nonchalantly. He’s usually standing on top of a tall building or pillar with his arms crossed and his cape flowing in the wind. This has caused many people online to joke that he’s aura farming, with a common caption being “Yes Piccolo, we see the fit 🙄.” For example, on October 26, 2024, @code.mayonaka posted a TikTok compilation video of Piccolo’s cool entrances with the caption “Yes we see the fit Piccolo 🤦🏾‍♂️.”"

      "content": "Duke Dennis Shaking Grapes Many of Duke Dennis’s actions have been considered aura farming by fans, but the grape shaking is by far the most popular one. Instead of picking grapes off the stem and casually eating them like everyone else, Duke Dennis tends to pick them off, shake them, and pop them back while looking away from the camera, which many consider aura farming. This has sparked plenty of memes online, with users like @large.cranium making videos parodying the way he shakes grapes captioned with “Dudes be tryna make anything look cool 🤦.”"

      "content": "Sasuke Throughout the Naruto Series In the popular anime/manga series Naruto , the character Sasuke Uchiha is typically standoffish and mysterious, garnering him attention and cool points from many other characters. Some of these moments, like when he is standing upside down on the roof during the Five Kage Summit Arc or when he enters the Chunin Exams, have been highlighted by users to show how much Sasuke aura farms. For example, @wrked.up posted a video of Sasuke entering the Chunin Exams to TikTok on March 26, 2025. In the video, Sasuke’s cold demeanor is cheered with the caption “Sasuke Aura Farm..”"

      "content": "Michael Jackson Standing on Stage As videos of Michael Jackson’s old concerts resurface on the internet, many users consider him one of the greatest aura farmers. They typically post the video of him standing on stage at a concert, as the camera pans to fans as they pass out and have to get carried away for medical attention simply because of his presence. One clip of the concert , posted by TikTok user @nineteesvintage_de on August 5, 2024, was simply captioned “Define aura.” It’s currently sitting at 8.8 million likes, so it’s safe to say he’s the definition of aura & the standard for aura farming."

      "content": "Put a good fit together. When you’re aura farming, you gotta have a good fit to match. Put on something that flatters you and matches your energy, and wear it with style . Instead of putting on sweats and a baggy tee, put on a pair of baggy jeans, a tank top, and a Carhartt jacket with a cool pair of kicks. If that’s not your thing, put on something that aligns with you more. If you like black clothing with big boots, throw on a pair of leather pants, a long-sleeve black top, and Rick Owens boots. As long as the fit is clean and matches your energy, it’ll be perfect for aura farming. If you don’t know what kind of clothes you like, check out TikTok or Pinterest for style inspiration."

While you don’t have to have a fresh cut all the time, it does maximize your aura, as you’re clean and freshly trimmed. You do want to make sure you smell good, though. Even if you have a good fit, fresh cut, and a well-trimmed beard, if you don’t smell good, that’s an automatic decrease in aura points. [2] X Research source Pick a haircut that represents you. Copying a hairstyle just because a popular celebrity has it may not help you build aura. Choosing a hairstyle that flatters your face and expresses your personality can, though."

      "content": "Find a suitable area to aura farm from. Aura farming is best done in areas that are populated. You want to be a suitable distance away from the crowd, close enough to be seen but far enough for your aura to be noticed. Head to a mall, lunch room, food court, or somewhere else with lots of people and get ready to show off your aura. You can be indoors or outdoors when aura farming. Take the environment into account when getting ready to aura farm. If you stand in the sun during golden hour, the lighting can help increase your aura."

If you’re in a pinch, pull out the weather app, but be careful, as someone may notice that you’re just trying to scroll on your phone and aura farm. If you want to stay off your phone, casually look off into the distance. You don’t have to focus on anything in particular, just remain calm and cool."

If you notice someone looking your way, either approach them and casually strike up a conversation or let them come to you. As you talk to them, try to keep your reactions casual and lowkey to maximize the aura."

So, even though you want to remain casual, confident, and lowkey, it’s just as important to be authentic and true to yourself. Be honest about the things you like and don’t like, speak your truth, and let the conversation flow naturally. That way, the person you’re talking to knows your aura is genuine.

When it comes to aura farming, you have to find an area that’s populated enough to where people will see you, but distant enough from them for your aura to be on full display, like a wall. This can be anywhere from school to the mall to the gas station, you just have to pick an environment that’s full of people you want to aura farm around. Some places to choose from include: The gym The lunchroom The rec center On a balcony The mall The gas station The club A convention A festival By a fountain On a riverwalk or lakefront"

      "content": "Yes, aura farming can raise your aura if you do it correctly. When you correctly pull off aura farming, you show people that you’re cool and nonchalant, but also confident and charismatic. When you have a good outfit, smell good, and can post up in a way that seems authentic, you can attract other people. For example, if you’re at a party or event and lightly aura farm before approaching someone, they may be more inclined to talk to you. On the flip side, if you force it and it seems like you’re intentionally trying to be mysterious or nonchalant, people may see right through your aura farming."

[4] X Research source Piccolo typically appears in a tall location, standing atop with his arms folded and his cape flowing in the wind. Many fans have considered this aura farming. Duke Dennis also helped popularize the term, with users saying that he tries to aura farm around women by doing things like holding a straight face and shaking grapes before eating them."

For example, if someone is reacting to a funny video on Twitch and they react in a way that’s clearly over the top or disproportionate to how funny the video way, they may be clip farming.
