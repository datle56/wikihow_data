      "content": "The PS5 features dynamic themes. While previous PlayStation iterations offered custom themes that players could choose from, the PS5 offered no such thing at launch, and remains as such nearly two years later. Instead, the console displays a new home background for every game you own."

To take advantage of dynamic themes and change your PS5's background, simply highlight the tile for a game you own on the home screen. The background will automatically adjust to display a wallpaper relevant to the highlighted game. [1] X Research source In addition to changes in the background image, some games will prompt a new soundtrack to play over the home screen, as opposed to the more ethereal sound of the PS5's default menu music."

Perhaps more annoying for some players than the constant changing of images is the constant switching of soundtracks when sifting through your collection of games. Fortunately, players can deactivate the home screen music entirely, affording you some peaceful silence when searching for a game to play. From the Sound section, head to Audio Output and then toggle Home Screen Music off under the \"General\" tab. You may also deactivate your home screen's sound effects in this subsection as well.

The home screen may not be very customizable on the PS5, but Sony seems to be placing particular emphasis on the new control center with their latest console anyway. You cannot change the control center's background, but you can tailor its display to your needs. Press the PS on your DualSense controller to find it. Press the options button to rearrange the cards on your PS5 control center as you please. Place cards of particular use towards the top of the display, and hide any unwanted cards by dragging them to the \"Hidden Controls\" area on your screen. [4] X Research source Three cards come hidden by default ( Broadcast , Accessibility , and Network ) but you can unhide them at any time."

Decorate the console itself with a console cover, available from Sony as well as several other third parties. You can even get a matching set for your DualSense controllers! [5] X Research source If you can't find a console cover that intrigues you, consider sticker bombing your PS5! Covering your console in stickers is largely safe (just avoid any ports or external-facing fans) and allows for even deeper levels of self-expression. [6] X Research source"
