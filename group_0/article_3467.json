If you’re still in high school, take physics, chemistry, and a full four years of math to prepare for any maritime training.

Study topics dealing with navigational software, facilities management software, marine communication system operations, and the structure of mechanical ship equipment.

They’re not necessary to take the exam, but they can be a comprehensive way to learn about navigation, tidal calculations, international and inland rules of the road, and meteorology. If you live near a coast, look for local businesses that specialize in these classes. If there's nothing near where you live, you can take an online course. These courses end in a written exam that can often stand in for the official exam. Check the Coast Guard website to find approved courses. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Log at least 360 days of sea-time. Before you can obtain a captain's license, you must have a minimum total of 360 days worth of sea-time within a five-year period. A \"day\" in this context refers to a period of four consecutive hours. [5] X Research source If this sea-time is spent under another captain's command, you will need to have this captain sign your license application when the time comes. Any time spent on a boat counts.

Even though you only need 360 days of sea-time to get your license, if you want an actual job as a captain, you will usually need at least three to four years of professional experience. This experience should be directly related to the operations and management of a ship. [6] X Research source Some positions to aim for are deckhand, third mate, second mate, chief mate, or engineer. While you can study some of the basics of boating in books or online, you really need experience on the water in order to truly understand what you've been reading.

[11] X Research source The Master license involves far more sea-time hours, but there’s no need to get the six-pack license first. Jump right to the Master if that’s the one you want."
