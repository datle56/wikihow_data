      "content": "Select the size. Design the permanent sawbuck to be 6 vertical 2x4's (38 mm x 89 mm) or 2x6s (38 mm x 140mm) of about 4 feet (1.22 meters) long and 4 horizontal 2x6's 5 feet (1.52 meters) long using 3.5 inch (8.89 cm) wood screws or nails. [1] X Research source (See \"Tips\" for information on making a demo/prototype version instead.) Cutting the top \"V\" form portion at an angle and with a shorter top would make it lighter and more open. Adding a trough or floor, as a retainer like feature, into the top \"V\" allows for a lower chance of shorter pieces of firewood unexpectedly falling from the inner part of the sawbuck to the ground."

      "content": "Use suitable boards for your project. Nominal 2X6s or 2X4s of pine (southern yellow or lodgepole or white), or spruce will be fine. Decide if it is the taller or shorter height that you think you may want, namely, and cut the \"X\" pieces about 48 inches (1.22 meters) long. [2] X Research source Adjust the height according to what feels right to you. [3] X Research source"

Take it apart and angle-cut and trim the angle of the \"V\" as shown in the photo above. [4] X Research source Angled cutting of the \"V\" and making the upper \"arms\" shorter than the \"legs\" will make it less top-heavy. The arms help to hold poles and limbs to be cut on the sawbuck."

      "title": "Use this as your pattern for the rest.",
      "content": "Use this as your pattern for the rest. Feature: the upper \"V\" part being deep allows you to nestle and cut two or more narrow poles or tree limbs (around 3 to 8 feet (91.44 cm x 44 meters) in length) for cutting with a chainsaw to chop your firewood at a faster rate."

      "content": "Design a lower sawbuck if you would like to use the \"X\" sawbuck with a hand \"bow-saw\". Make the sawbuck about only 20-24\" (50.8 cm x 60.9 cm) high to the center. This will allow the user to put a foot on top of the poles or resulting in the split wood being cut when it is that low (as illustrated)."

[5] X Research source You may find inexpensive [or free] long bolts, and nuts that fit them, on the ground in a self-service, automobile wrecking yard). Put it in the exact same placement at the center of each \"X\", using extra-large washers, so that it can be clamped together and loosened to fold for storage."

Long, common bolts are not very expensive- they cost between $1 to $1.50 each at a lumber or hardware store. (But, tempered, hardened, fine threaded bolts cost about 4 to 5 times as much.)"
