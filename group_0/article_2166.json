      "content": "Snap out of it by relaxing your body. When you blush, you can quickly help fade the redness by relaxing your muscles, particularly in your shoulders and neck. Try to let go of the tension that you are suddenly holding on to. Keep your posture upright and your legs balanced. In order to relax, try: Remembering to breathe in and out (deeply if you can). [1] X Expert Source Donna Novak, Psy.D Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 8 December 2020. Reminding yourself that this isn't the first time you have blushed and it probably won't be the last time. This can be oddly comforting. Smiling. Smiling may help as our cheeks naturally redden when we smile; smiling also helps us feel happier [2] X Research source , which may destroy any social anxiety."

      "content": "Don't fixate on blushing. Many people fixate on their blushing when it happens, worsening their social anxiety. And research shows that the more we think about blushing, the more we blush.

      "title": "Consider calling attention to it.",
      "content": "Consider calling attention to it. If a person's on a date and they do something incredibly awkward, one way that they'll save the situation is by calling attention to it: \"Well, now, that was clumsy. I promise I'm only a klutz half of the time!\" By calling attention to the awkwardness and putting it out in the open, they've unmasked it. The awkwardness usually leaves right then and there. You can do the same thing with blushing. It's obviously not something you can do every time, in every situation, but consider it a tool you can use. Your blushing often gets worse because you're afraid of people uncovering your anxiety. If you defuse the anxiety before other people have time to realize it, you have no reason to blush anymore."

      "title": "Try rehearsing thought exercises.",
      "content": "Try rehearsing thought exercises. In order to help you feel both cooler (as in physically colder, but also street-wise) and to distract you from the blushing itself, try several thought exercises: Imagine jumping in an ice-cold lake. Imagine diving deep down to the bottom of the lake while feeling the cold water wash over your limbs and skin. It'll help you cool down and should relax you a bit. Imagine people in their underwear. For some odd reason, this public-speaking trick really works. It makes you feel like everyone else is human, and that you're not the only one who makes mistakes. More often than not, it'll make you chuckle. Compare your situation to other people in the world. You feel embarrassed because you need to get up and talk in front of your class, perhaps. That's a piece of cake compared to fighting for your life or struggling to find food. Remind yourself of how good you have it."

      "title": "Understand what blushing is.",
      "content": "Understand what blushing is. Blushing is the involuntary rushing of blood to the face, usually brought on by social anxiety. Blushing causes redness and sometimes perspiration. Blushing is made worse by the fact that the face has more capillary loops and more blood vessels than other skin areas, making blushing in the face particularly visible. Understand that blushing can be caused for no \"social\" reason at all. Most people blush when they feel uncomfortable in a social situation. Other people blush for no apparent social reason at all. This kind of unprovoked blushing is called idiopathic craniofacial erythema. Understand that some people have a legitimate phobia of blushing, called erythrophobia. People suffering from erythrophobia may wish to seek out counseling as they try to overcome their fear."

      "title": "Try to prevent blushing in the first place, if possible.",
      "content": "Try to prevent blushing in the first place, if possible. Find out when you blush. Is it when you're angry, or when you're nervous? Is it when you look at or think of a certain someone? Is it when you're put in the spotlight? Don't necessarily try to avoid whatever makes you blush, but try to condition your body to believe that there is no reason to blush when it comes along. This is the first step in beating the blushing. Make a list of all the recent times you remember blushing, especially if you blushed social situations. Write the outcome of the social situation. Were you made fun of? Did people notice? In most cases, decent people don't think that blushing is a problem and don't point it out. And why should they? It's not something that you can control. Start understanding that blushing isn't always as important as you think it might be."

      "title": "Don't feel responsible for blushing.",
      "content": "Don't feel responsible for blushing. Whatever you do, don't feel responsible for blushing. It is involuntary. Train your mind to understand that your conscious thoughts have nothing to do with this autonomic bodily response. You are not to blame, and you are not guilty of anything. If you let go of feeling responsible for blushing, there's a good chance you'll find yourself blushing less often."

      "title": "Stop caring.",
      "content": "Stop caring. Not only is your blushing much less noticeable than you probably think, but it's also helpful to remember that most people either find blushing to be cute or endearing. There are benefits to being a blusher. They include: People who witness someone blush find the blusher to be more sympathetic, softening their social judgments of the person. [4] X Research source In this way, blushing may help build better social bonds. Researchers believe that people who blush are better at relationships, reporting higher levels of monogamy and trustworthiness. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Work out strenuously before you feel you might get embarrassed. This does two things: your face will have a natural red hue that looks more \"normal,\" and you'll lower your blood pressure so much that you could become effectively immune to blushing, based on how hard and long you work out, for anywhere between 30 minutes to 2 hours. Even if your redness from working out fades, this temporary immunity will continue."

      "title": "Find helpful relaxation techniques.",
      "content": "Find helpful relaxation techniques. Prime your mind and your body to relax before the blushing sets in through meditation or gentle exercise. Feeling relaxed and in control could help you prevent blushing from occurring in the first place. Try yoga. Yoga is the perfect mind/body exercise that will help center your thoughts and provide enough physical stimulation to get blood flowing throughout your body, not just in your face. Experiment with different types of yoga; there are dozens. Find the style that best suits you. Try gentle meditation. Meditation can mean so many different things. One form of meditation that you can try is simply becoming aware of your body and shooting that awareness out to the very edges of your body, achieving a kind of release. Focus first on the thoughts in your head, and then gradually move your awareness to the edges of your body, until you are aware of your body as a whole."
