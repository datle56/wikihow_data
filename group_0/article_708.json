They are as follows: Center at Cut: This places the center of the transition in between the two clips. This creates a symmetrical transition from one clip to the next. This is the alignment you'll be using most often. Note: If you are unable to position a transition in the center of the cut, it's probably because there is no video data before the start of the second clip. Simply grab the edge of the second clip and drag it inwards to shorten the clip by a little. Then move it next to the first clip. This will allow you to place a transition in the center of the clips. [3] X Research source Start at Cut: This starts the transition at the beginning of the second clip in the sequence. End at Cut: This starts the transition at the end of the first clip. The transition ends when the second clip begins."

When you play the video clips back, the transition may stutter and jerk, depending on how much you shortened or lengthened the effect. It is signified by a red bar at the top of the video clip panel.
