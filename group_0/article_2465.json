      "title": "\"Baruch Hashem\" (ברוך השם) means \"Blessed is God\" or \"Thank God\" in Hebrew.",
      "content": "\"Baruch Hashem\" (ברוך השם) means \"Blessed is God\" or \"Thank God\" in Hebrew. The Hebrew word \"baruch\" (pronounced bah-rook ) means \"blessed,\", while \"Hashem\" (pronounced how it's spelled) translates to \"the Name.\" Jews and some non-Jews use this phrase to thank God when speaking about news, health, finances, work, school, and personal matters in casual conversation. It's one of the ways they constantly thank God for His blessings in their daily lives. [1] X Research source Jews refer to God as Hashem (or \"the Name\") in casual conversation or personal prayer to avoid saying His holy names (i.e., Adonai and YHWH). Using a word with a vaguer meaning is also a way for them to acknowledge God's depthless wisdom and unknowable nature."

      "content": "Say \"Baruch Hashem\" in answer to someone asking how you are. When you talk to someone else and they politely ask you how you've been or how you're doing in a specific area of your life (i.e., health, job, family), you can say \"Baruch Hashem\" to acknowledge God and thank Him for your blessings. [2] X Research source You can either say it before or after your answer. Below are some appropriate ways to use \"Baruch Hashem\" in response to a \"How are you\" question. \"Baruch Hashem, I'm doing good!\" \"Baruch Hashem, I'm in good health.\" \"Baruch Hashem, I'm alive.\" \"Baruch Hashem, I've been very blessed.\" \"Baruch Hashem, all is well and my work is coming along great.\" \"School is going well, baruch Hashem.\" \"I have much to be grateful for, baruch Hashem.\" \"I've been in good spirits, baruch Hashem.\" \"My family and I are prospering, baruch Hashem.\" \"I've been feeling better, baruch Hashem.\""

      "content": "Say \"Baruch Hashem\" when you hear someone say good news. When someone brings you good news – i.e., they got a new job, they came through a medical procedure successfully, or they passed a hard test at school – thanking God is a beautiful and heartfelt way to acknowledge the blessing in the moment. Saying \"Baruch Hashem\" also reminds us that God is the source of all our prosperity, abundance, and good fortune. [3] X Research source According to Jewish teachings, it's also important to thank God when you hear bad news. This blessing reads, \" Baruch Dayan HaEmet ,\" which translates to, \"Blessed is the Judge of truth\" or \"Blessed is the true Judge\" (the \"Judge\" being God). It's an affirmation of the Jewish belief that God knows best and that whatever happens in life is for our benefit."

      "title": "It isn't appropriate to say \"Adonai\" outside of formal prayer.",
      "content": "It isn't appropriate to say \"Adonai\" outside of formal prayer. Adonai is a name for God that means \"Lord\" or \"my Lord.\" It's used primarily in blessings spoken at Shabbat (the Jewish Sabbath), during the ceremonies for Jewish holidays, and when reading the Torah. It's not appropriate for casual conversation. Another reason to avoid saying \"Adonai\" after \"Baruch Hashem\" is it doesn't make sense. The word \"Hashem\" already refers to God; there's no need to add a second name for Him in the same phrase."

      "title": "Anyone can say \"Baruch Hashem\" with the right intention and respect.",
      "content": "Anyone can say \"Baruch Hashem\" with the right intention and respect. As long as you're using the phrase to thank God sincerely and not saying it flippantly or just to sound pious, it's certainly appropriate to say \"Baruch Hashem.\" It's also acceptable for non-Jews to say it, though they must take care not to try to pass themselves off as Jewish. Non-Jews who use this phrase can communicate they're not Jewish in other ways, such as by not donning a head covering and not wearing tzittzit. If you're not Jewish and don't feel comfortable saying the Hebrew version of \"Baruch Hashem,\" you can say \"Thank God\" instead."

Prior to this passage in Genesis, Abraham – forefather of the Jewish people – fought against a foreign king and rescued his nephew, Lot, from captivity.

Upon arriving, Eliezer finds the woman he feels God has destined for Isaac, and he says, \"Blessed be Hashem, the God of my master Abraham, who has not withheld steadfast faithfulness from my master.\" The rest of the verse continues as follows: \"For I have been guided on my errand by Hashem, to the house of my master's kin.\" Genesis 24:27"

After he reunites with Moses after the Israelites' escape from Egypt, Jethro praises God for delivering them safely. \"Here is the full verse: \"'Blessed be Hashem,' Jethro said, 'who delivered you from the Egyptians and from Pharaoh, and who delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.'\" Exodus 18:10"
