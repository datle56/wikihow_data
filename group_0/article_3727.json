      "title": "Find a church.",
      "content": "Find a church. Consider what faith or denomination would best fit your beliefs, and what requirements that group sets for becoming an ordained minister. Sit in on a few services at local churches to see if their style and focus are a good match for you. Once you find a church whose message resonates with you, seek out senior members of the church and speak to them about ordination via seminary school. Most seminaries have an established history with particular denominations, so senior members can guide you toward a school that will be the best fit for your beliefs. If you'd rather seek out a school on your own, using an online search tool can be helpful in narrowing down potential options. It's worth noting that California accepts ordinations from institutions across the United States for the purpose of conducting a marriage ceremony, so your choice of school need not be dependent on that."

      "title": "Apply for seminary.",
      "content": "Apply for seminary. Once you've decided on a school, you'll have to send in an application. Requirements for entry will vary by school and by program. Some masters programs may require a four-year college degree, while more general programs may only require a high school diploma. [1] X Research source Typical application steps include an essay detailing your interest in seminary school, letters of recommendation from pastors or spiritual mentors, and an interview process with school officials."

    {
      "title": "Prepare for seminary.",
      "content": "Prepare for seminary. Review the logistics of attending the school and make sure you're financially prepared. Costs are similar to attending a four-year university, and most degree programs take at least several years to complete. Given the scope of this commitment, it's important to be sure that you've been called to a life of ministry before beginning the process. This isn’t something you do on a whim or solely to perform a single wedding."

      "title": "Apply for pastoral candidacy.",
      "content": "Apply for pastoral candidacy. Once you have your degree, you can apply for pastoral candidacy at the church where you wish to conduct your ministry. This involves a thorough interview with senior members of the church. You should be prepared to answer questions like, \"Do you agree with everything in this church's statement of faith?\" or, \"How would you characterize your understanding of church leadership?\" The church for which you are applying can be located anywhere in the country, as California recognizes ordained ministers working in any of the fifty states for the purposes of officiating weddings. Understand that some churches may require you to complete a trial period in a lessor leadership role, though this requirement will vary by organization. Upon successful completion of this process, you will be given the title of ordained minister."

      "content": "Begin officiating weddings. Once you become ordained, you will be eligible to perform legal marriage ceremonies.

There are numerous organizations that provide instant online ordination qualifying you to officiate weddings in California.

      "title": "Get ordained.",
      "content": "Get ordained. The ordination process is usually as simple as filling out an online form detailing your personal information. There are rarely tests to pass or prior education requirements. Despite being a much shorter and easier process, ordinations through an online church provide the same legal status as those obtained through a seminary."

The exact amount depends on the county clerk’s office that issues the marriage license, but generally costs range from $100-$150. Call the clerk's office or consult the county website for information specific to that county."
