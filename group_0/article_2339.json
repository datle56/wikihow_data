You’ll start eliminating meat, dairy products, added sugars, caffeine, alcohol, and processed foods. Active Cleanse/Kitchari Phase : The main cleansing period. Your diet will consist primarily of variations of Kitchari, a traditional Ayurvedic dish, as well as certain other foods like Ghee and spices. Reintroduction/Rejuvenation Phase : Essentially involves returning to stage one. You’ll gradually reintroduce a wider variety of foods, while also focusing on hydration to rejuvenate your body.
