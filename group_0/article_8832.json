      "title": "Use props to set the mood and buy yourself time during the reading.",
      "content": "Use props to set the mood and buy yourself time during the reading. Use a prop associated with psychic readings, like a crystal ball or a tarot card. Choose something that will create a more believable atmosphere for your subject and distract them while you're thinking of things to say. [1] X Research source For example, you could look into a crystal ball and say something like “Just a moment, I think I’m getting something,\" when you need a minute to come up with your next line."

      "title": "Pick out your subject in advance if you're performing for an audience.",
      "content": "Pick out your subject in advance if you're performing for an audience. Choose someone in the crowd and observe them for a while. Listen for any useful information they might share about their life that you can use later on. When you're ready to begin, tell that person that you sense a powerful energy coming from them and you'd like to read them first. [2] X Research source For example, if you hear someone mention their best friend Mike, you could bring up the name Mike during the reading to prove you're a true messenger of the spirit world."

    {
      "title": "Be modest about your reading abilities.",
      "content": "Be modest about your reading abilities. Don’t make crazy claims about your powers that will set you up for failure. The lower you set the bar for yourself, the easier it will be to meet or surpass your subject’s expectations. You want your subject to be surprised, not disappointed. [3] X Research source For example, instead of bragging about how you can read someone’s mind, say something more modest, like “I'm able to sense things that are troubling people, and their problems come to me in bits and pieces. I could try reading you if you’d want that.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Tell your subject the success of the reading depends on them.",
      "content": "Tell your subject the success of the reading depends on them. Let them know it's up to them to piece together and make sense of the information you’re conveying. You're simply the messenger. This takes the responsibility of connecting the dots off of you and places it on them. [4] X Research source For example, before the reading you could say something like “The spirit world relays information to me in mysterious ways, so it’s up to you to make meaning of the things I’m about to tell you.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Be confident during the reading.",
      "content": "Be confident during the reading. Your subject is more likely to believe you when you seem confident about the things you’re saying. Try not to stutter or get flustered, even when you’re wrong about something. Remember that you’re the one with the supernatural powers. You’re subject is lucky to be in your magical presence! [5] X Research source Whenever you make a claim that's wrong, say something like \"Are you sure that doesn't mean anything to you? Maybe the meaning hasn't revealed itself to you yet.\""

    {
      "title": "Conceal questions as statements.",
      "content": "Conceal questions as statements. This technique, known as “fishing,” lets you learn things about your subject that you can use later on in your reading. You’re fishing for information until your subject takes the bait by confirming one of your statements. [6] X Research source For example, you could say “I’m getting visions of a necklace, I wonder why?” If your subject doesn’t respond, move on and try again. “I’m seeing a hazy image of a white house, what could it mean?” If your subject jumps in and tells you that their grandma used to live in a white house, use that as a jumping-off point for your reading."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let your subject do most of the talking.",
      "content": "Let your subject do most of the talking. If you strike a chord during the reading, and your subject wants to talk a lot about a specific person or incident, let them. Don’t interrupt them. Your subject talking is invaluable because they will reveal things about themselves that you can use later to demonstrate your otherworldly abilities. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Pay attention to your subject’s clothing and mannerisms.",
      "content": "Pay attention to your subject’s clothing and mannerisms. Use these characteristics to deduce things about them that you can use in your reading. Just avoid anything obvious that your subject would pick up on, like “reading” that their favorite band is Metallica when they’re wearing a Metallica shirt right in front of you. Don't worry if your deductions are incorrect, just casually move on with the reading. [8] X Research source For example, if your subject is fidgeting a lot in their seat and wearing a necklace with a heart pendant, at some point in the reading you could say “I’m sensing you’re an anxious person, but that anxiousness disappears when you’re with your true love.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Speak in general statements that could apply to anyone.",
      "content": "Speak in general statements that could apply to anyone. This minimizes the risk of you being wrong. Your subject will do the hard work by making the broad statements fit their life. Avoid anything too specific unless you’re using information that you gathered from your subject earlier. [9] X Research source For example, you could say something like “As a child, you sometimes felt unhappy and like no one understood you.” This statement could apply to anyone (most people experience unhappiness or being misunderstood at some point as a child) but it has the illusion of being specific."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let your subject guide the discussion.",
      "content": "Let your subject guide the discussion. Many subjects come into a reading with troubles or desires already weighing on their mind. If your subject is eager to discuss something, or you notice that they keep bringing up a topic, take the reading in that direction. Your subject will be more willing to believe you if you’re telling them what they want to hear. [10] X Research source For example, if the subject keeps mentioning their ex, you could say something like “You experienced heart break not too long ago, and you’re having trouble moving on. Your past relationship is weighing on your soul.”"
