There could be underlying factors at play that you don’t know exist that will help you understand them and their rules better. This is also a time for them to understand you better. [1] X Research source Say something like “Hey Mom and Dad, I know that I’ve been getting in trouble a lot for breaking my curfew of 10 o’clock by a few minutes. I really want to be a better child and I never want to stress you out or for you to worry about me. But I’ve had the same curfew for a year now, and I was wondering if in the future you would consider extending it to 11, after I’ve proven that I can be home by 10 consistently?” Perhaps your parents are very strict on you because there are a lot of kids in your area who do drugs or get into fatal car accidents. If so, you can reassure them by being drug free and by driving carefully."

Also, if there is any way you’d feel more comfortable with me going, could we talk about that?\" In the future, ask them a bit in advance so they have more time to think about it, and don’t demand an answer right away.
