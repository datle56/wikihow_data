      "content": "Join a theater group while you are in middle school or high school. If you are still in school, join the drama club. Look for announcements regarding drama club meetings, or ask your guidance counselor to help you connect with the correct faculty member to get you started. Then, attend all meetings and practices. This is a great way to learn fundamental acting skills and participate in your first plays or musicals. [1] X Research source In drama club, you can learn things like different methods of acting, writing your own material, trying out different characters, and stage/costume design. In addition, consider majoring in theater or acting in college to continue your education."

      "title": "Take an acting class or workshop outside of school.",
      "content": "Take an acting class or workshop outside of school. Look for small playhouses and theaters in your area, and research any workshops, classes, or training courses. Most communities have a local theater in the area, and many native actors offer ways to gain acting skills , such as summer workshops, personal lessons, or networking events. Make a selection based on what you want to learn, and sign up for the class online or in person. This is a great idea if you want to take up acting but did not join a drama club in school. Improvisation classes are a good place to start. Improvisational acting trains you to pay attention to cues and respond quickly. You'll learn to naturally react to others' prompts and silence your inner critic. When you advance past basic acting classes, you can take specialized classes for film or stage acting, which require different skills. Experiment with both to figure out which suits you best."

      "content": "People-watch to learn about different expressions and behaviors. A great way to expand your acting knowledge is to observe the people in your daily life. Take a second to watch others while at a coffee shop, restaurant, or running errands. Quickly watch others to get a sense of their mannerisms, facial expressions, and body language. Then, use this knowledge when acting to deliver an authentic performance. [2] X Research source For example, you can watch a young child with a large ice cream cone. Pay attention to how their happiness is expressed across their face. Then, use these facial expressions when you act out a happy scene. Be careful not to stare or gawk at the person, as this will make them uncomfortable."

Actors submit these along with their resume when applying to a certain position. Find a professional photographer, review their work, and explain that this is an acting headshot. When it’s time to take your picture, dress in neutral clothes and try a few different angles and poses. Typically, headshots are printed on standard 8.5 in × 11 in (22 cm × 28 cm) paper. Use the same size of paper for your resume. It looks more professional this way. In addition, get electronic copies of your headshots. Some agencies may ask you to email your resume and headshots. You want a professional, presentable photograph that displays your natural beauty."
