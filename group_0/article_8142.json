For a picture window, use horizontal strokes. Start at the top and work down the window. Overlap each stroke by a couple inches (a few centimeters), and wipe the blade dry with a lint-free cloth between each stroke. [6] X Research source Make sure the rubber blade is always in contact with the window. One of the easiest ways to get streak-free windows is to buy a good quality squeegee, and to make sure the rubber blade on it is sharp. [7] X Research source Make sure you also have a streak-free window cleaning solution. Replace the rubber blade when it gets dull, because it will stop sealing properly and start leaving streaks."
