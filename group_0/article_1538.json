      "content": "Choose a type of self tanner. There are so many self tanning products out there, it can be difficult to choose one that will work for you. Some formulas allow you to build a tan gradually over the course of a few days or a week, while others immediately stain your skin bronze. Some are long-lasting, while others wear off after a week or wash off at the end of the day. Figure out which product is best for your needs: [1] X Research source Gradual self-tanning formulas. These come in the form of creams, gels, sprays or foams. Gradual self-tanning formulas usually contain either dihydroxyacetone (DHA) and Erythrulose, both of which work by reacting with the amino acids on the skin surface to create a darker complexion. One application will darken the skin by just a shade or so, but you can keep applying the product over the course of several days to achieve the color you want. Instant tanning formulas. Most instant tanners are sprays that you can apply immediately for a sun-kissed look. Some stay in place for about a week, while others can be washed away at the end of the day. Instant formulas are trickier to apply than gradual formulas, since they stain the skin right away and might leave streaks. Face tanning formulas. Look for a self-tanner designed for use on the face if yours is on the sensitive or oily side. While most self-tanners work on the body and the face equally well, you'll want to get one specifically for the face if your skin is a little finicky. Pick the right color. If you have fair skin, choose a light to medium color. If you have olive skin, choose a dark formula. You can always reapply the self-tanner to deepen your tan if your first application looks too light."

You might want to shave or wax your legs (and arms, if necessary) to ensure you'll be happy with the final appearance of your tan. [2] X Research source If you have fine hair on your legs or arms, there's no need to remove it before tanning unless you want to.

[3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source No matter what your skin type, is, it's best to exfoliate well in the shower before tanning. [4] X Expert Source Barbie Ritzman Beauty & Skincare Specialist Expert Interview. 23 August 2021. When your skin has dry, flaky patches, it's a lot harder to apply self-tanner evenly, and you'll end up with a patchy look instead of a pretty finish. The chemicals in self tanner react with amino acids in the upper layers of your skin. By removing the uppermost layer (which would've sloughed off on its own soon anyway) you're ensuring that the tan develops in a fresh layer that's going to be around longer. Also, dry skin tends to absorb more color, increasing the likelihood of an uneven tan. To exfoliate, use a washcloth, a scrub brush or scrub gel to thoroughly exfoliate all of the areas you're tanning. Focus on rough spots like your elbows and knees. [5] X Expert Source Barbie Ritzman Beauty & Skincare Specialist Expert Interview. 23 August 2021. The self-tanner tends to darken these areas more than other parts of your body, since it soaks in faster. Rough skin will cause the application to look even more uneven. Moisturize the skin after exfoliating, particularly if your skin is dry. Pay attention to areas like the knees and elbows where tan can build up. Use lotion or oil to trap the moisture in your skin after your shower. Allow it to fully absorb into your skin over an hour or so before you apply the self-tanner. Try to exfoliate at least 8 hours before applying the tanner. This gives your skin's pH time to neutralize, which will help the color develop.

The palms of your hands don't naturally tan, so if you get self-tanner on them it'll be a dead giveaway that your tan came from a bottle instead of the sun's rays. If you don't have latex gloves or a tanning mitt handy, you can wash your hands with soapy water throughout the process to remove self-tanner. You may also want to protect your bathroom surfaces by putting down an old sheet or a plastic tarp and applying the self-tanner while standing on it. Keep nice towels and other items out of the way.

Squeeze a small amount of tanning product into the palm of your hand. Spread the tanner over your skin in broad circular motions. Follow the instructions that came with your formula to determine how long to rub it in. Apply it to one body part at a time so you can be sure not to miss any spots. [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you're using a spray tanner, follow the directions regarding how far you should hold the can from your body and how long you should spray any given area. Holding it too close or spraying too long could result in an uneven tan. Around your feet, spread the tanner from your legs onto your ankles and the tops of your feet, and use as little as possible in this area. Don't apply any to your toes, heels, or the sides of your feet, since these areas don't tan much naturally. It may be a good idea to use a makeup brush for this step, so you can really blend it in well. If you're applying it to your back, use a strap or a band for even application. Better yet, ask a friend to help you out. If you aren't wearing gloves, use a timer and make sure you wash your hands every five minutes, scrubbing under and around the nails. While most people don't have tanned underarms, avoiding that area can be difficult, so it's better to apply self tanner there and lightly wipe with a damp washcloth about five minutes later."

Any type of regular moisturizing lotion works well. Apply a very small amount of regular lotion to the tops of your feet (if you are using gloves, rinse them in water and dry them to ensure no additional tan will mix in with the moisturiser, or wash hands afterwards) and blend it with the tanner that you've already applied around your ankles. Apply a small amount of regular lotion around your knees, especially just below the knee. Do the same thing to your elbows, especially the part that puckers when your arm is straight.
