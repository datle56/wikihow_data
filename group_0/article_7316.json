Each sign is fixed to an element, which can affect compatibility. For example, fire shapes metal, therefore, a Fire Horse could enhance a Wood Tiger’s life with their fiery passion. Similarly, a Water Pig could put out a Snake’s flame, leading to incompatibility. There are two types of elemental associations in the Chinese Zodiac: the element your animal is associated with and the element the 12-year cycle you were born in is associated with.

The lunar calendar is different from the Gregorian calendar in that the former includes the lunar phases, while the latter does not. For example, if you were born on January 20, 1986, you would not be considered a Tiger, even though 1986 is the year of the Tiger, because the lunar year started on February 9, 1986.
