Then, go to a route with a thunderstorm and encounter them in the grass. You can find a route with a thunderstorm by looking at the bulletin board at a route gate and seeing which route there is a thunderstorm at. [1] X Research source Tornadus and Thundurus run away when you encounter them, so have a pokémon with Mean Look to prevent them from running away.

So, you have to trade with someone who has the opposite game to get the other legendary. Trade by going to the top floor of a Pokémon Center and talking to one of the women there to enter the Union Room. [2] X Research source Note : You have to do a local trade, as Wi-Fi trades are no longer supported in Pokémon Black and White. Just be in the same room as the friend you’re trading with before entering the Union Room."

Go up the waterfall and hop onto the cliff to the left of the river. Go to the left-hand side of the cliff and head down the waterfall. Then, hop onto the land on the left and head inside the forest. [4] X Research source Make sure you have a Pokémon in your party that knows Surf and Waterfall."

Then, talk to him to start the battle and catch him. [5] X Research source Stock up on Ultra Balls (or Dusk Balls if you’re catching Landorus at night) before you start the encounter. Landorus is difficult to catch, so it might take quite a few pokéballs before you get him! Landorus is at level 70, so make sure you have a high-level pokémon that can fight him. Weaken Landorus to make him easier to catch. Landorus is a Ground and Flying-type, so aim to use Ice moves, which are super effective against both types. If you accidentally defeat Landorus before catching him, he will reappear again after you beat the Elite 4 and Champion."

Depending on the time of day, walk back and forth between one of these routes until you see that it’s storming. [8] X Research source Day : Tornadus and Thundurus only appear on routes 4, 5, and 16. Day is usually between 10am to 6pm, though it varies depending on the season. Night : Tornadus and Thundurus only appear on routes 12, 13, 14, and 15. Night is usually between 12am to 5am. Morning : Tornadus and Thundurus only appear on routes 2, 3, and 18. Morning is usually 5am to 10am. Another way to find Tornadus or Thundurus is to check the bulletin board inside a route gate. It’ll notify you that a certain route has stormy weather, which means Tornadus or Thundurus is on that route."

[10] X Research source Pokémon that can learn Mean Look : Patrat/Watchog, Yamask/Cofagrigus Make sure your pokémon has a high speed stat to help ensure that it goes first. To increase your pokémon’s speed, give it X-Speed or the Quick Claw item."

Then, put them to sleep or paralyze them—this also helps increase your odds of catching them. [11] X Research source Tornadus and Thundurus are at level 40, so make sure you have a pokémon that’s at a similar level. If Tornadus or Thundurus manages to run away, their HP and status condition will be the same when you encounter them again. To quickly lower Tornadus or Thundurus’ HP use the move False Swipe. This move always lowers a pokémon’s HP to 1. Pokémon that can learn False Swipe: Leavanny, Axew/Fraxure/Haxorus Pokémon that can learn sleep moves : Patrat/Watchog, Foongus/Amoonguss, Munna, Sigilyph, Petilil (White only) Pokémon that can learn paralysis moves : Cottonee (Black only), Petilil (White only), Blitzle, Joltik/Galvantula, Tynamo/Eelektrik"

[12] X Research source If you’re battling Tornadus or Thundurus at night, use Dusk Balls for an extra boost—they have a 3.5x bonus catch rate. [13] X Research source Alternatively, use a Quick Ball as soon as you start the battle with Tornadus or Thundurus. Quick Balls have a 5x bonus catch rate if you use one on your first turn of the encounter. [14] X Research source Another option is to use the Master Ball, since Tornadus and Thundurus are the only roaming legendaries in the game (and thus more difficult to catch). It may take a few tries to catch Tornadus or Thundurus—like all legendary pokémon, they have a lower capture rate. If they manage to run away, simply find the stormy route again and run into the tall grass to encounter them."
