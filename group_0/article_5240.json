      "content": "Select a VPN. Like proxies, there are countless Virtual Private Network (VPN) services available. Popular ones include NordVPN and ExpressVPN, but you're free to choose the one that fits your needs (and price range if you plan on purchasing a membership). If the firewall or Internet filter that you're attempting to bypass is on a library, work, or school computer, you most likely won't be able to use a VPN since doing so will require changing your computer's settings. Unlike proxies, VPNs will hide any online browsing while they are active. Most VPNs are free to test, but eventually cost a small monthly fee (or a discounted annual one)."
