Potatoes may also be baked at lower temperatures for longer times. This process tends to give the outside of the spud a crisper skin. [2] X Research source 350 °F (177 °C) for approximately 90 minutes or 375 °F (191 °C) for approximately 75 minutes is a good guideline. Cooking times will vary. Not all potatoes are uniform in size and mass, making these cooking times a guideline , not a rule . Perform the fork test to figure out if the potato has reached the doneness you want."
