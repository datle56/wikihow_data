      "content": "Select oils that are 100% pure. Research the brands you see in stores and online and read reviews. Look for an oil with 100% purity. Don’t use an oil that is mixed or altered with something else. [2] X Research source Don’t confuse essential oils with fragrance oils. Essential oils are extracted directly from plant materials. [3] X Research source Essential oils are not really oils. They are highly concentrated aromatic compounds extracted from plants. This makes them unique from fragrance oils, which are created specifically to smell good. Essential oils should come in dark tinted bottles as exposure to light can degrade their chemical structures. Look for the Latin names of the plants on the bottles as this will let you know exactly what you are getting. Check the scent of the oil. If it doesn’t smell good or it differs from what you expected, it may not be a high-quality preparation."

Cinnamon bark, for example, has been shown to cause allergic reactions in people who have seasonal allergies. [5] X Research source"

These are great for when you are working under a deadline or are simply struggling to get your mind in order. Rosemary oil is a nice option for these situations.

Tea tree oil, for example, has antimicrobial properties, but it has a very woodsy smell that you may not want in your home. Other oils, like peppermint, for example, will smell nice in addition to any aromatherapy effects you might experience. [9] X Research source Try adding a few drops of an oil that smells good, like lavender, to your preparation to improve the overall effect. Rose essential oil is associated with reducing stress and anxiety.

Always exercise caution when evaluating health claims about essential oils, because there is currently little evidence for their effectiveness. The vast majority of essential oils are not very expensive and should not cost a fortune. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a traditional candle burner for its simplicity. Traditional oil burners are two-tiered ceramic pieces made up of a small bowl-shaped top where you put your oil, and a bottom section where you place a small, tea-light candle. [15] X Research source Oil burners of this type are inexpensive, easy to find in stores or online from retailers that sell home goods or health and beauty supplies. You can even find these in some grocery stores. Look for a burner that has a deep bowl so the contents won’t evaporate too quickly. [16] X Research source"

Some burners have an inner lip, which is a good indicator to use when you’re filling the bowl.

[19] X Research source If you’re mixing oils, keep the total number of drops to 10 or less as you don’t want to overdo it. You can always add more later if you think the aroma is not strong enough. Experiment to find the concentration of oil to water that you like best."

Never leave an open flame unattended and keep the burner out of reach of pets and children."

      "content": "Wash your burner in between uses to prevent residue build-up. Wipe out the bowl of your burner with a tissue dampened with rubbing alcohol. [22] X Research source This will remove oil residue, leaving your burner fresh and scent-free for the next time you want to use it. If left unwashed, your burner will soak up the essential oil residues that are left behind. [23] X Research source Built-up residue contributes to an accumulation of scents that will ultimately make the burner unusable for different oils. Leaving your burner unwashed may also result in an unpleasant burnt smell when you use it."

      "content": "Look for a ceramic burner that uses a low heat. A burner that uses a small lightbulb as a heating element can be a good option, as the warmer will only get as hot as the lightbulb allows. Other models involve sitting a ceramic bowl on top of a heating element, sometimes referred to as a candle warmer or wax warmer. [24] X Research source Electric burners eliminate the need for an open flame, but electrical hazards can still cause fire risks and the heating element can cause burns. Operate these with care and never leave them unattended. [25] X Research source Avoid using an extension cord as this increases the risk of fire. Choose a burner that has a cord that is long enough to reach your outlet. Do not place more than three electrical appliances into any one outlet at a time. It’s also a good idea to unplug your burner when it’s not in use."

      "content": "Turn on your burner by plugging it in. Instead of lighting a candle, your electric burner will need to be plugged into a working electrical socket. Some burner models may also have an “off/on” switch somewhere on their cord. Check to see if this is the case and make sure you turn it to the on position. [27] X Research source Don’t burn your oils for more than an hour or so at a time. Cycle between periods of burning and not burning so that you don’t overwhelm your space with too much oil."

Use a tissue or cloth dampened with rubbing alcohol to wipe out the bowl. [28] X Research source Turn off and unplug your burner before cleaning it. Leave it to cool for 15-20 minutes after turning it off before you attempt to clean it as it could cause burns. To remove built-up residue that you missed, try a mixture of 2-3 drops of lemon essential oil, 2 tablespoons (28.8 g) of baking soda and ½ tablespoon (7.5 mL) of water. Spread this over the affected area and let it sit for 5 minutes before wiping clean with a sponge."

      "content": "Buy clean-burning essential oil candles to prevent indoor air pollution. Whether you’re shopping in a store or online, look for candles that are made with pure essential oils (not just fragrance). Also select candles that are made from beeswax or soybeans, not paraffin (a petroleum byproduct). [29] X Research source Also check for a “lead-free” label when you purchase candles. Look for cotton wicks when you are shopping for candles. Keep your wicks trimmed to 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm). This lessens the amount of soot the candle produces while it’s burning."

Extinguish the flame and then add 3-5 drops of your essential oils into the wax. Stir with a toothpick and allow the wax to cool and harden again. [30] X Research source Experiment with the concentration of essential oil in your DIY candles until you get the result you want."

      "title": "Burn your candles long enough for it to melt all the way across.",
      "content": "Burn your candles long enough for it to melt all the way across. Whether you are using a store-bought or homemade candle, you want to burn it long enough for the entire top layer of wax to melt. This will ensure that your candle burns evenly and will last as long as possible. [31] X Research source Look for candles with multiple wicks. This will help speed up the melting process, diffusing oils more quickly and efficiently. Just like with oil burners, don’t burn your candles all day long, every day as this can have negative health effects. Burn until the wax is evenly melted, then take a break. The exact times will vary based on the size of your candle."
