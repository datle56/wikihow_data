[1] X Research source The easiest way to increase the odds of abduction is to keep your Sims awake during this time and keep them on their home lot. It's possible that Sims who are outside in the yard are more likely to be abducted. Set up activities for your Sims outside and have them visit each night."

      "title": "Use a telescope.",
      "content": "Use a telescope. Buy a telescope in Buy mode. Have your Sims interact with it to \"Stargaze\" or \"Look Through\" to increase the odds of alien abduction the same night. If a Sim has a few points in Logic, she can use the \"Search Galaxy\" option, which might increase it even more."

      "content": "Collect space rocks. Keeping space rocks in your lot increases the odds of an alien visit, but it's possible that actively collecting rocks or keeping them in the inventory is what adds to the chance of an abduction that night. [2] X Research source Rarely, you can find space rocks using a telescope or just noticing them on the ground, but using Lifetime Points to get the Collection Helper will greatly increase your ability to find these. If you have the Pets expansion, dogs may occasionally find space rocks as well."

      "content": "Wait for the Sim to return. The \"Abducted\" moodlet will typically last several game hours, after which the Sim will return. Non-occult male Sims sometimes get the \"Unexpected Weight Gain\" moodlet immediately after returning, which means they are pregnant. If you are trying to get a male Sim pregnant, save before the \"Abducted\" moodlet wears off, and reload if the moodlet wears off without being replaced by \"Unexpected Weight Gain.\""

You will be prompted to make a decision and can either send it back to its homeworld or raise it yourself. Despite the human father, the baby will be 100% alien. [3] X Research source It can be raised as an ordinary baby would, but will grow up into an alien with special powers. Non-human Sims and female Sims cannot have an alien baby from an abduction."

This resource can be used for a variety of powers: [6] X Research source Interact with other Sims to restore energy, learn their personality, or mind control Sims from other households.

[7] X Research source A Sim with enough Handiness can perform two upgrades: [8] X Research source The laser upgrade allows the car to invade other households, shooting lasers that singe off clothing. The space travel upgrade allows Sims to embark on space adventures. These \"disappear\" your Sim for a while, and give you text updates describing the adventure and result."

[9] X Research source These powers might only show up once the baby grows up, however. [10] X Research source Even supernaturals like Fairies & Werewolves can reproduce with aliens. The children will have a mix of alien and supernatural features, but no alien powers."
