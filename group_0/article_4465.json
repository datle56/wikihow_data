They make you feel comfortable being yourself around them. They support you. They keep in contact with you all the time and not just when they want something.

Use you to climb up a particular social chain. Use you to get close to someone you are close to. Copy your work or use your intelligence. Try to get some sort of information from you.

If you feel that your friend has changed, or that you are growing distant from each other, it may be a sign that your friendship is fading out. [3] X Research source Even if you used to be close friends, people grow apart. Don't fight that growth, just be glad for the good times you spent together. [4] X Research source If you feel you are growing apart as friends, you may not have to proceed through a formal break-up. You may choose to just let the friendship naturally fade. This may be a good alternative option to take if you feel like there is no strong reason you don't get along. Especially, if it's just that you have developed different interests and different groups of friends."

Removing the benefit may go against your nature or personality if you tend to be a “people-pleaser,” but your fake friend may be taking advantage of you.

If you think they are trying to copy your work, make it impossible for them by moving your seat or not letting them see your work. [6] X Research source If you believe they are using you to get to someone else, keep contact with the person while the fake friend isn't around. If they only call you when they want something, deny whatever their request is. You could even tell them that you won’t be able to fulfill their request in the future either. For example, “Jenny, I know I’ve been giving you rides to work for the past month, but I’m not able to do that anymore.”"

[7] X Research source Politely decline invitations to hang out by saying “I'm sorry, I can't right now.” The purpose is to give yourself a little space free from the stress of a fake friendship, while you figure out how to end the relationship with them. [8] X Research source Try to avoid outright ignoring them or giving them the “silent treatment.” Those are perceived as immature and will likely cause an angry reaction from the fake friend and drama with any mutual friends you have."

If you really want to end the friendship, you should be able to think of several reasons why this friendship makes you unhappy and why you think you would be healthier without this friend around.

You may be dreading it, but try and rise above those emotions and face the situation with maturity. Remember that at one time you were friends, and you may have to interact with this person in the future, so try and be as respectful as possible throughout this process. Avoid breaking up with them over the phone. The only way this is acceptable is if you cannot see the person face to face for a long time, or if you are concerned about violent behaviors or your safety. Don't end your friendship with them over text or e-mail. It sends the wrong message about you as a person and how you deal with your friends.

It can potentially be a very emotional time and that shouldn't have to occur somewhere where you could draw an audience. Make sure you are both calm and that you are not having the conversation right before something very important such as a test or a performance review at your job.

Organizing your thoughts beforehand allows you be clear, firm, and thorough. Make sure you are clear in your communication with your friend. There should not be any doubt in their minds about what you were trying to say after meeting with you. Be firm about what you want and what you don't want in your friendships, and in this friendship going forward. Be thorough and make sure you are communicating everything you want to say and everything you feel during this conversation. Planning this out will help you avoid the instance of “I should have said this!” later on. When planning what you are going to say, find a good balance between being honest, and being kind. Try to avoid blaming or being unnecessarily mean to your soon-to-be-ex friend."

If your boyfriend cheated on you with your friend, “I feel like I cannot trust you, and I'm hurt that someone who considered themselves my friend would do that to me.” If they constantly make fun or you, or make you feel bad about yourself, “I feel like spending time with you is not healthy for me and my self-esteem because of some of the things you say about me.”"

It is possible that they may experience all three. Try and hear them out. Address anything that might come up like any misunderstandings or anything that might change the way you feel about breaking up with them. Avoid getting into an argument with them at this point. If they respond with anger, they are likely to begin to say hurtful things to you or to try and blame you. Don't engage with them, simply tell them “I'm sorry you feel that way.”"

I'm sorry this worked out this way.” If they are apologetic, see how you feel and consider whether or not you might want to try to repair the friendship .

Having your boundaries set before hand will make it easier to stick to them later on. If you have mutual friends, suggest that maybe you two should only hang out in groups. If you would prefer to never have contact with them again, than that is fine too. Let them know that you would prefer they do not contact you going forward.

Ashley and I are not friends any longer. We talked about it and I think we each got to say what we needed to say. I'm only telling you this because I don't want you to feel uncomfortable about it, or put in the middle.”"
