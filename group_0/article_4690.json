      "content": "Gather together the materials you will need to make a tunnel. You will need several empty toilet paper tubes, bedding, some small cardboard boxes, and a cutting instrument (knife, scissors, box cutter).Make a Fun Hamster Tube Town Instead of cardboard boxes, you could also use shoe boxes, milk cartons, or empty boxes of tea. Because these boxes are not transparent, you will not be able to easily see your hamster once he's inside the tunnel. Even if you can't see him, trust that he's having fun in there!"

Use non-toxic glue to attach the tubes to each other, if necessary. Use non-toxic glue to attach cloth to the inside of the walkway. The cloth will give your hamster extra traction so that he can easily walk up and down the tube. Do not make the incline so steep that your hamster will have trouble walking up or down the tube."
