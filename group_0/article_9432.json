      "content": "Be sincere and include a return envelope to get a response. Briefly introduce yourself and explain how Katt has impacted you. Whether he inspired you to become a stand-up comedian or pursue an acting career, get specific about what you love about him. Finish off with a polite request to return your letter, send an autograph , or answer one of your burning questions. [3] X Research source When writing fan mail , use conversational language to showcase your personality, and feel free to throw in a few jokes to make Katt laugh. To make your letter stand out (and increase the likelihood of it being read), put it in a brightly-colored envelope or decorate the outside with stamps and stickers. Be genuine to make your letter more meaningful. For example, instead of saying “You're so funny,” you could say, “I couldn’t stop laughing for 20 minutes after finishing Woke Foke on Netflix. All the references you made were EPIC!” If you’re requesting an autograph, send your photo in a properly stamped and self-addressed envelope. It typically takes 3+ months for a response, so try your best to be patient. [4] X Research source"
