      "title": "Get the correct brake pads.",
      "content": "Get the correct brake pads. Pads are available at any auto parts store or your local car dealership. Just let them know the year, make and model of your car and select a pad in your price range. In general, the more expensive they are, the longer they last. Some very expensive pads with a higher-than-desirable metal content may be aimed at the 'Rally' market for use with performance Rotors. You'll probably want to avoid these because they are likely to cause premature wear of standard Rotors. Also, some people find that less expensive pads are noisier than \"brand name\" pads."

      "title": "Loosen the lug nuts.",
      "content": "Loosen the lug nuts. Using the lug wrench provided along with the car's jack, loosen each of the lug nuts that hold the wheels onto the car about two-thirds of the way. Don't loosen all the tires at once. Generally, you'll change at least the two front pads or the two back pads, depending on your car and how evenly the brakes wear. So either start with the front or the back."

      "content": "Carefully jack the car up until it can be removed comfortably. Consult your owner's manual to determine the correct position for the car jack under your car. Put some blocks behind the other wheels to stop the car from rolling forward or back. Place a jack stand under the frame of the vehicle. Do NOT trust the jack alone. Repeat for the other side of the car so that both sides are securely supported."

      "title": "Remove the wheels.",
      "content": "Remove the wheels. Finish loosening and removing the lug nuts when the car is raised. Pull the wheel straight out towards you to remove it. If the wheel rims are alloy and on the studs, you should clean the studs, stud holes, rotor mounting surface, and the rear mounting surface of the alloy wheel with a wire brush and apply anti-seize compound before refitting the wheel."

      "title": "Remove the caliper bolts using the correct size of socket or ring spanner.",
      "content": "Remove the caliper bolts using the correct size of socket or ring spanner. The caliper fits over the brake rotor like a clamp and its job is to slow the wheel using hydraulic pressure. The brake pads will create friction with the rotors to slow the vehicle to a stop. Calipers generally come in one-piece or two-piece designs, secured with between two and four bolts at the inside of the stub axle housing, where the tire fits onto the axle. Spray these bolts with WD-40 or PB Penetrating Catalyst to aid in removing them. Check the caliper pressure. The caliper of a car at rest should move back and forth a little bit. If not, the caliper is under pressure and it may fly off when you remove the bolts. Take extra precaution when checking to keep your body to the side of its path, even if it is loose. Check to see if there are any shims or performance washers fitted between the caliper mounting bolts and the mounting surface. If there are, remove them and keep track of them to replace them later. You will need to refit the caliper without the brake pads and measure the distance from the mounting surface to the brake pad to replace them appropriately. Many Japanese vehicles use a two-piece sliding caliper that only requires the removal of two forward-facing slider bolts, with 12-14mm heads. You will not need to remove the entire caliper."

      "content": "Remove the old pads. Finally! Note how each brake pad is attached. They typically snap or clip in with attached metal clips. Remove both pads. They may take a little force to pop out, so take care not to damage the caliper or brake line while getting them out. Inspect brake rotors for warped, heat damage, or cracks to the surface and replace them as needed. Rotors are recommended to be replaced or resurfaced during brake pad replacements."

      "title": "Put the new pads on.",
      "content": "Put the new pads on. At this point, you can spread anti-seize lubricant on the metal contact edges and the back of the pads. This will prevent a lot of squeaking. However, do not get any lubricant onto the inside of the brake pads. If any lubricant touches that material, the brake will not provide friction and will be useless. Attach the new pads exactly the way the old ones were attached."

Tighten one lug nut, then one across from it until each nut is fully tightened to torque specification. Check the owner's manual to find the torque specifications for your vehicle. This will ensure the lugs have been tightened enough to prevent the wheel from coming off or over-tightening."

      "title": "Test your new brake pads.",
      "content": "Test your new brake pads. Going no more than 5 mph (8.0 km/h) on a quiet residential street, brake like normal. If the vehicle seems to stopping normally, repeat the test and go up to 10 mph (16 km/h). Repeat several more times, gradually going up to 35 or 40 mph (56 or 64 km/h). Also, check in reverse. These braking tests ensure there are no issues with your brake-pad installation, give you confidence when driving on main streets, and help \"seat\" the brake pads into place. Listen for problems. The new pads may squeak a bit, but if you should hear a grinding, metal-on-metal sound, you probably have the brake pads reversed (i.e., the inside surface is incorrectly facing out). This should be corrected immediately."

      "content": "Remove the cap from the brake master cylinder. [1] X Research source Brake fluid will become contaminated with dirt and other particulate from the air and the mechanics of the car. It will also absorb moisture from the air, dangerously lowering its boiling point. You'll need to bleed the brake fluid from the system before changing your pads and calipers, but you'll also (counterintuitively, perhaps) want to make sure the fluid is topped off before you do this. Check the fill line and add a little if you need to. Leave the cap off while you bleed the system. The reason you need to add fluid is that you're bleeding the fluid from the calipers themselves--the fluid trapped in the line--and you still need a steady supply in the master cylinder."

      "content": "Determine the sequence of the bleed. Generally, you want to bleed the brake most distant from the master cylinder first, so you'll need to check the owner's manual before you do this. All cars differ in the particular order.

They should shout to you to let you know they're feeling resistance, at which point you should unscrew the bleeder screw slightly and tell them to hold the brake down. The fluid should drain down the hose into the bottle or pan at this point. Screw the bleeder screw back in when your friend's foot touches the floor. Repeat this process until you see no air bubbles in the tube. [3] X Research source"
