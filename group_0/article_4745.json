      "content": "Set a realistic working budget for your project. The number you come up with will ultimately depend on what kind of disposable income you have, as well as the amount you’re willing to take out in loans. Devising a practical budget is key to focusing your vision and setting your sights on a plan you love that won’t leave you drowning in debt. When building your own home with the aid of a build contractor, you can expect to pay as much or more than you would if you were buying a house that’s already on the market. Every home is a little different, but for a 2,800 square foot single-family house, you’re looking at an average cost of around $290,000. That figure will only go up as you increase the square footage or add extra amenities."

Start looking around for suitable places to build, keeping your preferences and financial limitations in mind, as well as the residential zoning laws for the area. [1] X Research source In many parts of the US, it’s possible to purchase a few acres of land for $20,000-50,000. [2] X Research source Quiet rural and suburban areas are especially popular among owner-builders Another option is to buy a lot in an existing development, then have your home built to your own specs. Just be sure to check with the owner of the development to find out if there particular building regulations in place that you might need to know about."

      "content": "Apply for a construction loan to get the money you need to build. Once you’ve picked out the perfect spot for your new home, talk to a loan adviser at your bank about getting a construction loan to help you pay for it. With a construction loan, the bank will front you all or part of the cost for the property with the understanding that you’ll pay it back once your home is finished. [3] X Research source Don’t forget to bring a copy of your budget to the bank with you when you go in for your meeting. Securing a construction loan will allow you to take a piece of land off the market so that someone else can’t buy it before you do. It also gives you time to draw up a house plan and submit it to your local authority for approval."

Research realtors and agents in your area and take some time to read customer testimonials to find one that comes recommended. Building a house is a complex project. For this reason, it’s strongly recommended that you have someone in your corner to help you navigate the many legal and financial details involved.

They’ll communicate your wishes to your architect and building team, offer valuable cost-cutting advice, and take care of complicated legal tasks for you.

      "content": "Draw up or purchase a detailed house plan. If you have prior experience building homes, you can design your own custom floorplan. Otherwise, your best bet is to go online and browse ready-made house plans until you find one that calls to you. Plans like these make excellent templates—you can always modify them later on to get everything exactly the way you want it. When selecting a house plan, be sure to consider factors like overall size, number of levels, and the general convenience and accessibility of the layout. Features like these will be especially important if you have a family. Premade house plans are most often priced by scale and level of detail. In general, you can expect to pay anywhere from $700 to $1,500 if you decide to buy a template online. Your house plan will be the blueprint for your new home. You and your building team will be referring back to it every step of the way, so it’s important to make sure that everything is in place."

While hiring an architect isn’t a necessity, it can be a big help if you feel like you’re in over your head with the design process. An architect can help you refine your building plans and deal directly with the building team to make sure construction runs smoothly. [7] X Research source If you don’t need an architect to hold your hand throughout the entire project, you also have the option of paying them for various services individually. Some architects charge an hourly or daily rate, while others claim a fixed percentage of the total cost of construction, typically 5-15%. [8] X Research source"

If your plans are approved, you’ll be notified by phone or email and later receive a copy of the building permit by mail.

To ensure that your breakdown is as precise as possible, it should include not only the costs associated with general construction, but also secondary expenses such as painting, landscaping, and decorating. [9] X Research source It may help to create a chart dividing construction up into phases. Your first column could include land costs, building permits, and inspection fees, the next would contain foundation, framing, and roofing, and the later columns could be used to record the small finishing details. Go over your cost estimate with your realtor or buying agent to make sure that everything is accounted for. Be prepared to make adjustments if your breakdown doesn’t fit your working budget."

You’ll sleep better at night knowing that you’re off the hook in case of an emergency. [16] X Research source Ask your contractor for a copy of their policy to see what kind of protection it offers.

A basic builder’s insurance policy may run you $1,000-5,000 per year, depending on where you’re building and how big your project it.

Once there’s a frame to work with, flooring, siding, and roofing subcontractors will be brought in to install your home’s main exterior surfaces. These rough surfaces are known collectively as “sheathing.” As soon as the sheathing is in place, your builders will surround the entire structure with house wrap, which is a type of waterproof barrier designed to prevent mold and moisture damage. Roofing is an extensive job in itself, and will typically take longer to complete and inspect than the rest of the sheathing. [21] X Research source This is also when the outlines for exterior openings like doors and windows will be cut. Depending on how your contractor prefers to do things, they may opt to go ahead and install the siding and other exterior detailing immediately after the sheathing is done.
