      "title": "Brush your boots with a suede brush to remove dirt and dust.",
      "content": "Brush your boots with a suede brush to remove dirt and dust. Before you wash your Ugg boots, use a soft suede brush to sweep away any dirt, mud, dust, or other debris from the surface. The suede brush will also help lift the nap on your suede, which will make it easier to get your boots completely clean. [1] X Research source You can buy a suede cleaning kit from most big-box stores, shoe stores, or specialty leather shops. Typically, they come with a suede brush, a rubber eraser, and suede cleaner. The kit may also contain a sponge. Ugg also sells its own cleaning and conditioning kit."

      "title": "Dampen your shoes with a sponge dipped in cold water.",
      "content": "Dampen your shoes with a sponge dipped in cold water. Wet your sponge, then squeeze it well to remove as much of the excess water as possible. Then, dab the sponge across your shoes until the surface is completely damp. [2] X Research source Do not soak your shoes, as too much water could also cause the sheepskin to separate from the wool. [3] X Research source If you don’t have a sponge, use a clean, soft cloth."

    {
      "title": "Apply suede cleaner to your sponge and gently scrub your shoes.",
      "content": "Apply suede cleaner to your sponge and gently scrub your shoes. Squeeze or spray just a little of your suede cleaner onto the sponge, then start scrubbing your Ugg boots with a gentle circular motion. Add more cleaner a little at a time as you work your way over the entire surface of the shoe. [4] X Research source Remember, it’s always better to add more cleaner as you need it, rather than using too much at once. Do not apply the cleaner directly onto your Ugg boots. Some people like to make their own cleaner out of equal parts vinegar and water. However, keep in mind that this can discolor your Uggs."

    {
      "title": "Rinse out your sponge and blot away the soapy water.",
      "content": "Rinse out your sponge and blot away the soapy water. Once you’ve gotten your shoes clean, rinse your sponge and wring it out again, then dab away the cleaner, using the same circular motions as before. Continue doing this until all of the soapy dirt is gone from the surface of the boots. [5] X Research source Suede cleaner will also condition the material, which is why you don’t need to rinse it completely away."

    {
      "title": "Blot the shoes dry with a separate soft, white cloth.",
      "content": "Blot the shoes dry with a separate soft, white cloth. Use a clean, soft cloth, like a microfiber towel, to blot up as much of the remaining water as possible. It’s a good idea to use a white cloth for this to ensure no dye transfers onto your Uggs. [6] X Research source If you notice a lot of dirt on the cloth, you may need to go back over the boots with your sponge."

      "title": "Stuff your boots with paper towels so they'll retain their shape.",
      "content": "Stuff your boots with paper towels so they'll retain their shape. Sheepskin can easily lose its shape when it’s wet, even if it seems just barely damp. To help your Ugg boots preserve their shape, stuff them with balled-up paper towels, newspaper, or something similar. Be sure to fill the toes as well as the shaft of the boot. [7] X Research source You can also use butcher paper or clean hand towels, if you prefer."

      "title": "Allow the shoes to air dry for 24 hours in cool, ventilated area.",
      "content": "Allow the shoes to air dry for 24 hours in cool, ventilated area. The best way to dry your Uggs is to allow them to dry naturally in a cool place with good air circulation, like the corner of a room. Do not put your shoes under direct heat, such as placing them in the dryer, heating them with a hairdryer, or storing them in front of a radiator. Also, avoid placing your shoes in direct sunlight. [8] X Research source Sunlight and heat could shrink the sheepskin, causing it to crack. They could also fade your boots. If you have a boot dryer, you can use that to help speed up the process. Boot dryers use room-temperature air, so they’re more gentle than using heated dryers."

      "title": "Brush the shoes in a single direction to raise the pile.",
      "content": "Brush the shoes in a single direction to raise the pile. Once your boots are dry, the suede may have a somewhat flat look. Take your suede brush and start at the top of the shoe, brushing downward toward the toe. Continue doing this, always moving the brush in the same direction, until you’ve brushed the whole boot. [9] X Research source The pile refers to the fuzzy surface on your suede boots."

      "title": "Rub chalk on your shoes if you have an oil stain.",
      "content": "Rub chalk on your shoes if you have an oil stain. If you got cooking oil, makeup, or another oily substance on your Ugg boots, draw over the stain with a piece of plain white chalk. Let the chalk stay in place overnight, then dust it away the next morning with a soft- or medium-bristled brush. The powder should soak up the stain, but if there's still some remaining, repeat the process until the stain is gone. [10] X Expert Source Marc Sigal Shoe Care Specialist Expert Interview. 15 January 2020. You can also cover the stain with talcum powder or cornstarch. Let it sit in place overnight, then dust off the powder with your suede brush. If you can still see the oil, reapply a fresh layer of baby powder. Keep doing this until the stain is gone.

      "content": "Rub away scuff marks and dirt with a suede eraser. If your kit came with a rubber eraser, rub the end of it against any stains or scuff marks on your Ugg boots. Often, this will lift minor stains, which will reduce how much scrubbing you have to do once you wet your shoes. [12] X Research source If you don’t have a suede eraser, you can use a regular white rubber eraser. However, don’t use a colored eraser, as it could leave stains on your boots."

      "content": "Take your shoes to be professionally cleaned if they get salt stains. Wiping your shoes with a damp cloth after you wear them can help prevent salt stains, but if you do end up with these light-colored marks on your shoes, you probably need to take them to the dry cleaner’s. Most home remedies for removing salt stains, like cleaning your boots with vinegar, can discolor or damage the suede. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour baking soda or cornstarch into your Uggs to deodorize them. If you’ve been wearing your Uggs for a while, they may start to develop an odor, especially if you wear them without socks. To get rid of any unpleasant smells, pour a few spoonfuls of baking soda or cornstarch into the bottom of your shoe. Shake the boot around to distribute the baking soda evenly and leave it overnight. You can also combine baking soda and cornstarch, if you’d like. Shake out the excess powder before you wear the shoes, or use a small vacuum, if you have one.

      "content": "Treat your shoes with a protective suede spray when you first get them. The best way to keep your Ugg boots looking fresh and new is to protect them from stains in the first place. Take your boots outdoors or to a well-ventilated area, then hold the can about 6 in (15 cm) away from the boots and spray them evenly. Wet the surface well, but do not soak the boots, then leave them in a cool, ventilated area for at least 24 hours. [17] X Research source Once the boots are dry, brush them with a suede brush to lift the pile. You can purchase suede protector from a big-box store, leather shop, or directly from Ugg."

      "content": "Avoid storing your shoes near direct heat or sunlight. Sunlight and heat can damage suede, causing it to discolor, shrink, and crack. Do not keep your Ugg boots in front of a heater or near a window where they’ll be exposed to full sunlight. [18] X Research source For instance, if your heater vent blows in a certain corner of your room, you wouldn’t want to store your boots there."

      "content": "Avoid wearing your shoes in deep water or snow. Although Ugg boots are very warm and are popular in the wintertime, they are not made to be weatherproof. If you’re wearing your Uggs and it’s raining or snowing, try not to walk through deep puddles or drifts of snow. If you do wear them when it’s rainy or snowy out, wipe off your boots with a damp cloth as soon as possible, and leave them to dry naturally. [19] X Research source Icy streets are often treated with salt. Since salt will leave stubborn stains that are difficult to remove without discoloring your shoes, it’s especially important to wipe them down as soon as possible if you’ve worn them in icy weather.

      "content": "Clean dried mud and dirt off of your boots as soon as possible. Just like any other material, the longer a stain sits on suede, the harder it will be to get out. If you get dirt or mud on your shoes, let it dry completely, then dust it away with your suede brush as soon as possible. If you need to, wash your shoes with suede cleaner and a damp sponge to get rid of any residue. [21] X Research source Allow your boots to air-dry after you clean them."
