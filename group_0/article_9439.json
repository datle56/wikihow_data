      "title": "Fill out the contact form on her website.",
      "content": "Fill out the contact form on her website. Theresa’s website has a “Contact” page, which is her preferred method for requesting a reading. The “Contact” page has a form for you to fill out. You should fill it out as completely as possible, with your name, email address, city, and phone number. You should also specify whether you’re looking for a private or group reading. [1] X Research source The form also has an area for you to leave a message to Theresa if you’d like. Not everyone who requests a reading gets one, so the message area is a good place to get her attention. Explain why you want a reading and who you’re hoping to reach."

    {
      "title": "Write her a letter.",
      "content": "Write her a letter. If you’d rather not use the online form, you can write Theresa a letter. This is probably the better method if you have a long story behind your desire for a reading. Make sure you still include your contact information, your name, and whether you want a private or group reading in case she wants to get in touch with you. [2] X Research source Send your letters to: Theresa Caputo, PO Box 490, Hicksville, NY 11802. Keep in mind that since this isn’t the preferred method of requesting a reading, it might taken longer to get a response, or you might not get one at all."

      "content": "Expect to wait up to 2 years for a reading. Theresa says right on her website that there is at least a 2 year wait for readings.

      "content": "Write her a letter. If you’re just looking to tell Theresa how much her show means to you, or an experience you’ve had at one of her live shows, you can write her a letter. You might not get a reply, but include your email address and mailing address in case she gets a chance to write back.
