      "content": "Simplify any terms inside the radicals when possible . To simplify the terms inside of the radicals, try to factor them to find at least one term that is a perfect square, such as 25 (5 x 5) or 9 (3 x 3). [1] X Research source Once you do that, then you can take the square root of the perfect square and write it outside the radical, leaving the remaining factor inside the radical. For this example, we are working with the problem 6√50 - 2√8 + 5√12 . The numbers outside the radical sign are the coefficients and the numbers inside it are the radicands. Here's how you simplify each of the terms: [2] X Research source 6√50 = 6√(25 x 2) = (6 x 5)√2 = 30√2. Here, you've factored \"50\" into \"25 x 2\" and then have pulled out the \"5\" from the perfect square, \"25\", and placed it outside of the radical, with the \"2\" remaining on the inside. Then, you multiplied \"5\" by \"6\", the number already outside the radical, to get 30 as the new coefficient. 2√8 = 2√(4 x 2) = (2 x 2)√2 = 4√2 . Here, you've factored \"8\" into \"4 x 2\" and then have pulled out the \"2\" from the perfect square \"4\" and placed it outside the radical, leaving the \"2\" on the inside. Then, you multiplied \"2\" by \"2\", the number already outside the radical, to get 4 as the new coefficient. 5√12 = 5√(4 x 3) = (5 x 2)√3 = 10√3 . Here, you've factored \"12\" into \"4 x 3\" and have pulled out the \"2\" from the perfect square \"4\" and placed it outside the radical, leaving the factor \"3\" on the inside. Then, you multiplied \"2\" by \"5\", the number already outside the radical, to get 10 as the new coefficient."

Since you can only add or subtract like terms, you should circle the terms that have the same radical, which in this example are 30√2 and 4√2 . You can think of this as being similar to adding or subtracting fractions, where you can only add or subtract the terms if the denominators are the same. [3] X Research source"

Now, all you have to do is to add or subtract the coefficients of the terms with the matching radicands and leave any additional terms as part of the equation. Do not combine the radicands. The idea is that you are saying how many of that type of radicand there are, total. The non-matching terms can stay as they are. [4] X Research source Here's what you do: [5] X Research source 30√2 - 4√2 + 10√3 = (30 - 4)√2 + 10√3 = 26√2 + 10√3"

Then, you can pull out a \"3\" from the perfect square, \"9,\" and make it the coefficient of the radical. So, √(45) = 3√5. [6] X Research source Now, just add up the coefficients of the two terms with matching radicands to get your answer. 3√5 + 4√5 = 7√5"

First you can factor out \"40\" to get \"4 x 10\", which makes 6√(40) = 6√(4 x 10) . Then, you can pull out a \"2\" from the perfect square, \"4,\" and then multiply it by the current coefficient. Now you've got 6√(4 x 10) = (6 x 2)√10. Multiply the two coefficients to get 12√10. Now, your problem reads 12√10 - 3√(10) + √5 . Since the first two terms have the same radicand, you can subtract the second term from the first and leave the third as it is. You're left with (12-3)√10 + √5 , which can be simplified to 9√10 + √5 ."

Now, as with a regular fraction, you can only add or subtract fractions that have the same numerator or denominator. Let's say you're working with this problem: (√2)/4 + (√2)/2. Here's what you do: Make it so these terms have the same denominator. The lowest common denominator, or the denominator that would be evenly divisible by both the denominators \"4\" and \"2,\" is \"4.\" [7] X Research source So, to make the second term, (√2)/2, have the denominator of 4, you need to multiply both its numerator and denominator by 2/2. (√2)/2 x 2/2 = (2√2)/4. Add up the numerators of the fractions while leaving the denominator the same. Do just what you would do if you were adding fractions. (√2)/4 + (2√2)/4 = 3√2)/4."
