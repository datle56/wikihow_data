To restore the glycogen (i.e., the stored energy) in your muscles and liver after the athletic event, consume 1-1.5 g of carbs per kg (2.2-3.3 g per lb) of your body weight 30 minutes after the event ends. Then eat the same amount of carbs again every 2 hours for 4-6 hours. [1] X Research source For example, if you weigh 68 kg (150 lb), you should eat 68-102 g of carbohydrates. That's roughly as much as you'd get if you calculated the carbs from 2-4 bananas."

[2] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source While you want to avoid consuming too many healthy fats and fiber during carb loading, it's important to reincorporate them back into your diet when the athletic event is over. Male athletes typically need 2400-3000 calories per day, while female athletes require 2200-2700 calories daily. Keep that in mind as you're planning your meals and snacks.

These have small amounts of fiber, so they won't slow down your digestive system. [4] X Research source For protein, opt for lean meats and eggs. Not all fats are good for us! Instead of cooking with oils that cause inflammation in high amounts, like corn or canola oil, try using avocado oil, olive oil, and coconut oil.

When you eat carbohydrates, your body converts them into glycogen, which stores energy in your muscles and liver. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Athletes consume more carbs than normal people because they burn through their glycogen stores more quickly. The idea behind carb loading is if an athlete eats even more carbs right before a long-distance event, like a marathon, they'll build up more glycogen – and more energy – to help them make it to the finish line."

This time frame gives your body plenty of time to convert the carbs you're consuming into glycogen and beef up your energy stores.

      "content": "Eat more carbs while eating fewer fatty and fiber-rich foods. Increase your carb intake from 6-10 g of carbs per kg (13.2-22 g per lb) of body weight to 8-12 g per kg (17.6-26.4 g per lb) of body weight while you're carb loading. At the same time, avoid consuming a lot of fatty foods and fiber. Too much fat will make you feel too full to eat more carbs and won't increase your muscles' energy stores. Meanwhile, large amounts of fiber may make you feel heavy and uncomfortable during your event. [12] X Research source Eat simple carbohydrates. Complex carbs (i.e., whole grain bread, pasta, rice, and potatoes) digest more slowly and may cause digestive discomfort. Simple carbs, like fruits and dairy products, digest quickly and convert to energy faster. Remember to eat protein! While you should avoid eating more protein than normal so you leave enough room for extra carbs, protein is still important to your overall health. Not only does it help balance out the effects of the carbs, but it can also help your muscles repair themselves and recover when your event is over. Avoid experimenting with new foods. Instead, eat foods you know settle well in your stomach. Certified personal trainer and nutritionist Pete Cerqua recommends not cutting out sweets completely if you're still used to having them. Avoid \"wiping out an entire food group\" or, Cerqua says, \"you're just gonna cave in and fail.\""

If you're concerned about eating too many calories, talk to a doctor or a licensed dietician and form an eating plan adapted to your body type and weight. Personal trainer Katie Prendergast, who specializes in training athletes, suggests downloading a food journal app like MyFitnessPal or something similar to keep track of your carbs and other macronutrients. Simply input the amount of each food you're eating in a meal, and the app \"automatically calculates how many grams of protein, carbs, and fats\" are in it. This makes counting calories way easier!"
