When you’ve been friends with a girl for a long time, you'll likely have a good idea of the qualities and characteristics she typically finds attractive in a person. If you have any of these qualities, emphasize them when you spend time with her. For example, if your friend finds humor to be an attractive quality and thinks you're funny, tell even more jokes when she's around. Similarly, if there are particular physical characteristics that your friend likes, wear clothes that emphasize that part of your body when you're together. While it’s good to accentuate qualities that you already have, it’s important that you don’t pretend to have certain qualities just to impress your friend. She will likely see through your ruse, and if she doesn’t, you'll be stuck pretending to be someone you aren't."
