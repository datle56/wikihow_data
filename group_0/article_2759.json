This will help you bond with the person you are listening to, and help you absorb what they are saying."

      "content": "Use the right language. Pay attention to both your words and your body language. You want to communicate that you are present and connected to your co-workers, friends, and family. This will make you a more effective communicator, and increase your mindfulness. Watch the words that you use in workplace conversations. When you use words like being \"swamped\" you are telling yourself and your co-worker that you are experiencing a negative situation. Be mindful, and use positive language. Try saying that your schedule is \"full\" instead. Breathing is an important part of your body language. If your breathing is erratic, it signals to your body and others that you are under stress.
