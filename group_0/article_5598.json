While you can tell them a particular address, remember that London taxi drivers are very well-versed in their city, and you can usually just tell them the name of the hotel, theater, restaurant, or landmark you’re headed to."

      "content": "Book a minicab online or on the phone. In London, “minicabs” are taxis that can only be booked online, by phone, or through ride apps like Uber; it is illegal to hail a minicab. Minicabs are much cheaper than black cabs, and many companies that offer black cab bookings will also offer minicabs. Minicab fares are not determined by meters, so make sure to ask what the fare is for your destination before booking a minicab. Like black cab drivers, minicab drivers do not expect large tips."
