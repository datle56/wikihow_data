      "content": "Be upfront about wanting something casual. Even on apps well-known for hookups, keep in mind that some people are looking for something more serious. The best way to find someone looking for the same thing you are—and avoid offending someone who isn’t—is to directly state that you’re only interested in hookups. Here are some things you might say: [1] X Research source “Here for a good time, not a long time.” “Only in town for the weekend. Just looking for some fun.” “Only here for hookups or friends with benefits. If you’re looking for something serious, I’m not your guy/girl.” “Looking to meet new people and have fun.” “Just got out of a relationship, not looking for a new one.” “I’m looking for some casual fun, nothing more.” Even if you state that you’re looking for hookups in your bio, it’s probably a good idea to tell your matches directly within a few messages. Some people swipe without reading bios, so you want to make sure you’re on the same page. Relationship expert John Keegan recommends being honest and direct. He says to do so “in a fun, flirty way” as you’re trying to seduce someone, and be “very clear that at the end, [a hookup] is what it will be.”"

      "content": "Be flirty to indicate you’re looking for something short-term. There’s nothing wrong with using suggestive or sensual language; in fact, it may help get your point across. Don’t be too vulgar, though, as this could make others uncomfortable and may result in them reporting your account. Try to keep your language PG-13 while flirting . Here are some lines to try: [2] X Research source “I’m like a fine wine—best paired with a good time and a bit of flirtation.” “Swipe right if you’re ready for some fireworks. I promise I’m not a dud.” “I’m not a thief, but I’m here to steal your heart… just for the night.” “I’ve been called a bad influence, but I can be very persuasive in all the right ways.” “Why be a star in the sky when we can light up the night together?” “I like my dates how I like my coffee: hot, bold, and able to keep me up all night.” “Growing up, I had straight As. Now I’m looking to F.” “Hit me up if you want to test out my new sheets with me.” “My favorite place to be is in my bed, but I think I’d probably like to be in yours, too.”"

      "title": "Use humor to show you’re not looking for anything serious.",
      "content": "Use humor to show you’re not looking for anything serious. If you’re writing a long bio talking about the future, people are going to assume you’re looking for a serious commitment. If you want something casual, keep your bio casual, too. Try a fun, flirty joke to break the ice . Here are some examples: [3] X Research source “Swipe right if you want to be my next mistake.” “I whisper sweet nothings to my pizza before I eat it. You could be next.” “I’m like a thrift store—full of surprises and slightly used.” “I’m like a broken pencil. Pointless, but fun to play with.” “Not interested in casual hookups. Only semi-formal hookups. That’s the kind where we both show up in suits and ties.” “I’m great with numbers. Give me yours and I’ll show you.” “Professional shower singer seeking a duet partner.” “I’m not that great at advice, but I can offer you sarcasm and a good time.” “I’m not a photographer but I can definitely picture us together. Briefly.” Keegan says to keep things short and funny. He states, “Hookup profiles usually want to keep things much shorter and maybe say something silly or funny. Still, you're a person who wants to connect with other people; you're just not necessarily looking to be in a relationship.”"

      "content": "Be confident to pique their interest. Nothing’s more attractive than someone who knows what they want. People might be more willing to hookup with someone who seems like they know what they’re doing. Avoid being too arrogant, but be cool and confident to make potential matches curious about you and your bedroom abilities. Here are some things you might say: [4] X Research source “I’m not a genie, but I can make all your wishes come true tonight.” “I’ve got the moves to make your night. Care to dance?” “I’m the risk you won’t regret taking.” “I don’t just make plans. I fulfill fantasies.” “I’m the perfect blend of inappropriate and charming. Perfect for those who like a challenge.” “Let’s have a who’s better in bed contest.” “We’ll get along if the little spoon is your favorite position.” “72% gentleman, 28%...You’ll have to find out.” “Not picky about how tall you are because everyone’s the same height in bed.” “Swipe right for a night of fun… I guarantee I’m more fun than your ex.”"

      "content": "Say something witty to charm potential matches. Even when you’re both looking for something casual, your potential matches will be drawn to those with interesting profiles. You don’t have to add a bunch of personal information since you aren’t looking for something serious, but add something to get the conversation started and open up the door for a potential hookup. Here are some examples: [5] X Research source “Love is in the air? Wrong. Nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide are in the air.” “Looking for my next victim… I mean date.” “I’m like an IKEA table—easy to pick up, but you’ll need instructions to put me together.” “Looking for someone who laughs at my jokes and their own texts before hitting send.” “I like big butts and I’m morally against lying.” “From the future. To keep the natural timeline intact, we must match on Tinder today. Do the right thing for yourself and the fate of the universe.” “Feel free to add me to your to-do list.” “I’m a lot like Burger King. You can have me your way.” “I’m like a library book. If you’re not careful, you’ll have to pay a fine for keeping me too long.” “I’m the person your parents warned you about. Let’s disappoint them together.”"

While it isn’t directly marketed as a hookup app, many users see it as one and use it to look for casual fun rather than long-term relationships. Tinder has a large user base that makes it easy for anyone, regardless of gender identity or sexuality, to swipe right on potential hookups. [6] X Research source"

Only women and non-binary people can send the first message, making it easier to weed out potential matches who come off as creepy or make them uncomfortable. Bumble may be more geared toward relationships than Tinder, but it easily allows users to set their preferences and match with someone on the same page. [7] X Research source"

Remember, if you’re upfront in your bio, your matches probably swiped right because they’re looking for the same thing. Start a casual conversation and ask about the hookup when it feels natural. [10] X Research source To make things a bit easier on yourself, only swipe right on people you’re attracted to and genuinely want to hookup with. Some people may be willing to hookup right away while others need more time to get comfortable. Do what works best for you while being considerate of how the other person might feel about the situation, too. If you only want to hookup, it’s probably not the best idea to ask people at 10 AM on a Monday. Instead, try messaging people later at night and during the weekend."

Your safety should always be a priority, so exchange a few messages to make sure your match seems legit before sharing any personal information. [11] X Research source When creating your profile and selecting your photos, be careful not to include anything that might reveal your address, place of work, or license plate. While some people may want to be discreet when looking for hookups, use caution if you choose to match with someone who has few or no pictures. If they won’t show you what they look like ahead of time, it’s probably best to avoid the situation."

Remember, even though the dating app conversation might be going well, you’re ultimately meeting a stranger. Plus, if you’re nervous, you two can grab coffee or catch a movie before hooking up to get a little more comfortable with each other. [13] X Research source If the person you’re meeting makes you uncomfortable while you’re in public, remove yourself from the situation. You don’t want to risk your safety by going home with them or continuing the hookup."

Alcohol can make it more difficult to think clearly, so there’s a chance you could find yourself making decisions you wouldn’t make sober. If you do decide to drink, keep an eye on it at all times. [14] X Research source If at any point you notice your drink looks or tastes different, leave the date immediately."

      "content": "Practice safe sex. Practicing safe sex is always important, but especially when hooking up with someone you just met. You don’t know their sexual history, and there’s always the chance someone could lie about being tested. Use a condom , dental dam, or other form of physical protection to keep you and your partner safe. [15] X Research source If your partner refuses to use protection, don’t continue with the hookup. It’s better to find someone who takes your health seriously. If your hookup ends up becoming a regular sexual partner, consider getting tested together to make sure you’re both safe and healthy before intercourse. Remember, consent is key. Communicate with your partner throughout the hookup to make sure you’re both comfortable."
