      "content": "Use pliers to pull on 1 end of the bottom loop if you have a French earring hook. Examine the bottom end of your French earring hook to find a small metal loop attached. Next, pinch the loose, disconnected end of the wire with a pair of round- or needle-nosed pliers. Pull upwards or outwards on the end of the loop to create a wide gap, which you can use to string on beads or other jewelry attachments. [1] X Research source French earring hooks have a gentle curve, and are commonly used in a variety of handmade jewelry. Some varieties of this hook have a wire coil attached to the base. You can use this open loop to attach other earring decorations, like feathers or dangling leather shapes. You can use the same process to open the small metal loops attached to lever-back French clips and earring posts. As the name suggests, lever-back hooks use a clasping mechanism to secure the earring, while posts use a straight strand, or “post,” of metal. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Unfasten the clasp if you’re working with a kidney wire. Examine the bottom portion of a kidney wire and find a fastener securing a loose section of wire into place. Use your fingers to pull the loose section of wire away from the fastener so you can string beads or jewelry attachments onto the hook. [3] X Research source As the name suggests, kidney wires are ovular hooks that form complete loops, and have a clasp that prevents the actual earring from sliding off. You can string beads onto kidney wire hooks while also attaching other earring accessories to the bottom loop."

      "title": "Unclip or unfasten the connecting wire if you have a hoop earring.",
      "content": "Unclip or unfasten the connecting wire if you have a hoop earring. Examine your specific set of hoop earrings to see what kind of mechanism holds it together. Pull, twist, or unfasten the loose end of wire to open the earring hook, which allows you to string beads and other trinkets onto the hoop. Note that, unlike other earrings, hoops double as both the hook and the earring itself. [4] X Research source Manipulating hoops have a flattened metal end with a hole drilled in the center where the loose section of wire threads through. To connect and disconnect the hoop, slide the loose section of wire through the drilled hole. Leverback hoops use a clasp mechanism, which can be opened and closed to secure the earring. Crimp hoops use a special clip to hold the hoop together. To secure the earring into place, pull down the lever that’s attached to the crimp. Endless hoops are made with a curved, hollow loop that accepts and secures a thin, small section of wire. Stick the thin portion of wire into the hollow loop to secure the jewelry, then pull on the wire to open the hoop. Sleeper hoops come with a twisting mechanism that locks the loose section of wire into place."

      "title": "String beads onto earring hoops or kidney wires to add a decorative touch.",
      "content": "String beads onto earring hoops or kidney wires to add a decorative touch. Take the beads of your choice and thread them onto the thin, loose section of wire. Next, drag the beads down the length or curve of the wire until you’re happy with their placement. To create a fun pattern or colorful effect, string additional beads onto the hoop or kidney wire. [5] X Research source This type of design only works with kidney wires or hoops, as both earring hooks create continuous loops."

      "content": "Use pliers to tighten and close the small loop attached to the hook. Once your desired beads and decorations are threading onto the earring hook, you can pinch the loose, open end of the earring hook with a round- or needle-nosed set of pliers. Push the wire back to its original position, completing the original loop and securing the earring in place. [6] X Research source Double-check that the earring is secure before trying it on. This process doesn’t apply to any kind of hoop earring."

      "content": "Select a pair of premade earrings that match your earring hooks. Search online or in your local craft store for a set of premade earrings. If you’re purchasing metallic earrings, check that the earring is similar in color to the hooks that you have on hand. If you’re purchasing colorful, non-metallic earrings, then you don’t have to worry about this. [7] X Research source For instance, if you have a pair of silver earring hooks, you’d want to pick out a pair of silver premade earrings."

Open the loop to create a 4mm-wide gap, so you can thread premade earrings onto the hook. If you’re having trouble opening the loop, try using another set of pliers to hold the earring hook in place. [8] X Research source For instance, you could use the pliers in your left hand to hold the hook in place, and the pliers in your right hand to open the loop."

Next, apply an even amount of force so the loop closes completely. Continue squeezing this loop until it’s completely shut, and the earring is securely attached to the hook. [10] X Research source If you want, try shaking the earring a little bit to ensure that hook is secure."
