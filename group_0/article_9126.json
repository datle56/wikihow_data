      "title": "Start with the present tense.",
      "content": "Start with the present tense. The present tense is perhaps the most used tense in Spanish, so it makes sense to learn it first. To conjugate an -ar verb, remove the -ar ending from the infinitive and replace it with -o, -as, -a, -amos, -áis, or -an , depending on the subject pronoun. [3] X Research source Yo hablo : I speak. Tú hablas : You [informal] speak. Él/ella/usted habla : He/she/you [formal] speak. Nosotros hablamos : We speak. Vosotros habláis : You all [informal] speak. Ellos/ellas/ustedes hablan : They/you all [formal] speak."

      "title": "Describe actions that were completed in the past with the preterite tense.",
      "content": "Describe actions that were completed in the past with the preterite tense. You can think of the Spanish preterite as similar to the English past tense. However, preterite tense is not used if the action described carries on into the present. To conjugate an -ar verb, replace the -ar with -é, -aste, -ó, -amos, -asteis , or -aron , depending on the subject pronoun. [4] X Research source Yo hablé : I spoke. Tú hablaste : You [informal] spoke. Él/ella/usted habló : He/she/you [formal] spoke. Nosotros hablamos : We spoke. Vosotros hablasteis : You all [informal] spoke. Ellos/ellas/ustedes hablaron : They/you all [formal] spoke."

    {
      "title": "Switch to imperfect if the action continues into the present.",
      "content": "Switch to imperfect if the action continues into the present. Since the preterite tense only describes completed actions, if the action continues, you need to use the imperfect tense. The closest translation into English would be if you \"were doing\" something. Replace the -ar with -aba, -abas, -aba, -ábamos, -abais or -aban to create the conjugated form of your verb. [5] X Research source Yo hablaba : I was speaking. Tú hablabas : You [informal] were speaking. Él/ella/usted hablaba : He/she was speaking; you [formal] were speaking. Nosotros hablábamos : We were speaking. Vosotros hablabais : You all [informal] were speaking. Ellos/ellas/ustedes hablaban : They/you all [formal] were speaking."

      "title": "Use the conditional tense to discuss the possible.",
      "content": "Use the conditional tense to discuss the possible. If an action depends on something else to occur, the conditional tense is appropriate. This tense is also used to make polite requests (like in English you might say \"If you could...\"). To conjugate regular -ar verbs, use the endings -ía, ías, ía, -íamos, íais, or -ían . However, you'll add these endings to the entire infinitive, rather than just the stem. [6] X Research source Yo hablaría : I would speak [if]. Tú hablarías : You [informal] would speak [if]. Él/ella/usted hablaría : He/she/you [formal] would speak [if]. Nosotros hablaríamos : We would speak [if]. Vosotros hablaríais : You all [informal] would speak [if].

      "content": "Express actions that will happen using the simple future tense. In English, the future tense uses the helper verb \"will.\" In Spanish, a single word is used. For regular verbs, simply add -é, -ás, -á, -emos, -éis , or -án to the end of the infinitive. [7] X Research source Yo hablaré : I will speak. Tú hablarás : You [informal] will speak. Él/ella/usted hablará : He/she/you [formal] will speak. Nosotros hablaremos : We will speak. Vosotros hablaréis : You all [informal] will speak.

      "title": "Talk about actions happening in the present.",
      "content": "Talk about actions happening in the present. The present tense is used for anything that's currently happening. To conjugate an -er verb in the present tense, remove the -er ending from the infinitive and add -o, -es, -e, -emos, -éis, or -en , depending on the subject pronoun. [8] X Research source Yo como : I eat. Tú comes : You [informal] eat. Él/ella/usted come : He/she eats; you [formal] eat. Nosotros comemos : We eat. Vosotros coméis : You all [informal] eat.

If you want to talk about something that happened completely in the past, remove the -er ending from the infinitive of your verb and add the appropriate ending. Depending on your subject pronoun, your ending will be -í, -iste, -ió, -imos, -isteis, or -ieron . [9] X Research source Yo comí : I ate. Tú comiste : You [informal] ate.

This tense is also appropriate if you \"were doing\" something, but were interrupted. To conjugate -er verbs in this tense, replace the -er ending with -ía, ías, ía, -íamos, íais, or -ían .

If you want to talk about a hypothetical situation, or something that will only occur if something else takes place first, use the conditional tense. To conjugate -er verbs, you'll use the same endings that you used for the imperfect tense. However, you'll attach them to the end of the infinitive, rather than removing the -er ending.
