    {
      "title": "“That’s a nice name.”",
      "content": "“That’s a nice name.” Use this simple phrase to compliment a name that sounds pleasing or pretty to you, expressing your admiration of it in a friendly way. [1] X Research source Feel free to elaborate on what you like about their name, or simply leave it at that and segue into general small talk."
    },
    {
      "title": "“What a pretty name!”",
      "content": "“What a pretty name!” Save this compliment for names you really love—don’t just say this to someone with a common or simple name, as they may feel like your praise is fake. To sound more genuine, repeat their name back to them before giving your compliment."
    },
    {
      "title": "“Your name is so unique.”",
      "content": "“Your name is so unique.” If someone has a truly unique name, they might appreciate you noticing it. However, be mindful of making them feel uncomfortable, especially if their name is from a different language or culture than your own. You don’t want them to feel like you’re exoticizing or othering them. [2] X Research source If they offer to share the meaning of their name, listen to their explanation. Otherwise, don’t push them to translate it—they might not know or want to share."
    },
    {
      "title": "“Your name is so melodic!”",
      "content": "“Your name is so melodic!” Compliment someone with a name that’s pleasing to say by calling it melodic—a musical term referring to a sweet arrangement of sounds. [3] X Research source You can also say their name has a musical quality to it."
    },
    {
      "title": "“I’ve never heard that name before.",
      "content": "“I’ve never heard that name before. It’s beautiful.” Praise someone’s unique name by expressing that it’s rare and complimenting it. Adding a short compliment at the end is important—otherwise, you may come off as judgmental or dismissive of the uniqueness of their name."
    },
    {
      "title": "“I love that name.",
      "content": "“I love that name. It has a timeless feel to it.” If someone has a classic or vintage-sounding name, let them know you find it timeless. This is an easy way to compliment a common name without coming off as disingenuous, since being timeless is a positive quality—it’s being able to withstand the test of time."
    },
    {
      "title": "“What a cool name!",
      "content": "“What a cool name! It sounds like a character from a book.” Fictional characters typically have cool names because the author wants their characters to be memorable and likable. Compare someone’s name to that of a book character to suggest their name feels crafted by a poetic mind."
    },
    {
      "title": "“That has a nice ring to it.”",
      "content": "“That has a nice ring to it.” If a name catches your attention because it sounds satisfying and feels pleasing to say, let them know with the common idiom, “It has a nice ring to it.” [4] X Research source It’s a way of saying that the name sounds pleasing like the “ring” of a bell."

    {
      "title": "Compliment someone’s name when you first learn it.",
      "content": "Compliment someone’s name when you first learn it. This is the kind of compliment that only really makes sense when you’ve just been told someone’s name. If you already know their name, they may feel confused or awkward if you compliment it one day out of the blue—it may feel forced instead of genuine. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Only compliment names you genuinely like.",
      "content": "Only compliment names you genuinely like. A genuine compliment feels more authentic and meaningful than a fake one said out of politeness. If someone has a name you don’t find special, musical, or pretty in some way, find something else about them to compliment. Focus on things they have control over, like their personality or their outfit—not things like their height. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Pay attention to how they react if you’re trying to flirt.",
      "content": "Pay attention to how they react if you’re trying to flirt. After complimenting someone’s name as a way to flirt with them, see if they appreciate the compliment or if they feel uncomfortable. Is their body language closed off, such as crossing their arms? Are they replying in short sentences? If so, they may be signaling that they’re not interested in flirting, in which case it’s best to wrap up the conversation and let them be. [7] X Research source To compliment someone without coming off as creepy, dating coach John Keegan says to give a compliment without expecting anything in return. “Give [the compliment] away and just leave it at that,” he says."

      "content": "Most people appreciate being complimented, but not everyone does. Some people may feel like their name isn’t worth complimenting. [8] X Research source They may also not like their name—they probably didn’t choose it. Other people may appreciate that you like their name because it’s part of their identity or because they chose it. It varies from person to person. If you genuinely like someone’s name, feel free to compliment it. Otherwise, find something else about them that you admire and compliment them on that."
