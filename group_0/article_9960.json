      "content": "Cover your work surface with parchment paper. Tear off a sheet of parchment paper roughly 18 inches (46 cm) in length and spread it over a flat portion of your kitchen counter. This section or parchment paper will provide you with a clean, nonstick surface on which to place your formed meatballs before you cook them. Note that you can also use wax paper instead of parchment paper. If you plan on baking your meatballs, you can line a baking dish or baking sheet with parchment paper instead of lining the counter. You could also grease the dish and line the formed meatballs on it without the use of parchment paper."

      "content": "Combine the ground meat, bread crumbs, eggs, and seasonings in a large bowl. Use your hands or a wooden spoon to mix the ingredients thoroughly. Ground beef is the simplest meat option for you to use, but you can also use a combination made of equal parts ground beef and ground pork, ground beef and ground sausage, or ground beef and ground veal. For a healthier option, you could skip the beef completely and use ground turkey instead. You can use either unseasoned or seasoned bread crumbs. Dry bread crumbs are often easiest to work with, but you could also tear a slice of fresh bread into small crumbs and use that in place of dry crumbs for a fresher, softer result. Make sure to slightly beat the egg with a fork or whisk before adding it to the mixture. Otherwise, it may fail to bind the meat properly. Salt and pepper are basic seasonings to add to your meatballs, but minced onion and parsley can be used if you want to give the flavor more depth. Other herbs, like oregano or cilantro, could be used instead of or alongside the parsley, as well."

If you have a melon-baller or small ice cream scoop, you could use that to form your meatballs instead of your hands. You could also use a teaspoon to help you portion off the meat into workable amounts."

[1] X Research source If you have not already done so, prepare a 9- by 13-inch (23- by 33-cm) baking dish by coating it with the olive oil. Place the baking dish in the oven as it preheats to warm the dish and the oil. Only use enough oil to grease the pan. If you notice any puddles of olive oil, you should wipe them out or spread them further with a clean paper towel. Nonstick cooking spray may be used instead of cooking oil."

Place your meatballs in the dish, spacing them roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart from one another. Keep the meatballs in a single layer and do not allow them to touch as they bake. If the meatballs bake while touching one another, they may end up sticking together. Gently press down on each meatball as you place it in the baking dish in order to somewhat flatten the bottom. By giving each ball a flat edge, you reduce the risk of the meatballs rolling around and coming into contact with each other in the oven."

Most meatball recipes can be served and enjoyed on their own, but adding meatballs to other dishes can be a good way to enhance the flavor of both the meatballs and the dish itself. Italian pasta dishes like spaghetti and meatballs are, perhaps, the most common example of a dish that features meatballs. Meatball soup is also a popular meatball dish. For a cheap, easy twist, you could also add meatballs to ramen in order to create Ramen meatball soup. Meatball sub sandwiches are a relatively mess-free way to enjoy meatballs drenched in sauce, as well."
