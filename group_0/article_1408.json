Start at the center of your face and work your way out, buffing the product into your skin (instead of rubbing it). Generally, applying CC cream with a flat top brush gives you the most coverage, while using your fingers gives you the most natural finish. A beauty blender or sponge is good for a flawless, airbrushed look. [4] X Research source If you’re applying CC cream with your fingers, be sure to wash your hands first. If you’re using a makeup brush, clean it weekly with a brush cleanser . If your CC cream looks streaky, dampen a beauty blender or makeup sponge and wring out any excess water. Gently press it all over your face to blend out any harsh lines. [5] X Research source"

[9] X Research source If that’s not possible, get samples of a few different CC creams and swatch them on your jawline to see which shade matches the best. Your perfect shade will blend seamlessly into your skin, without looking too warm or cool. If you have fair skin, pick a CC cream with a pink or peach undertone. If you have medium skin, opt for a CC cream with a yellow or olive undertone. If you have dark skin, choose a CC cream with a bronze or golden undertone."

      "content": "Determine the coverage you want. Some CC creams work like a tinted moisturizer, while others have heavier pigmentation like foundation. Choose a medium or full-coverage CC cream for a more opaque finish. If you prefer a more natural look, choose a lightweight CC cream with a thinner texture, or one with buildable coverage that can be layered. If you want a radiant finish, choose a dewy CC cream with hydrating ingredients. It’s the perfect choice for the “your skin but better” look. If you want a more full-coverage look, opt for a matte or semi-matte CC cream . This formula works best for people with oily or acne-prone skin because it helps control shine."
