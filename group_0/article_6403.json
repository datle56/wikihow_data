      "title": "Set aside time for longer meditation sessions.",
      "content": "Set aside time for longer meditation sessions. Religious and spiritual introspection is important during Navratri. If you don't currently meditate every day, try to set aside a least 15 minutes every day during the 9 days to slow down and focus on your spirit. If you already practice daily meditation, try devoting extra time to your meditation and prayer each day. If it's difficult for you to find time to meditate, do it when you wake up in the morning or just before bed, since you'll be winding down and in a more introspective mood during these times."

      "title": "Recite the Gayatri Mantra three times per day.",
      "content": "Recite the Gayatri Mantra three times per day. This is one of the most important spiritual traditions of Navratri, and it is said in the morning, afternoon, and evening. During your prayers and meditation, recite the mantra in your mind or aloud to focus your spirit on creation, unity, and life. The mantra is commonly chanted as “Om buhr, bhuva, swaha, om tat savitur varenyam, bhargo devasya dheemahi, dhiyo yonaha prachodayat” which translates to “Let us meditate on that excellent glory of the divine vivifying Sun, May he enlighten our understandings.” Some traditional Hindu worshippers don't recommend that women chant the Gayatri Mantra because it is very powerful and can be harmful for them. However, it's your decision to decide how you would like to worship."

Most of the time, this means cooking meals for the needy or feeding the homeless to encourage growth and positivity in the community. [5] X Research source A great way to observe this aspect of Navratri is by volunteering at a local food bank or soup kitchen during the 9 days of celebration. You might also choose to deliver meals on your own to elderly people or needy people in your area. You can share meals that you've already prepared for your celebration, or make larger batches with the intent of giving some to the hungry."

Red, blue, orange, yellow, green, pink, and purple are all common. You can also wear different colors on your top and bottom.
