In APA style, you list the last name followed by a comma, then the author's first initial and middle initial. [1] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source For instance, an author named Francis Leanne Montgomery would be listed as \"Montgomery, F. L.\" If the author's middle name or initial is not provided, just use their first initial. For example, \"Powell, J.\" Separate names of authors with commas. Check to make sure you have a comma after each last name and after each set of initials. For example: \"Sunshine, S. J., Summers, P. T., & Autumnwood, S.\""

If everyone listed is an editor, follow the last name with a comma and the abbreviation \"eds.\" [3] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source The ampersand is always preceded by a comma.

Capitalize the title just as you would a sentence. This means often only the first word is capitalized. [5] X Research source If the work also has a subtitle, include it after a colon. You'll also capitalize the first word of the subtitle. The title may be in italics, depending on the type of work you're citing. This stays the same regardless of the number of authors. For example, a book title would be italicized, but an article in a scholarly journal would not be italicized."

Make sure you include a comma after the sixth author's name. You don't need a comma after the ellipsis. Check your word processing app for an ellipsis style function â€“ it looks like it's just a string of 3 periods, but they are spaced further apart than regular periods."
