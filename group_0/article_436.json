      "content": "Snap the glow stick. Shake it too. These actions will activate the glowing power of the plastic stick, which has glowing liquid inside of it. Once you see the stick glowing, it’s ready to use. Next, you should take a pair of scissors, and cut the glow stick in half. Make sure that your scissors are sharp, so that you can more easily cut through the glow stick. Be careful when using scissors though that you don’t cut yourself. Cut the glow stick slowly and on a paper towel or plate, while being careful that none of the liquid spills out of the stick. Use the paper towel or plate as a stopgap under the glow stick as you cut it, in case a little bit of it does spill out. Try not to get the contents on your clothes."

      "content": "Add the glow from the stick into your polish. Take one cut end of the stick, and place it into the nail polish bottle. Squeeze the glow stick as if it’s a tube in order to get the glowing liquid inside the glow stick into the nail polish bottle. If you cut both ends of the tube, the liquid should flow into the nail polish bottle more easily, but cut the top end after you’ve put the tube into the bottle. Put the cap back on the nail polish bottle, and shake it vigorously! This is important so the glow liquid disburses throughout the nail polish evenly."

      "content": "Put regular nail polish on first. One trick you can use is to put regular nail polish on before the glow-in-the-dark variety. You will want to paint your nails with a regular nail polish or nail polish base first. This will make it easier to remove the glow-in-the-dark nail polish later if you want to do so. It will also help people see it. It’s a good idea to choose a lighter color base, or you will need to apply more coats of the glow-in-the-dark nail polish. Choose neutral colors. White is a good choice, or just a clear gloss or light beige color."

You might need three to four coats of the polish for the effect to take its full effect. Apply a coat, let it dry, and then apply another coat. You may need fewer coats, perhaps as few as two, if you’ve used a lighter nail polish color like white as the base. It will take your nail polish a little longer to dry than normal, so make sure that you don’t touch anything for awhile or you could ruin your nails."

The glowing effect on your nails will probably only last for a couple of hours. You could always reapply more polish if you notice the glowing effect starting to wear off."

However, it's possible to use some highlighters to make your nails glow! Yellow highlighter is a good choice because it usually does glow. You can check the highlighter under a black light before you paint your nails. Apply a base of nail polish before applying the highlighter to your nails.

Apply a top coat of clear nail polish to seal the look."
