Pressure treated lumber is best if your stage will be resting on concrete or placed outside. For each individual platform you will need: [2] X Research source 6 – 8 foot 2x4’s 1 – 8’x4’ sheet of 3/4 inch plywood 12 – 3.5 inch hex bolts 24 washers 12 nuts 26 - 1 ½” wood screws 24 - 3” wood screws"

To avoid mistakes and wasted wood, remember this rule of carpentry: measure twice, cut once. [3] X Research source From two 8’ pieces of 2x4, cut 3 lengths of wood to 3’9” (45 inches). You will have 4’3” of wood left from one 2x4, cut it into two 2’ pieces. (Discard the remaining 3”.) Use a new 8’ 2x4 to cut four 2’ lengths of wood. From the fourth 2x4 cut six 1’ pieces at a 45º angle on each side. Cut the angles on either end toward each other. The long side of the board will measure 12” while the short side accounting for the angles will be approximately 5 ½”. The angled boards will be used to brace the legs. The other two 2x4s will be used to make the frame. Don't cut these."
