[1] X Expert Source Ryan Glynn, CPA Plant Specialist & Interiorscaper Expert Interview. 4 November 2021. If you’re growing your plant indoors, place it in a window that faces north or east to prevent it from getting too much light during the day.

[3] X Expert Source Ryan Glynn, CPA Plant Specialist & Interiorscaper Expert Interview. 4 November 2021. To make sure your goldfish plant gets the humidity it needs, place the pot on a shallow tray or saucer with pebbles in it and pour a little water into the tray. The water will evaporate and create moisture for the plant. [4] X Research source Don’t put in so much water that it touches the bottom of the pot. This could cause the soil to become soggy. If your plant is in a hanging basket, you can instead mist it every day with lukewarm water. Don’t use cold water, since this will damage the leaves."

Keep your plant in a temperature-controlled area so that it doesn’t get too hot or cold. [6] X Research source If you notice the leaves of your goldfish plant turning brown or falling off, it may mean that your plant is too hot. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Put the plant in a wide planter so it can trail.",
      "content": "Put the plant in a wide planter so it can trail. In nature, the goldfish plant is epiphytic, meaning it usually grows in trees rather than on the ground. For this reason, it’s easiest to grow goldfish plants in planters or hanging baskets rather than in your garden. Choose a pot that is at least 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) wide to allow your plant to trail and spread out. Make sure to choose a planter with good drainage, since soggy soil can cause the roots to rot.

      "content": "Give your plant a well-draining potting mix. It’s important to keep epiphytic plants in soil that drains well, since waterlogging can cause the plant to rot. Choose a soil that won’t retain too much water and allow your goldfish plant to become soggy. [9] X Research source An orchid or succulent potting mix containing perlite and peat moss should work well."

[11] X Research source You will not need to water your goldfish plant as often during the winter as during the summer. However, water it often enough that the soil never completely dries out."

During the spring through early fall, give your goldfish plant a phosphorous-rich fertilizer once a week to encourage blooming. Don’t fertilize the plant during the winter.

Remove your plant from its pot and replant it in a clean, slightly larger pot with fresh potting soil.

Pinch off the tips of the stems regularly and trim back any branches that are starting to look too long or “leggy.” [14] X Research source In addition to trimming the branches, regularly deadheading wilted blossoms can encourage the plant to produce more blooms.
