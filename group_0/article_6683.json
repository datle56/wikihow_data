If you want a specialty plate that supports a particular cause, or if you want a personalized plate number, your DMV will have information on how to request those plates. [1] X Research source You may have to visit an office in person, or the information you need may be available online. Check the website of your DMV to learn more about the exact process and the types of plates available."

      "title": "Verify that your registration and address is up to date.",
      "content": "Verify that your registration and address is up to date. Typically, you won't be able to get a personalized or specialty plate unless the car is registered in your name and the registration isn't expired. Your address will also need to be up to date. In many places, you can't get new plates at the same time you're renewing your registration. [2] X Research source Check the date when your registration is up for renewal. If it's coming up for renewal within a month or two, you may want to renew your registration first, then order your new tags. Given that it can take weeks or months to get a personalized tag, your registration may expire before your new tags are ready."

      "title": "Choose the plate and configuration you want.",
      "content": "Choose the plate and configuration you want. Each location has different types of specialty plates available, many of which can be customized with your personal combination of letters and numbers. [3] X Research source Each vehicle licensing office has basic rules you must follow when choosing a personalized configuration. Generally, you can't have a configuration that is suggestive or vulgar, or that uses any trademarked or proprietary names. Typically you can check online to see if the configuration you want is available. You may also be able to do this in person at a vehicle licensing office."

    {
      "title": "Submit your completed application and fees.",
      "content": "Submit your completed application and fees. The application form requires you to provide identification information about yourself, including your name and address. You also must provide information about your vehicle. [4] X Research source You may be asked to submit proof of registration. Some specialty plates also are only available to individuals who meet specific criteria, so you may have to provide documentation to prove that you're eligible to have that plate. For example, you may have to provide proof that you are a veteran or member of the military to get a military-themed specialty plate. The fees for specialty and personalized plates vary greatly among vehicle licensing offices, but you generally must pay an additional fee beyond what you would normally pay for a regular plate."

    {
      "title": "Receive confirmation of your new plate and configuration.",
      "content": "Receive confirmation of your new plate and configuration. If you ordered your specialty plates in person by visiting the vehicle licensing office, you'll typically receive confirmation of your order immediately. [5] X Research source If you ordered your new plates online or through the mail, you may have to wait for confirmation. The vehicle licensing office typically will send you a form that states the new configuration you ordered. Check over the form carefully to make sure everything is correct."

      "content": "Check the mail for your new plates. After you've ordered personalized plates, it may be weeks or even months before those plates are made and sent to you. In the meantime, you typically must keep your old plates on your vehicle. [6] X Research source Contact your vehicle licensing office to find out the procedure for disposing of old plates. Some offices require you to surrender your old plates immediately, while others will allow you to keep them even though they're no longer valid."

If your license plates are lost or stolen, call your local vehicle licensing office as soon as possible to report the theft and find out what you need to do to continue legally driving your car. If you had personalized plates that were lost or stolen, you may not be able to get new plates with the same configuration. For example, in the state of California you can only get duplicate plates with the same configuration if you still have one of the plates – not if you've lost both of them."

      "content": "Verify your address with the office or department in charge of vehicle licensing. In many cases, you must verify your address with the vehicle licensing office before you can begin the process of replacing a plate that was lost or stolen. You typically can verify your address online or over the phone, although you may want to go to the nearest vehicle licensing office and do this in person. If you go to the office in person, bring along something with your name and address on it, such as a utility bill, so you'll have proof of residency."

When your plates are lost or stolen, you must be able to prove that you are the registered owner of the vehicle before you can get replacement plates. If you have a copy of your vehicle registration, that and your driver's license typically are enough to prove ownership. You can also use the car's title, a loan agreement, or a bill of sale. Some offices also require proof that the plates were lost of stolen. You can do this with a police report or signed and notarized affidavit."

If you have to go to the DMV, call ahead and see if you can make an appointment to save wait time. If you don't have any special requests for the replacement plate, but just want a new standard-issue plate, you're probably better off making a visit in person. You should be able to pick up your new plate immediately, so you won't have a car without plates."

If you have to wait for plates and need to drive your car in the meantime, find out if you can get a temporary tag to put on your car while you wait.
