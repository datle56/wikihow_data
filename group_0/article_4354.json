      "title": "Tell him how good he looks.",
      "content": "Tell him how good he looks. Every guy likes hearing that he looks good—even when you’ve been in a relationship for a long time. Even if he’s not confident about his looks, sincerely let him that you are attracted to him. Give him a specific compliment every few days, like how great he looks in a certain shirt. If he goes to the gym, say “Your workouts have been really been paying off lately. You look irresistible.” It wouldn’t hurt to tell him that other people would drool over his good looks. That doesn’t mean he would want those people. It would just make him feel good that someone thinks he’s attractive that isn’t intimately involved with him."

      "title": "Praise his accomplishments.",
      "content": "Praise his accomplishments. Make a big deal out of it when he accomplishes something. It could be a promotion, a finished art project, or something as simple as finishing a household task that took a while for him to complete. Let him know how proud of him you are. You could make him his favorite dinner, give him a gift, or throw him a surprise party. It will make him feel special. If he has recently been promoted, say “I knew you would get that promotion. I am so proud of you. How do you want to celebrate?”"

    {
      "title": "Ask for his advice.",
      "content": "Ask for his advice. Think of something you’ve been struggling with for a while. Perhaps you have had a fight with a friend and aren’t sure how to solve it. Or, it could be something bigger. For instance, maybe you were offered a job but aren’t sure you should take it. Ask him for his advice. Then, compliment his ability to give you helpful and thoughtful advice. [1] X Research source You could ask for advice when it comes to something small, like choosing an outfit. Ask him which dress or outfit he thinks you should wear. You don’t have to take his advice, but asking for it will make him feel valued. By showing vulnerability immediately, the other person will feel closer to you. [2] X Expert Source Cristina Morara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 29 September 2020."

      "title": "Compliment his ability in bed.",
      "content": "Compliment his ability in bed. Men are often very physical creatures. A physical relationship isn’t everything, but it would boost his ego to know that he is pleasing you. You can tell him that he’s the best you’ve had or could have. Or, tell him specific things you like that he does. For example, you could tell him that you love how thoughtful he is when it comes to your needs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Brag on him to others.",
      "content": "Brag on him to others. Ideally, you should do this in front of other people while he’s around. You could say something about how he recently got a promotion, or how great he has been with the kids. Knowing that you are proud enough of him to brag will be an instant ego boost. You could say “He always has been a great partner, but he has been especially great lately. I feel so lucky to have him!” Even if you brag while he’s not around, it might get back to him. It will make him feel great if a friend tells him that you complimented him when he wasn’t there."

    {
      "title": "Laugh at his jokes.",
      "content": "Laugh at his jokes. Making a man feel like he has a great sense of humor is sure to boost his ego. You might have different senses of humor, but don’t resist laughing when he does or says something genuinely funny. Don’t force fake laughter because that may make him feel like you pity him. Also, don’t laugh at him when he falls or does something unintentionally funny. Say something like “you’re hilarious” when he cracks a joke."

    {
      "title": "Look at him from across a crowded room.",
      "content": "Look at him from across a crowded room. Make your man feel like you can’t take your eyes off of him. This works especially well when you’re in a room full of people that could easily get your attention. Don’t stare at him the whole time. This might make him feel like you’re tracking his movements. Instead, smile at him or wink at him a couple of times when you’re separated. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Show him that you find him attractive.",
      "content": "Show him that you find him attractive. Outside of complimenting his appearance, show him what qualities he has that you find attractive. Let him know when he’s doing something that turns you on. Tell him that he’s looking too good to resist. Don’t be afraid to show your desire for him. [4] X Research source Before he leaves for the day, say “Wow! You’re looking extra handsome today! But I also said that yesterday because you always look great.”"

    {
      "title": "Send him a text during the day.",
      "content": "Send him a text during the day. It will make him feel good to know that you can’t stop thinking of him when you’re apart. Don’t bombard him with texts all day because that could get annoying. One or two texts will be enough. You can say something as simple as “thinking of you.” Or, you could tell him how much you want him. Send him a text that says “Can’t wait until I see you tonight.” Suggest that you’re going to help him relieve the stress of a long day. You could send a text telling him that you can’t stop thinking about the amazing time you had together last night."

      "title": "Initiate intimacy.",
      "content": "Initiate intimacy. Physically show your man that you can’t resist him by being the one that initiates intimacy. It doesn’t necessarily have to be sexual. You could give him extra kisses, hugs, and cuddles. But, it’s also a good idea to seduce him if you feel comfortable with it. [5] X Research source You could take this up a notch by wearing lingerie or indulging in one of his fantasies."

      "title": "Tell him when he has done something right.",
      "content": "Tell him when he has done something right. Don’t let the little things go unnoticed. You don’t have to compliment every little thing, but some praise for the everyday good he does will make him feel great. You could let him know how much you appreciate him changing diapers, doing taxes, or making dinner. [6] X Research source You could say something along the lines of “You’ve been so helpful around the house today. I appreciate it so much.” You don’t even have to tell him you appreciate these things. You could replace words with a high five or fist bump sometimes."

    {
      "title": "Let him know you’re thankful for his dedication to you.",
      "content": "Let him know you’re thankful for his dedication to you. Being loyal in a partnership is expected, but it doesn’t hurt to let your man you appreciate his dedication to you. In a world where betrayal seems common, tell him that he makes you feel lucky. If you have a family together, tell him you appreciate his dedication to your children. Let him know that his dedication makes a big difference in your family’s life. [7] X Research source For example, you could say “I see how much hard work you put in for this family. That hard work does not go unnoticed by anyone.”"

    {
      "title": "Do something he likes.",
      "content": "Do something he likes. Outside of telling him that you appreciate his interests and talents, try to do something with him. It will be a confidence boost for him to know that you want to learn more about what he spends time doing. If he likes to play baseball, ask him to teach you the basics. If he enjoys a certain video game, learn how to play it and then surprise him by playing it with him. It could also be something as simple as cooking him Italian food for dinner, even if it isn’t your favorite.

      "title": "Embrace his flaws.",
      "content": "Embrace his flaws. He may be having a hard time accepting his flaws, which brings his ego down. Pointing out flaws happens sometimes, but try to refrain from it. Instead, tell him you appreciate his flaws, and teach him how to appreciate them as well. Perhaps he can be a little too envious of people sometimes. Sure it’s annoying, but by embracing it, you can work together to fix the problem. If he’s a little insecure, you could say “I know you feel a little less than confident sometimes, but understand that you don’t need to feel that way. I think you're great. Either way, we can work together to help you overcome that feeling.” Some flaws shouldn’t be embraced. For example, maybe he’s wildly jealous to the point where you lose friends. This is a flaw that should be pointed out and changed as soon as possible."

      "title": "Let the small things go.",
      "content": "Let the small things go. Yeah, it’s difficult to let small problems go sometimes. Maybe he keeps leaving his wet towel on the bathroom floor. Or, he dropped the eggs even after you told him to be extra careful with that bag. Things happen. Sure, there are some things that shouldn’t be let go, but try to let the small things go. It will make him feel more confident if every mistake he made isn’t called out. [8] X Research source If certain problems persist, like not cleaning up after himself, it’s okay to gently bring up the problem. Try to avoid nagging."

      "title": "Ask him for help.",
      "content": "Ask him for help. You are, of course, a capable and independent person, but it often makes a man feel good to know that you need him. It’s not necessary to ask him to ask for help for every little thing, or it could get annoying for him. Instead, occasionally ask for him to help with a problem you’re absolutely sure he would know how to solve. [9] X Research source For example, if his job is fixing computers, ask him to help with your slow computer. If he’s great at fixing things, ask him to fix a wobbly table."
