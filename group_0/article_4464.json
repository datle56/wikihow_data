      "content": "Call for help if you think the threat is viable. If there’s any chance that your partner could seriously follow through with their suicidal threats, dial 911 or another emergency number to get them support. If you aren’t completely sure if their threat is serious, call your local suicide prevention hotline for guidance. [1] X Research source In the United States and Canada, 988 is the official suicide prevention hotline—they also have a chat-based site . Visit the International Suicide Hotlines website to access an international directory of hotlines. In some cases, threats of suicide are used as a form of emotional manipulation. In any case, it’s always a good idea to call for help in case the threat is serious. Try not to challenge or argue with your partner about their suicide threats. If they feel like you aren't taking them seriously, they may hurt themselves just to prove you wrong."

However, make it just as clear that their threats aren’t fair to you, and that they put you in an uncomfortable position. [3] X Research source “Your safety is really important to me, but I don’t feel comfortable being put in this position.” “I understand that you aren’t feeling good, but I wish we could find a different resolution to this situation.” “I care about you and want you to be safe, but I don’t feel like I’m being put in a very fair position.”"

Gently remind your partner of this fact if they threaten to take their own life— let them know that you’re there to support them , but that you can’t force them to do or not do anything. [4] X Research source “You mean a lot to me, and I’m happy to help you find a counselor to meet with if you think that would help. However, this choice is completely yours—I won’t make you do anything you aren’t interested in doing. “I feel hurt and a little helpless when you threaten to hurt yourself like this. I want you to be safe, but that decision belongs to you, not me.” “I’m really sorry to hear that you’re struggling, but making threats like this isn’t fair or healthy. I don’t want to be in a relationship that’s ruled by fear.”"

      "content": "Ignore any of your partner’s demands to “prove” your loyalty. Your partner might make a lot of comments about how you’re somehow responsible for their self-harm, or that you need to somehow “prove” your love by helping them with a crisis. Healthy relationships aren’t rooted in a sense of fear or obligation but in one of mutual respect. If your partner tries to guilt you into thinking otherwise, they are completely in the wrong. [5] X Research source Statements like “If you loved me, you wouldn’t let me hurt myself” are good examples of this. At the end of the day, a person’s mental health and sense of mental well-being are their responsibility. It isn’t up to you, their friends, or anyone else to keep them safe."

[8] X Research source “I feel like this relationship isn’t good for my mental and emotional well-being, and I need to break things off to focus on myself.” “I don’t think this relationship is healthy, and I think we should go our separate ways.” “I realize that you have a lot on your plate right now, but I don’t think I have the emotional capacity to give you the support that you need.

This may be especially helpful if your ex-partner used threats of suicide to emotionally manipulate you. \"I broke up with my ex because they emotionally manipulated and abused me frequently.\" \"I ended my relationship because I felt more like a counselor and psychologist than a partner.\" \"I didn’t feel like my needs were being met or prioritized during my relationship, so I ended things.\""
