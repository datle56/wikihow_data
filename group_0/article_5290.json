Foods made from meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, soy products, nuts, and seeds are considered part of the protein food group. [1] X Research source The amount of protein you need in your diet depends on your age and sex. Adult women need about 5 ounces of protein daily. If you are pregnant, you may need more protein in your diet depending on your weight and stage of pregnancy. Talk to your doctor if you're concerned about protein intake during pregnancy. [2] X Research source Men under 50 need about 6oz of protein each day. After 50, men only need about 5oz of protein daily."

      "content": "Know how to roughly measure protein. Many people are unsure about what constitutes an ounce of protein. The answer depends on the type of protein you're consuming. [3] X Research source 1oz of meat, poultry, or fish should contain roughly 1oz of protein. With other food types, protein is diluted or combined with other nutrients within the food. This changes how protein is measured. 1/4 cup of cooked beans contains about 1oz protein. One egg is 1oz of protein. A tablespoon of peanut or other nut butter also counts an ounce. Half an ounce of nuts or seeds counts as an ounce of protein."

      "content": "Calculate your total daily calories of protein. For fitness, you may need a rough sense of how many of your daily calories come from protein. This can help you calculate things like your macronutrient requirements. It's fairly simple to determine how many of your daily calories come from protein. Figure out how many total grams of protein you consumed in a given day. You can use an online calorie calculator to measure the grams of protein in any given food you consumed. You can also use nutritional labels. A gram of protein contains roughly 4 calories. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Multiply the total grams of protein by 4 to determine how many total calories in protein you consumed in a day. To convert ounces to grams, it can be helpful to use an online conversion system. The number of grams in an ounce is inexact, but it's somewhere around 28.3. It can be difficult to convert by hand and may be easier to do the conversion with an online system. You may also have to round numbers when converting ounces to grams. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Determine the percentage of calories from protein in a given food. It can also be helpful to know what percentage of calories from protein a given food contains. Start by multiplying the number of protein grams by 4 to figure out how many calories of protein the item has. Then, divide the number of protein calories by the total calories in the food and multiply the sum by 100. For example, say a food contains 200 calories and 8 grams of protein. Multiply 8 by 4, which is 32 protein calories. Divide 32 by 200, giving you 0.16. When multiplied by 100, this comes out to 16, so 16% of the calories in that food come from protein."

      "content": "Know your rough protein requirements. If you want to apply your knowledge to your diet, spend some time figuring out your rough protein requirements for a healthy diet. You can do this by talking to a doctor or fitness specialist about your diet, lifestyle, and any goals you have regarding fat loss or weight loss. A fitness specialist or doctor can help you figure out roughly how many calories from protein you should eat and if what is a high or low percentage protein in a given food based on your specific needs. [8] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source It is generally accepted that your diet should consist of 40% carbohydrates, 40% protein, and 20% fat. [9] X Trustworthy Source National Institutes of Health U.S. government agency for biomedical and public health research Go to source This will vary depending on your diet, so do consult your doctor or dietitian. However, becoming aware of the percentage of protein you are getting in your diet can be useful as many people have too much of at least one of these macronutrients."
