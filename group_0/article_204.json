      "content": "it’s easier to grow and move on when you accept your feelings. Whatever type of change is unsettling you, take time to sit with yourself and examine those feelings. Change will come whether you feel ready for it or not, but you can decide how you respond to it. If you let your feelings about the change overwhelm you, you’ll likely struggle to move on—so embrace those feelings instead. [1] X Research source If a loved one has passed away, give yourself the time you need to grieve. If you’ve lost your job, let yourself feel mad, disappointed, or upset. If you feel like your community is changing in a negative way, articulate that to friends and look for ways you can help it."

      "content": "It’s hard to accept change if you don’t know why it bothers you so much. Take the time to think about the situation and look inward; it may help you better understand yourself. As a result, this might alleviate some of your anxiety about change. Consider the following: [2] X Research source Does the death of a loved one make you face your own mortality? Does social change give you a feeling of uncertainty and make you feel like everything you know about the world is falling apart? Does breaking up with a significant other make you feel as if you're too emotionally fragile and lacking a support system?"

      "content": "It’s necessary for old things to go and new things to come in life. So, remind yourself not to expect constant stability. The entire history of the world and the history of humanity can be defined by continual change, evolution, and development. Change is part of life and existence, and change often brings new opportunities--sometimes good ones! [3] X Research source If you fixate on how a change limits you, it’ll be harder to work through your feelings; instead, remind yourself that you still have the freedom to decide your future. In other words, don’t spend all your energy trying to fight a change and return to how things were!"

      "content": "Take charge and find small ways to get yourself used to change. Change is inevitable—so why be unprepared for it? If you know that you need to change in order to grow, start making small, easy changes in your life that won’t scare or upset you—like setting a firm sleep schedule for yourself or drinking more water each day. [4] X Research source Easing into those smaller changes will make the big ones feel more manageable, too! If you don’t know what small changes to make, ask yourself about your current goals, strengths, weaknesses, or challenges. Is there a change that might help you in some way?"

      "title": "Putting change in perspective can stop you from getting overwhelmed.",
      "content": "Putting change in perspective can stop you from getting overwhelmed. You can get into a more optimistic mindset if you take the time to put things in perspective and reframe the situation by asking yourself some questions. Ask questions such as: “What is it that I believe will happen as a result of this change?” and “Are these thoughts accurate and realistic?” [5] X Research source Going through these questions can help you to determine if the change is really worth worrying about. Try starting a gratitude journal and list everything you’re grateful for in life, too. Among its many other benefits, practicing gratitude can help you feel happier, sleep better, and possibly even overcome trauma. Every day, jot down 10 things you’re grateful for, adding to the list every time you write. You can start with basic things like a place to sleep, food to eat, family, and so on. As your list continues, try to notice smaller things, like a beautiful sunset, a good cup of coffee, or a great phone call with a friend."

      "content": "Although change can have negative effects, there’s always an upside. Take this chance to use a loss or negative change to rediscover your zest for life. Remind yourself that change is how you’ll grow as a person, and there’s always some new opportunity to explore on the horizon. For example: [6] X Research source If you have a death in the family, think about all of the family members you have left. Let the experience be one that binds you together tighter as a family unit. If you lost your job, look at it as an opportunity to find a new job, a new career, or a new way of supporting yourself that brings you more fulfillment. If you're separating from a significant other, remember there are reasons for that. Both of you might be happier in the long run and better able to find fulfilling relationships."

Humor is a powerful tool—it can relieve stress and make you feel better, as well as the people around you. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Just make sure you’re making jokes that everyone can laugh at, and not poking fun at someone else’s problems. Understandably, some situations are hard to laugh at, so don’t try to force it. However, finding something to laugh at may bring you a little comfort in the midst of change."

      "content": "Affirmations can help you prepare for and come to terms with change. It’s important to find ways to be positive, even when change is making your life difficult—and affirmations can be a powerful tool. Spend a little time each day reciting affirmations to build a positive outlook for yourself and help you keep moving forward despite the changes happening in your life. [8] X Research source For example, you might use affirmations such as: I grow and improve a little every day. My life is full of potential. I’m allowed to have needs and take up space. I don’t need to be able to see the future to know that everything is going to be okay. My life is what I choose it to be, and I choose to make it wonderful."

      "content": "Try to view change as a challenge and a chance to grow. Remind yourself that you’re a strong person with a dynamic nature and that you'll be stronger as a result of this change. Also, keep in mind that change can be a powerful motivator to help you achieve your goals. [9] X Research source Try to use change as a motivation, if possible. For example, if you lose your job, you might use this change as motivation to go back to school or pursue a career you have always dreamed about."

      "content": "Use stress-reducing activities to help you find inner peace. Change can bring stress, and that’s okay—but try not to add to that stress. Instead, find ways to manage your stress and uneasiness. You might not get rid of the stress entirely, but you can prevent it from taking a heavier toll with activities proven to reduce stress, like practicing yoga , meditating , and exercising . [10] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source It may also help to ask yourself what your stress is helping you accomplish. After all, stress is a natural feeling that can help you power through all kinds of challenges. For example, stress might help you do high-quality work on a project or get out of a situation with a toxic family member. So, instead of worrying about how stressed you are, reminding yourself of how your stress is helping you navigate the situation may actually help you feel calmer."

      "content": "Staying busy may help contribute to positive changes in your life. If you’re going through a period in your life when change negatively impacts you, make yourself busy —with work, making something, tackling a project, or spending time with other people. Staying busy can distract you from the situation and enable you to do something productive instead. [11] X Research source Making yourself busy will help you move on and think about other aspects of your life, and it may even open up new opportunities for you! Try finding a new hobby—something you've never done before. Finding pleasure in a new activity can help you enjoy life after the change."

      "content": "Remind yourself of the things that are most important to you. What do you value above all else in life? Is it family, friends, work, religious or cultural practices, creativity, a specific hobby, or something else? When your world feels turbulent and full of change, focusing on your values can help determine how you behave and react. [12] X Research source Ask yourself what values you can apply to your life, and use them as the foundation for navigating the change. For example, if you value a hobby, you might focus on that hobby when you’re feeling overwhelmed. If you value kindness and expressing gratitude, you might focus on doing acts of kindness and communicating your gratitude for the people you care about."

      "content": "Discuss how (and why) the change unsettles you so much. Your friends and loved ones can sympathize with you—and if you talk to them, they might also provide a new perspective that’ll alter your view of change and help you accept it more easily. Even if they’re just as distressed as you are, knowing that they’re in a similar situation can be comforting, and it may give you the strength to accept change and move on together. [13] X Research source On the other hand, it may help to talk more about the actual problem than how you feel. When you stew in your anger or frustration, it may actually hinder you from moving on. Instead, once you acknowledge your feelings, ask someone for practical advice about what to do next. Get yourself in a problem-solving headspace so you don’t get stuck in a negative one."

By looking ahead and looking to the future, you’ll be able to better deal with the past and accept it as something that had to happen for you to move forward.

[15] X Research source Do your best to track your progress. That way, you can measure how close you are to each goal—and reflect on your efforts thus far. Remember: the overall idea is to get comfortable with change, so don’t be afraid to try new things or go on adventures here and there, especially if it coincides with your goals."

They can also lend you a hand when you need it and help you find opportunities or places to improve as you go.

Once you accept the change that makes you uncomfortable, determine what you'll do about it—and how you'll use those feelings to make an even better world. In this way, you're accepting change, turning it upside down, and using it to do good things! Consider doing the following: [17] X Research source Volunteering for a cause that you think is important. Helping someone in need that you know. Adopting a homeless pet."
