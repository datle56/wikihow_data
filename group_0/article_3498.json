      "content": "Follow the right educational path. The majority of United States congresspeople have at least a bachelor's degree. Many others have higher degrees in fields like law and business. When exploring your career path, think about different routes you could take that would eventually lead to a career in politics. Many senators and congresspeople have degrees in business and law. It may be worth it to get a law degree (Commonly known as the Juris Doctor Degree ) or MBA in addition to a bachelor's degree in business or pre-law. You can also try broader degrees, like political science, philosophy, and business, and then pursue a law degree. A few years of experience as a lawyer or businessperson may help with a political career. This is not required to run for Congress, however, it is very recommended to help you gain experience in the related field. However, not every member of congress pursues a business or law before politics. You can pursue a political career straight out of college. Think about pursuing a degree like a political science degree, or a degree in something like public policy or international relations, and launching your career from there."

[1] X Research source Volunteer. Volunteering is easy to do and can help you gain much of the necessary experience to be a congressperson. You can, for example, volunteer for a local political party.

[2] X Research source Get involved with organizations that are personally meaningful to you. Every congressperson runs on a particular platform, and you will want to show early commitment to that platform. For example, if religion is important to you, take a leadership position in your church. Join the vestry. If education is important to you, see if you can find a position on the local school board or PTA."

[3] X Research source You can try taking on a leadership position in a local political party. For example, volunteer to become the treasurer for your local Democrat or Republican party. You can also run for a local office. Requirements will vary from state-to-state, and between specific counties, so you'll have to check with a local courthouse. However, running for, say, the local city council could help you become established in politics. Simply volunteering is also key. Often, you can get your foot in the door with local politics just by being a loyal volunteer. During election seasons, for example, offer to help with fundraising or to make phone calls."

      "content": "Pick a political party early on. Having party support can help you get elected.

Pick a party that lines up with your personal values and belief systems and that supports candidates with views similar to yours. Deciding on your party early on and sticking with it can help you become a congressperson. Review the policies of major political parties in the United States. Pay attention to how Democrats and Republicans tend to vote on big issues like healthcare, the environment, and education. See which side best represents your opinions and perspective. While most people in Congress are Democrat or Republican, you do not have to choose a major party if you don't agree with either platform. You can examine the views of alternative parties, such as the Green Party or the Libertarian Party."
