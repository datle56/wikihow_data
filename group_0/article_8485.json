Add around ⅛–¼ teaspoon (0.75–1.42 g) of iodine-free sea salt . Stir the solution together with a spoon until the salt completely dissolves. [1] X Research source Avoid mixing more salt into the water because the solution can irritate your piercing if it’s too concentrated. Alternatively, use a premixed saline solution if you don’t want to mix your own at home."

Once you soak your piercing, dip the end of a cotton swab into the saline solution. Gently rub the swab against any crust forming around your piercing to loosen it and break it apart.

If you have a little extra time during the late morning or early afternoon, do a shorter soak to keep your septum piercing clean and sterilized. [7] X Research source Do not soak your piercing more than 4 times a day because this can dry out your septum and increase the healing time. Do some of your daily cleaning in the shower by cupping water in your hands, dipping in the tip of your nose, and then blowing bubbles. Just make sure to clean with a saline solution a couple of times during the day too. [8] X Expert Source Karissa Sanford Body Piercing Specialist [v161168_b01] 29 October 2019."
