      "title": "Oil concentration",
      "content": "Oil concentration One of the main differences between perfume and cologne is the oil concentration. Perfume, also known as parfum in French, has a concentration of 20%-30%, while cologne has a concentration of 2%-4%. The oils within the fragrance can be either essential oils, derived from organic plant matter, like lavender or rose, or fragrance oils , which are synthetically created in a lab. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It may take a large amount of organic material to derive a very small amount of concentrated oil. For example, it takes 250 pounds of lavender flowers to make one pound of lavender oil. Fragrance, or synthetic, oils are made in a lab to mimic naturally occurring scents. On the label of a perfume or cologne bottle, you might see the umbrella term “parfum” or “fragrance.” These suggest that the oils are synthetic, suggesting a list of secret chemicals involved that companies don’t feel the need to disclose. Due to its increased oil concentration, perfume lasts up to 8 hours, while cologne only lasts 2-4. All fragrances are made up of essential or fragrance oils, alcohol, and water. Fragrances with higher levels of oil have longer-lasting effects."

      "title": "Longevity",
      "content": "Longevity Oil concentration dictates how long the scent will linger on the skin, so perfume typically lasts significantly longer than cologne. Once spritzed, perfume should last for up to 8 hours, while cologne lasts only about 2-4 hours. Depending on the person’s natural body chemistry and external factors, cologne may have to be regularly reapplied to maintain the scent. [2] X Research source Cologne may be a more desirable option during the summer months or when traveling to a tropical climate, as cologne is lighter and more refreshing on the skin than its heavier, oil-rich counterpart."

      "title": "Marketing",
      "content": "Marketing Although cologne has historically been associated with men and perfume with women, there is no real difference in terms of fragrance composition. There is a difference, however, in how these two fragrances were and are marketed. Cologne began being marketed toward men in the 19th century, strategically offering unique fragrances to entice both male and female demographics. [3] X Research source Cologne is simply a type of perfume, characterized by its lighter citrus notes, and able to be worn by both men and women. Although some companies are sticking to their gendered marketing of these fragrances, there is a new movement toward creating unisex scents."

      "title": "Complexity of notes",
      "content": "Complexity of notes Fragrance notes are the building blocks of perfume and cologne, offering different levels of sweetness, earthiness, and musk. Perfume is generally considered more complex than cologne, as it consists of top notes, heart notes, and base notes, offering a robust, intense sensory experience. Cologne, on the other hand, only has a few notes, resulting in a simpler scent profile. [4] X Research source Top notes are usually citrus-forward and only last a few minutes. These are the first impressions of the fragrance. Also known as middle notes, heart notes make up 70% of the fragrance. They provide big, luscious oil-based scents like jasmine, pepper, and cardamom, and tend to linger the longest. Base notes hold up the foundation of the fragrance, lasting as long as heart notes. Common base notes include vanilla, amber, and cedarwood."

      "title": "Price",
      "content": "Price Since perfume is richer in essential oils and is designed to last much longer than cologne, the price point tends to reflect that. However, there are other factors to consider when purchasing fragrances, including sourcing, packaging, and marketing, as celebrity endorsements can certainly make a difference! Still, there are fragrances for every budget, so focusing on personal preferences, duration of wear, and occasion is key. Perfumes and colognes containing essential oils can vary in price depending on how rare the source plant is, how much oil the fragrance should contain, and how difficult it is to mine."

      "content": "Attar Also known as ittar, attar is an essential oil extracted from plants. This is typically done via steam, then distilled into a wooden vessel, aged from 1-10 years. Attar is considered to be the purest form of perfume, free of alcohol or other additives. Derived from “itir”, the Persian word for “perfume,” attars are very popular in the Islamic world due to their absence of alcohol. [5] X Research source Concentration: 100% Longevity: 6-24 hours Application: Dab attar on your wrists, ear lobes, or neck. Attar may stain your clothes, so be careful when applying."

      "content": "Extrait de Parfum French for “perfume extract,” this is the second most concentrated form of perfume available. It has a very potent and long-lasting scent, and usually consists of very expensive ingredients, like saffron, oud, and ambergris, which is a waxy solid substance created in a sperm whale’s digestive system.

      "content": "Perfume Perfume, or “parfum,” offers the third strongest concentration of oils and is the most commonly purchased kind of fragrance. Perfume strikes a perfect balance between intensity and longevity. Perfume is less diluted by water than eau de parfum, so the price tag tends to be on the heftier side since it lingers longer on the skin. Concentration: 20-30% Longevity: 6-8 hours Application: Spray on desired areas; may need to be reapplied."

    {
      "title": "Eau de parfum",
      "content": "Eau de parfum The French term “eau” means “water,” and “parfum” means “perfume,” so together, it’s describing a perfumed water. Although this type of fragrance is more diluted by water than perfume, these bottles still contain a good amount of fragrance oil, making for a stronger, longer-lasting scent perfect for romantic nights out— or in! Concentration: 10-15% Longevity: 4-8 hours Application: Spray on desired areas; will likely need to be reapplied after several hours."

      "content": "Eau de toilette The French term “toilette” refers to the act of washing and grooming yourself for the day ahead. Eau de toilette is a fresh, water-based fragrance, made up of less essential oils than eau de parfum. Akin to a body spray or body mist, eau de toilettes are designed to perfume your hair and body without leaving behind any oily residue or potent smell. [7] X Research source Concentration: 10% Longevity: 2-4 hours Application: Spray on hair and clothes; will need to be reapplied throughout the day."

      "title": "Eau de cologne",
      "content": "Eau de cologne Translating into “cologne water,” this fragrance often showcases herbal, citrus, and earthy notes, perfectly embodying the unisex quality of cologne. However, it has the second lowest concentration of oils of all the fragrances, so it’s best reserved for the simple purpose of freshening up a bit, especially on a warm, humid day. Concentration: 2-5% Longevity: 1-2 hours Application: Spray on hair, clothes, and skin for a quick refresh."

    {
      "title": "Eau fraiche",
      "content": "Eau fraiche This type of fragrance contains the least amount of essential oils. It translates into “fresh water” and is the least potent and shortest-lasting fragrance of them all, which comes with a very affordable price point to match. This is a great option for beach days or to lightly freshen up anytime. Concentration: 1-3% Longevity: 2 hours Application: Spray on hair, clothes, and skin as needed."

      "content": "Perfume has been around for thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians burned resin to perfume the chambers where bodies were kept. They later began implementing perfume in their daily life, prioritizing hygiene and bathing with essential oils. In Ancient Rome, rosewater was used to disguise the malodorous streets, and the Greeks used similar perfuming methods themselves. [8] X Research source Figures of the ancient world, like King David, were said to have perfumed their clothes with aloe and cassia. The custom of smelling good extended into Asia, with Persia and China following suit. The Chinese loved incense in particular, associating certain scents with promoting wellness in the body. Royalty also took to the practice of perfumery. King Louis XI historically smelled like musk, orange flower, and musk, while Marie Antoinette preferred a more floral palette of hyacinth, violet, and jonquil. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Today, fragrances still hold a special place in cultures all over the world. In France, perfume is an important part of the French identity. The French classically opt for muskier, spicier scents that represent the rich tapestry of French fashion history. The further south you go, the fresher the notes will be, as that reflects the beachy Mediterranean. In the Middle East, people used to perfume their clothes via smoke, which lent itself to create a dark, earthy, and exotic scent palette. [10] X Research source In Southeast India, notes of rose, oud, and saffron are very popular, emulating the scents and flavors of the region. In America, floral and vanilla notes reign supreme, with American audiences preferring scents that are fruity, sweet, and citrusy."

If you have a base pH level and darker skin, you are more likely to be receptive to spicy, musky, and leathery fragrances, and they’ll last longer on your skin type, too! If you have more acidic skin, it might be best to go for a fragrance with citrus, floral, and earthy notes. [11] X Research source"

Their proximity to one another on the wheel denotes how similar they are, with fresh and floral being side-by-side, and woody and amber taking up the other half. [12] X Research source Common florals include jasmine and rose, while common ambers include vanilla and myrrh. Popular wood scents include patchouli and sandalwood, while popular fresh notes include citrus and bergamot. Identify which of these is your preferred scent family and go from there!

Perfume can be considered more of an immersive experience, reserved for special occasions where you can show off your signature scent. Perfume is also more expensive, potentially resulting in less frequent use. [13] X Research source Remember: there’s no truth to the gendered myth about cologne being only for women and perfume for women. You could choose to wear unisex cologne daily, and pick out a more elevated, longer-lasting perfume for date nights, celebrations, or other special occasions."
