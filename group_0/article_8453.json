      "content": "Cool the unit. Before cleaning, allow the unit to cool entirely with all components in place. The unit should be allowed to cool on its own. Do not introduce water or other agents to help cool the machine. Unplug the machine while allowing it to cool. While many machines can cool in as little as an hour, it may be advisable to let the machine sit for a few hours or overnight to allow it to cool completely."

      "title": "Wash the cover and melter.",
      "content": "Wash the cover and melter. Wash the cover, the butter melter cup, and any other removable components with dish soap or a mild detergent and warm water. Unless the manufacturer’s manual specifically states the components are dishwasher safe, wash all components by hand. [1] X Research source Do not wash any electrical or non-removable components with water, as this could cause damage to the maker. Use a sponge or washcloth to wash the removable components. Do not use steel wool or other scouring instruments. Allow the components to dry completely on a drying rack or on the counter before replacing them."
