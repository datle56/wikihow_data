      "title": "Find some affordable laptops.",
      "content": "Find some affordable laptops. Your parents are unlikely to buy you an expensive laptop, especially if you've never had a laptop before. Before asking your parents for a laptop, do some research. Find some affordable laptops with good reviews. You can read reviews online or in magazines about computers and electronics. If your parents see you've made a plan, they may be more likely to say \"Yes\" to your request. Many of the more expensive laptops cost over $1,000, but you can find a lot of suitable laptops for under $500. Think about your needs. Pick a laptop you can use for things your parents would approve of, like schoolwork. You can, for example, look for a laptop with built in word processing features. Try to find a laptop that's durable. Your parents may feel it would be a bad idea to buy you a laptop as you may break it. Look for laptops with a reputation for withstanding a lot of damage. Find a laptop that does not require a lot of maintenance. Your parents won't want to buy you something that will be breaking down a lot."

      "content": "Identify the benefits of a laptop. You want your parents to see how a laptop can help you. They're unlikely to invest a lot of money in something you'll just use recreationally. Find reasons your laptop can help you be more responsible. [1] X Research source Jot down the academic benefits of a laptop. You can talk about how a laptop can help you prepare for school. You can show your parents software and games that help you learn subjects like math, English, and science. See if there are any apps you can find that help you maintain a schedule. Maybe there's a to-do list app that could help you keep track of your homework, for example."

      "content": "Address potential concerns. Your parents may have reservations about getting you a laptop. They may worry that it will distract from school or have safety concerns. Think of ways you can counter these concerns when asking for your laptop. [2] X Research source Your parents may worry about you spending too much time in front of a screen, which can cause problems with eyesight and posture. Your parents may also worry you'll become inactive if you have a laptop. You can tell them you'd be willing to only use the laptop for a set time each day. You can also make sure you know how to use the laptop correctly. Promise your parents you'll keep proper posture when using your laptop. You should also promise to look away from the screen every 20 minutes when using the computer, which is healthier for your eyes. Also, let them know you'd be happy to let them install security software and parental controls to make sure you're using the laptop safely."

      "title": "Show you're responsible.",
      "content": "Show you're responsible. Your parents will be more willing to give in to a request if they think you've earned it. As you prepare to ask your parents, work on showing how responsible you are. A high level of maturity and personal responsibility will reflect well on you when making the request. [3] X Research source Find small ways to show you're responsible. Clean your dishes after dinner without being asked. Do a small household chore for one of your parents. If you show that you embrace responsibility, this will make you look mature. This can reflect highly on you when you ask for a laptop."

      "content": "Choose a good time to talk. Once you feel your case is ready, find a time to talk. You want to make sure you pick the right time to stop your parents to ask. A time when one or both of your parents are stressed is not a good time. [4] X Research source Think about when your family has free time throughout the day. If Tuesday nights are always packed, do not ask then. However, maybe your parents usually have downtime Wednesdays shortly after dinner. This may be a good time to ask. Try to eliminate distractions when asking. Wait until the television is turned off and neither one of your parents are busy with electronic devices like cellphones. It's best to wait if you've recently gotten into an argument with one or both of your parents. Not only will they likely be stressed, but you may be as well, and your discussion may end up not being productive. Wait a few days until you've all had a chance to cool down before asking."

      "content": "Practice what to say first. If you're nervous, practicing can help. Stand in front of a mirror and rehearse what you plan to say to your parents.

      "title": "Be direct.",
      "content": "Be direct. Asking directly will show you're mature, and help the discussion progress effectively. Get to the point right away, and provide the details you gathered that help make your case. [6] X Research source Start off the conversation introducing what you want. For example, \"I would really like a laptop or computer of my own.\" From there, state your case. Bring up the benefits of a laptop. For instance, \"I think it could help with schoolwork. Sometimes, I have papers to write, but Sam is using the computer for her homework. My own laptop would just make that easier.\" Remember to address any potential concerns. For example, \"I know you might worry about me being locked in my room all day, but I would be happy to limit my computer time to a few hours each day if you want.\""

You want them to feel valued when you ask them for a laptop. [7] X Research source Express how much you appreciate what your parents do. You can say something like, \"I know how hard you guys work to afford everything I have. I really appreciate that, and I know a laptop is not cheap.\" This way, you'll sound mature and grateful. Your parents will know that you've really thought a lot about why you need a laptop and are not just asking on a whim. You understand how much these items cost."

Your parents will appreciate knowing their voices have been heard in the conversation. You can try briefly summarizing what your parents said to make it clear you understood. For example, \"I understand you're worried about my physical health. You don't want me sitting indoors all day wasting time online.\""

      "title": "Avoid arguing or whining.",
      "content": "Avoid arguing or whining. You never want to steer the conversation into an unproductive direction. Do not argue with your parents or complain. This will only make your parents less likely to listen to you. If you feel the conversation is not getting anywhere, end the conversation and do something to blow off steam. Go for a walk, for example, instead of blowing up at your parents. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "See if you can find a compromise. Offer a compromise in as mature a manner possible. If you present a clear, concrete compromise, your parents may be able to meet you halfway. [11] X Research source Make the terms clear. Do not say, \"If you let me have a laptop, I won't use it that often.\" Instead, go for specific timeframes. For example, \"How about if I have a laptop, I will only use it for 2 hours a day and I'll make a point of turning it off an hour before bed.\" You can also suggest appropriate punishments in the event you break the conditions of the compromise. For example, \"You can take the laptop away for a week if I use it for more than two hours in one day.\""

In the event you get a \"No\" for an answer now, accept as much. Say something like, \"Thank you for listening anyway. I appreciate that.\" [12] X Research source You can try asking again in a few months. If your parents see you're mature enough to gracefully accept a \"No,\" they may reconsider in the future."
