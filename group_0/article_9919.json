      "content": "Salt the goose breasts and bring them to room temperature. Remove 2 goose breasts from the refrigerator and sprinkle them with salt. Leave the breasts to sit out at room temperature for 20 to 40 minutes. [1] X Research source Use around 1/4 teaspoon (1.5 g) of salt for each 1 pound (450 g) of meat."

      "content": "Preheat the oven to 375 °F (191 °C) and cut slashes across the skin. Take a paper towel and pat the breasts dry. Then take a sharp knife and carefully make slices about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart that just go through the skin. Score the breasts in a crosshatch pattern. [2] X Research source Scoring the skin will help the fat render as the goose breasts cook. This will make crispy skin that's delicious to eat. If you're cooking wild goose, skip scoring the breasts since they're probably not as fatty."

      "title": "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.",
      "content": "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place an oven-safe skillet on the stove and turn the burner to medium-high. Pour 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil into the skillet and let it heat for about 1 minute. It's important to heat the oil in the skillet so the goose breasts instantly begin to sear when you add them. Want a crispier skin? Opt for medium-low heat instead of medium-high. The fat will have more time to render so you’ll get a firmer texture. Just make sure you cook the goose thoroughly!"

      "title": "Sear the goose breasts for 8 minutes.",
      "content": "Sear the goose breasts for 8 minutes. Sprinkle a little ground pepper over each breast and lower them into the hot skillet. Cook the breasts over medium-high heat without moving or turning them. Once they've cooked for 4 minutes, use tongs to flip them over and let them cook for another 4 minutes. The outside of the breasts should be browned and crisp. Keep in mind that they won't be finished cooking at this point."

[4] X Research source If you want a stronger barbecue flavor, leave out the pineapple and green pepper. Then add 1 ⁄ 2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of liquid smoke and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of molasses. You could also make a teriyaki flavor by substituting teriyaki sauce for the barbecue sauce and add more soy sauce according to your taste."
