[6] X Research source Try to avoid embellishing or lying on a resume. For example, say you have five years of experience when you mean five months. Do not leave off your interests section. It can humanize you and show why you are an interesting person beyond your work. Do not leave off a summary statement or an objective statement.

As a Flex driver, you will likely work in 2- to 4-hour shifts making deliveries for Amazon Prime Now, AmazonFresh, and Amazon Restaurants. [9] X Research source The Flex smartphone app provides locations and driving directions for all your pick-ups and deliveries. Most AmazonFresh and Amazon Prime Now orders are picked up at a Prime Now Delivery Station and delivered to the residence or business indicated on the app. For Amazon Restaurants orders, the app indicates a designated Waiting Area for you to begin. Once you arrive at the Waiting Area, select “I’ve Arrived” in the app. The Flex app then provides further instructions on how to pick up and deliver the order. [10] X Research source As a Flex delivery driver, Amazon pays for your entire shift, regardless of how long your deliveries take you. If you sign up for a 3-hour delivery block, for example, and you get done with your deliveries in 2 hours, you still get paid for your 3-hour shift. But, if you do not finish all the deliveries during your block, Amazon does not compensate for the extra time. [11] X Research source"
