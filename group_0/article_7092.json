[1] X Research source A rich fuel mixing with little oxygen in the exhaust leads to a typical voltage of 0.8 to 0.9 through the sensor's platinum electrodes. A lean fuel mixture with more oxygen in the exhausts causes the voltage to drop 0.1 to 0.3 volts. A balanced air and fuel mixture averages around 0.45 volts."

[2] X Research source Honda oxygen sensors usually last at least 50,000 miles (80,000 km), but older cars, or contaminated sensors, may affect their ability to reduce emissions. The sensors should be checked at these intervals: Unheated oxygen sensors (1976 to early 1990 models): Every 30,000 to 50,000 miles (48,000 to 80,000 km). The first generation of heated oxygen sensors (mid-1980s to mid-1990s): Every 60,000 miles (97,000 km). The second generation of heated oxygen sensors (since the mid-1990s): Every 100,000 miles (160,000 km)."

The number of Honda oxygen sensors doubled when Onboard Diagnostics II was developed in the mid-1990s. Check for extra oxygen sensors near the catalytic converter."

A Honda oxygen sensor may fail if it becomes contaminated by silicone (from gasket sealers), phosphorus or lead. Check oxygen sensors for other causes of failure, including mechanical stress or environmental factors such as road splash."

[4] X Research source If the voltage stays steady below 0.45, it is steady low. If the voltage stays steady above 0.45, it is steady high. Allow air to enter the PCV valve. If this moves the voltage to less than 0.3, the sensor is probably good."
