      "content": "Address the letter to the recipient. The recipient’s address goes on the side of the envelope without a flap. Write the postal code in the boxes at the top. [1] X Research source The mailing address should be written beneath the postal code boxes, top-to-bottom, right-to-left. After the address, write the recipient’s name. [2] X Research source Organize address information from largest to smallest. An out-of-country letter might be addressed: JAPAN, Tochigi-ken, Utsunomiya-shi, Minemachi, 2-chome, 1. The order of information is more important than its location on certain lines. Kanji (Japanese pictograms) can shorten some addresses to a single line, while others might take several. The postal codes used in Japanese addresses generally contain 7 digits (as in: 123 - 4567). Since few Japanese streets have names, a street name is rarely included."

Whether it’s a handwritten message to a pen pal or Christmas pictures to your host family, you don’t want your envelope being sent to the wrong place. Perform an online search for the address to make sure you’ve written everything correctly. Be sure to write “Japan” very prominently with the recipient’s address information. To make it especially hard to miss, write it in caps! [3] X Research source If you’re concerned you might have made a mistake, you might be able to cut and paste the address written out in Japanese from an online map search ."

Write your address above the rightmost box in the same top-to-bottom, right-to-left pattern as before. Follow the address with your name. [4] X Research source When sending a letter to Japan from a foreign country, make sure you clearly write your home country in English. This will increase the chances of the letter being returned should it be undeliverable. The format of your return address does not have to follow the Japanese style of large-to-small if you live outside of Japan. [5] X Research source"

For those of you writing from outside of Japan: is your home country clearly written? If so, turn it over to the side with the recipient’s address (the flapless side) and put a stamp in the upper left corner. [6] X Research source You should only need postage from your home country to send an envelope to Japan, though this may differ from country to country. Ask at your local post office. [7] X Research source Postage is weight-rated inside Japan. Expect a two-sheet letter in a normal envelope to cost about 90 yen or 110 yen airmail. [8] X Research source"

Follow that with the recipient’s address, moving from the largest unit of information to the smallest (country, prefecture, city…). Follow this with the recipient’s name. [9] X Research source Because horizontal envelopes carry a Western association, they are generally written according to Western convention: left-to-right, top-to-bottom. If you’re mailing this letter from outside of Japan, make sure you clearly write “Japan” at the top of the address."

If you’re sending the letter from outside of Japan, clearly indicate your home country in English at the top of your address. [10] X Research source It’s a matter of preference, but some people write the address on the flapless side and the return address on the flap side, similar to how one would for a vertical envelope.

      "content": "Follow Japanese polite writing practices. Your writing says a lot about you in Japanese culture, so you should take your time when writing messages by hand. Avoid pencil or marker and write in blue or black ink. White stationery is preferred, especially if you’re sending a letter to a superior. Avoid writing messages or names in red ink, as this can carry negative implications for many Japanese."
