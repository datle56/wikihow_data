[1] X Expert Source Deanna Dawson-Jesus, CD (DONA) Birth & Postpartum Doula, Childbirth, & Lactation Educator Expert Interview. 31 July 2020. A warm touch or a kind word can let your child know how much you really care about them. Here are some ways to show love and affection: Give your child a cuddle, a kiss on the cheek, big hug, or even just a warm touch on their shoulder to show encouragement and appreciation. Tell them you love them every day, even if you're upset with them."

[2] X Research source For instance, you might hope that your child will be athletic. If they're not really interested in sports, though, it's important to let them know that that's okay, and work with them to find an activity that better suits their interests. Similarly, don't make your child feel bad if it takes them a while to warm up to people, even if you're very outgoing yourself."

Instead, make time to take your child to do fun things—even something as simple as eating an ice cream cone in the park can create a sweet memory that will last much longer than any toy.

When they do something good, let them know that you've noticed and that you're very proud of them. If you don't give them the confidence they need to be out in the world on their own, then they won't feel empowered to be independent or adventurous. [4] X Research source Be specific in your praise to let them know exactly what is being appreciated. For example, instead of saying, \"Good job!\" you might say, \"You did great taking turns with your sister while playing,\" or \"Thank you for cleaning up the toys after playing with them!\" Make it a point to praise your children's accomplishments and good behavior more than their natural talents. That will help them learn to value taking on a tough challenge. Try to get in the habit a habit of praising your children more often than you give them negative feedback. Though it's important to tell your children when they're doing something wrong, it's also important to help them build a positive sense of self. In addition, if you focus too much on bad behavior, your children may act out more as a way to get your attention.

If you constantly compare your child to other kids, it might make them feel like they can never be good enough in your eyes. It might even hold them back from finding success later on. [6] X Research source Instead of comparing them to other kids, help your children learn how to meet goals on their own terms, and encourage them to follow the path that works for them. Comparing one child to their siblings can lead your children to develop a rivalry. Try to nurture a loving relationship between your children, not a competitive one. Don't show favoritism between your children, either—if they're arguing, be fair and neutral."

It's important to have open communication with your kids, so be sure you take the time to stop and listen when they come to you with questions or concerns. In addition, express interest in your children and involve yourself in their life. This will help create an atmosphere in which your children can come to you with a problem, however large or small. Practice active listening with your children so they know you're paying attention to them. Look at them while they talk to you, and show them you're following along by nodding and making affirmative statements, such as \"Uh huh,\" \"I understand,\" or \"Keep going.\" When it is your turn to speak, paraphrase what you heard them say before you respond. [7] X Research source For instance, you could say, \"It sounds like you're saying that this week's chore list is unfair.\" Try setting aside a specific time to talk to each child every day. This can be before bedtime, at breakfast, or during a walk after school. Treat this time as sacred and avoid checking your phone or getting distracted. For instance, during dinner you might ask your child to share something they learned at school. [8] X Expert Source Kathy Slattengren, M.Ed. Parent Educator & Coach Expert Interview. 27 July 2021."

It's really important for kids to feel like they're important to their parents, so intentionally carve out time to spend with each of your children. During that time, plan something fun to do together, like going for a walk, getting a snack, or putting together a puzzle. While you're doing that, give your child your full attention—talk to them and listen to what they have to say. Even just casually spending time together can be really meaningful to them. Try to divide your time equally if you have more than one child. However, keep in mind that you don't have to do the same thing with each one—maybe one of your children loves roller skating, for instance, while the other would be happiest with a trip to the library. Be engaged with their schoolwork as well. For example, when you can, try to attend school functions, do homework with your children, and monitor their grades to get a sense of how they are doing in school. You can also join a Parent Teacher Association (PTA) if you'd like to be more involved in their education. [9] X Expert Source Kathy Slattengren, M.Ed. Parent Educator & Coach Expert Interview. 27 July 2021. Be careful not to stifle or smother your children, however—give them time to themselves, too.

This will teach them to honor their own space and to respect the privacy of others. It will also give them a sense of stability, and it will help build trust between the two of you. Allow your child to maintain their personal space and accept that it's normal for them to sometimes keep secrets from you, especially as they get older. You can balance this by having an open door policy so that they can approach you if they need help with an issue."

Your boss may or may not remember that you missed that meeting, but your child will most certainly remember that you didn't attend the play they were in. [10] X Research source If something happens and you have to miss an important milestone, let your child know that you're really sorry you missed it, and make it up to them with a special celebration.

Make sure these rules are appropriate for your child's age. Remember, your rules and guidelines should help your child develop and grow, but they shouldn't be so strict that they feel like they can't do anything right. [12] X Research source For example, if you have a younger child, you might have rules like \"Don't go outside without a grownup,\" with the consequence of being grounded indoors if they break that rule. For older children, you might set rules about helping around the house, and you might take away a privilege like screen time if they don't do their chores. Listen to your child's feedback about the rules they have to follow, but remember—you are the parent. Children need boundaries. A child who has been allowed to behave as they please will struggle in adult life when they have to obey society's rules. Avoid overly harsh forms of punishment, and never do anything that involves physically hurting your child—in addition to being abusive, it can actually make behavioral problems worse.

If you're raising your children with someone else, it's important that your children think of you as a united front—two people who will both say \"yes\" or \"no\" to the same things. If your kids think that their mother will always say yes and their father will say no, then they'll probably learn to play off of that to get what they want. [17] X Research source This doesn't mean that you both have to agree 100% about everything having to do with the kids. But it does mean that you should work together to solve problems that involve the children, instead of being pitted against each other. Try not to argue with your spouse or co-parent in front of the children. Children may feel insecure and fearful when they hear their parents bickering. Instead, try to show them that when people disagree, they can discuss their differences peacefully."

For example, you should have set bedtimes and wake-up times, serve meals at about the same time each day, and schedule a time for things like homework and play. [18] X Research source Here are some ways that you can provide order for your children: Keep up with your own hygiene, such as showering and caring for your teeth, and teach your child that the same is expected of them.

However, reassure them that you still love and care about them, even though you're not happy with that behavior. That way, they'll be more likely to feel like they're can change how they're acting, while still feeling loved and supported. For instance, if you catch your child being mean to their sibling, don't say, \"You're so bad!\" Instead, say something like, \"It's hurtful to call people names, so I think you should apologize to Anna.\" Be assertive yet kind when you're pointing out what your child has done wrong. Be stern and serious, but not cross or mean, when you tell them what you expect. If they misbehave in public, take them aside, and scold them privately.
