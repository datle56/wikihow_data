      "content": "Aries men thrive on passion, and Aquarius women are driven by logic. In many ways, Aquarius women and Aries men are emotional opposites. Aries is volatile, with lots of emotional ups and downs; their anger burns hot but fizzles out just as fast.

[2] X Research source Despite their very different emotional dispositions, an Aries-Aquarius pair can balance one another out and help each other grow! Aries, you’re impulsive and confident. You can help Aquarius trust her intuition and let loose a little more instead of relying solely on logic to make all her decisions. Aquarius, you’re rational and innovative; you can help Aries to think outside the box and find solutions to his problems that he might not have seen without your guidance."

      "title": "Neither sign is very tender, so they may struggle with vulnerability.",
      "content": "Neither sign is very tender, so they may struggle with vulnerability. Because Aquarius women are so logical, they tend to come off as cold or aloof, even when they really do care for their partner. Aries men are more passionate but only show vulnerability when they’re comfortable with the other person; they might see Aqarius’s reserved manner as a sign that they don’t feel the same and withdraw as a result. Aries, the best way to ease your Aquarius into vulnerability is to let the relationship develop naturally from friends into lovers. An Aquarius woman is often more comfortable with friendship, so friendly bonding can help her lower her guard and relax around you before you introduce romance into the relationship. Aquarius, try checking in with your Aries man if he’s hesitant to be vulnerable around you . Ask something like, “How are you feeling?” or “What’s on your mind?” He’ll feel more comfortable with your encouragement."

      "content": "Both signs are honest, which leads to a lot of trust between them. Aries men are blunt, direct speakers, and Aquarius women believe in the value of honesty and integrity. In short, neither sign is prone to lying—they don’t see the point of doing so when they could say what’s on their minds instead! Trust develops easily in the relationship because each can count on the other to be honest at all times. [3] X Research source The only potential speedbump in their developing trust is Aries’ tendency towards jealousy, which can rear its head if they feel like Aquarius has eyes for someone else. Aquarius, your Aries guy just wants to know he’s special to you. If he seems jealous, you could try talking to him about it. Reassure him that he’s the only one for you, and tell him your desire for autonomy has nothing to do with your feelings for him. You can stop the jealousy and help Aries feel secure by talking things out."

      "content": "Aries’ possessiveness might clash with Aquarius’s need for freedom. Though Aries men are independent on their own, they can actually become quite attached to their partner. Between the two, Aries will usually crave commitment and closeness before an Aquarius woman will—and if Aries starts getting impatient, asking Aquarius for more commitment than they’re ready for, it might cause friction. [4] X Research source Aries, the best way to help an Aquarius woman embrace commitment is to show her that you respect her independent nature and understand that as much as she cares for you, she also needs time to herself. For example, if you ask what she’s doing over the weekend and she tells you she’s taking some alone time to finish a book, you could say, “Have fun! I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on it when you’re done.”"
