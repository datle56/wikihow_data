You will use stakes, flags, and other markers, as well as special measuring equipment. Once you have collected the data, you will then punch the information into a computer. This information can then be accessed by cartographers, engineers, and construction companies. [1] X Research source As a surveyor, you are part of a larger process and your primary role is to collect geographic data that will be utilized by other experts in the field. You will also need to have excellent math skills and be confident with recording data with accuracy and clarity. You should be able to clearly see distance and size in a landscape. You will often be working with other surveyors or in a team, so you also need to be able to work and communicate effectively with others."

Most surveyors are paid a stable salary wage for their work and receive employee benefits, especially if they work with a large surveying firm.
