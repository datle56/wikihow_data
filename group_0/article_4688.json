      "title": "Squat",
      "content": "Squat regularly. You can't build a better butt by only focusing on squats, but you should still do them. Squats may be the most effective total lower body exercise you can do. [1] X Research source Stand with your feet under your shoulders and slightly pointed outward. Keep your back straight and your eyes forward. If it helps, find a spot on the wall in front of you to focus on. Look at this spot throughout the entire squat. [2] X Research source Breathe in and start bending at the hips while pushing your butt back. As your knees start to bend keep pushing your hips back. [3] X Research source A proper squat should feel somewhat like sitting on your heels. Focus on keeping your knees lined up with your toes. [4] X Research source To execute a proper squat, make sure your hip joint is lower than your knees. Once you feel comfortable squatting, try to go deeper than this for a more intense workout. [5] X Research source Breathe out and drive your feet into the ground to bring yourself back up. Squeeze your glutes and push your hips forward until you're back to the starting position. [6] X Research source If you're knew to lifting, try working with just the bar to get a feel for the form. You can even do squats with just your body weight. These are \"air squats,\" and are an excellent way to warm up. [7] X Research source Once you start adding weight, aim for an amount you can lift for 5 full \"reps,\" or repetitions. Each time you squat and come back up is a full repetition. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Do lunges",
      "content": "Do lunges with weights. As with squats, keep your back straight and find a spot in front of you to focus on. Relax your shoulders. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart. Find a comfortable weight to hold in each hand. Take a step forward with one leg until your knee is bent at a 90-degree angle. Keep this front knee in line with your ankle. The knee of your back leg should also be bent at a 90-degree angle. Do not let it touch the floor. Pushing off with the heel of your front leg, return to the starting position and repeat with the other leg. [9] X Research source Try reverse lunges. Set up the basic starting position for lunges. Instead of taking a step forward, step backward. Keep your back straight as you would in a forward lunge. This requires a little more balance than the forward lunge. Make sure you're comfortable with your form before attempting a reverse lunge. Lunges are a good lower body exercise, but they can put a lot of strain on your knees. Take smaller steps if you feel pain in your knees. You can always work to increase your range of motion."

[10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source As you lift the rest of your body onto the platform, breathe out. [11] X Research source Place your lead leg back on the ground. Move your body off the platform until you are standing back in the starting position. As with lunges, you should alternate which leg you start each rep with. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Try deadlifts . Deadlifts are a compound exercise. They will work out your lower body, but they also help with core and back strength. [13] X Research source Stand up straight in front of a barbell with weights. Your feet should be under your shoulders and the bar should be over the middle of your feet. [14] X Research source Keeping your back straight and your hips in place, lean down and grab the bar. Your hands should be a little further apart than your legs. Once you have a good grip on the bar, lower your hips and bend your knees slightly. [15] X Research source To lift the weight off the ground, drive your feet down into the ground and pull up until you are standing upright. Inhale as you lift. [16] X Research source Keep everything tight as you lift the weight off the ground. Squeeze your butt, engage your core, and don't lean back. [17] X Research source Once you've lifted the weight off the ground, do not just drop the bar. To set the weight back down, reverse the movement you used to lift it. Keeping everything tight, push the hips back and begin bending the knees. Focus on a spot in front of you and move your entire body down at the same time. Do not lean forward and do not round your back. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Add calisthenics to your routine. Some exercises that require weights can be done without weights. If you don't have time to hit the gym, you can do calisthenics almost anywhere. To do an air squat, set up as if you were in front of the squat rack at the gym. Put your feet a little more than shoulder width apart, with your toes facing outward. Using the same form you would in weighted squats, lower your hips and push your butt back. To help keep your balance, push your arms out in front of you as you lower down. Lunges can be performed without weights very easily. The form is exactly the same with or without weights. To do a glute kickback, set up as if you were going to do a push-up, but stay on your knees. Lift one leg off the ground until your thigh is parallel to the ground. Keep your shin perpendicular to the ground and push your leg up. Lower you leg slowly and repeat with the other leg."

Keep your shoulders and arms on the floor. Push up using your heels and raise your hips up as high as possible. Hold at the top for two seconds. Slowly lower your body back to the ground. [19] X Research source Once you've mastered the short bridge, try doing a straight bridge. The straight bridge is a lot like a reverse push up. Sitting up with your legs straight in front of you, place your hands near your hips. Push your torso up and squeeze your butt. Hold for a few seconds before lowering back down. [20] X Research source To do a full bridge, lie flat on your back. Bend your knees and place your hands by your head. Lift your entire body off the ground and arch your back. Push your hips into the air and squeeze your legs, butt, and core. Take a deep breath and make sure you give everything a good stretch. Hold for a 1-2 seconds and then lower yourself back down.

Another variation is to lie flat on your back with your legs straight in front of you. Slowly lift your legs off the ground to a 90-degree angle. Hold for one second and then lower your legs taking care not to let them touch the ground."

For an added challenge, run up a hill. Hill sprints will improve your glutes by putting more stress on your hip flexors. [22] X Research source Running is a high impact activity and may not be good for your joints. If you can't run, try using an elliptical machine or a stationary bike."

When you rise from a squat position, or do any kind of thigh extension, this is the muscle you are using. [32] X Research source The gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus have similar functions. When running, they stabilize your leg as it hits the ground. They also help with thigh rotations. [33] X Research source"

These muscles get worked out during exercises such as the squat. The glutes also contain \"slow-twitch\" muscles, which respond to aerobic exercises and running."
