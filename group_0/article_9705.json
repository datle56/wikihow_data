The resulting image file will be the same size as the data on the disc (up to 800 MB for a CD, or 4.7 GB for a DVD). Oppido explains that creating an ISO from a disc is like taking an exact photo of the disc with a special camera that can then print an identical new disc from that photo. You can use that image to create boot discs, play games that require keeping a disc inserted when you don't have the physical disc, and much more."
