      "content": "Learn what Wiccan beliefs are. Wicca is based on a belief of the Goddess at the center of all life and creation. Some versions of Wicca weigh goddesses and gods equally, as there is a general sense in Wicca to believe in duality or balance in the universe. [1] X Research source There are no holy books or prophets or intermediaries. All who practice Wicca have direct access to the Goddess or the Divine, and the Divine lives in each person. [2] X Research source The Wiccan Rede, or creed, is the central tenet that most Wiccans follow, which is: “If You Harm None, Do What You Will.” This creed values the harmony with which one should live their life, and as long as your actions do not hurt others or infringe upon their ability to live their lives, then proceed as you will. The threefold rule is also central to Wiccan beliefs, which is the idea that whatever you do will come back to you threefold. This can happen in a positive or negative way. Wiccans take responsibility for their own actions. This is the belief that you have sole responsibility for your words and actions. You alone determine how you act and react to outside forces, and making amends to those who you have treated poorly is the best approach to taking responsibility. [3] X Research source Harmony with nature is a key aspect, as is the sacredness of all life. Wiccans recognize that people live in partnership with the earth and rely on the earth’s bounty to survive. Nature and life occur in a cycle, and people are very much part of that. Related to this is the belief in reincarnation in some form. Things in nature keep returning, whether it is sea water that returns as clouds or clouds that return as rain, and so on. This also influences how Wiccans perceive death; death is also a part of the cycle of nature. [4] X Research source There are many different forms of Wicca. According to Circle Sanctuary, “Hereditary, Shamanic, Gardnerian, Alexandrian, Celtic, Traditionalist, Dianic, Faerie, and Eclectic are just some of the variety of Wiccan traditions or paths.” These each have specific beliefs and rituals."

      "content": "Learn how Wiccans perform rituals and ceremonies. Wiccans prefer to perform rituals and celebrate outdoors where the connection to nature is closer. [5] X Research source Many rituals and celebrations revolve around the cycles of the moon, such as the full moon and new moon, as well as the changing of the seasons. There can be, however, complications related to weather and safety, which means that Wiccans must often perform rituals inside. Some rituals are performed as a gathering of Wiccans in a circle surrounded by candles. There may be an altar at the candle placed at the north end of the circle. This circle creates a space for healing energy and Wiccans gather within the circle. During this circle gathering, there may be healing, divination, discussion or other nature-based activities. Many ceremonies and rituals also include eating food and drinking wine or juice before the circle is dissolved and the ritual ends."

      "title": "Learn what Wicca is not.",
      "content": "Learn what Wicca is not. Wicca is not anti-Christian, nor is it against any other religion. It is sometimes known as pre-Christian since many of its beliefs are rooted in pagan practices of honoring the earth, honoring life and creation, and honoring the Goddess. You also don’t need to dress or look a certain way or act a certain way to be a Wiccan. Wiccan followers may be people from all walks of life, and there is no official look or behavior that absolutely defines all Wiccans."

      "title": "Understand the ethics behind Wicca.",
      "content": "Understand the ethics behind Wicca. This religion does not use magic to curse people or cast hurtful spells. As a Wiccan, you need to be responsible for your relationship to and use of magick. You live by a creed, or the Wiccan Rede, which is: “If You Harm None, Do What You Will.” If you live positively and in harmony with the earth, then you will be a successful Wiccan."

      "title": "Read books and other resources to more fully understand Wicca.",
      "content": "Read books and other resources to more fully understand Wicca. The best introduction to self-studying Wicca is to read and research about the religion. Some of the most influential books about Wicca include: “The Heart of Wicca” by Ellen Cannon Reed, “Wicca for a Solitary Practitioner,” by Scott Cunningham, and other titles. [6] X Research source There are introductory and advanced texts about Wicca that will give you a solid understanding of the religion."

      "title": "Choose your deities and build relationships with them.",
      "content": "Choose your deities and build relationships with them. Wicca is polytheistic, meaning that its followers believe in multiple goddesses and gods. These goddesses and gods are not set apart from nature, nor do they possess superhuman powers. Rather, they are embodied in nature. These deities are derived from a variety of sources, including Roman, Norse, Hindu and Celtic roots. [7] X Research source There are over 200 gods and goddesses that Wiccans might follow, but you won’t just randomly choose one to be your matron or patron deity. One of these deities will become your matron or patron deity. While you certainly have a say in which god or goddess you follow, it will also present itself to you, so be open to learning about a lot of deities. Be sure to research the deities thoroughly so you know which ones might have characteristics, not to your liking."

      "content": "Keep track of your journey in a journal or diary. As you study and learn more about Wicca, you will begin to find associations and preferences within yourself. Writing down these observations will help you make connections and realizations about yourself. This journal will evolve into your Book of Shadows, a journal that you will keep when you become a Wiccan. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Learn what magick is and how to use it.",
      "content": "Learn what magick is and how to use it. Magick within the Wiccan religion is the practice of raising and channeling energy for a purpose. [9] X Research source Magick for Wiccans is spelled with a “k” at the end of the word to distinguish it from stage tricks. Most Wiccans believe that magick is a personal manifestation of energy that comes from within. It is not sorcery; rather, it is spiritual and can turn your dreams into reality through spell-casting. You will need to learn how to make magick safe and protected by considering possible consequences of certain requests or spells and understanding the ramifications of using magick to obtain certain things. [10] X Research source Practice meditation and visualization exercises to enhance concentration for using magick. Make a quiet space for yourself where you can meditate without interruption.

      "content": "Learn and practice the threefold law. In Wicca, the threefold law is the principle that whatever you do, it will be returned to you three times over. No matter if you do something good or bad, your actions will reverberate back to you. Following the threefold law and understanding that vengeful or vindictive actions will negatively affect you. Use the threefold principle to be aware and appreciative of your blessings. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Connect with other Wiccans.",
      "content": "Connect with other Wiccans. You can find them online in discussion groups and other forums, or you might find them in your local community. It’s likely that you will be able to find Wiccans more easily in a larger city, but that does not mean that smaller communities do not have their fair share of Wiccans. Depending on the perceived tolerance of your community, Wiccans might not be very publicly vocal about their beliefs. Talk with Wiccans about what they believe, how they practice, how they got started, and so on. These conversations will give you greater understanding of the entire faith, and they will help you develop a supportive community."

      "title": "Have a self-dedication ceremony.",
      "content": "Have a self-dedication ceremony. This ceremony will formalize your personal relationship with Wicca and share your devotion to your deities. There are a number of simple and complex ceremonies that you can use; many suggestions can be found online. [13] X Research source One such ceremony is as follows: Collect symbols that signify a balance of nature. These objects will represent fire, water, air, and earth. It is fine to use objects that are readily available, such as a candle for fire, a glass of water for water, and so on. In a circle around you, place the water in the west, earth in the north, the air in the east and fire in the south. Walk or swing your arm around in a clockwise manner three times. Close the circle by reciting, “Thrice I cast this circle ’round, sacred is this holy ground.” This creates a space between you and the physical world in which to make your dedication. Make a statement about why you want to follow Wicca. Attest that you will follow the Rede (“If You Harm None, Do What You Will.”). Open the circle back up by walking or waving your arm three times counterclockwise. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Join a coven after a year and a day of study.",
      "content": "Join a coven after a year and a day of study. Most covens and other formal gatherings require that you have studied Wicca for a year and a day before you are considered knowledgeable or serious enough to join the group. Find a coven in your local community if one exists, and introduce yourself to the group. Some covens have closed membership and do not accept new members. Others are more open and welcome new members. [15] X Research source It is not necessary to join a coven to practice Wicca. Like any religion, Wicca can be an individual activity or it can be practiced in a group setting. You may not have an adequate community in your local area, or perhaps you have tried to be in a group setting and it hasn’t worked out. Practicing as a solitary Wiccan can be lonely, but it can also be liberating. You can remain as true to yourself as you allow yourself to be. A circle is a loose gathering of people who might only meet periodically, but they gain support from each other. A coven is a more formal gathering of people, and they are often closed to outsiders. They demand trust and respect, but can often be subject to personality clashes or egos. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Take an oath of secrecy.",
      "content": "Take an oath of secrecy. One of the earliest actions that Wiccans should do is take an oath of secrecy. This covers three areas: protection of identity, protection of rituals, and protection of the mysteries of the craft. Wiccans should not assume that other Wiccans have announced publicly that they follow the religion; many remain secretive because of potential discrimination and harassment, or for other personal reasons. Wiccans should keep rituals secret and protected in order to maintain trust and ensure that people can be vulnerable within a trusted group and space. Protecting the mysteries of the craft respects the complexities and fragilities of Wicca as a religious practice. Respecting the mysteries and inexplicable occurrences will help sustain Wicca as a practice and reserve its magical qualities for those who actively practice it. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Follow the Wiccan Rede. The Rede, creed or approach, as you know it is: “If You Harm None, Do What You Will.” [18] X Research source This idea emphasizes freedom to act as you see fit so long as your actions do not harm others. Tied to the Rede is the threefold law, or the idea that whatever you do will come back to you threefold. These principles emphasize positivity and harmony."

      "title": "Spend some time every day in meditation or devotion.",
      "content": "Spend some time every day in meditation or devotion. Bring Wiccan beliefs into your daily life by reflecting on your religious path regularly. Wicca upholds strong beliefs in creative freedom, connection to the physical, spiritual self-empowerment, the divine feminine, family bonding, and a connection to nature. [19] X Research source These ideals can be celebrated and integrated into everyday life through meditation, increased time with family, and engaging with the environment. Many everyday Wicca practices just take a few minutes, such as breathing and centering exercises, meditating for 10-15 minutes, or giving thanks for a meal. You might also perform a brief ritual of devotion to one of your deities, speaking to them about problems you’re having or giving thanks for blessings in your life. Other practices that can take more time might be: building an altar to one of your deities; creating art or writing that reflects your religious beliefs; or taking a long walk or hike in a natural setting.

      "content": "Celebrate Wiccan holidays. There are 8 holidays, or Sabbats, that are typically celebrated by Wiccans throughout the year, with the Wiccan new year being celebrated on October 31. These holidays can be celebrated in a number of ways, but they tend to include some acknowledgement and celebration of nature and family or community. Esbats are the celebrations based on a lunar cycle. Some Wiccans celebrate waning, waxing and full moon but there are some that celebrate only full moons. The Sabbats include: Samhain (end of summer, around October 31) Yule (winter solstice, around December 20-23) Imbolc (February 1) Ostara (spring equinox, around March 21) Beltane (April 30-May 1) Litha (summer solstice, around June 21) Lughnasadh (July 31-August 1, first day of harvest season) Mabon (autumn equinox, around September 21)"

This book can follow a number of templates and no two books are the same. They are deeply personal and a person can tailor their book to their own experiences. Most books have certain elements, such as a page with the Wiccan Rede; a list or description of the deities you follow; spells and incantations; rituals; mythology; and other elements.

This does not, however, mean that you should try to recruit other people to become Wiccans. This religion frowns upon proselytizing, or trying to convert people. [22] X Research source But you can be a leader in your Wicca community, offering guidance and mentorship to new members."
