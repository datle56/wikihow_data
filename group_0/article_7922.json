If clear material flakes up, that’s a wax finish. If no wax beads up, it’s surface finished. If you have a surface-finished floor, use odorless mineral spirits . If it’s wax finished, get trisodium phosphate (TSP). [8] X Research source Surface-finished floors have a urethane coating that keeps water from sinking into them. They require a different kind of care than wax-treated floors, because the urethane just sits on top while the wax actually penetrates the wood. If you’re using TSP, mix 1 tablespoon (.17 g) into 32 fluid ounces (950 mL) of water to make a cleaning solution. Use a glass bowl and a wooden stirrer to keep the TSP from reacting with metal."
