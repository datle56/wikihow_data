      "title": "Drink lots of fluids, especially water.",
      "content": "Drink lots of fluids, especially water. Drinking water will help your body to combat the congestion by thinning the mucus in your lungs and make it easier to cough up the mucus. It will also keep your body hydrated. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Tobacco smoke slows the movement of the tiny hairs (known as cilia) that line our lungs and help to remove mucus. When you stop smoking, these hairs become more active and start to clear away the mucus built up in your lungs. This can result in increased coughing for a few weeks after you first quit. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Drinking orange juice and other natural fruit juices will provide your body with the vitamins and minerals it needs to combat congestion. Avoid alcohol, coffee, and sodas which can contribute to dehydration as much as possible."

      "content": "Take a hot shower or bath once or twice a day. Dry air can irritate your lungs and increase your coughing fits. The steam produced from a hot shower or bath can moisten the air passages in your lungs and thin out the mucus.

      "content": "Sleep with your head elevated. Keep your head angled at 15 degrees by placing one or two pillows directly underneath your head. This will minimize mucus draining into your throat which causes coughing at night. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Try a facial steam.",
      "content": "Try a facial steam. Facial steamers produce similar results outside the shower, directing the steam from hot water directly into your airways and lungs. Pour six cups of hot (almost boiling) water into a bowl. Make a tent over your head with a bath or hand towel. Place your nose and mouth over the bowl and inhale deeply. Add three to four drop of eucalyptus oil to the water. Eucalyptus oil has both antibacterial and analgesic properties and acts as an expectorant, loosening phlegm that causes coughing. Add a few drops of peppermint oil to the steam to benefit from its soothing menthol agent. Professional facial steamers are also available at your local drugstore."

      "title": "Do a chest rub.",
      "content": "Do a chest rub. Chest rubs, such as Vicks Vaporub, can help alleviate feelings of chest congestion via its menthol properties (the active agent in peppermint). Menthol can also reduce feelings of shortness of breath. Although the benefits from these products can be largely psychological, they can help alleviate the symptoms (but not the cause) of chest congestion. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Never apply the rub directly under your nose or used on infants or children under the age of 2. The active ingredient in many chest rubs, camphor, can be toxic when ingested. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Take Mucinex. If you don't have any aversion to a pill-based solution, Mucinex will significantly reduce any chest congestion you may suffer from. The medication thins and loosens mucus in the airways, clearing congestion, and making breathing easier. [9] X Research source Mucinex is designed for temporary relief of congestion and cold-like symptoms. It's important to consult your doctor before you use it to treat smoking-induced congestion or coughing."

      "title": "Ask your doctor about treatment for “smoker’s lung”.",
      "content": "Ask your doctor about treatment for “smoker’s lung”. Although increased feelings of congestion are typical in the first few weeks after you stop smoking, be aware that any smoking habit increases your risk of “smoker’s lung”, a catch-all term for chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which are associated with a reduction of airflow due to lung damage. Both conditions are associated with coughing and feelings of breathlessness. Individuals with smoker's lung experience a combination of symptoms similar to having chronic bronchitis and emphysema. These include chronic coughing, breathlessness, and mucus in your lungs. Although treatment for these two conditions may be minor, it’s important to talk to your doctor after quitting smoking about your likelihood of contracting either of these conditions. Your doctor may recommend a chest X-ray or a CT scan to exclude other possibilities. A lung function test or a blood test may also be necessary to determine other contributors to your condition."

      "content": "Exercise on a regular basis. It’s important to keep your lungs and cardiovascular system in good working order. Your body already begins the repair process as soon as you quit smoking. The more you exercise, particularly after you quit smoking, the more you will help your lungs gain back the capacity they lost while you were smoking. [13] X Research source A study examining the effects of quitting smoking found some physical improvements after just a week. Eleven young men who smoked about a pack a day for three and a half years were subjected to several tests while on a stationary bike before quitting, and then a week later. The study showed considerably increase in oxygen concentration in the lungs and an extension of exercise time."

Keep the filter clean and the humidifier will minimize the amount of congestion-causing dust in the air. [14] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Keep the vaporizer and humidifier clean. Every two to three days, clean the filter using a mixture of bleach and water (two tablespoons of bleach per one quart of water). Run the machine until dry (approximately 40 minutes) in a well-ventilated area, away from your bedroom."
