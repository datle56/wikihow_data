      "title": "They’re annoyed.",
      "content": "They’re annoyed. When your cat gets airplane ears, they may be feeling irritated, agitated, or overstimulated. So, this is often their warning that they’re preparing to take flight or fight. For instance, they might get airplane ears when they hear a loud, surprising noise, are being held or pet in a way they don’t like, or aren’t allowed to do something. [1] X Research source Other behavior cues to look for : If your cat is annoyed, they might start to swish their tail or thump it on the ground and stare at the thing irritating them. [2] X Research source To fully understand what your cat is saying , certified feline training and behavior specialist Molly DeVoss stresses that you “have to take into consideration every body position, sound they are making, and environment surrounding them” because “cats communicate from the tip of their nose to the end of their tail.”"

      "title": "They’re threatened.",
      "content": "They’re threatened. Airplane ears can sometimes be a sign of aggression, so your cat might display them when they’re feeling defensive and ready to attack. It’s possible that you or another pet has invaded their space, so back off to allow your cat to get away and calm down. [3] X Research source Other behavior cues to look for : If your cat is angry or threatened, they might puff up their tail, hold it straight up, and arch their back. Their ears tend to flatten on their head, too. DeVoss also says they’ll often hiss or growl. Pay attention to what’s going on around you to see why your cat may be getting aggressive. Veterinarian Dr. Brian Bourquin says cats can get aggressive when you touch their belly or tail or stare directly into their eyes."

      "title": "They’re stressed or scared.",
      "content": "They’re stressed or scared. According to DeVoss, cats often turn their ears out to the sides or flatten them when they’re frightened, uneasy, worried, or anxious. This is a sign that something is upsetting or bothering them, so they’re on high alert to figure out what it is and if they need to run away. [4] X Research source Other behavior cues to look for : DeVoss says when cats are scared, “they are usually motionless” and “hold their body close to the ground” with their “tail held tight to the body or curled forward.” Additionally, their “head is lowered” and their eyes are “fully open and pupils dilated.”"

      "title": "They’re feeling playful.",
      "content": "They’re feeling playful. Airplane ears are often a sign that your cat is about to get the zoomies. They might get a burst of energy after waking up or using the bathroom, put their ears into airplane mode, and start running around your house or chasing after their toys. [5] X Research source Other behavior cues to look for : If your cat is feeling playful, their eyes usually dilate fully. They’ll typically get into a stalking or pouncing position (body low to the ground, bottom close to the floor) and swish their tail, too. Take this as an opportunity to play with your cat ! DeVoss suggests using a wand toy and playing with them before they eat to simulate their natural rhythm in the wild: hunt, catch, kill, eat, groom, sleep. DeVoss recommends playing with your cat at least twice a day in 10-minute sessions."

      "title": "They’re curious.",
      "content": "They’re curious. If your cat is intrigued by something they heard or saw, they might display airplane ears. This can signal that they’re trying to gather more information about the situation and figure out what’s going on. For example, they might get airplane ears if you suddenly get up and go to the door or if they see the bushes rustling through the window. [6] X Research source Other behavior cues to look for : According to DeVoss, when your cat is curious, they typically bring their whiskers forward and keep their tail upright or parallel with the floor. They often have a tall stance and constricted pupils, too."

    {
      "title": "They’re content.",
      "content": "They’re content. If your cat has airplane ears while they’re lying down and all snuggled up, they’re most likely feeling relaxed and happy. Some cats simply find this ear position more comfortable when they’re snoozing on the couch or just contentedly watching what’s going on around them. [7] X Research source Other behavior cues to look for : DeVoss says purring is usually a clear sign your cat is feeling happy and content. They might also chirp or trill at you to say, “Hello.” Their body usually appears soft and relaxed and their eyes may be slightly closed. Pet and give your cat some love when they’re feeling content. DeVoss says that “cats typically prefer to be touched from the neck up”—“they like to have the side of their face rubbed, chin scratched, ears rubbed, and sometimes the top of the head.”"

      "title": "They’re listening to something behind them.",
      "content": "They’re listening to something behind them. Lots of times, your cat might swivel their ears to the sides simply because something caught their attention. They might keep their ears in airplane mode to determine if the noise they heard was worth investigating without actually turning their head. Other behavior cues to look for : If your cat is listening to something, they might stop what they were doing (grooming, playing, eating, etc.) and display signs of curiosity, like facing their whiskers forward and constricting their pupils."

      "title": "They’re sick or in pain.",
      "content": "They’re sick or in pain. Most of the time, airplane ears are a completely normal behavior in cats. However, if your cat’s airplane ears are combined with other unusual or out-of-the-ordinary behaviors, it might mean they’re not feeling well. In general, Dr. Bourquin says “anything that is not status quo” is “a sign that there could be something going on.” Signs your cat is sick : According to Dr. Bourquin, your cat might eat less, stop drinking, hide, want less or more attention, sleep a lot, or avoid being touched. Signs your cat is in pain : According to veterinarian Dr. Natalie Punt, a cat that is in pain “may not eat,” “vomit,” “go in and out of the litter box several times,” or “pee in areas they normally don't pee in.” She also says they might “vocalize, not want to eat,” and “hide.” In some cases, airplane ears might be a sign of ear problems, like an infection or mite infestation. Signs your cat might have an ear problem include scratching the ears, constantly shaking or rubbing their head, the presence of blood or discharge, swelling, and pain sensitivity.

      "title": "Airplane ears are when your cat’s ears are pushed back to the sides.",
      "content": "Airplane ears are when your cat’s ears are pushed back to the sides. When your cat’s ears are in airplane mode, they flatten their ears and swivel them outward to the sides. Airplane ears look a lot like an airplane’s wings (which is where they get their name!), and are usually a sign your cat is about to take off—whether they’ve got the zoomies, are preparing to attack, or want to make a getaway. Cats have a flap on the outsides of their ears that is called the cutaneous marginal pouch or Henry’s Pocket. While scientists still don’t know its exact function, they theorize that it helps your cat rotate and flatten their ears. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Give your cat space if they’re feeling annoyed, stressed, or threatened.",
      "content": "Give your cat space if they’re feeling annoyed, stressed, or threatened. If your cat’s airplane ears accompany signs of irritation, aggression, fear, or unease, slowly back away so they have the space to calm themselves down or flee, if they prefer. Make sure they have access to a quiet, peaceful place where they feel secure and have plenty of spots to hide, like a tall cat tower or cat cave . [10] X Research source Remove the source of your cat’s stress , if possible. For instance, turn down your music if it's really loud or distract your dog with a toy if they’re bothering your cat."

      "content": "Take your cat to the vet if you think they may be sick or in pain. If your cat is showing signs of sickness or pain, schedule an appointment with your vet. Your vet will complete a check-up on your cat, diagnose any issues, and provide a treatment plan to help your cat get healthy again. [11] X Research source Visit your vet if your cat has noticeable behavior changes (not eating, sleeping a lot), is constantly scratching at their ears, has dried blood around their ears, or reacts painfully when you touch their ears."

      "title": "Ears forward: happy and relaxed.",
      "content": "Ears forward: happy and relaxed. When your cat’s ears are relaxed and pointed forward, they’re typically feeling content. This is usually their natural resting position and means everything is a-okay. [12] X Research source Remember, it’s important to consider the rest of your cat’s body language, as well as what’s going on around them, to completely understand what they’re feeling."

      "title": "Ears upright: alert and curious.",
      "content": "Ears upright: alert and curious. If your cat’s ears are facing forward but taut and pointed straight up, something’s probably caught their attention. They’re likely listening intently to their surroundings to figure out what’s up—they might turn their ears in different directions to help them focus on what’s piqued their curiosity. [13] X Research source Cats can control their ears separately, so they might keep one ear forward and swivel the other in a different direction to monitor their surroundings."

      "title": "Ears flat: threatened and defensive.",
      "content": "Ears flat: threatened and defensive. When your cat pushes their ears flat against their head, Dr. Bourquin says they’re usually telling you to back off. Something is likely bothering your cat, whether they’re annoyed, angry, or scared, and they’re either preparing to fight it or flee from it."

      "title": "Twitching ears: alert or agitated.",
      "content": "Twitching ears: alert or agitated. If your cat is twitching or flicking their ears, it might mean they’re picking up on a lot of different noises and monitoring their surroundings closely. It’s also possible that something is agitating their ears, like a fly or gust of wind. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Airplane ears can mean your cat is annoyed, stressed, or playful.",
      "content": "Airplane ears can mean your cat is annoyed, stressed, or playful. Cats communicate their emotions through their different ear positions. When your cat puts their ears into airplane mode, they might be telling you that they’re annoyed, threatened, scared, content, ready to play, or curious. Pay attention to their other behavior cues (eyes, body position, tail, vocalizations) and the situation to help determine what their airplane ears mean."
