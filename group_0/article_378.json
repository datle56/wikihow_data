  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Be very interested in humans.",
      "content": "Be very interested in humans. Izaya claims to love all of humanity(excluding Shizuo Heiwajima ), and screams this publicly from a rooftop in one of the manga volumes. If screaming from a rooftop doesn't suit you, you can always drop it into conversations from time to time. Learn all you can about human behaviour. One of the things you can do to accomplish this is to learn about psychology and keep yourself updated on related articles and magazines."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear dark colours.",
      "content": "Wear dark colours. Izaya wears a lot of black. If you don't want to wear black, dress classy in dark colours (maroon, dark red, dark purple etc.). Make sure to wear simple shoes, like trainers or boots to move around with agility. Izaya wears his signature dark coats with fur trims and does not care about mainstream fashion."

      "title": "Use chatrooms.",
      "content": "Use chatrooms. Don't use text language. He speaks in a female manner in chatrooms, under the name 'Kanra' and \"Chrome\". Stir things up, and spread rumours.
