      "title": "Rinse the jellyfish and soak it for 1 hour in cold water.",
      "content": "Rinse the jellyfish and soak it for 1 hour in cold water. Open a 10-ounce (283 g) package of jellyfish packed in salt and rinse it under cold running water. Place the jellyfish in a large bowl and fill it with cold water so the jellyfish is completely submerged. Soak the jellyfish for 1 hour. [1] X Research source The jellyfish should feel flexible once it's soaked long enough. Soaking the jellyfish will remove the salt that it was preserved with."

      "title": "Slice the green onions and mince the garlic.",
      "content": "Slice the green onions and mince the garlic . Rinse 2 green onions and trim off the ends. Use a sharp knife to slice the onions as thin as you can (about 1/4 inch or 1 centimeter thick). Mince enough fresh garlic to get 2 tablespoons (17 g). [2] X Research source Since 1 clove of garlic usually yields 1/2 teaspoon (1.4 g) of minced garlic, you'll need about 12 cloves."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sauté the green onions and garlic for 30 seconds.",
      "content": "Sauté the green onions and garlic for 30 seconds. Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) of grapeseed oil into a skillet or wok and turn the heat to medium. Once the oil is hot and shimmering, stir in the minced garlic and sliced green onions. Stir and cook them until they're slightly browned and fragrant. Turn off the burner. [3] X Research source If you don't have grapeseed oil, you could use coconut or olive oil. Avoid leaving the garlic and green onions unattended because they can burn easily."

      "title": "Drain and add the jellyfish to the skillet.",
      "content": "Drain and add the jellyfish to the skillet. Place a colander into the sink and pour the soaked jellyfish into it. Add the drained jellyfish to the skillet and stir it so it's combined with the green onions and garlic. [4] X Research source The jellyfish in the package will probably already be sliced into strips. If it isn't, cut it into long thin strips about 0.8 inches (2 centimeters) wide."

      "title": "Stir in the seasonings.",
      "content": "Stir in the seasonings. Measure 1/4 teaspoon (1 ml) of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of chili oil, 1/4 teaspoon (1.5 g) of salt, and 1 teaspoon (3 g) of ground sichuan pepper into the skillet. Stir until the jellyfish is completely coated in the seasonings. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Warm the jellyfish for 2 minutes.",
      "content": "Warm the jellyfish for 2 minutes. Stir and cook the jellyfish salad over medium heat just until the jellyfish warms up a little. Avoid frying or cooking the jellyfish too long. Overcooking the jellyfish can make it rubbery or tough. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Taste, garnish, and serve the jellyfish salad.",
      "content": "Taste, garnish, and serve the jellyfish salad. Taste the salad to see if you need to add extra salt. Transfer the jellyfish salad to a serving bowl and drizzle it with a little sesame oil. Sprinkle a little chopped cilantro over the top and serve the salad while it's slightly warm. If you prefer, you can refrigerate it until it's cold and then serve it. [7] X Research source The sesame oil will give the salad a slightly smoky, nutty taste. Store the leftover jellyfish salad in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 4 to 5 days. If you'd like to rewarm the salad, microwave it in a microwave-safe container in 30-second increments until it's as hot as you like."

Transfer the jellyfish to a large bowl filled with cold water. Ensure that the jellyfish is covered with water and soak it for 1 hour. Once the jellyfish has soaked enough, it will feel flexible.

Turn the burner on to high and bring the water to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium so it's at a gentle boil and cook the potatoes until they're tender. Use a pot that's at least 2-quarts (1.9 liters) in size. To test if the potatoes are tender, insert a fork or knife into a potato chunk. You should be able to easily slide it in and out if it's finished cooking."

Divide the jellyfish mixture into 4 evenly sized portions and place them in the centers of 4 of the mashed potato disks. Top those disks with the remaining mashed potato disks so the jellyfish mixture is sandwiched in the middle. Gently press around the edges of each burger to seal in the jellyfish mixture. The burgers should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. Ensure that the jellyfish mixture isn't spread across the entire disk of mashed potato mixture or the jellyfish filling may seep out.
