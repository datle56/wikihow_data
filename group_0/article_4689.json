      "content": "Look at your stores online or locally. Depending on your personal location, it would most likely be difficult as purchasing Gunpla Kits could be harder. Ordering online may be a good option; however, it can be pricier due to online shipping costs. General retailers such as Barnes & Nobles, Target, and Hobby Lobby have begun selling these kits. Local hobby shops may not have these kits since they are a niche."

      "title": "Choose what Grade kit you want.",
      "content": "Choose what Grade kit you want. When you’ve found a store or place to purchase a gunpla model kit, you’re given six options of what to assemble. Depending on what grade, they will be more of a process to build. The size ratio of the model to real-life is in parentheses. High Grade (1/144) are more available to purchase as they’re more plentiful. Recommended for beginners due to their simplicity Real Grade (1/144) are designed around an inner frame and to look more realistic and functional compared to their high grade counterpart. Master Grade (1/100) are larger than their high grade counterparts. They have more detail as well as an inner-frame that’s designed for it. Perfect Grade (1/60) are considerably larger and more time-consuming, so therefore more to assemble due to a higher part count. Mega Size (1/48) are the largest models offered; yet, they are cheaper compared to Perfect Grades. You should choose what looks the best to you as well as what gimmicks that specific model offers. It’s ultimately your choice in what you want to build and what you like the most."

      "content": "Purchase some tools necessary such as a plastic nipper, filer, panel liner, and a cutting mat. When you've decided on what you want to build, you will need some sort of workshop to assemble your Gunpla. Most tools can be obtained through a local hobby store around you A cutting mat isn’t necessarily an essential item to have, but if you are thinking about doing this hobby in the long-run, it is becomes essential."

      "title": "Prepare your workstation.",
      "content": "Prepare your workstation. Once you’ve obtained all the items necessary for assembly, including your choice Gunpla model, have a selected area for each tool so they don’t get mixed up. A light source, such as a lamp, will help a lot for getting some focus on a specific part. Gunpla assembly is very messy with excess plastic. It’s best to have a plastic bag for the leftover plastic. A comfortable environment is important! Make sure you have everything necessary. Music or a show to listen/watch in the background enhances the overall experience."

      "title": "Separate Gunpla contents.",
      "content": "Separate Gunpla contents. The box usually is wrapped in a thin plastic wrap as well as a semi-thick strip that can be removed easily. Everything besides the instruction manual is wrapped in plastic and should be removed. The box is also something you should not cut as it’s designed for the bottom to slide out when shaken. The box is also a great place to store your frames and Gunpla, so don’t throw it away! The sprues (or plastic frames) & decal sheets when unwrapped should be placed in the box so they’re not easily lost & forgotten."

      "title": "Read the provided instructions manual.",
      "content": "Read the provided instructions manual. The instructions manual is a great guide into how to assemble the figure. The Japanese text may be intimidating, but the pictures will guide you through! The instruction manual holds key information for the decals, or stickers, to place on key parts of the figure. Each part of the Gunpla is numbered and labeled. With some kits, they even label what sprue (or plastic frame) is necessary for building that part or what decal must be placed. (e.g. head, arms, torso, legs, accessories) Be extremely careful, and make sure to re-read the instruction manual throughout assembly! There are small indicators throughout the manual on what to cut and what not to cut! Making a big mistake could potentially turn things upside down."

      "title": "Cut your sprue frames carefully.",
      "content": "Cut your sprue frames carefully. Making a mistake is entirely possible during this step, so you must pay attention to the area that you cut in! You could possibly damage the plastic itself or make a certain part unusable. For certain builds, having damaged plastic can enhance a model. These models are known as “battle-damaged Gunpla” and are great for dioramas or for a more gritty and realistic look to it. Some plastic connectors are incredibly important to the build itself, and you can find out on the instruction manual since it’s always labeled."

      "title": "Detail and refine your parts.",
      "content": "Detail and refine your parts. To make your model pop out in the final assembly, there will always be small nubs on your model kit or thin empty spaces that can be filled in that makes a detailed kit into an amazing kit. With some kits, they also come with an extra decal sheet to make it pop out even more. Panel lining your model isn’t necessary, but it overall adds a “Wow!” factor into the finished build. It’s recommended to panel line when all the Be careful in filing your model kit because it can ruin the opportunity for panel lining in general. Nubs should always be filed down, but anything can go as Gunpla is freedom. Decaling is always optional and doesn’t need to be applied. It is, however, recommended as it adds a whole level to your model."

      "title": "Assemble the complete mobile suit.",
      "content": "Assemble the complete mobile suit. One of the best parts of Gunpla is witnessing the assembly of your complete model. As each limb is assembled, make sure you can hear a distinct and even snap. That snap is the sound of the model being locked in place and is good to go. Make sure not to apply too much pressure; otherwise, the plastic will break! The plastic that’s used to manufacture these models are strong, but they are not strong enough to withstand a the pressure of a human-being. If a part is loose, there are various methods on how to tighten a part, but it usually depends on the severity of the looseness. Superglue and Tamiya Cement are the most used products and preferred methods of re-tightening a part."

      "content": "Pose your finished model. This is where the fun begins. You can pose your model kit however you want, and that’s the beauty of it. For more dynamic poses, it’s best to purchase a Hobby Action Kit which allows your model kit to stay airborne! Make sure the Hobby Action Kit is the correct size as well as if the adapter will connect with your model kit Don’t try to make your Gunpla do anything crazy with the poses otherwise it can fall. Depending on what model kit you have purchased, that model may be fragile and can fall apart."
