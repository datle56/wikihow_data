      "content": "You can only break a soul tie if you’re aware of it first. Even if you want to move on from your ex , sometimes your heart will hang onto the broken relationship. Understand that only you can break the soul tie, and you must fully commit to doing so—even though it may be painful. To acknowledge the soul tie, look for signs that you have one. This includes feeling like you’ve known someone forever, or like your emotions are tied to theirs. You might also feel like meeting them was fate, and think about them constantly. [1] X Research source After a relationship ends, you’ll still feel connected to this person if you have a soul tie. It’ll be difficult to forget details of the relationship, and you may even dream about them. If you tend to have a hard time letting go, this step is critical to eventually breaking the soul tie between you and your ex. Keep in mind that it's normal to still have feelings for an ex, and that it's okay to love people for different reasons. Your ex was a part of your life for a long time, and you don't open your heart and close it right up again!"

      "title": "No contact makes breaking soul ties less painful—and more permanent.",
      "content": "No contact makes breaking soul ties less painful—and more permanent. Resolve not to text or call them, and delete their number if you feel brave. Even if you don't delete their number, at least block it; this will prevent your ex from calling or texting you out of the blue. [2] X Research source Sometimes, people stay friends with their ex to keep the relationship alive. Remember that until the soul tie is broken, friendship is unwise; otherwise, you might cling to your ex and be unable to let go."

      "title": "To break a soul tie, make sure nothing remains of your ex in your home.",
      "content": "To break a soul tie, make sure nothing remains of your ex in your home. Collect everything from your relationship, including your ex's gifts, belongings, and objects that hold sentimental value. Then, remove them from your living space. You can throw them out, donate them, or give them away. [3] X Research source Some people find it cathartic to burn these items—although it should be done in a secure and controlled environment if you do this. Only burn things that are safe to dispose of, like letters and photos. Whatever you do, don't just store the items in a basement, attic, or closet. If they're in your house, you can still go look at them."

      "title": "If your ex is out of sight, they'll also be out of mind.",
      "content": "If your ex is out of sight, they'll also be out of mind. Unfriend your ex, block them, delete photos of them, and do whatever you need to do to get them off your social media accounts. It'll be easier to let your ex go and sever the soul tie if you can't see pictures of your ex, read posts about what they're up to, or get messages from them. [4] X Research source Remember that you aren't obligated to be friends with your ex—especially if you're still trying to break a soul tie with them. Give yourself the space you need to heal."

      "content": "Let go of past wounds from the relationship to find peace. If a relationship ends badly, it's easy to get caught up in whose fault it was or hold resentment towards your ex. Reflect on the relationship, and acknowledge the negative emotions you feel. Then, choose to forgive your ex and let go of all grudges. [5] X Research source Forgiveness can be difficult, but it's worth the effort. Holding onto resentment can harm your mental health and relationships with other people. Even if your ex hurt you, forgiving them is really an act of kindness that you do for yourself because it lets you move on with an unburdened heart."

      "content": "Use your imagination so you can feel yourself letting your ex go. Close your eyes as you meditate, and picture the soul tie between you and your ex as though it's a physical rope or cord. Then, imagine cutting that cord. You can even pantomime cutting a cord if it helps the gesture to feel real and permanent.
