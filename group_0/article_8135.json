      "content": "Make your own liquid cleaner. Not only is it easy and cost-effective to make your own liquid cleaner, but it can be safer for your leather. Many synthetic cleaning products, especially ones that are petroleum-based, can actually discolor, stain, or change the surface quality of your leather. Here are some easy recipes for making your own liquid cleaner out of common household products: Mix 1 part mild soap (the kind you would use on your face or clothes) with 8 parts warm water. Mix 2 parts vinegar with 1 part linseed oil."

      "content": "Apply your cleaner. It's important not to use too much liquid directly on the leather, as this can over-saturate the leather and cause “watermark” staining. Instead, try using a spray bottle or applying your cleaner to a micro-fiber cloth rather than onto the leather."
