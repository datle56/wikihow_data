      "content": "Ask ChatGPT to limit its response length. Long responses can cause ChatGPT to return a network error and stop writing. You can avoid this by adding length specifications to your request and asking for less at once: Split your query into multiple questions or more specific parts. Ask that ChatGPT limits its answer to less than 500 words. This helps avoid ChatGPT's approximate word limit . Ask followup questions after your initial query. This can be something like \"can you further explain [this part]?\" Note that ChatGPT won't always follow word limits exactly. You can try again by requesting something like \"can you explain the above concept again, but in less than 500 words?\""
