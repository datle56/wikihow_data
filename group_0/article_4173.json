      "title": "Can I only block text messages and not calls from someone?",
      "content": "Can I only block text messages and not calls from someone? There is no default, built-in way to only block text messages from a user but not calls. However, there are a few workarounds you can try instead: Put your phone in \"do not disturb\" or \"focus\" mode. This will temporarily pause notifications for all calls and texts until you turn focus mode off. Unfortunately this is not a permanent solution, but is a quick fix if you just need to focus for a bit. Enable Screen Time/parental controls. Using the parental controls on your phone, you can restrict yourself from using your texting messaging app. This will allow you to get phone calls, but not send or view your texts. Unfortunately this will keep you from seeing all of your text messages, not just texts from a particular person. Use a third-party app to block spam and scam texts. While many phones have some sort of text message filtering built-in, it may not actually block them. A popular app that blocks spam and scam texts is Textkiller , which is available for iPhone and Android. Communicate boundaries with a particular person. If someone is texting you incessantly but you don't want to block them, the only way to get them to stop is to talk to them about your boundaries. Explain when it's okay to text you and why you might not text back right away."

Yes, blocking scam/spam texters will reduce the amount of spam/scam texts you get, plus it can help phone companies identify which numbers are associated with spam activity. However, blocking these numbers likely won't make the spam texts stop entirely, as spammers and scammers are constantly using new numbers (or spoofing numbers with an area code similar to yours)."
