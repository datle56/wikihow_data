      "content": "Add a drop of food coloring to your slime and knead it in. Choose any color you like to add to your slime. Add 1 drop directly onto the slime. Then, knead the food coloring into the slime with your hands. Keep kneading until the color is distributed evenly throughout the slime. Add another drop to make the color more noticeable. [1] X Research source You can use 1 color or combine colors. For example, you could make blue slime with a drop of blue food coloring, or use a drop of blue and red food coloring for purple slime."

      "title": "Use markers to draw on your slime and then knead in the color.",
      "content": "Use markers to draw on your slime and then knead in the color. A fun and easy way to add color to slime is to draw on your slime with washable markers. Spread your slime out so it is flat and draw whatever you like on it, or simply color it in with a marker. Then, knead the slime to distribute the color. [2] X Research source Repeat this as many times as you like to deepen the color. Combine multiple colors to make new ones, such as yellow and blue to make green slime, or red and blue to make purple slime."

      "title": "Mix 1 teaspoon (5 g) of color pigment into your slime.",
      "content": "Mix 1 teaspoon (5 g) of color pigment into your slime. You can use a special color pigment meant for making slime, or use powdered eyeshadow. Measure out 1 teaspoon (about 5 g) of the color pigment of your choice. Then, knead the pigment into your slime until the pigment is distributed evenly throughout the slime. [3] X Research source Add more pigment if needed to achieve the desired color. You can use any pigment or eyeshadow color you like to color your slime. Try purple pigment or eyeshadow for purple slime, or a glittery charcoal pigment or eyeshadow for sparkly black slime."

      "title": "Knead glitter into your slime for color and sparkle.",
      "content": "Knead glitter into your slime for color and sparkle. Choose a colorful glitter in the size and texture you like. Then, knead about 1 teaspoon of the glitter into your slime. Keep adding 1 teaspoon at a time until the slime is the desired color. You can also substitute an equal amount of glitter glue for regular glue when making slime to get glittery slime. [4] X Research source Chunky glitter won’t actually color the slime, but you can combine glitter with another option for coloring slime if you want your slime to be sparkly."

Pour both ingredients into a bowl and use a plastic or metal spoon to stir them until they are well combined. [5] X Research source If you use clear glue, your slime will have a translucent or see-through look. If you use white glue, your slime will be opaque and you won’t be able to see through it."

      "content": "Add 1 to 2 drops of your desired food coloring or paint. Food coloring is the most popular choice, but you can use other liquid colors, such as acrylic paint, poster paint, or liquid watercolor. For more interesting slime, you could even try glow-in-the-dark paint. [6] X Research source You can choose a color you like or combine 2 colors to create a color, such as 1 drop of yellow and 1 drop of red for orange slime."

If the slime is too pale for your liking, add another 1 or 2 drops of your color, then stir it again. Keep adding the color 1 drop at a time until you get the shade you want. [7] X Research source For example, if you add 1 drop of green food coloring and the water is only a light green, then add another drop and stir again."

Knead it with your hands until it is the desired consistency. The longer you knead the slime, the firmer it will become. [9] X Research source If the slime is too firm after 1 minute of kneading, add 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 mL) more water and then knead it again. If it's too gooey after 1 minute of kneading, add 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 mL) more starch and then knead it again. Put on a pair of gloves to protect your hands from the dye, if desired."
