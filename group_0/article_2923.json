Some psychologists estimate that about 98% of us have experienced some form of unrequited love, whether it’s an unreturned crush or a nasty breakup. Knowing that you’re not alone probably won’t heal your broken heart, but it could make the pain easier to bear. [2] X Research source"

Don’t tell yourself that it’s no big deal, or force yourself to move on before you’re ready. It’s okay to be sad! And, before moving past your emotions, you’ll have to process them. Cry your eyes out if you need to. Crying is a cathartic practice that can actually reduce feelings of stress, anxiety, and anger. Express your emotions through creative pursuits, like art or music. Write a song about how you feel, or draw a picture of your emotional state. This helps you understand and process your feelings. Listen to music that comforts you or makes you feel seen. Just try to stay away from songs that are too sad or angry (think death metal), as they may actually increase these feelings.

[7] X Research source For example, look for global, definitive statements, such as “I’m going to be alone forever,” or “No one will ever love me again.” If you notice these patterns in your writing, point them out, and try to restructure your thinking. For example, instead of thinking “This breakup is ruining my life,” tell yourself, “This breakup hurts really bad right now, but it’s only one part of my life.” Or, instead of thinking, “This is all my fault. I should have done everything differently,” shift this to, “I did the best I could at the time, and that’s enough.” [8] X Research source"
