      "title": "Stop and think when you can.",
      "content": "Stop and think when you can. If you see a bomb, the question has a time limit. If you don't, you can take as long as you like to answer the question. Stop and make sure you're confident in your answer before continuing, especially if you're a long ways into the game. You don't want to have to start again from the beginning because you tried to save a few seconds."
    },
    {
      "title": "Think about possible jokes and puns.",
      "content": "Think about possible jokes and puns. The answers are often illogical, making puns, jokes, or pop culture references instead of answering the question seriously. Some of them are even intentionally misspelled words to make bad jokes (\"armies\" instead of \"arms\")."
    },
    {
      "title": "Think very literally.",
      "content": "Think very literally. Read the question word by word. Is there an obvious meaning â€“ so obvious you hadn't thought of it? For example, if you're told to \"Click the answer,\" literally click the words \"the answer.\" A supposed typo or misspelling might actually be a hint."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask a friend for help.",
      "content": "Ask a friend for help. The more people working together, the more likely you'll get the answer. Friends who know internet memes and pop culture references are especially helpful, since some of the questions are references to movies, songs, or memes that the game developer thought were funny back in 2006 and 2007."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write down wrong answers and guesses.",
      "content": "Write down wrong answers and guesses. If you have to guess, write down the answer you're going to guess before you click it. Cross it out if it was wrong, and circle it if you were right. If you lose all your lives and have to restart the game (and it's a miracle if this doesn't happen), you'll be glad you wrote down your last guess so you have fewer options to choose from next time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a mouse or touch screen.",
      "content": "Use a mouse or touch screen. Some of the questions require extreme precision and timing with your cursor or touch screen. If you're on a laptop, plug in a mouse instead of relying on your mouse pad."
    },
    {
      "title": "Never skip a question.",
      "content": "Never skip a question. The game lets you earn \"Skips\" which can be used to skip some questions if you get stuck, but don't be tempted! It is impossible to beat the game unless you have all seven \"Skips\" unused on question 110 (the last question)."

      "title": "Write down the code in question 50.",
      "content": "Write down the code in question 50. A list of numbers is written on the screen on question 50. Write these numbers down, and be prepared to type them in on question 108."

      "content": "Look for invisible or off-screen answers. Sometimes, you'll need to ignore the answers. Click words in the question, the numbers next to the answers, or answers hidden in the pictures. If you're playing on the computer, you might even need to move your mouse outside of the game window for some puzzles."
