      "content": "Keep your distance. There is no need to get involved in a fight if you don't have to. By keeping your distance, this can help to preserve your personal safety. If you're unsure about what to do when faced with a fight, take a step back or find a safe area. This can be the best course of action. Place your own safety first. Use non-violent means, before resorting to physical methods for breaking up a fight. Physical methods for breaking up a fight are a last resort, and are for use when other options are exhausted or non-existent."

      "title": "Look for underlying causes.",
      "content": "Look for underlying causes. Conflicts can be about hidden or unconscious beliefs and values. Being able to determine the true cause for a fight can help you to resolve it. Try to think about the personality and cultural aspects at play, before you step in. Understand the relationship between the two people in a fight. Do these people know each other? Are they family members? Is this about a romantic interest? Examine possible motivations. Is this random aggression, or is it driven by a specific feeling of being wronged? The differences in motivations can alter how two people in a fight will respond to someone breaking it up. Random, unprovoked aggression is less likely to be responsive to attempts at mediation, as the aggressor may not have a strong grasp on why they're being aggressive. Ask questions to anyone who will answer."

Not only can attempting to restrain a violent person result in harm to you, restraining people can seriously harm the person you're holding on to. While combat holds and other manners of restraint can be effective with an adult, they can cause injury or even death, and are only recommended in extreme situations. It is not suitable to restrain children with combat holds, such as a chokehold. A firm hug is considered, in some states, an acceptable way to break up fights between children when proper training is lacking. Hugs can also be used for fights among adults.

Be cautious with pepper spray, as some people are allergic to it, and it can cause severe health problems. Extra caution should be taken with pepper spray, as it can be illegal to carry, and spraying someone in the face can be a crime. [5] X Research source"
