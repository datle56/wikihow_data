      "content": "Apply a thin layer of lip balm to moisturize and even out your lips. Lip balm nourishes your lips so they’re less likely to get dry and flaky. Additionally, lip balm can smooth out your lips by filling in uneven spots. Swipe the lip balm over your upper lip from your Cupid’s bow to the corner of your lips on each side. Then, apply the lip balm to your bottom lip from the center out to the corners. [1] X Research source The lip balm should soak in soon after you apply it. If your lips feel gunky, gently wipe off the excess lip balm with a tissue before you apply your lipstick."
