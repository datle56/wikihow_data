      "content": "Check your owner’s manual for the right blade sizes. Hook-mount blades have a J-shaped hook on the end of the wiper blade, and they’re the most common type. Page through your manual for information on your wiper blades and jot down the sizes. Note that the driver- and passenger-side wipers are different lengths so you don’t accidentally get the wrong size. Choose wiper blades that match the sizes exactly to ensure they fit. [1] X Research source Alternatively, use a tape measure to find the length of each wiper from one end of the blade to the other. Don’t have your owner’s manual or a tape measure? No worries! Most automotive stores have a catalog or electronic system listing which wiper blades are compatible with your vehicle’s make and model."

      "content": "Lift the wiper blade off of your windshield. Simply hold onto the wiper arm just below the blade and slowly pull it up and away from the glass. Keep lifting the arm until it’s perpendicular to your windshield and snaps into position so it doesn’t fall down.

That way, if you bump the wiper arm and it falls back down, it won’t damage or crack the glass."

      "title": "Press down on the wiper tab if there is one.",
      "content": "Press down on the wiper tab if there is one. Search for a small tab or clip on the wiper blade where it attaches to the arm. If you see one, use your finger or a flathead screwdriver to press the tab down so the wiper can freely move around. [3] X Research source Some wiper blades don’t have clips and simply snap right into the hook on the arm."

      "title": "Pull the blade straight down toward the windshield to remove it.",
      "content": "Pull the blade straight down toward the windshield to remove it. Position the blade so it’s parallel to the wiper arm. Hold onto the blade with one hand and support the arm with your other. Then, just pull the blade down so it slides out from the hook. Once you remove the old blade, you can throw it away in the trash. [4] X Research source Old wiper blades might feel a little stuck when you try to pull them by hand. Lightly tap on the top end of the blade with a hammer to loosen it up."

      "title": "Slide your new wiper blade onto the hook until it clicks in place.",
      "content": "Slide your new wiper blade onto the hook until it clicks in place. Find the metal adaptor clip on the back of the blade in the middle. Rotate the adapter so it’s about parallel to the blade. Hook the end of the wiper arm around the adapter and push the blade up and away from the windshield. Once you hear the wiper snap into place, gently lower the blade back against your windshield. [5] X Research source After you finish installing your first wiper, change the other blade as well. Chances are if one of your wiper blades needed replacing, then your other one will probably start going bad soon too. [6] X Research source If you have a rear wiper blade, don’t forget to change it too."

Be sure to measure both the driver- and passenger-side wipers since they’re usually slightly different lengths. [7] X Research source When in doubt, check your vehicle’s manual or check wiper size compatibility at an automotive store. Your owner’s manual will list the type of wiper you need, but you can tell if your blades are clip-on if they have a button or clip on the top side of the arm."

Be sure to find the length for each individual wiper blade since they may vary a little in size. [12] X Research source The correct sizes for your wiper blades are also listed in the owner’s manual. You may also check auto parts stores to see if they have a catalog of which wiper blades are compatible with the make and model of your vehicle. You can tell if wipers are pin-mounts since they’ll attach to the sides of the blades rather than through the top."
