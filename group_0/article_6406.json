Another good option is The Ten Commandments starring Charlton Heston. It's a classic that appeals to both the young and old. If your family prefers a little more drama, try The Devil's Arithmetic . In this film, a young Jewish girl (played by Kirsten Dunst) is tired of celebrating Passover and is magically transported back in time to a Nazi concentration camp. She learns the true meaning of struggle, the importance of remembering, and the value of family and heritage."
