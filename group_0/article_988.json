      "content": "Adjust the sweep tension screw to control how fast the door swings. Some door closers might have one screw, while others will have two, advises Expert Handyman Abraham Swartz. [1] X Expert Source Abraham Schwartz Handyman Expert Interview. 28 August 2020. On a hydraulic door closer, look for a screw marked with an S on the bottom or side of the mechanism. If your door closer has a cover, gently pry it off to find the adjustment screw. Covers that aren’t removable have a clearly marked adjustment screw that is exposed on the outside of the cover. A pneumatic door closer (most often found on residential storm doors) has a tube or cylinder attached to the inside of the door. Look at the end of the cylinder closest to the bracket to find the adjustment screw. [2] X Research source A hydraulic door closer is usually found on medium to heavy commercial doors. It often has a rectangular mechanism that’s attached to the inside of the door with a bent arm that straightens as the door opens. Pneumatic doors are powered by air, while hydraulic doors are powered by liquid, but they work on the same general principle."

      "content": "Turn the screw clockwise to slow down the swing speed. Use a screwdriver to tighten the adjustment screw slightly if the door is closing too fast. [3] X Research source Make very minor adjustments – maybe 1/8 of a turn at a time – until you're happy with how the door closes, says Swartz. [4] X Expert Source Abraham Schwartz Handyman Expert Interview. 28 August 2020. Test the door by opening it and letting it close to see how much slower it swings. Keep making minor adjustments until the door closes at your desired speed. The Americans with Disabilities Act requires a commercial door to have a swing speed that’s at least 5 seconds, so make sure you time the door during your tests. [5] X Research source The law doesn’t apply when adjusting a storm door on your home."

      "title": "Turn the screw counterclockwise to make the door close faster.",
      "content": "Turn the screw counterclockwise to make the door close faster. Loosen the adjustment screw slightly with a screwdriver if your door is closing too slowly. Make sure not to completely unscrew the adjustment screw, or the cylinder could come apart and start leaking hydraulic fluid. [6] X Research source If it's not obvious which screw is the adjustment screw, test the door closer by slightly loosening or tightening screws one at a time, then closing the door to see if the speed changes. If you see fluid leaking from your hydraulic door closer and none of your adjustments fix the problem, it’s time to replace it."

      "content": "Adjust the screw marked BC to control how far the door opens. This screw is marked with a BC and is located on the bottom or side of the mechanism. The backcheck controls the last few inches of the door’s swing before it’s completely open to prevent it from opening too fast and slamming into the wall. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Turn the screw counterclockwise to decrease the backcheck.",
      "content": "Turn the screw counterclockwise to decrease the backcheck. Use a screwdriver or hex tool to adjust the screw by turning it to the left. If the backcheck is too high, the door won’t open wide enough to allow a person to comfortably walk through without the door closing, which can be dangerous. [8] X Research source Turning the screw to the left decreases the backcheck, so the door opens wider. Turn the screw ⅛ of a turn at a time. Then, test the door until it opens wide enough to comfortably walk through the doorway."

    {
      "title": "Turn the screw clockwise to increase the backcheck.",
      "content": "Turn the screw clockwise to increase the backcheck. Increasing the backcheck means the door will stop opening earlier in the swing. This adjustment prevents the door from opening too quickly and slamming into the wall, which may damage the door, doorframe, hinges, or the door opener itself. [9] X Research source Small turns of the screw make a big difference. Only turn the screw ⅛ of a turn, and then test the door to see if it stops before getting to the wall."

      "title": "Adjust the “L” screw to control the last few inches of a door’s swing.",
      "content": "Adjust the “L” screw to control the last few inches of a door’s swing. Find the screw marked “L” (for latch speed) on the hydraulic mechanism. This screw changes the closing speed of a door closer but only for the last few inches before the door latches. It’s usually the screw on the side or bottom of the unit closest to the latch side of the door. [10] X Research source Check to see what type of screwdriver or hex tool the screw takes. A screw with a flat groove takes a flathead screwdriver. A screw with a cross shape takes a Phillips-head screwdriver. A screw with a hexagon shape requires a hex tool. If there’s a knob, use your hands or a small adjustable wrench to turn it. There isn’t a latch adjustment screw on a pneumatic door."

      "title": "Turn the screw counterclockwise to increase the latching speed.",
      "content": "Turn the screw counterclockwise to increase the latching speed. Only turn the screw ⅛ of a turn at a time, testing the door as you go until you get to the desired speed. Outside doors generally have a faster latching speed, which snaps the door closed more quickly to secure the building. [11] X Research source Always make adjustments when the door is closed. A faster latching speed also makes a more audible “clack” when it closes."

      "title": "Turn the screw clockwise to decrease the latching speed.",
      "content": "Turn the screw clockwise to decrease the latching speed. Turn the screw ⅛ of a turn to the right – or clockwise – to slow down the latching speed. Test the door between each turn by opening it all the way, holding it for a few seconds, and then letting it close. A latching speed that’s too slow won’t latch properly or close all the way.

      "content": "Adjust the cylinder pin to make the door close more firmly. Press up on the pin that holds the cylinder to the bracket to remove it. Close the door completely and locate the pin that holds the pneumatic cylinder to the bracket. Slide it up and out to release the cylinder from the bracket. [13] X Research source Pneumatic door closers have a pneumatic cylinder, which controls the swing speed of the door, and a bracket, which connects the pneumatic cylinder to the door. Look where the arm of the cylinder connects to the bracket to find the pin. Most door closers have 2-3 different holes that attach the cylinder closer to or further away from the bracket to adjust the closing pressure."

      "title": "Put the pin in the hole furthest from the cylinder to make the door latch all the way.",
      "content": "Put the pin in the hole furthest from the cylinder to make the door latch all the way. Align the holes on the arm of the cylinder underneath the holes furthest away on the bracket. Slide the pin back in to hold the cylinder and the bracket together. This makes the door close harder and latch all the way. [14] X Research source Your door won't latch all the way if there is not enough pressure in the last several inches when it closes. Connecting the cylinder closer to the bracket creates more pressure in the final stages of closing, so the door will latch firmly."

      "title": "Move the closer’s bracket closer to the door handle to make the door latch more firmly.",
      "content": "Move the closer’s bracket closer to the door handle to make the door latch more firmly. Loosen the screws that attach the bracket to the door. Slide the bracket further away from the cylinder, closer to the door handle, to create more closing pressure. Most door closer brackets have slotted holes, so you’re able to slide them left to right to make adjustments without completely removing the screws. Simply loosen them with a screwdriver, adjust the bracket, and tighten the screws again. If none of these adjustments work, your door closer may be worn out. To replace it yourself, look for a similar model so you can simply unscrew the old one and screw the new one back into the same position."
