      "content": "Condition the leather. Because leather was the skin from a living animal, it needs to be moisturized and conditioned (just like human skin) to prevent it from drying, cracking, and losing its durability. Rub your Docs with a cloth or sponge to massage a conditioner into the leather, making sure to get the hard to reach places as well. Let them dry for about 20 minutes afterward.

Apply the polish to the entire shoe, using gentle but firm pressure to get the polish into the leather’s pores. [10] X Research source If necessary, use a cotton swab or soft-bristled toothbrush to get polish into the hard to reach places. [11] X Research source If your shoes are old and have never been polished, consider applying a second layer of polish.

[13] X Research source If you're looking to achieve a mirror shine, the process is slightly more in depth: Dip your finger into a pot of clean water and allow a couple drops to fall onto a spot on the leather. Dip a cloth into your shoe polish and rub that spot using circular motions. Work in small areas at a time, applying water and working more polish into the leather with a cloth. It will likely take a couple hours to cover the entire boot or shoe, but you should notice the leather getting increasingly smooth. [14] X Research source"

Because it’s oil-based, it’s safe to use on leather. Take a clean rag and dip it in some mineral spirits. Rub the affected area with the rag, adding more mineral spirits as needed. Continue rubbing until the paint dissolves and comes off. [17] X Research source"
