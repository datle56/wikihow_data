      "content": "Move the weights. Slide the weights left and right on the beams until the two white lines at the right line up again. The most efficient way to do this is to make a rough estimate as to what you think the mass will be, and then move the highest value weight you think will still be lower than the mass. Move this weight until the pointer is just under 0. Then move on progressively to the next smallest weights to get closer and closer to the actual mass. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Plug your values into the equation. If the density of your object is 500 kg/m 3 (kilograms per cubic meter), then you put 500 in place of the D for 500=m/v. If your volume is 10 m 3 (cubic meters), put 10 in place of the v for 500=m/10. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Isolate",
      "content": "Isolate the variable. As you are trying to calculate mass, the variable in this equation is m . You want this value to end up alone on one side of the equal sign. In this equation, it is involved in division with another value. To isolate it, you must multiply both sides of the equation by this value. This equation becomes (500)10=(m/10)10. Isolating a variable is always done by performing the opposite mathematical function on both sides of an equation. If the variable is involved in addition, subtract the extra value from both sides, etc."
