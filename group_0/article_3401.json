      "content": "Ensure you’ve given yourself enough time. Once your friend has rejected you, make sure to give you and your friend some time to process and readjust. You both probably feel uncertain about what the two of you now have, so give some time to think things through. If you usually spend every weekend with them or talk to them frequently via text, give yourself a few days apart and decrease your communication during that time. Keep in mind there’s no set time limit for getting over someone. Go with your instincts on how much space or time you both need, but don’t avoid each other for too long. If after a few days or weeks you feel you've processed your initial sadness, reach out to them to see if they're open to talking and spending time together. If they're still uncomfortable, ask them how much longer they need and let them know you’ll be there for them when they're ready to talk again. [1] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 1526 wikiHow readers about what they struggle with the most when it comes to rejection, and only 9% of them said focusing on the negative rather than the positive . [Take Poll] If you’re struggling with this, journal about your feelings to get them out of your head. When a negative thought pops up, challenge it with positive affirmations or self-talk."
