Following through applies to fun things as well—don't tell your friends you're going to go out with them and then flake out at the last minute. They might stop asking you along. Truly good friends know that being friends with someone means hanging out with each other at times that aren't necessarily fun.

But if it seems like it's been an abnormally long time since you've heard from someone, go ahead and shoot them a text and make sure everything's okay. What it looks like: send a text that says something like \"I was just thinking about you and realized we haven't chatted in a while, everything alright?\" Keep in mind that some people are ashamed to reach out when they're having problems. They may need their friends to recognize that something's up and reach out to them instead. Clinical psychologist Lena Dicken notes that \"questions outside of just 'How are you'... really allude to the fact that you want to know more. But saying, 'How are you doing emotionally?' is probably the most succinct way of finding out somebody's feelings specifically.\" \"Offering some of what you're feeling as the person asking can also be helpful,\" Dicken adds. \"People always feel safer to open up once that groundwork has been laid.\""

[7] X Research source What it looks like: If your friend fidgets and bounces their leg in a way that bothers you but you know they can't help it, move to the other side of the table and say something like \"I feel like we can make eye contact better if we sit across from each other\" instead of snapping at them in irritation. Whenever you and a friend have an argument (it happens!), be ready to admit your own mistakes and apologize for your role in the situation. Talk it over and come to a resolution, then let it go—holding grudges can lead to resentment. If you're the one who was in the wrong and your friend isn't ready to forgive you, Dicken recommends you \"say something along the lines of 'I understand that you're still upset with me, and that I've hurt you deeply, or I've really upset you.

Good friends allow their friendship to evolve organically, taking time to understand what changes in their lives might mean for their relationship.

Rather, they accommodate the changes and accept the ways those changes might alter their core friendship.

It's actually really beneficial for people to change and grow... into themselves.\" Good friends give each other plenty of space and freedom to live independent lives, rather than being clingy or possessive.

Because they still have some good qualities, you keep them around longer than is healthy. List the things they do that bother you, then determine if those things bother you because they're actually violating one of your boundaries. [19] X Research source Sometimes, it's less about your friend becoming toxic and more that you've simply grown apart. Dicken notes that \"it's just natural that people grow apart over time, because the only constant is change, and it wouldn't actually be beneficial for us to stay who we were for our entire lives.\" Things that were fine even a year ago might have changed. For example, if you have a friend who likes to go out drinking all the time and you've recently committed to sobriety, you might consider that friend toxic now. Dicken advises that you \"remind yourself that it's okay to let go of relationships that aren't really working anymore, or you don't really have much in common anymore.\" Reflect on your friendships every few years or after a major life change. Remember that it's ok to let go of relationships that are no longer serving your interests."

Do you want them to change the way they treat you, an apology, or both? How will you feel if they decide that they don't want to be friends with you anymore? Do you even like spending time with this person anymore? These questions will help you figure out what kind of boundaries you need to set. [20] X Research source Therapist Ebony Eubanks advises that if a friend is doing something that makes you feel uncomfortable, you \"create a boundary in the relationship\" where you're not subjected to that thing, then \"learn how to accept that person for who they are and not who you want them to be.\" Just setting boundaries isn't enough if you're going to let them slide when they violate your boundaries. Enforce your boundaries consistently so they'll be able to understand and predict the consequences of their actions. For example, if your friend is always late, you might tell them that if they are more than 10 minutes late, you're going to leave. Next time you go out, wait 10 minutes and then leave. If you're still there when they show up 15 minutes late, it shows them that you're not actually going to enforce your boundaries."

[21] X Research source For example, a toxic friend might plant a rumor to test you in some way—they might want to find out your reaction to it or see if you tell them about it.

Start by deleting all of their information from your phone and blocking them on all social media platforms. This removes their influence from your life and gives you a little breathing room. [25] X Research source You don't have to do this forever. If, after a few months, you decide that you miss the person and would like to try being friends, you can always initiate contact again.
