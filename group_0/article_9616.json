      "content": "Multiply the number of degrees by π/180. To understand why you have to do this, you should know that 180 degrees constitute π radians. Therefore, 1 degree is equivalent to (π/180) radians. Since you know this, all you have to do is multiply the number of degrees you're working with by π/180 to convert it to radian terms. You can remove the degree sign since your answer will be in radians anyway. Here's how to set it up: [3] X Research source Example 1 : 120 x π/180 Example 2 : 30 x π/180 Example 3 : 225 x π/180"

Think of it like multiplying two fractions : the first fraction has the number of degrees in the numerator and \"1\" in the denominator, and the second fraction has π in the numerator and 180 in the denominator. Here's how you do the math: [4] X Research source Example 1 : 120 x π/180 = 120π/180 Example 2 : 30 x π/180 = 30π/180 Example 3 : 225 x π/180 = 225π/180"

Find the largest number that can evenly divide into the numerator and denominator of each fraction and use it to simplify each fraction. The largest number for the first example is 60; for the second, it's 30, and for the third, it's 45. But you don't have to know that right away; you can just experiment by first trying to divide the numerator and denominator by 5, 2, 3, or whatever works. Here's how you do it: [5] X Research source Example 1 : 120 x π/180 = 120π/180 ÷ 60/60 = 2/3π radians Example 2 : 30 x π/180 = 30π/180 ÷ 30/30 = π/6 radians Example 3 : 225 x π/180 = 225π/180 ÷ 45/45 = 5/4π radians"
