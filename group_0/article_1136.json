The urine may not be clear no matter how much you drink, and may instead be cloudy from the infection or light bleeding. Strive for urine that is light straw yellow. Drinking plenty of fluids will also flush bacteria out of your bladder and help speed the healing process."

      "content": "Drink cranberry or blueberry juice. Cranberry and blueberry may be helpful when you have a UTI because they contain elements that will help the bacteria not stick to the walls of the bladder or urethra. This may help reduce inflammation, infection, and recurring infections. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try to get cranberry and blueberry juice with as much percentage of juice as possible. There is pure, 100% cranberry juice available, so try to find it. Also look for juices without added sugars or high fructose corn syrup. Cranberry juice cocktail can have as little as 5% juice, but up to 33%, as well as artificial or added sweeteners and won’t help as much as 100% pure cranberry or blueberry juices. Try to get the purest form you can. You can also take cranberry extract as a pill supplement. This is a good alternative if you want to reduce the amount of sugar you ingest. [4] X Research source Make sure to follow the supplement directions. Don’t use the supplement if you are allergic to cranberry juice. Speak with your doctor before taking a supplement if you are pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy. Don’t take a cranberry supplement or drink cranberry juice if you are taking a blood thinner, such as Warfarin.

      "content": "Drink ginger tea. Ginger tea can help alleviate the inflammation. It can also help reduce any nausea you feel. You can also take a supplement. Cooking with ginger spice doesn’t have the same effectiveness as a tea or supplement because it doesn’t provide the same concentrated amount. [6] X Research source Check with a pharmacist or physician if you have medical conditions or are taking medications before incorporating ginger into your diet. It can interact with certain medications and supplements. Ginger can cause mild heartburn and diarrhea if taken in high doses. A high dose is considered more than two cups of tea per day or more than the recommended amount of supplements. Don’t take ginger root, ginger tea, or supplements if you have gallstones, will have surgery soon, are pregnant, breastfeeding, or intend to become pregnant without discussing with your doctor. Don’t take ginger root, tea, or supplements if you have a bleeding disorder or are taking blood thinners."

Medication containing phenazopyridine can help to alleviate pain associated with bladder spasms, as they can numb your urethra and bladder to prevent burning during urination. One such medication is Pyridium, which can be taken at 200 mg three times a day as needed for up to two days. Another OTC medicine is Uristat. These medications will turn urine red or orange. [10] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Be aware that if you start taking medications containing phenazopyridine, your medical provider won’t be able to check your urine for UTI using a dipstick , as the test strip will turn orange. You can also take ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen (Aleve) for the pain; however, the pain suffered during urination will persist, as these do not have the same numbing effect as phenazopyridine. If you have extreme pain, your doctor may prescribe you a prescription analgesic. These are used for a short period of time and are paired with antibiotics, which will eliminate the pain and the need for pain medications quickly after you start taking them.
