      "title": "Use eggs that are about one week old, if possible.",
      "content": "Use eggs that are about one week old, if possible. When an egg is stored for a while, its contents contract, and the air cell between the shell membranes increases in size. This reaction makes the egg easier to peel and less likely to crack. As a result, eggs that are about a week old are better for hard boiling than farm-fresh eggs. That being said, your eggs shouldn’t be too old, and you should still make sure that the eggs you’re using haven’t gone bad. To test whether your eggs are fresh, Chef Ollie George Cigliano recommends placing them into a bowl of cool water. If the egg sinks to the bottom, it's fresh. If it floats to the top, there's a good chance that it has gone bad."

      "title": "Bring your eggs to room temperature before cooking.",
      "content": "Bring your eggs to room temperature before cooking. When you take an egg straight out of the refrigerator and place it into boiling water, the extreme temperature change can cause the shell to crack. [1] X Research source To prevent this, take your eggs out of the fridge about 30 minutes beforehand, and make sure they're at room temperature before boiling them. [2] X Research source Boiling a very cold egg can also cause the egg white to attach itself to the inside of the shell, which makes the egg harder to peel. As a result, letting your eggs come to room temperature also leads to an easier peeling process."

      "content": "Poke a very small hole in the egg with a clean safety pin. Before you boil your egg, prick the large end of the shell with a clean thumbtack or safety pin. This will release trapped gas and allow the trapped air bubbles to escape during the boiling process, which helps prevent cracks. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Lay a cheesecloth in the pot and arrange your eggs in one layer.",
      "content": "Lay a cheesecloth in the pot and arrange your eggs in one layer. The cloth creates a soft cushion at the bottom of your pot or saucepan, which helps prevent your eggs from cracking as you cook them. If you don’t have a cheesecloth, you can also use a clean folded kitchen towel. [4] X Research source When you try to boil too many eggs at one time, they’re more likely to knock against each other during the cooking process, which can easily cause their shells to crack. To prevent this, make sure that no eggs are overlapping or stacked on top of each other. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Add 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) vinegar per egg and ½ tsp (6 g) salt to the water. The salt helps prevent the eggs from cracking while they’re boiling, and it also makes them easier to peel once they’re done. [7] X Research source The vinegar helps the proteins in the egg white coagulate faster to plug any cracks that develop in the shell during the cooking process. [8] X Research source If you prefer, you can also wait until an egg actually cracks to add the vinegar. However, for the vinegar to be effective, you'll need to act quickly and add it to the water as soon as you notice a crack."

[10] X Research source Let the eggs sit in the hot water for about 3-12 minutes, depending on how hard or soft you like them. Everyone has their own preferences, but Chef Lloyd recommends letting the eggs cook for exactly 10 minutes for the perfect texture. For soft boiled eggs: Remove them from the water within 3 minutes. The whites should be set, while the yolks should be runny and warm. Be very gentle when you remove the eggs—each one out with a large spoon to avoid cracking. [11] X Research source For medium-boiled eggs: Take them out of the water after 5-7 minutes. The yolks should be semi-soft in the center, and the whites should be very firm. You should still handle the eggs gently, but you don't need to worry as much about them cracking. For hardboiled eggs: Leave them in the hot water for 9-12 minutes. The yolks should be firm all the way through. For a solid but soft and bright yellow yolk, leave the eggs in water for 9-10 minutes. For a harder, pale yellow center, leave them in for at least 11-12 minutes."

The egg will still be edible, and the streaks don't have much effect on taste, but some people find them unappetizing. [12] X Research source Consider buying a color-changing egg timer , which is a heat-sensitive indicator that you can place in the water with your boiling eggs. You can find these timers online or at kitchen-supply stores. [13] X Research source"

When the eggs are done cooking, carefully move them into this bowl to rapidly decrease their temperature and prevent them from getting overdone. [14] X Research source Remove your eggs from the pot one by one with a slotted spoon, and gently drop them into the bowl of ice water to prevent cracking. If you don’t want to use an ice bath, Chef Lloyd recommends running the eggs under cold tap water right after they finish cooking to achieve the same effect."

      "content": "Refrigerate the eggs for 20-30 minutes then peel them before eating. Once the eggs are cool enough to hold in your hand, put them in the refrigerator for 20-30 minutes to loosen the shells. To peel your eggs , press each one into a clean, flat surface and roll it in your hand to crack the shell. Start peeling from the fatter end of the egg, where there should be a small empty space under the shell. This makes it slightly easier to peel. [16] X Research source Try rinsing the eggs under cold water as you peel them. Rinsing helps keep bits of shell and membrane from sticking to the egg. [17] X Research source If you're not particular about how pretty your peeled eggs are, or if you like your eggs warm, you can skip the refrigerator and start peeling them immediately after the ice bath."

      "content": "What causes the green ring around a hard-boiled egg’s yolk? A green ring around the yolk of a hardboiled egg is usually a result of overcooking. It’s caused by sulfur and iron compounds in the egg reacting on the surface of the yolk. The green ring can sometimes be the result of high iron content in the cooking water, as well. Although many people don’t like the way the green ring looks, it’s entirely safe to eat. [20] X Research source To prevent the green ring from forming, take extra care not to overcook your hard-boiled eggs. If you think iron in your tap water is to blame, try using filtered water to boil your eggs instead."

If the egg cracks in the water while it’s cooking, it’s still safe to eat, and it will likely cook normally if the crack isn’t too severe. On the other hand, if you notice that an egg is already cracked in the carton before you’ve even cooked it, the egg isn’t safe to eat. Bacteria may have gotten into the interior of the egg through the crack, making it potentially hazardous to your health. [23] X Research source"
