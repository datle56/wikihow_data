Some countries have different road rules and road signs, so it's important to know what you're doing before you get on the road. Study up on the areas that you plan on traveling to, and get well-acquainted with their rules of the road before driving in that country. Don't forget that you might need to brush up on a different language depending on the country you'll be driving in as some road signs might be written instructions rather than visual signs, so know before you go.

Drivers get so used to driving on one side of the road that it's easy to fall into the routine of driving on that side. You wouldn't want to forget the drive on the right-hand side, as that could lead to accidents."

This way, you won't have to ask people you don't know who might speak a different language for help. Consider applying for insurance that will cover your car if it breaks down in the country you're in."

In countries where one drives on the right-hand side of the road, the cars are built so that the driver sits on the left-hand side of the car instead of the right. Also, changing gears is done with the opposite hand. No matter what country you're in, the pedals will always be in the same position from left to right. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Practice in a car park. Before you drive on a public road, practice driving on the right-hand side and parking in a designated car park so you can build up some confidence before you go on the road. You'll find that you're more prepared and more accustomed to this different way of driving when you start to drive on public roads. Without practice, it's possible to become distracted by trying to remember how to drive on the right."

If they're facing you, you're going in the correct direction — that is, unless the signs read \"Wrong Way\" or \"Do Not Enter\"! Oncoming traffic is seen coming from the left. Left-turning traffic must cross oncoming traffic. Traffic signs facing motorists are mostly on the right-hand side of the road."

Because you are a new learner, keep in mind that the \"fast\" lane is the left lane and the \"slow\" lane is the right lane, which is the opposite of what you're used to. (In both cases, however, it is the lane farthest from the oncoming traffic.) Let fast drivers pass on your left. When you need to pass other drivers, give a left turn signal, move to the left, pass, signal right, and move in front."

      "content": "Make turns with care. Signal in plenty of time to let other drivers know what you are doing, and make any necessary adjustments. Be sure to check all mirrors before turning or changing lanes. Make a left turn by getting as close as possible to the left-most lane, nearest the median strip (in a divided road) or the center of the road (when oncoming traffic is immediately adjacent). When completing your turn, you will cross traffic going opposite your original direction and traffic going opposite your intended direction. Be sure you end up in the right half of any two-way road, but in the left lane (if there is more than one). To make a right-hand turn, stay close to the curb or the edge of the road and do not cross any traffic when completing your turn."
