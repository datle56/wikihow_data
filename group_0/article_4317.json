Don’t fill the kettle more than halfway full with eggs or they may not cook evenly. [1] X Research source Be careful not to shake the kettle or allow the eggs to roll around to keep them from cracking."

Make sure you don’t shift the eggs around too much so they don’t crack. Fill the kettle until the water is 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the eggs. [2] X Research source Use cool water so you don’t overcook the eggs."

Wait until the water comes to a boil and the kettle turns off on its own. If your kettle doesn’t turn off once it reaches a boil, then turn it off yourself as soon as the water starts bubbling.

      "content": "Remove the eggs and place them into a bowl of cold water. Fill a medium to large-sized bowl with cold water and place it near the kettle. Use a pair of tongs or a large spoon and take the eggs out of the kettle and gently place them into the bowl of cold water so they stop cooking. [4] X Research source It’s important that the water in the bowl is cold so the eggs don’t continue to cook after you remove them. You can toss a couple of ice cubes in the bowl of water to cool the eggs even faster."

      "content": "Peel and eat the soft-boiled eggs once they’re cool to the touch. Start peeling a soft-boiled egg by tapping the top of it lightly with a spoon to crack it. Then, use your fingers to carefully lift the shell off of the egg. Continue lifting the shell from the surface of the egg until it’s completely removed. [5] X Research source Soft-boiled eggs can be enjoyed on their own with a pinch of salt and some fresh cracked pepper, or you can add them to a tasty dish like the top of some avocado toast or in a bowl of ramen noodles."

      "content": "Place the eggs into the kettle and cover them with water. Carefully set the eggs inside of the kettle, making sure you don’t drop them or shake the kettle so they don’t crack. Fill the kettle with cool water until the eggs are covered with about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. [6] X Research source Make sure you use cool water so you don’t start cooking the eggs!

Leave it undisturbed until it comes to a boil and turns off automatically. If your kettle doesn’t automatically turn off once the water reaches a boil, wait until the water is bubbling away and then turn it off. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Leave the eggs in the kettle for 15 minutes, then transfer them to cold water. Set a timer for 15 minutes and allow the eggs to simply soak in the hot water and cook. Fill a bowl with cool water and place it near the kettle. Once the timer goes off, use a spoon or a pair of tongs to remove the eggs from the water and place them into the cool water. [8] X Research source The cool water will stop them from cooking further and will allow you to pick them up without burning your hands. Set a timer on your stove or on your phone so you can hear it and the eggs won’t overcook."

      "content": "Peel the eggs and eat them or store them in your refrigerator. An easy way to peel stubborn hard-boiled eggs is to tap the bottom of the egg a few times on your sink or countertop to crack it, then use your fingers to start lifting the shell from the bottom. If bits of the shell are stuck on the egg, hold the egg under running water as you peel to loosen them. You can then eat the eggs, or place them in a container in your refrigerator for up to a week. [9] X Research source Hard-boiled eggs are great on their own with some salt and pepper, but you can also chop them up and toss them into a salad to add some extra protein!"
