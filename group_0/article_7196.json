Part of the reason why the BBB is so respected is that they allow consumers across the country to report businesses through the use of the same complaint filing formats and procedures. Once the complaint is received the BBB acts as an impartial mediator and provides access to dispute resolution tools in order to resolve the complaint.

If you have had an unpleasant experience with the company you searched for, it may be a good idea to file a complaint in order to hopefully prevent future consumers from also having a similarly bad experience. The BBB handles complaints between consumers and businesses. They do not handle employment law disputes, discrimination or healthcare claims, nor matters currently or already litigated. [5] X Trustworthy Source Better Business Bureau Nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting marketplace trustworthiness by educating consumers and reviewing businesses Go to source The BBB suggests, but does not require consumers to first try to resolve the issue with the business before commencing the official BBB complaint filing process.

      "content": "Don’t put too much weight on the fact that a company is BBB accredited. Though the BBB is a great resource for accessing detailed information about a business, the BBB has come under some criticism for how much weight the public places on the BBB accreditation process. This is because the BBB accreditation process only requires the submission of an application and fee to the BBB, as well as the business's agreement to adhere to abstract standards such as operating with transparency. Consider BBB accreditation as being more like a club membership, as opposed to being a true certification of business excellence. Though BBB accreditation indicates that a business values its’ relationship with the public, this does not mean that the BBB has conducted a substantial, in-depth, on-site review of the company and its operations."

Unlike the BBB, some companies such as Angie’s List rely on membership fees from consumers and not businesses. As a result, there is less of an incentive for Angie’s List to inflate ratings, or to otherwise act for the benefit of listed businesses. Though all of these companies also rely on business advertisements, using multiple websites to check out a company is a great way to get a clear picture of a business, their practices, and interactions with the public.
