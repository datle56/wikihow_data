Then select the value at the end of the list. [1] X Research source For example, suppose you are testing the precision of a scale, and you observe five measurements: 11, 13, 12, 14, 12. After sorting, these values are listed as 11, 12, 12, 13, 14. The highest measurement is 14."

Algebraically, the range can be expressed as: Range = x ( m a x ) − x ( m i n ) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Range}}=x(max)-x(min)} For the sample data, the range is: Range = x ( m a x ) − x ( m i n ) = 14 − 11 = 3 {\\displaystyle {\\text{Range}}=x(max)-x(min)=14-11=3}"

Because there are different measures of precision, you should specify what you are reporting. For this data, you would report Mean=12.4, Range=3, or simply that the Mean=12.4±3. [3] X Research source The mean is not actually part of calculating the range or precision, but it is generally the primary calculation for reporting the measured value. The mean is found by adding up the sum of the measured values and then dividing by the number of items in the group. For this set of data, the mean is (11+13+12+14+12)/5=12.4."

The first step in finding the average deviation is to calculate the mean of the measured values. The mean is the sum of the values, divided by the number of measurements taken. [4] X Research source For this example, use the same sample data as before. Assume that five measurements have been taken, 11, 13, 12, 14, and 12. The mean of these values is (11+13+12+14+12)/5=12.4."

To do this, subtract the mean from each number. For this measurement, it does not matter whether the value is above or below the mean. Subtract the numbers and just use the positive value of the result. This is also called the absolute value. [5] X Research source Algebraically, the absolute value is shown by placing two vertical bars around the calculation, as follows: Absolute deviation = | x − μ | {\\displaystyle {\\text{Absolute deviation}}=|x-\\mu |} For this calculation, x {\\displaystyle x} represents each of the experimental values, and μ {\\displaystyle \\mu } is the calculated mean. For the values of this sample data set, the absolute deviations are: | 12 − 12.4 | = 0.4 {\\displaystyle |12-12.4|=0.4} | 11 − 12.4 | = 1.4 {\\displaystyle |11-12.4|=1.4} | 14 − 12.4 | = 1.6 {\\displaystyle |14-12.4|=1.6} | 13 − 12.4 | = 0.6 {\\displaystyle |13-12.4|=0.6} | 12 − 12.4 | = 0.4 {\\displaystyle |12-12.4|=0.4}"

      "content": "Use the correct formula for standard deviation. For any size data set, the standard deviation is a reliable statistic for reporting precision. There are two formulas for calculating standard deviation, with a very slight difference between them. You will use one formula if your measured data represents an entire population. You will use the second formula if your measured data is from only a sample of the population. [8] X Research source Your data represents an entire population if you have collected all the measurements possible from all possible subjects. For example, if you are conducting tests on people with some very rare disease, and you believe that you have tested everyone with that disease, then you have the entire population. The standard deviation formula in this case is: σ = Σ ( x − μ ) 2 n {\\displaystyle \\sigma ={\\sqrt {\\frac {\\Sigma (x-\\mu )^{2}}{n}}}} A sample set is any group of data less than an entire population. This is actually going to be used more often. The standard deviation formula for a sample set is: σ = Σ ( x − μ ) 2 n − 1 {\\displaystyle \\sigma ={\\sqrt {\\frac {\\Sigma (x-\\mu )^{2}}{n-1}}}} Notice that the only difference is in the denominator of the fraction. For an entire population, you will divide by n {\\displaystyle n} . For a sample set, you will divide by n − 1 {\\displaystyle n-1} ."

When collecting a group of data, either by measurement or through an experiment of some kind, the precision describes how close together the results of each measurement or experiment are going to be. [14] X Research source Precision is not the same as accuracy. Accuracy measures how close experimental values come to the true or theoretical value, while precision measures how close the measured values are to each other. It is possible for data to be accurate but not precise or to be precise but not accurate. Accurate measurements are close to the target value but may not be close to each other. Precise measurements are close to each other, whether or not they are close to the target."

This is particularly true if the values appear reasonably closely grouped. If you see one or two values that appear far from the others, you may wish to use a different calculation. Average deviation. The average deviation is a more accurate measure of precision for a small set of data values. [15] X Research source Standard deviation. The standard deviation is perhaps the most recognized measure of precision. Standard deviation may be used to calculate the precision of measurements for an entire population or a sample of the population."

      "content": "Report your results clearly. Very often, investigators will report data by giving the mean of the measured value, followed by a statement of the precision. The precision is shown with a “±” symbol. This provides an indication of precision, but it does not clearly explain to the reader if the number following the “±” symbol is a range, standard deviation, or some other measurement. To be very clear, you should define what measure of precision you are using, either in a footnote or parenthetical note. For example, for one series of data, the result could be reported as 12.4±3. However, a more explanatory way to report the same data would be to say “Mean=12.4, Range=3.”"
