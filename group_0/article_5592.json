      "content": "Try calling yourself. If you start to get your standard \"I'm away from the phone right now\" recording, try pressing * before the message ends — for many carriers, this command signals that you want to log in to your voicemail account. You can usually look up your own number on most modern smartphones. To do this, navigate to your \"Settings\" menu, then tap \"Phone\" or \"About phone.\" From here, you should see an entry labeled \"My phone number\" or something similar with your number listed under it. Note that the instructions above are very general and will vary from phone to phone."

However, most modern phones will direct you to set up a voicemail account the first time you try to access your voicemail using one of the methods above. In this case, an audio recording will usually direct you through the process of choosing a password and/or recording a message for your callers — simply follow the prompts you are given to set up your account. If you aren't automatically directed to set up your voicemail account when you first try to log in, your carrier may have a special setup process you need to go to, so contact your carrier's online support resources or its customer support line (see below.)"

Unlike passwords for most online services, there isn't usually an easy \"Forgot password?\" option for getting your voicemail password back if you don't remember it. Typically, the easiest way to reset your password is to do so online via the account you have registered with your carrier. Below are brief instructions for resetting your password at the sites of major U.S. carriers: Verizon: Visit verizon.com/myverison, then navigate to My Verizon > My Device > Reset Voicemail Password. Follow the prompts to rest your password. AT&T: Log in to your MyAT&T account, then navigate to Profile > Passwords > Wireless Voicemail Passwords. Select the number you want and click Submit.
