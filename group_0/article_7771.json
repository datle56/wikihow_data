Alternately, apply a dusting of baking soda to a damp sponge and scrub the cups. The baking soda and vinegar will react, dissolving the film that causes the plastic to appear foggy.

      "content": "Use a vinegar and water mixture. Combine white vinegar and water in equal parts. For instance, if you have a large load of foggy plastic, you might fill your sink with one liter of vinegar and one liter of water. Place your foggy plastic items in the water, and let them soak for one hour. [2] X Research source Scrub the plastic items with a damp rag until they become clear. For stubborn deposits, let the mixture soak for several hours. Rinse the no longer foggy plastic in the sink under warm water. Dry with a soft cloth."

      "content": "Use a baking soda paste. Instead of using baking soda and vinegar, mix baking soda and just enough water to form a paste. Dab a paper towel into the baking soda paste. Apply the paste to a small area of the cloudy plastic using a steady circular motion. [3] X Research source Use an old toothbrush to scrub the paste into the plastic and reach tight corners or crevices. As the paste removes the cloudiness from the inside of the blender or cup you’re cleaning, you will see the paper towel darken with grime."

If you’re cleaning a foggy plastic blender, run the blender on high for a few seconds, then turn it off and remove the blade (if possible). With your cup or blender bottle still filled with the lemon juice mix, scrub the inside of it with a non-abrasive sponge or microfiber cloth. Pour the juice out when the fogginess has been corrected.

Then, cleaning specialist Ahmed Mezil explains that “one of the best ways to clean fog off plastic is vinegar and warm water. Place about 3 cups (710 mL) of vinegar in a container and apply it to the surface [of the headlights] with a cloth for 5 minutes. For stubborn fog, incorporate a mixture of baking soda and warm water [with the vinegar].

[It’s] a very simple process.” [8] X Expert Source Chad Zani Auto Detailing Expert Expert Interview. 2 October 2019. To use it: “Tape up the vehicle’s paint around both headlights.

Then, apply the headlight restorer to the headlights with a microfiber pad attached to a drill. “It’s about 5 minutes per headlight,” adds Zani. “You'll end up with a nice, fresh start.

While these cleaners may make your headlights look shiny and clear again at first, the effect will fade. “There are temporary fixes that you can do. If you just rub petroleum jelly on headlights, they will look better for as long as that petroleum jelly hangs around,” explains Zani. “I see a lot of really bad advice where people are using toothpaste and all sorts of things. If you put any kind of oil-based thing, like olive oil, spray oil, or cooking oil, it'll make a dull headlamp look better, but only momentarily.

Use a spray bottle or bucket to apply the soapy water to the headlights, wiping away any plastic dust from your dry sanding. Rinse the lights off, but don’t dry them—the water will act as a lubricant while you sand and polish the lights with increasingly fine sandpaper. [14] X Research source After rinsing, take 1000-grit sandpaper (or, if you started with 600-grit, use an 800-grit first) and sand the headlights. Make diagonal and left-right passes with the sandpaper for the clearest results. Circular motions may not lead to the same clarity when you’re sanding by hand. Add more water to the light periodically to flush away debris and keep the sandpaper from getting clogged."

If the surface is not uniform, wipe the headlight down again with 2000- or 3000-grit sandpaper while spraying it with soapy water. Then, it’s time to add the compound: [16] X Research source Apply two small dabs of compound to a rotary sander-polisher equipped with a 4-inch (10-cm) polishing pad . Wipe the pad about the surface of the headlight before turning it on. Set the polisher to a speed between 1500-1800 rotations per minute and move the pad slowly across the surface of the headlight. Use only slight pressure when applying the polisher pad to the headlight. This step will remove any haziness that remains from the sanding process."

Set the polisher to 1200-1500 rotations per minute and move it slowly and evenly across the surface of the headlight. [17] X Research source When you’re done, wipe the headlight off with a dry hand towel. Remove the tape surrounding the edges of the headlight.

[24] X Expert Source Chad Zani Auto Detailing Expert Expert Interview. 2 October 2019. This is because UV rays are known to (slowly) degrade plastic into microplastics, nanoplastics, and other molecules.
