An argument has to be two-sided; if you fail to hear the other side out, they will return the gesture and not listen to you. Refuting a person's opinion is fine, but refusing to hear it makes a debate pointless. [2] X Research source You should always be respectful when arguing with another person. Remember, that's what they are: another person. Treat them the way that you would want to be treated. Don't immediately dismiss their ideas just because they don't agree with you. Listen to them."

      "content": "Attack ideas, not the person they're attached to. When you argue with someone, you should remember to only attack that person's ideas, not the person themselves. That means you shouldn't call the person stupid for thinking what they think, and you shouldn't devolve to attacks on their physical appearance either."

Evidence from reliable sources that specifically supports and deals with what you're arguing about can be one of the easiest ways to win an argument. You should also tailor the type of evidence you use to what kind of person they are, using more logical or more emotional evidence based on what you think they'll respond to best."

Learning to recognize logical fallacies can be challenging but here are a few common ones: [8] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source Watch out for arguments with incorrectly assume that correlation means causation. For example, rates of autism diagnosis increased with the usage of cell phones. Therefore, autism is caused by cellphone usage. Post-hoc fallacies are similar, but are based on the idea that because A preceded B, B was caused by A. An Argument from Silence fallacy is the idea that because there is no evidence for something, it must not exist. For example, God/germs/evolution/aliens do not exist because we have never physically witnessed them. Non-Sequiturs are when the conclusion of an argument is unrelated to its premise. For example, the argument that we can't pay teachers more because police officers and firefighters do not make that much money. [9] X Research source"

Keep them thinking this and charm them into changing their views by carefully tailoring how you talk about the issues. For example, \"I know you really, really want to help people.

[13] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source The fastest way to make an argument totally pointless is to let it get derailed. Stay on topic when you argue and when the other person derails, get them back on track. Solving a single disagreement is better than getting nowhere with 20 separate issues. Discuss one issue at a time, covering everything you want to say about it. When it's been settled or you've reached an impasse, move on to the next topic. Don't allow subject changes. The other person might try to change the subject in order to cover up a mistake. Many people, when proven wrong in some area, will rather be dismissive of their mistake rather than acknowledging their error. Either leave the argument if the person refuses to acknowledge mistakes (\"It doesn't matter\", \"Whatever, that's my opinion.\", etc.), or insist they acknowledge their error."

You should also make sure you agree with the premise of your opponent's argument. If you don't agree with the example they're using, or if you think it isn't representative or the idea is flawed in some way, say so before getting knee-deep in an argument.
