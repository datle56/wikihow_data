Just like with Instagram’s built-in captioning options, these apps typically allow you to edit the captions in case of errors. They may also allow a wider range of customization options, such as a variety of fonts, colors, and caption styles. Some popular captioning apps include Clips, Subtitles: Captions for Video, MixCaptions, and Captio. Once you’ve added captions to your video using the app of your choice, upload the edited video to Instagram using the Post, Story, or Reels feature."

      "title": "This method helps ensure that your captions are accurate.",
      "content": "This method helps ensure that your captions are accurate. However, it’s also more complicated and time-consuming than other approaches. Open up a plain text editor such as Notepad or TextEdit. For each line of speech, or any other sounds you’d like to caption, write a sequence number, starting with 1. Under that number, write the time code for the line, marking the start and end times for when you’d like each caption to appear. Then, write the caption text. Insert a blank line after each caption. When you’re done, save the file with an .srt extension. The time codes are written in the format hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds, with the start and end times connected by an arrow with two dashes (-->). For instance, your first line might look like this: 1 00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,002 This is my first line of dialogue. Once you’ve created your caption file, sync it to your video using a video editing app or program such as Camtasia, MovieCaptioner, or Adobe Premier. Follow the instructions in the app to import the file. If you’d rather not type out all the captions by hand, you can also use a free website such as Amara.org, Subtitle Horse, or DotSub.com to automatically generate an editable caption file. To use these services, you’ll need to upload the video somewhere first and provide a link."

They typically charge a small amount of money per minute of video, and some offer more advanced features such as translations, more detailed audio descriptions, and caption customization options. Some popular video captioning services include Rev, GoTranscript, and 3Play Media. You may have the option of getting your caption file separately or ordering a video with the captions already built in. Depending on how fast you want your captions—and how difficult the audio is to transcribe—you may need to pay some additional fees on top of the base charge per minute of video."
