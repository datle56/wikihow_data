      "content": "Find a secure area. Find a car, tree, or bush to conceal at least half of your body while you change into your bathing suit. Change on the side of the car, tree, or bush that is facing away from the beach or the public area. You can also ask a friend to hold up their towel while you change into your bathing suit. Have them hold their towel horizontally and as close to you as possible. This way, their towel will be similar to a stall wall."

      "content": "Wrap a towel around your waist. While you are standing up, begin to wrap the towel around your waist. Fasten the towel around your waist by tucking the top outermost corner in between your skin and the towel. You should wrap the towel tightly around your waist, but not so tight that it makes it hard to maneuver. [1] X Research source If you have a hair clip, you can also clip your towel instead of tucking it. For best results, you should use an adult-sized towel where your whole body is able to fit inside the area of the towel, including your feet. [2] X Research source"

For example, if your suit top clips, then clip it underneath your shirt first and pull it up. If it ties, then tie the strings around your torso first. Then, twist the tied strings around toward your back so the front of the bathing suit is on your torso, and pull up. Pull your arms back through your shirtsleeves and finish securing the bathing suit top, i.e., tie the strings around your neck or make any adjustments before taking off your shirt. Alternatively, you can put your bathing suit top on over your shirt. Secure your top as you normally would over your shirt. Then, pull your arms through your shirtsleeves and carefully take off your shirt so that your bathing suit top does not move and expose you."
