      "title": "Do quests.",
      "content": "Do quests. Turning in quests will net you a good amount of experience points. You'll usually get led through level-appropriate areas with quests. So you can break up the monotony of questing with grinding and vice versa!"

      "title": "Grind enemies.",
      "content": "Grind enemies. If you're bored with simply talking to NPCs and questing, you can mindlessly kill mobs to gain experience (this is, however, generally considered to be a pretty bad option as enemies give far less XP than quests)."

      "title": "Get XP boosts.",
      "content": "Get XP boosts. Pay Robux to make leveling faster by buying XP boosts through the Roblox store. You can also search online for working codes that give you free XP boosts. A list of working codes can be found here"
    },
    {
      "title": "Spend your skill points wisely.",
      "content": "Spend your skill points wisely. Put 60% of your points to melee and 40% to defense. So every time you level up, put 2 in Melee and 1 in Defense. Once melee is maxed, you can put those skill points in Sword. This will make grinding faster and easier."
    },
    {
      "title": "Defeat bosses.",
      "content": "Defeat bosses. A boss kill will reward you with a solid chunk of experience points. There are recommended levels for each boss, however. You most likely won't be able to beat a level 2175 boss if you're level 25."

      "title": "Level on a private server.",
      "content": "Level on a private server. Using public servers means others can Bounty Hunt you at any time. A private server allows you to grind without other players fighting you."

    {
      "title": "The best Fruit for grinding is Buddha.",
      "content": "The best Fruit for grinding is Buddha. The Fruit offers a huge defense boost, increased range for sword and melee attacks, water walking, and a double jump that damages enemies. [1] X Research source You can also use Magma or any Fruit with a large hitbox, but Buddha is the best for grinding. If you're just starting and don't have Buddha, don't fret! You can grind with any fruit, but Elemental fruits are considered to be the best in the First Sea. Switch to a PVP-based Fruit (like Leopard or Dough) around 2,500-2,600 since you will most likely focus on PVP then! If you don't want to PVP, that's OK! Just remember that other players (sometimes called bounty hunters) will jump you if you're near max level."

    {
      "title": "Sword or melee fighting is better with the Buddha Fruit than using the fruit's attacks.",
      "content": "Sword or melee fighting is better with the Buddha Fruit than using the fruit's attacks. You will be able to hit things further away as long as you have the Buddha Fruit equipped."

      "title": "Human is most recommended since Ghoul is difficult to unlock.",
      "content": "Human is most recommended since Ghoul is difficult to unlock. Human doesn't have too many downsides, and almost everyone can use it immediately. You can also awaken Human to unlock damage boosts. Ghoul isn't as easy as using the Human race, but the passive lifesteal effect can be nice. Ghoul is a great race to grind for while you're in the Cursed Ship or when you get bored along the road to max level. Level 1,000 is required to unlock Ghoul."
