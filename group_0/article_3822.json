      "title": "Attend local competitions.",
      "content": "Attend local competitions. When you are just starting out, visiting local competitions will be helpful for a few reasons: you will be able to get a feel for competitions and what will be expected of you, you will be exposed to your potential competitors, and you will be able to speak with like-minded men and women who also enjoy the sport. You can make connections at a competition you might not be able to make at your local gym. The goal here is to network and find out more about the sport and the local community, not to find a sponsor or find a moneymaking opportunity. Don’t ask for favors; ask for guidance."

      "title": "Talk to bodybuilders and coaches.",
      "content": "Talk to bodybuilders and coaches. If possible, talk to bodybuilders and coaches you come into contact with at the competition. They may be able to recommend the best gyms for bodybuilding in your area, or may know of a personal trainer looking for more clients. [1] X Research source Don’t be afraid to ask bodybuilders or their coaches if the gym they attend is open to the public, or if their rosters have room for another trainee. While they may be your competition down the line, most are willing to share their love of the sport. Ask simple questions, such as, “Where do you train?” “How did you get started?” “What does an average training session look like?” Each of these questions can help you on your own bodybuilding journey."

      "title": "Visit at least three gyms.",
      "content": "Visit at least three gyms. Even if you love the first gym you step into, visit at least three gyms to find one that suits all of your needs. Gyms vary widely in the types of amenities and training programs they offer; while one might have all of the equipment you want, another might be more effective for you due to the expertise of its trainers. [2] X Research source Always make sure you read the terms of your contract before you sign on with a gym. Some gyms may exaggerate their offerings, but require a large fee for the early contract termination, while other gyms may have exclusivity clauses."

    {
      "title": "Speak with personal trainers.",
      "content": "Speak with personal trainers. When you visit a gym, speak with the personal trainers on staff to find out what they are looking for, and what you can expect from the gym. Think of it as an interview, of sorts, to act as your trainer. [3] X Research source When you speak to personal trainers, specify that you are interested in bodybuilding. Not all personal trainers are willing or qualified to train for the sole purpose of building bulk. A prospective trainer should also be made aware of your expectations. If you have a specific deadline you’d like to meet (for an upcoming competition, for instance), tell the trainer your deadline and desired training schedule."

    {
      "title": "Join a gym that fits your needs.",
      "content": "Join a gym that fits your needs. Not every bodybuilder is going to want a personal trainer, nor is every bodybuilder going to need a 24-hour gym. Find a gym that suits all of your needs, including business hours, training equipment, training instruction, and membership fees. Bodybuilding does not have to drain your bank account, but it easily can. Make sure you keep your personal budget in mind when joining a gym, enlisting the help of a trainer, and paying competition fees and purchasing competition apparel."

      "title": "Identify your body type and what you are striving for.",
      "content": "Identify your body type and what you are striving for. If you want to get into competitions, then it is important to know your body’s strengths and to be aware of what judges will be looking for. Look into the federation’s guidelines and attend a competition to see what the competitors look like. [4] X Research source This will help you to design an effective training program along with the guidance of your trainer."

    {
      "title": "Get moving.",
      "content": "Get moving. If you have enlisted the help of a personal trainer, go to your first session and do exactly as you’re told. If you are following an exercise program, follow each of the instructions to the letter, and do each exercise to the best of your ability. Getting started is arguably the most difficult part of bodybuilding. [5] X Research source If you are using a trainer, listen to their advice and follow the training plans they’ve set. These are likely to be difficult, but are set in a specific order and pattern to help your body build sustained, useful muscles. Expect to start with basic exercises, such as squats and bench presses. These exercises allow you to gradually add more weight and provide significant gains."

    {
      "title": "Track your progress.",
      "content": "Track your progress. Track your progress via progress photos (ideally taken in the same lighting and clothing each week), weight gains, and measurement gains. Keep all of your gains and observations in a notebook or folder on your phone or computer so you have easy access and can check in with your progress any time. [6] X Research source This may not seem like an important step, but being able to see physical changes in your body is an excellent way to keep your motivation high. If possible, use exactly the same pose in each of your photos, as well, as this will give you a more concrete visual of any possible changes. Tracking your progress will also give you a window into which exercises and routines are effective, and which do not provide as many muscle gains."

      "title": "Up your reps and weights gradually.",
      "content": "Up your reps and weights gradually. If you’ve managed a certain set of weights for a week, don’t immediately add another 20 pounds, as this could cause injury and could actually set your training back. Up your weight limits gradually, and stop if you feel any sharp pain or you are in danger of dropping your weights. [7] X Expert Source Laila Ajani Fitness Trainer Expert Interview. 31 October 2019. [8] X Research source Under the supervision of a trainer or partner, you might want to try dead lifting and similarly challenging lifts. If this is the case, be aware that these should never be done solo, and should not make up the bulk of your training."

      "title": "Train four to five times per week.",
      "content": "Train four to five times per week. Although you might be tempted to train seven days a week, or even multiple times per day, this will actually slow down your progress and damage your muscles. Aim for four to five training times per week, varying the types of exercises you do. The human body is highly adaptable, so keeping your muscles guessing is a key aspect of bodybuilding and weightlifting. [9] X Expert Source Laila Ajani Fitness Trainer Expert Interview. 31 October 2019. Although you should not do intense training regimens seven times per week, you should be in some way active each day, even if it something as simple as walking up stairs instead of using an elevator, or taking a walk around the block."

      "title": "Give your body recovery time.",
      "content": "Give your body recovery time. When aiming for four to five days of training per week, make sure you add some recovery time. One to three days, you can go for a leisurely walk or a relaxed jog. One out of the two to three days, you could swim or practice yoga. Make sure you set aside time for your body to rest and heal. [11] X Research source Do not, under any circumstances, skip rest days. Your body will not be able to build muscle effectively if it does not have time to heal and repair itself. Because building muscle means creating tiny tears in muscle fiber, which then heals, failing to give your body adequate time to repair and rest will mean few gains and the risk of serious injury."

Before you make any drastic changes to your diet, it is important to consult with a dietitian who has experience working with bodybuilders. They will be able to develop an eating plan for you that will help you to reach your goals."

      "content": "Cut processed foods. Highly processed, high-sodium foods will not give your body the energy required to maintain heavy weightlifting and exercising. If you want to steadily build muscle and eliminate body fat, you must say a firm “goodbye” to processed foods."

      "title": "Avoid sugar and artificial sweeteners.",
      "content": "Avoid sugar and artificial sweeteners. If you avoid processed food, but still consume sugar or artificial sweeteners, you are also doing yourself a disservice. If you must sweeten your items, use natural sugars such as fruit, honey, and maple syrup. Make sure to use sugar sparingly. [12] X Research source Whenever possible, opt for fresh over pre-made. Use meal prep such as chopping your food beforehand, or creating weekly lunches to encourage healthy eating habits."

      "title": "Up your protein intake.",
      "content": "Up your protein intake. Protein is required to build and maintain muscle. Eating a low-protein diet will not allow you to build muscle mass and may actually lead to the loss of muscle mass and fatigue. While you do not need to eat a steak at every meal, you should incorporate meat, beans, dairy, eggs, and nuts into your diet. [13] X Research source Eat protein wisely. A pound of bacon is not going to provide your body with the same nutrient content as a pound of lean, grass-fed beef. Make sure you consume plant-based protein as well, through nuts, nut butters, soy, legumes (such as kidney beans, chickpeas, and lentils) and other plant proteins for a well-rounded diet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Eat plenty of carbs.",
      "content": "Eat plenty of carbs. Although a high-protein diet is a must for bodybuilding, you should not eschew carbs altogether, as your body needs carbohydrates to build and process energy. Instead, make sure you are eating carbs wisely; a doughnut and a bowl of quinoa are not equals. When implementing carbs, aim for whole-grain, high-quality carbohydrates, including grains such as quinoa, brown rice, oats, and barley. [14] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Eat vegetables.",
      "content": "Eat vegetables. While protein and carbohydrates often get most of the focus where bodybuilding and weight training are concerned, you absolutely need the vitamins and minerals found in vegetables. Make sure you are including a generous helping of vegetables in your diet, including at least one vegetable in each meal. The best rule to follow when eating vegetables is to eat the rainbow—that is, to eat a wide variety of vegetables in different colors. Fruits contain vitamins and minerals as well, but they are much higher in carbohydrates and sugar than vegetables. If you do include fruits in your diet, eat them in moderation, such as no more than one serving per day, or as an occasional treat."

    {
      "title": "Use protein supplements wisely.",
      "content": "Use protein supplements wisely. Throwing back a protein shake every morning is not a guarantee that your body will build muscle mass. Although protein shakes are not inherently bad, they are also not a magical means of building muscle. If you decide to implement a protein supplement in your diet, make sure the ingredients are high-quality (i.e. not riddled with sugar and empty carbs). [15] X Research source While protein supplements can do a lot for a bodybuilder, they are not strictly necessary; while it may be difficult, it is possible to get all of the protein you need through a healthy diet and wise food choices."
