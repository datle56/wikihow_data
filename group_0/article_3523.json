[1] X Research source Watching older movies without the technology and special effects of modern film can also help you appreciate the power of good storytelling and simple visuals.

Take a look at your list of recommended films from a reputable source, and make a point of watching at least a few that you wouldn’t normally be interested in. You’ll expand your understanding of film, and you may discover your tastes are more varied than you thought. Truly great films transcend genre. You may think most sports movies boring, but find yourself drawn in by the humor and humanity of Rocky . Or perhaps you can’t stand fantasy, but are still blown away by the visual splendor of Lord of the Rings."

Start off by choosing movies from countries you’re interested in or familiar with, but try to choose a few from countries you know nothing about as well. Doing a little research on the film beforehand, as well as the country it was made in, can help give you a better understanding of its significance and make it easier to follow the plot."

What other work have they done and how is it similar? Many modern films release short “making of” or “behind the scenes” features, which can usually be found online or in the DVD’s special features. There are several very interesting documentaries on filmmaking and Hollywood which can teach you more about life behind the scenes, such as Casting By , [2] X Research source And the Oscar Goes To… and Hollywood: A Celebration of American Silent Film .

      "content": "Watch movies in the order they were released. As you make your way through your list of chosen movies, try to order them so that you work your way from oldest to newest. This will give you a better idea of how film styles and techniques have changed with time. If you can’t go through all your chosen films in chronological order, try watching an older movie followed by a newer movie in the same genre. For instance, if you are watching 2001: A Space Odyssey , one of the first and most famous movies about space travel, you might follow it with newer movies in the same theme, such as Contact or Solaris , and note how they compare.

If you want to get the most out of your viewing, don’t just have the movie on in the background while you do something else - clear your schedule, dim the lights, get comfortable and give the movie your full attention. Make sure you know the basic details about each movie before you watch it - director, release date, stars, and any particular details the film is famous for. Try not to read anything that will give away too much of the plot. Don’t worry if you don’t like every “important” movie you see. You can still appreciate and understand its significance even if it isn’t one of your favorites. [5] X Research source"

Look online for reviews in major papers, such as the LA Times or the Washington Post. Try hosting a movie marathon and inviting a few friends to watch some of your chosen films with you and discuss them afterwards. They may have insights you hadn’t thought of, and talking about the movie will help you develop your opinions further. Learning some common film terms and what they mean will enhance your discussions and help you better understand reviews. Look for filmmaking glossaries geared towards film buffs, rather than those written for film professionals, which will contain technical terms not relevant to viewers."

Often, a second viewing will allow you to notice details you missed the first time around, and you may have a fresh perspective after discovering other viewer’s impressions of the film. Pay attention to things like how the movie begins and ends, and repeating images or concepts throughout the movie. [6] X Research source Since you already know how the movie ends, you will be able to pick up on foreshadowing and recurring themes more easily the second time around."

      "content": "Keep track of the films you enjoyed. When you first start out, it’s important to watch a wide variety of genres, time periods, and directors. Make note of which ones were your favorites and what you liked about them. Do you notice any common themes in the movies you enjoyed? It can be helpful to start a “viewing journal” where you write down your thoughts and impressions of each movie you see for future reference. Try to write it down as soon after viewing as possible - it’s easy to forget details once some time has passed, especially after watching other films."

The world of film is vast, and you’re never going to watch all of them - it helps to narrow your focus to something you’re particularly interested in. If you’ve noticed that you’re especially drawn to film noir, for example, do some research on the genre and which films are considered important to its development, and make a point of watching them. You may want to join an online community or local film club that focuses on the genre you choose. This can be a great way to have helpful discussions and get more film suggestions."

Find out who some notable film professionals are in that field and research their work Every time you watch a new movie, find out who is responsible for that element and look up what other work they’ve done. You may quickly find you have a favorite costume designer, makeup artist, etc., which can lead you to discover more films of your liking. If you want to be a screenwriter, read a lot of screenplays. You can find scripts of screenplays online in the BBC writer's room and simplyscripts.com. You can even google screenplay to find screenplays.
