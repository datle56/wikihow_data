      "title": "Get Hearthfire on your PS3/Xbox 360.",
      "content": "Get Hearthfire on your PS3/Xbox 360. If you plan on buying plots of land, get the Hearthfire DLC first. If you already have it, proceed to the next section. Depending on which platform you play Skyrim on, there are a few different ways of acquiring the DLC. If you have the Legendary edition of Skyrim, Hearthfire will be available for you to install on the Start screen. If you do not have the Legendary edition, you can purchase the Hearthfire DLC at online game stores. Prices will vary depending on the store, but it’s usually around $5. Once you have purchased the DLC, start up the game as you usually would. At the Start menu, select “Options” and then “Downloadable content.” Enter the digital code, and the DLC will begin to download. Once completed, the content will automatically be added to your game."

      "content": "Get Hearthfire for your PC. If you’re playing on the PC, you can either purchase the Legendary edition or buy the Hearthfire DLC on Steam. If you’re playing the Legendary edition, Hearthfire will be preinstalled onto the game, and you won’t have to do anything to add it."

      "title": "Consider Pale.",
      "content": "Consider Pale. Once Hearthfire has been successfully been installed and you’ve started the game, choose the first plot of land (there are 3) where you want to build. The first plot you can purchase is where you can build Heljarchen Hall, which is located in the Pale. This plot of land is nestled in the snowy mountainside of Skyrim and is the only area that allows you to build a balcony attached to your house. Although the scenery is beautiful, the occasional wolf may attack if you’re walking around outside."

    {
      "title": "Consider Falkreath Hold.",
      "content": "Consider Falkreath Hold. The second area is the base for Lakeview Manor, in Falkreath Hold. This plot of land overlooks a gorgeous lake and is surrounded by green pine trees and the mountainside. This is the only piece of property that allows you to build an apiary, allowing you to harvest your own honey. This plot of land is great if you prefer Skyrim’s forest to its snowy mountains; however, be careful when going into the lake, as you may be attacked by Slaughterfish."
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider Hjaalmarch.",
      "content": "Consider Hjaalmarch. The final location is the base for Windstad Manor, located in Hjaalmarch. This land is located to the north of Solitude, right in front of the ocean. It is unique in that it is the only piece of property where one can build your very own fish quarry. This plot of land offers a beautiful view of the ocean; however, it has little to offer in terms of actual land, as the rocks limit the amount of open grassland. Note that each piece of land costs 5,000 Gold, and the player can purchase all three if they so desire."
