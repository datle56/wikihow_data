      "content": "Find a licensed dealer that offers the type of gun you want. Retail firearms stores all have federal licenses, as do many other dealers who sell guns for a living, even if they don't have a brick-and-mortar shop. Search online to find the gun stores nearest you. [2] X Research source If you're looking for a particular specialty gun, you might want to call ahead and see if the store has it in stock before making the trip."

      "content": "Fill out a background check application when you pick out a gun. The background check application requires both you and the dealer to provide information. For your part, enter identification information that matches the information on the valid, government-issued photo ID you present to the dealer to buy your gun. [3] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms U.S. federal law enforcement agency dealing with crimes related to firearms and alcohol and tobacco products Go to source You'll also need to answer a series of questions about your criminal background. When you sign and date the application, you're certifying that you answered those questions honestly. Lying on the form is a felony under federal law. Although you can download the form online and print it out to look at it, you can't fill it out in advance. You'll need to fill it out and sign it in the dealer's presence."

      "content": "Get back the results from your background check. Usually, you'll get the results of your background check back instantly. In some situations, it might take longer. The dealer will tell you the results and whether you need to wait for a final decision. [4] X Research source The service is available by phone 17 hours a day, 7 days a week. There's also an electronic service that's available 24/7. If your background check comes back \"delayed,\" you'll typically find out the result within 3 business days. If it's denied, you can challenge it or file an appeal. Typically, the only reason it would be denied would be if you had been convicted of a felony. However, it's possible for a mistake to be made if your name and identification information are similar to someone else's. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Buy your gun and take it home.",
      "content": "Buy your gun and take it home. Under Missouri law, if you pass the background check, the licensed dealer has to sell the gun to you — they can't just suddenly change their mind and decide they don't want to sell you a gun because they don't like something you said or the shirt you're wearing. After paying for the gun, you're free to take it home with you. [6] X Research source There's no waiting period for buying any kind of firearm, which means you can take it home as soon as you complete the purchase. [7] X Research source You'll need your own car to take your gun home — you can't bring it on public transportation. However, there's no reason you couldn't have a friend or family member drive you, or even use a rideshare. [8] X Research source"

You can also search classified listings online or in your local newspaper to find people selling guns. Missouri doesn't have any laws regulating gun shows, so those are generally good places to find private sellers. [9] X Research source"

[10] X Research source Different private sellers may accept different methods of payment. It's a good idea to get a bill of sale to memorialize the transaction. Since Missouri doesn't require you to register the gun, that's the only way you can prove ownership. [11] X Research source"

[13] X Research source Missouri also doesn't require a separate permit to carry a concealed weapon, so you can generally store it anywhere in your car as long as you're 19 years old or older. If you're 18, you can buy the gun, but you would need to carry it in your car exposed. [14] X Research source Generally, it's a good idea to make sure your gun isn't loaded while you transport it."

If you are 19 (or 18 and in the military) and otherwise permitted to own a gun, you can carry that gun concealed. However, you might want a permit if you frequently travel to other states and want to carry your weapon concealed while there. Most states in the US recognize Missouri's concealed carry permit.

To get a concealed carry permit, you need to complete a course conducted by an instructor certified by the National Rifle Association (NRA) that is at least 1 hour long. You can take your course in person or online. Most gun stores have information about courses available in your area. You can also check at a local shooting range. [16] X Research source The course covers basic safety techniques and Missouri's laws relating to firearms. You also need to complete a live-fire test in person. If you don't complete the NRA course, you can take any other firearm safety course that's at least 8 hours in length."

Depending on the size of your county sheriff's office, you might need to make an appointment to come in and apply for your concealed carry permit. A deputy might also be able to tell you the days of the week or weeks of the month that tend to be busier than others so you can plan accordingly. You'll have to pay a $90 fee for your concealed carry permit, so ask the deputy what methods of payment they accept. Some sheriff's departments recommend that you call at least 3 months in advance due to high demand for appointments and limited hours. [17] X Research source"

It'll save you some time to print that form and fill it out in advance, but you can also get a copy at the sheriff's office and fill it out while you're there. The form requires you to provide similar information as you did when you completed the background check, if you bought your gun from a licensed dealer.
