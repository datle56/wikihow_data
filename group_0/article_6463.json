      "content": "Discover just how long you can last without laughing. First, put together a list of funny videos; then, gather your friends and play all the videos one after the other. This challenge is simple: the moment someone starts laughing, they’re out. Whoever lasts the longest without laughing wins the challenge. This challenge is popular with a lot of YouTubers—and, despite the name, always leads to a lot of laughs. [3] X Research source You can keep the game going with a points system instead. For example, you could create a system where players start with 5 points, and every laugh loses a point. Alternatively, you could do the challenge and have every laugh earn players a point, so the player with the least points at the end wins."
