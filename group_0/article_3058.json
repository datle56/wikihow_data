      "content": "Vote in every election. Every election gives you an opportunity to have a say in who represents you in government. Local elections are especially important because the decisions these representatives make often affect your life in a very direct way. [1] X Trustworthy Source Pew Research Center Nonpartisan thinktank conducting research and providing information on public opinion, demographic trends, and social trends Go to source Even in countries where voting is mandatory, people still consider it an important part of being a good citizen. [2] X Trustworthy Source Pew Research Center Nonpartisan thinktank conducting research and providing information on public opinion, demographic trends, and social trends Go to source Brown emphasizes that if you want to be a good citizen, you must \"actively engage in [your] community's political, social, and cultural spheres, participating in voting, public meetings, and local activities.\" Going to local political party or political interest group meetings can also help you keep up to date with local issues and candidates. During election season, consider volunteering at local elections, with a voting rights organization, or for a candidate for public office."

      "content": "Serve on jury duty when called. In countries such as the United States, jury duty is both a right and a responsibility. While it can be tempting to try to get out of jury duty, the majority of Americans believe that serving on a jury is part of what makes someone a good citizen. [3] X Trustworthy Source Pew Research Center Nonpartisan thinktank conducting research and providing information on public opinion, demographic trends, and social trends Go to source Keep in mind that getting called doesn't necessarily mean you'll get to sit on an actual jury. Attorneys and judges can excuse jurors for many different reasons depending on the type of case."

      "title": "Contact your representatives about issues that matter to you.",
      "content": "Contact your representatives about issues that matter to you. Even if you're too young to vote or you didn't vote for your current representatives, they still represent you. If you don't tell them how you feel about an issue, they won't know! There's no guarantee that you'll be able to change their opinion in any way, but they might be persuaded to vote the way you want if enough of their constituents share your position. [4] X Research source Check your official government site to find out who your representatives are and how you can contact them. Contacting your representatives about issues is most effective if you have a lot of other people doing it with you. Elected officials' offices typically keep track of the number of calls or letters they get on either side of an issue. If a representative's constituency overwhelmingly wanted them to vote \"no\" on a proposal, a \"yes\" vote from them could mean the end of their political career. For this reason, they do take public opinion into account."

      "content": "Protest to make your voice heard. The right to protest is included among free speech rights in many countries. When you exercise your right to disagree with your government and protest its actions, you're holding it accountable to its citizens, which is at the heart of being a good citizen. [5] X Research source Remember that your representatives represent you. If they're doing things that aren't in line with what you want, you have the right to let them know."

      "title": "Follow all laws and regulations that apply to you.",
      "content": "Follow all laws and regulations that apply to you. Most people agree that \"law-abiding\" is synonymous with being a good citizen. Generally, this also means that you're not looking for ways to cut corners or get away with breaking laws that get in the way of you doing whatever you want to do. [6] X Trustworthy Source Pew Research Center Nonpartisan thinktank conducting research and providing information on public opinion, demographic trends, and social trends Go to source Following the law includes tax laws, with 71% of Americans agreeing that paying all the taxes you owe is very important to being a good citizen. Brown notes that good citizens \"respect their country's laws and regulations, as well as the rights of others.\" A good citizen also doesn't discriminate against others on the basis of something that person has no control over, such as their race, gender, or disability."

      "content": "Stand up to injustice when you see it. Being a good citizen is about more than just not discriminating against people yourself—it's about saying something when you see other people bullying or discriminating against others. It takes a lot of courage to speak out when you see something unjust happening, but it shows that you care about all of the people in your community. [7] X Research source This doesn't mean you should put your own safety at risk—that's definitely not required just to be a good citizen. If you're worried about something happening to you if your identity is known, look for ways you can report injustice to the proper authorities anonymously."

If you accidentally damage anything, you let the owner know right away and do what you can to make things right. [8] X Research source This includes carrying the appropriate insurance so that you can cover any damages you accidentally cause, or for injuries that occur on your property."

      "content": "Participate in fundraising events and activities. Nonprofit organizations often have events and activities, such as walks or races, to raise money for their causes. Getting involved in these things can help you make connections with like-minded folks and strengthen your ties to your community.

Not only does wasting these resources cost you or your family more money but also potentially damages the environment. Do your part by not leaving the water running and turning off lights when you leave a room. [11] X Research source If you're able to do so, check out alternative energy sources, such as wind and solar, and see if they could work for you to help you reduce your impact on the environment.
