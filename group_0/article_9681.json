      "content": "Locate the repeating decimal. For instance, the number 0.4444 has a repeating decimal of 4 . It is a basic repeating decimal in the sense that there's no non-repeating portion to the decimal number. Count how many repeating digits there are in the pattern. Once your equation is written, you will multiply it by 10^y , where y equals the number of repeating digits in the pattern. [2] X Research source In the example of 0.4444, there is one digit that repeats, so you will multiply the equation by 10^1. For a repeating decimal of 0.4545 , there are two digits that repeat, and you would, therefore, multiply your equation by 10^2. For three repeating digits, multiply by 10^3, etc."

      "content": "Rewrite the decimal as an equation. Write it out so that x equals the original number. [3] X Research source In this instance, the equation is x = 0.4444 . Since there’s only one digit in the repeating decimal, multiply the equation by 10^1 (which equals 10). [4] X Research source In the example where x = 0.4444 , then 10x = 4.4444 . With the example x = 0.4545 , there are two repeating digits, so you multiply both sides of the equation by 10^2 (which equals 100), giving you 100x = 45.4545 ."

      "title": "Remove the repeating decimal.",
      "content": "Remove the repeating decimal. You accomplish this by subtracting x from 10x. Remember that whatever you do to one side of the equation must be done to the other, so: [5] X Research source 10x – 1x = 4.4444 – 0.4444 On the left side, you have10x - 1x = 9x. On the right side, you have 4.4444 – 0.4444 = 4 Therefore, 9x = 4"

      "title": "Solve for x.",
      "content": "Solve for x. Once you know what 9x equals, you can determine what x equals by dividing both sides of the equation by 9: On the left side of the equation you have 9x ÷ 9 = x . On the right side of the equation you have 4/9 Therefore, x = 4/9 , and the repeating decimal 0.4444 can be written as the fraction 4/9 ."

[7] X Research source For example, take the number 6.215151 . Here, 6.2 is non-repeating, and the repeating digits are 15 . Again take note of how many repeating digits there are in the pattern, because you will multiply by 10^y based on that number. In this example, there are two repeating digits, so you will multiply your equation by 10^2."

To remove the repeating decimals, subtract from both sides of the equation: [8] X Research source 100x – x (= 99x) = 621.5151 - 6.215151 (= 615.3) Therefore, 99x = 615.3"

Do this by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 10^z , where z equals the number of decimal places you must move to eliminate the decimal. [9] X Research source In 615.3, you have to move the decimal by one place, meaning you multiply the numerator and denominator by 10^1: 615.3 x 10 / 99 x 10 = 6153/990 Reduce the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by the highest common factor, which in this case is 3, giving you x = 2,051/ 330 [10] X Research source"
