      "content": "Food, colors, clothing—it's all up for grabs. It's hard to go wrong with an open-ended, \"What's your favorite __?\" type of question. The broader the question is, the more freedom you give your child or student to respond in their own way. Try asking questions like: What’s your favorite sport and why? What’s your favorite tweet of all time? Who’s your favorite grandparent? What’s your favorite horror movie? What’s your favorite sitcom? Who’s your favorite actor? What’s your favorite song? What’s your favorite book? What’s your favorite type of food? What's your favorite restaurant? What's your favorite ice cream flavor? What’s your favorite clothing brand? What’s your favorite memory? What’s your favorite vacation you’ve ever been on? What's been your favorite year of life so far?"

Differences in age and life experience present a unique challenge when you're chatting with your child or student. Thankfully, it's easy enough to bridge this gap—as long as you're asking the right questions. Stick with relatable queries that really cater to their current life and past experiences, like: Who’s the best rapper of this generation? What’s the first thing on your bucket list? Who’s the most annoying person in your class? What’s the worst thing about school? Who’s your best friend? If you could be BFFs with any celebrity, who would you pick? How do you get your eyeliner wings so sharp?"

      "content": "Deep, mature questions can lead to deep, mature conversations. From politics to philosophy, there's no shortage of deep, thought-provoking topics that teens can share their thoughts on. If you feel comfortable doing so, toss out a few questions like: If you could change anything about society, what would it be? Do you think it’s easier to be happy if you’re rich? Do you believe in capital punishment? Do you think it's better to be feared or loved? What crimes do you think should be legal?"

What’s one thing you would change about yourself? What causes you to procrastinate the most? Name one thing that never fails to make you laugh. Name one thing that never fails to make you cry. What’s a body part you could do without? What are your biggest pet peeves?"

Who’s one person you hope to inspire? Predict one thing you think will happen in the next five years. If you had the option, would you want to see the future?
