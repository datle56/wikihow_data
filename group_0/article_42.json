The 16 guard buzz cut is one of the trendiest men’s styles blowing up on TikTok, and it looks similar to a textured fringe . While it’s longer than most other buzz cuts, a 16 guard buzz cut is a super versatile style that’s low maintenance and looks great with straight, wavy, or curly hair. 16 guard buzz cuts work well for most face shapes, but avoid this style if you have a tall forehead because it may look more prominent.

Many clippers only come with guards going up to number 8, or 1 in (2.5 cm), but there are many universal longer guards you can get separately."
