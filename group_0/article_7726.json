      "content": "Use a soft cloth or brush to wipe away surface dirt after each wear. Simply wipe the cloth or brush over the exterior of the shoe to remove any visible dirt, dust, and debris. [1] X Research source Any clean, lint-free cloth works for this (such as a strip from an old T-shirt), but you can also purchase a microfiber cloth if you prefer. A soft-bristled horsehair brush works as well. The more often you do this basic surface cleaning — e.g., every time you take the shoes off — the fresher your shoes will look, and the easier it will be to do your periodic deep cleanings later.

      "content": "Start by brushing or wiping away surface dirt and removing the laces. Use the horsehair brush that comes with many shoe cleaning kits , or a piece of clean, lint-free cloth to wipe off any surface dirt on your shoes, like you would on a daily basis after wearing them. You’ll also want to remove the shoelaces before moving on to the rest of the process. [3] X Research source Simmons explains that it’s important to start by removing dirt from your shoes, so that you have a clean surface to apply your polishing products on. “You don’t want to be polishing over dirt, just as you wouldn’t wax a car before cleaning it,” Simmons says."

      "content": "Use a clean cloth and a gentle soap to rub away dirt, scuffs, and stains. Lightly moisten your cloth with a small amount of either saddle soap or leather cleaner , and gently work it into the entire surface of your leather shoes. If you don’t have either of these products, Simmons explains that some baby shampoo and a little bit of water works in a pinch."

      "content": "Condition the leather after letting the shoes dry. Wipe away any leftover soap or suds with a damp cloth or paper towel, then give the shoes a bit of time to dry fully. Once they’re dry, apply your chosen leather conditioning product to make the leather more soft and supple. [4] X Research source You can use a specifically formulated leather conditioner , a bit more saddle soap, or an oil renovator like mink oil , all of which can be found alongside other shoe repair products. Follow the product instructions for application, but remember that a little goes a long way, no matter what you’re using."

      "content": "Apply a cream or wax polish (or both). You can use either a cream polish or wax polish on their own, or you can start with a layer of cream followed by a layer of wax. Simply apply a small amount of polish to the brush that comes with a shoe cleaning kit, a clean cloth, or a strip of old T-shirt fabric. Next, work the product into your shoe with circular motions. [5] X Research source Don’t overdo it with your polish product—you only need a small amount. “A big mistake people make is that they put a thick coat of wax or cream polish on,” says Simmons. “You want to put a paper thin coat of polish on the leather.” She recommends thinking of it like applying moisturizer to your face. “You wouldn’t put globs of face cream on–it’s just going to sit on the surface. So you want a thin coat on there, then set them aside and let that polish dry.” After you’ve applied a coat of polish, buff the shoes using a clean cloth and the same circular motion. Buffing evens out the polish, helps work it into the leather, and removes excess."

      "content": "Add a “spit-shine,” if desired. If your goal is a mirror-like sheen on your shoes, polish and buff them at least twice, but make sure to let the shoes dry for a while between rounds. After the second layer of polish dries a little, sprinkle a few drops of water on them and buff them with the cloth you used to apply the polish. Keep repeating this process (with brief drying intervals) to further enhance the shine. If possible, let the shoes dry overnight, then give them one final buff with a dry cloth in the morning. And that’s it! Your shoes should now be clean, polished, and shining."

      "content": "To clean suede shoes, you’ll need a few special tools and techniques. “If you’ve got suede, get yourself a suede brush . You can pick one up at a department store or drugstore,” says Simmons. Run the brush over the shoe in a consistent direction— that is, don’t rub back-and-forth, or in circles—to remove general dirt and debris. If your shoes need a deeper clean, Simmons recommends applying some suede cleaner with your suede cleaning brush. For scuff marks, you can brush more vigorously and back-and-forth with the brush, then end by brushing gently in one direction. Rubbing a suede eraser or even a regular pencil eraser on a stubborn scuff mark can also help. Apply a spray-on suede protector after cleaning and on a regular schedule, as per the product directions."

      "content": "Untreated leather has a different cleaning process from treated leather. Most leather dress shoes are made of treated leather, but you may have a nice pair of untreated leather shoes or boots that need cleaning. Check the tag on the shoes to determine if the leather is treated or untreated, and if it’s untreated, follow these steps to clean them:. Start by using a soft brush or cloth to gently wipe away dirt and debris, like you would for treated leather shoes. Next, moisten a clean cloth and rub a small amount of saddle soap onto it. Gently rub the soap onto the shoes, then wipe away the lather with a clean cloth. Let the shoes dry thoroughly. Apply a small amount of mink oil to your shoes using a clean cloth to protect the untreated leather. Finish by buffing the shoes with another clean cloth. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Satin shoes require careful, delicate cleaning. Satin shoes are a common accompaniment to women’s formal wear (like a prom or wedding dress), since they can be dyed to match the dress color. A deep cleaning isn’t really possible with these delicate shoes, but you can remove minor debris and scuffing. Wipe the shoes with a dry cloth. Lightly moisten a clean cloth with cold water, and blot away any stains. If this isn’t enough to remove stains, apply a small amount of hand soap to your cloth and rub it to create a lather, then dab the stain with the soapy cloth. Immediately rinse out the soap by patting the area with another clean cloth, dampened with cold water. Use a hand towel to dab the shoes and soak up as much excess water as possible, but don’t rub—this can cause water streaks. Don’t simply allow the shoes to air-dry either, as this can leave watermarks. [7] X Research source"

If you might need to wear your leather or suede dress shoes out in rainy or snowy weather, it’s a good idea to purchase a waterproofing spray . These products can help prevent damage and stains that may come from the material being exposed to water. [8] X Research source Different waterproofing sprays may require different application processes, so be sure to follow the instructions listed on the product you purchase."

      "content": "Use a shoehorn when you’re putting on your shoes. A shoe horn helps your foot slide into the back of your leather dress shoe without creasing the back of the shoe or damaging the “heel counter,” the firm structured portion that helps give the back of your shoe its shape. To use a shoe horn, simply grasp it by its handle and place the flat, spoon-like side into the heel of your shoe, then slide your foot in. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Store your dress shoes correctly to keep them looking brand-new. Insert a cedarwood shoe tree into your leather dress shoes when you aren’t wearing them. The cedarwood draws out moisture from the shoes and reduces odors, and the shoe tree itself helps maintain the shape of your shoe. If it’s going to be a long time before you wear your dress shoes again, you can even store them in a box with a lid or a cloth shoe storage bag , to protect them from dust and debris.

      "content": "How do you dry leather dress shoes when they get wet? “If the leather shoes get wet, quickly use a dry towel to wipe away any water remaining on the outside of the shoes,” explains Jongsae Kim. To draw moisture out from the inside of the shoes, he recommends stuffing the towel inside the shoe and then allowing them to dry slowly at room temperature. You may have heard that stuffing newspaper inside your dress shoes also works for this purpose, but Jongsae Kim actually cautions against this. “I don’t recommend using newspaper since the ink can stain the leather,” he says. To be safe, stick with a clean towel or cloth, or even paper towels."

      "content": "How do you remove salt stains from leather dress shoes? “When you get salt stains, don’t use water. Water is not good for the leather,” explains Simmons. “Use a bit of white vinegar or even a bit of spit on a cloth, and just wipe off that salt.” She mentions that you can also buy salt stain remover at the store if you prefer, but white vinegar or spit work just as well if you want to save your money."

      "content": "How do you remove grease and oil stains from leather dress shoes? Jongsae Kim recommends covering the oil stain with cornstarch or baby powder, then leaving it to soak up the oil for a few hours. Afterwards, he says to “wipe it off with a shoe brush and wet rag to remove the excess.”"

      "content": "How often should you clean and polish leather dress shoes? To protect your shoes and keep them looking fresh, try to make it a habit to brush off surface dirt and debris with a brush or cloth after each wear. Most people only need to polish leather shoes every 4-6 weeks, but this depends on how often you wear them. [11] X Research source For deep cleaning with saddle soap, once per year is usually sufficient."
