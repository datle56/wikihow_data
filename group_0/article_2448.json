      "title": "Choose a dance style to focus on.",
      "content": "Choose a dance style to focus on. Keep in mind that ballroom dancing is an incredibly broad genre of dance, and it doesn’t refer to a single style. Some popular types of ballroom dance include the Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot, Cha Cha, East Coast Swing, Mambo, Samba, and Bolero. Opt for a dance like the Waltz or Foxtrot if you’d prefer a smoother dance style, or learn something like the Cha Cha or Rumba if you’d like to focus on something more rhythmic. There are a lot of different variations in ballroom dancing, with the most obvious being the American versus International style of dance. There are also multiple versions of certain dances, like the Waltz and Viennese Waltz, along with the East Coast Swing and West Coast Swing."

      "content": "Stretch and warm-up your body before you start dancing. Get ready to dance by moving in place for 1-5 minutes, which helps get your pulse up slightly. Focus on stretching your ankles, hips, and arms before you start dancing with your partner. This will help you feel stretched and ready to start your dance practice! For instance, you can spin both of your ankles in circles for 10 reps so your feet are stretched and ready to go. You can also lay on your back and perform 5-8 reps of arms circles."
