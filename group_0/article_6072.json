      "content": "Make sure you have the necessary materials. Before flushing your PICC line, make sure that you have all of the required materials as established by your physician. You will need a syringe (available in medical supply stores and most pharmacies), alcohol wipes (or rubbing alcohol and cotton balls), and a flushing solution. The flushing solution is usually a saline solution, which is sent through the PICC line to clean it out. Follow your physician’s direct instructions for how to make or purchase a sterile saline solution. You might also have to flush your PICC line with a solution containing heparin, a blood thinner that prevents blood from clotting around your catheter. PICC lines must be flushed before AND after medications and fluids are administered, after drawing blood, as well as once in the morning and once at night when not in use. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Do not submerge your PICC line in water. While showers and short baths (with your PICC line connections remaining outside of the water) are acceptable, your PICC line should not be fully submerged in water for any reason. Avoid swimming, hot tubs, or other activities that would leave your body completely under water for an extended period of time. Even waterproof coverings can be penetrated by water if you soak in a tub or pool, which may lead to an infection."

A playful animal may be tempted to pull or bite the line, resulting in damage or removal of the tube. [9] X Research source Keep your PICC line fully covered when coming in contact with animals by wearing a thick, long-sleeved sweater or jacket, and avoid intense playing or cuddling with your pet that may disrupt it. Keep your pet occupied with puzzle toys, or visits from friends, relatives, or other animals, while you have a PICC line installed."

      "content": "Keep track of the length of your PICC line. It is important to keep track of the length of your PICC line to ensure that it is still inserted properly. The PICC line tube is approximately 24 inches (approximately 61 cm) long, stretching up the length of your arm to the large vein above your heart. [10] X Research source Note if the line seems to hang differently on your arm, or simply measure the line every day or two to ensure that it is properly in place. Never re-advance the catheter into the insertion site. If it appears to have moved or pulled out from the site, notify your doctor's office immediately. If your PICC line accidentally comes out, place a sterile gauze pad on the site and press firmly until bleeding stops, then apply a bandage firmly. Save the PICC line and call your doctor or home care nurse."
