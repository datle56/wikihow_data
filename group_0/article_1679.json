      "title": "Aquarians and Scorpios make great pals—as long as they are patient.",
      "content": "Aquarians and Scorpios make great pals—as long as they are patient. While these two fixed signs share loyalty, devotion, independence, and drive, they see the world very differently. Scorpios are passionate, intense, and sometimes possessive, while Aquarians tend to be more emotionally detached, intellectual, and casual. These opposing traits may cause some conflict, but as long as both signs are aware and respectful of their differences, they can maintain a thriving friendship. Scorpios are water signs, making them particularly in touch with emotions. Though Aquarius’s symbol is the water-bearer, they are actually air signs! Because of this, they tend to be more invested in ideas than people. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Scorpio and Aquarius are both self-sufficient intellectuals.",
      "content": "Scorpio and Aquarius are both self-sufficient intellectuals. These are very driven and intelligent signs, and they're very passionate about their specific interests and opinions. In a friendship, these two signs will cheer each other on, glad to have met someone sharp enough to keep up. They might even enjoy a bit of friendly competition. As fixed signs, they can both be rather opinionated, which makes for lively debates (which they'll both absolutely love to participate in). There is a chance for overly-possessive Scorpio to get a little jealous if Aquarius gets too distant, but in general, Scorpio appreciates solitude and independence as much as Aquarius does."

      "title": "Scorpio and Aquarius love to connect with people.",
      "content": "Scorpio and Aquarius love to connect with people. Though they are both loners, they appreciate a good hang—for totally different reasons. Emotional water-sign Scorpio might be naturally withdrawn, but they can't resist trying to understand what makes other people tick, what they are feeling, and what their passions are. [2] X Research source Intellectual air-sign Aquarius, meanwhile, wants to get involved in deep conversations about serious ideas. These two will be able to bond over their shared love of connection and communication, which will help them build a strong friendship. Because they are both highly independent, they can agree on when to leave a party—after they’ve socialized a decent amount, they’ll both need plenty of alone time."

      "title": "These signs are capable of intense loyalty, but it takes time.",
      "content": "These signs are capable of intense loyalty, but it takes time. Furtive Scorpios are naturally a little mistrustful of other people, and offbeat Aquarians simply don’t believe anyone will ever understand them, so they tend to keep a distance from others. Because of this, these signs might not form a strong connection overnight. But when they do bond, their devotion is diehard. [3] X Research source Scorpio should practice giving their Aquarius bud the benefit of the doubt, and over time, Aquarius can prove to them that they're trustworthy. Aquarius will need to treat their Scorpio pal with an open mind: they may be surprised by Scorpio’s ability to really see them. Scorpio may take a while to share their secrets, but when they feel safe to do so, Aquarius will know all. This suits Aquarius, who is turned off by people who open up too quickly. Reader Poll: We asked 704 wikiHow readers who are Scorpios what type of relationship they look for, and 65% of them said one that’s committed, serious, and long-term. [Take Poll] That holds true for their friendships, too."

      "title": "They may struggle to relate to one another sometimes.",
      "content": "They may struggle to relate to one another sometimes. Aquarians tend to focus on ideas, while Scorpios gravitate toward people. They may sometimes find it difficult to connect over their different hobbies and interests, but there is certainly room for mutual appreciation for one another’s passions. Aquarians, ruled by Uranus and Saturn, tend to obsess over one or a couple of off-the-wall ideas or subjects for long periods of time—perhaps even for life. [4] X Research source Scorpios, on the other hand, are known to shift focus fairly often, becoming obsessed with one thing this week, then another next week."

      "title": "Because they are each so withdrawn, forming a strong connection might be tough.",
      "content": "Because they are each so withdrawn, forming a strong connection might be tough. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but if they want to develop a strong friendship, they will have to work on overcoming their individual struggles to open up. However, even if their friendship becomes one where they only see one another a few times a year, this doesn’t mean the relationship is a bad one: they are able to easily pick up where they left off the last time they connected."

    {
      "title": "They have the potential to become codependent.",
      "content": "They have the potential to become codependent. Aquarius’s lack of emotional availability and Scorpio’s tendency toward possessiveness and emotional intensity can easily make this friendship a codependent one, with each sign’s, let’s just say, “not super flattering traits” becoming exacerbated by the other’s. Scorpio will have to tame their jealousy, and Aquarius will have to open up emotionally. Scorpio, being ruled by Mars and Pluto, can be a little insecure and even aggressive, which may turn Aquarius off. If Scorpio can overcome their trust issues and practice not becoming insecure when Aquarius seems cold or distant, and if Aquarius can learn to connect emotionally instead of just intellectually, these signs will maintain a beautiful friendship."

      "title": "An Aquarius-Scorpio romance will be full of fire—and at times, frustration.",
      "content": "An Aquarius-Scorpio romance will be full of fire—and at times, frustration. The heated debates that result from their natural passion and obstinacy make for great sexual chemistry, but those debates have potential to turn into arguments, causing the passion to suffer. Their clashing personalities might make a relationship tricky, though by no means impossible. The two signs find it hard to resist a challenge, and though they have lots in common, dating each other might be challenging at times."

      "title": "For the best shot at true love, they may want to be friends first.",
      "content": "For the best shot at true love, they may want to be friends first. An Aquarius would be hard-pressed to date someone they weren’t already friends with, a fact which is sure to test obsessive, passionate Scorpio’s patience. Scorpio may be careful and slow to trust, but they also act on emotions, meaning they fall hard and fast in romantic relationships. Aquarius, meanwhile, spends time thinking rationally before jumping into a new situation, meaning they will want to connect first as friends before becoming a Scorpio’s lover."

    {
      "title": "Aquarians may be too casual for a romance with a Scorpio.",
      "content": "Aquarians may be too casual for a romance with a Scorpio. Aquarians’ natural emotional distance makes them a great friend with benefits, but a no-strings-attached relationship is unlikely to fly for all-or-nothing Scorpio. If Aquarius is able to commit to their Scorpio, they could make a relationship work, but Scorpio may find it difficult not to become attached during a casual fling. Even in a committed relationship, Aquarius is likely to feel constrained by Scorpio’s intensity, and Scorpio may become frustrated by Aquarius's distance."
