      "content": "Take the boots outside and knock them together to remove excess dirt. Hold the top of 1 boot in each hand. Knock the boots together several times so that the heels collide. Any large pieces of debris or mud will fall to the ground. [1] X Research source It’s essential to do this outside to avoid making a large mess inside your home. This will save you a lot of time during the cleaning process because there will be less mud to remove."

      "content": "Spray the boots with the dish soap mixture and let it sit for 3 minutes. Place the boots into either a utility sink or a large plastic container. Spray the full exterior of the boots, including the soles. Be careful not to spray the mixture inside the boots. [3] X Research source If you clean your boots in a plastic container, you can simply pour the mud and water outside when you are done."

[4] X Research source Rinse out the cloth with water if it gets too dirty. If your boots have zippers, use the rag to gently brush down the zippers. This will remove any stuck dirt."

      "content": "Scrub the soles of the boots with a scrubbing brush if necessary. If there is still dirt left on the soles of the boots, add more water and scrub it away using a brush. In most cases, however, using a rag with warm soapy water will be enough to clean the soles. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Wipe the boots with a clean rag and then let them air-dry. Take a clean rag and gently wipe the soapy water off the boots. Then place the boots upright in the shade to finish drying. [6] X Research source You cannot dry Hunter boots in a dryer. Avoid drying or storing your Hunter boots directly in the sun.

      "title": "Wear socks with your boots at all times.",

      "title": "Stuff your boots with newspaper if they get wet on the inside.",
      "content": "Stuff your boots with newspaper if they get wet on the inside. Bundle up newspaper sheets and tightly stuff them inside each boot. Remove the newspaper after a few hours and let the boots air dry for 24-48 hours. [9] X Research source The newspaper will soak up the excess water. This will prevent mold from growing inside the boots. Alternatively, you can use moisture absorbing packets such as silica packets or cedar balls to soak up the excess water. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Use diluted vinegar to remove unpleasant odors from your boots.",
      "content": "Use diluted vinegar to remove unpleasant odors from your boots. Mix together a solution of vinegar and water in a spray bottle, with equal parts of each. Mist the full interior of the boot lightly, right down to the toe and then gently mop up any excess liquid using a paper towel. Once you have removed as much liquid as possible, leave the boots in a cool place for 24-48 hours to fully dry. Don’t worry about the strong smell of the vinegar. The smell of vinegar disappears once it dries. If you can still smell a bad odor after cleaning the boots with vinegar, repeat the process of misting the interior and drying the boots again. This should fully clear away the smell."

      "title": "Place baking soda into each boot to absorb moisture and odors.",
      "content": "Place baking soda into each boot to absorb moisture and odors. Sprinkle 2-3 teaspoons (14-21 grams) of baking soda into each boot. Make sure that is spread out from the heel to the toe. Leave it there overnight and simply shake your boots out upside down in the morning to remove any excess powder. You can use baking soda in your Hunter boots as regularly as necessary. You will probably need to use it more often if you wear your boots during warmer, summer months."

      "content": "Use the official care kit for the best chance at removing the rubber bloom. The company that sells Hunter boots also sell many care supplies that are specially designed to remove the white, powdery film that happens from time to time. Spray your boots with the rubber buff product and use a cleaning cloth to rub it into the exterior of the each boot. Once your boots have dried, apply the boot shine product using a circular motion to make your boots look new and shiny. [11] X Research source Rubber bloom is a completely normal process that happens with Hunter boots and it doesn’t mean that your boots are damaged. It occurs when insoluble particles from high quality rubber rise to the surface of the material. Only the appearance of the boots is affected."

      "content": "Use 1 tsp (4.9 ml) of olive oil for an easy home remedy. Pour the olive oil onto a clean rag. Rub the olive oil all over your boots, excluding the soles as this would make them slippery. The boots will absorb the oil, so they won’t feel greasy to touch once they have dried. [13] X Research source Although using olive oil has mixed results for removing rubber bloom from Hunter boots, this solution is worth a try if you don’t want to spend money on the official care products.
