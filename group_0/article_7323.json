      "content": "Your Chiron sign refers to the placement of the minor planet Chiron. Just like your Sun and Moon signs are connected to the placement of the Sun and Moon, your Chiron sign relates to the location of Chiron, a minor planet, on your birth chart. This planet hangs out toward the edge of the solar system (in between Saturn and Uranus) and takes anywhere from 1-9 years to pass through each zodiac sign. So, it takes about 50 years for this planet to cycle back where it was when you were born.
