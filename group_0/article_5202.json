These foam layers may be made from memory foam, latex foam, polyfoam, or a combination of multiple of these foam types—each of which has a different density and level of support, cushioning, and durability. Foam mattresses essentially trap air inside them, which provides support to the user as they sleep. [22] X Research source Pros: Foam mattresses mold to your body, helping to keep your spine in alignment (especially if you’re prone to back pain). They also provide good motion isolation, making them ideal for couples who are sharing a mattress. Cons: Memory foam mattresses can retain heat, making them potentially uncomfortable for hot sleepers. They may also be heavy and difficult to move or trigger allergies in people with certain sensitivities.

      "content": "Innerspring As the most traditional mattress type, innerspring mattresses contain a network of interconnected coils that support the weight of a person's body. The coils sit underneath a top layer of softer padding that’s typically encased in fabric. This “comfort layer” provides a cushioned feel that contours the body without the “engulfing” sensation common in memory foam. [24] X Research source Pros: Innerspring mattresses are highly durable and supportive. The coils provide good airflow, meaning that these mattresses may be better for hot sleepers. Cons: Innerspring mattresses may not isolate motion as well as other types of mattresses, so it’s more likely to be woken up by the noise or feel of someone else moving in your bed.

      "title": "Firmness & Support",
      "content": "Firmness & Support Mattress manufacturers typically rate their products on a firmness scale from one to ten, where ten is the firmest, and one is the softest. The best firmness level for you largely depends on your sleep position and your own personal preferences. For instance, firmer mattresses are best for back sleepers so that their spine stays supported, while stomach sleepers usually prefer softer, cradling mattresses. [27] X Research source Even if you already think you know whether you prefer softer or firmer mattresses, keep an open mind when shopping for mattresses. There’s no rigid standardization for how manufacturers categorize their mattresses, so you might be surprised by which firmness labels you prefer when you actually try them out! If you’re shopping in person and looking at a specific brand, start by trying out the firmest model in the brand’s mattress line. Then, move up the scale of softer models until you reach your perfect firmness level."

    {
      "title": "Comfort",
      "content": "Comfort Another important factor when shopping for mattresses is whether you want the surface to envelop your body or hold you up and support you. If you want a mattress top to conform and contour around your body, you may prefer a memory foam or foam-forward hybrid mattress. If you’d prefer to feel held up by the top of the mattress, you may like an innerspring model. However, you can still get an innerspring with a pillow or Euro top that’ll still give you enough cushioning to feel comfortable. [28] X Research source You might also consider whether you like to have a bit of “bounce” in your mattress. Innerspring mattresses and spring-dominant hybrid models will give more bounce, while foam and latex mattresses have more of an elastic and springy feel. Your comfort at night isn’t just a luxury—it’s crucial to your overall health. According to Dr. Kayem, a board-certified otolaryngologist who specializes in sleep-related disorders, “quality sleep improves so many things, from your immune systems…to even preventing cancer cells from growing out of control.” Being comfortable and well-rested at night may also lead to “less irritability, better concentration, and a better mood,” continues Dr. Kayem."

      "content": "Temperature If you consider yourself a hot sleeper or often wake up to sheets drenched in sweat, you might want to avoid foam mattresses and opt for spring models. Foam mattresses tend to trap heat, while innerspring mattresses are generally more breathable and allow body heat to move throughout the coils and disperse out of the material. However, if you sleep hot but love the feel of foam, try a foam hybrid or an innerspring mattress paired with a foam topper . [29] X Research source You can also look for memory foam mattresses with special cooling features like air channels, gel systems, or copper and graphite infusions."

      "title": "Material & Construction",
      "content": "Material & Construction The material and construction of a mattress are doubly important because they serve two essential purposes—providing durability and function to the mattress. To check a mattress’ long-term construction and durability, lift and shift it around to see if it feels light and flimsy (bad sign) or sturdy and substantial (good sign!). Take a look at the stitching around the cover and ask a professional about the foam density—if you weigh more than 200 pounds (91 kg), you want a memory foam mattress to have at least 4 pounds (1.8 kg) density per cubic foot to ensure long-term durability. [30] X Research source On the other hand, a mattress’ material and construction matters because it affects its overall function, comfort, and support. For instance, traditional innerspring mattresses provide better motion isolation, pressure relief, and bodily support. Latex foam mattresses, meanwhile, are more bouncy, cooling, and eco-friendly. Ultimately, each consumer’s individual preferences may determine which mattress material works best for them."

      "title": "Sleep Position",
      "content": "Sleep Position Sleep position is one of the most important factors to consider when choosing a mattress type. Picking the right mattress for your typical sleeping position will help you sleep more comfortably and it will improve the overall health of the body. Your body and spine need to be supported as you sleep in order to avoid aches and pains, and each sleeping position may need different mattress firmnesses in order to stay supported. [31] X Research source If you have muscle or joint issues, you should also consider your pressure points—aka, the bony or heavier parts of your body (which vary based on your sleep position). If you’re a side sleeper with hip pain, for instance, you want a mattress that isn’t too firm in order to avoid putting excess pressure on your hip as you sleep. It’s important to remember that the mattress firmness or material that you think feels most comfortable to you isn’t necessarily what’s best for your body. If you’re a back sleeper, for instance, you might like the idea of a memory foam’s thick and plush feel—but you should really use a firm mattress to provide support to your back."

Most commonly, however, adjustable mattresses are preferred by couples with differing preferences. Sleep Number’s adjustable air beds , for example, allow couples to inflate their side of the mattress to their desired firmness.

Most manufacturers use this scale of 1-10 to rate and categorize the firmness levels of their mattress (aka, how much a sinking, contouring, or “pushed-back” experience one has when laying on the surface). However, there’s no precise methodology to what constitutes a 1-2 (extra soft) versus a 3 (soft), and some firmness categories overlap, so there’s some subjectivity in this scale.

This level of firmness is supportive enough to keep the spine aligned while still providing comfort to the lower back, hips, and shoulders in a supine position. A good way to test if a mattress works for you—if you’re a back sleeper—is to lay as you normally would then slide your hand under your lower back. If your hand fits snugly between the mattress and your back, you’ll have decent support. If it fits too tightly, then the mattress may be too soft, while a bigger gap suggests that it’s too firm.

A softer foam mattress would likely put too much strain on your lower back. If you’re unsure, ask someone to take a picture of you from the side while you lay on the mattress.

      "content": "Air out boxed mattresses and look for certified chemical-free models. Some mattresses—specifically those that come rolled up or wrapped in plastic—are notorious for having unpleasant odors (called volatile organic compounds or VOCs). Others have developed a reputation for allegedly containing flame retardants and other harmful chemicals. [51] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source If you’re concerned about the chemical safety or smell of your mattress, follow these tips to feel and sleep safer: Air out any boxed mattresses for a few days in a well-ventilated area. Keep your windows open and fans on as much as possible, and avoid the room (if possible) until the smell completely dissipates. Once there’s no scent, it’s safe to sleep on the mattress. [52] X Research source If you’re really worried about VOCs, choose conventional mattresses that are delivered flat by professional movers. These mattresses have likely already completed off-gassing in a factory, meaning that they won’t carry an odor or any chemical into your home. Look for foam mattresses that are CertiPUR-US–certified , meaning that they’re free of specific chemicals like PBDEs, TDCPP, and TCEP flame retardants. These mattresses are also less likely to release VOCs (in a process known as “off-gassing”). [53] X Research source Most manufacturers can meet federal flammability standards by using ticking, sock covers, or fiberglass. However, fiberglass may cause concerns of its own, since it can be harmful to your health if accidentally removed from the mattress cover. If you’re concerned about flame retardants in your mattress, opt for mattresses with rayon instead. [54] X Research source"

      "title": "When should I replace my mattress?",
      "content": "When should I replace my mattress? Depending on your mattress’ condition and upkeep, consider replacing it every 6-10 years. Some visual signs that your mattress might need replacing include lumps, dented areas, sagging areas, protruding springs, and squeaking springs. Other signs include waking up with tightness or soreness in certain areas of your body or newly developed allergies or asthma symptoms. [55] X Research source These physical aches and issues are the biggest signs that you should get a new mattress ASAP. “You want an ideal pain-free environment to facilitate sleep and not be bothered with awakenings from pain,” says Dr. Dimitriu. However, before running out to buy a new mattress, consider whether any other factors may be affecting the issues with your mattress. For example, neck pain might be improved by a new pillow, or an overly firm mattress might just need a cushier mattress topper."
