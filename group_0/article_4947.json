From each half, cut a shelf at 32 inches (81.3 cm) (should leave 64 inches for the sides). Cut the other full sheet in half length-wise also. Cut each half in thirds at 32 inches (81.3 cm) each. Cut the half-sheet of plywood at 32 inches (81.3 cm). Cut the 32x48 piece in half (24x32). Set the remaining 16x48 piece aside for later. You should have 2-24x64 and 10-24x32."

The slot method is stronger and will not interfere with the rolling cans.) [2] X Research source The shelves need to have a 1:12 slope (1 inch drop for each 12 inches run). For standard cans, the distance from the top of the input shelf to the top of the corresponding output shelf is 8 inches (20.3 cm). For standard cans, the distance from the top of the input shelf, to the top of the next output shelf is 4 inches (10.2 cm). For standard cans, the input shelf is 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) shorter than the output shelf. For larger cans, add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to these dimensions. Draw outlines for all slots."

Therefore, the width of the shelves is actually 31 inches (78.7 cm). Each input shelf also needs to be trimmed on the back to allow a space for the can to drop. For standard cans, this gap needs to be 3.5 inches (8.9 cm)."

Cut cardboard in a trapezoidal shape to fit over the two row dividers. Cut out the center material of the cardboard and glue the flaps to the row dividers."

A solution for this problem is to glue wedges at the back of the lower shelf. This will cause the can to roll forward before the next one locks it in. The wedges can be cut from the same material used for the row dividers. They should be large enough to move the can forward."
