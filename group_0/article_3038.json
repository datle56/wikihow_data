The decision to become a furry is completely up to you! Whether you’ve been interested in furry-related things for a while or you’re new to the community, feel free to proclaim yourself a furry whenever and however you’d like. [2] X Research source If you want to create your furry-related characters, meet other like-minded people, and/or visit furry conventions, you’ll probably love being a part of the furry community! But it’s also totally okay to be a part of the community without calling yourself a furry. If you don't have a strong interest in anthropomorphic animals but you still want to join the community, the people within it will likely welcome you with open arms. People aren’t automatically furries if they happen to like anthropomorphic animals; they get to choose for themselves."

There's a place for every interest in the furry fandom – artists, musicians, authors, dancers, comedians, actors, and many others celebrate their love of anthropomorphism through creative expression. Don’t be afraid to share your work! Other furries will be very welcoming and supportive of however you combine your furry identity with your other interests.

Open for requests if you want other furries to ask you for free artwork. Open for trades if you’re open to swapping 1 free artwork for another. If you want to sell your work, open for commissions. Set up an info page outlining your terms, prices, and policies so others know what to expect. Specify the type and style of work you’d like to create, then spread the word across the online furry community. Other furries might send you an image or written description of their fursona for you to draw, or they might give you a premise for a story to write. Once you develop your skills and reputation, you can potentially make a good income by selling your work within the furry community. If you accept a commission, you’re obliged to complete it. By accepting payment and not finishing a project, you can get into legal trouble."

While you’re there, check out the artwork, tails, accessories, badges, fursuits, and other furry merchandise. Don’t miss the fursuit parade! Even if you don't have a suit, you can still have a blast watching all the incredible fursuits march by. Many furries opt to meet up at conventions since they’re safe, public spaces, and you’ll be free to fully express yourself and your fursona. If you’re going to be at the same event as your online furry friends, set up a time to meet up during the event! Special events differ from convention to convention, but you might be able to catch a great concert, fursuit dance competition, or discussion panel featuring your favorite animator.

There are a lot of myths and rumors about the furry community circulating through the media that you’ll need to debunk for yourself and others in your life. Most importantly, know that you don’t have to own or wear a fursuit to be a furry. You can participate no matter what you wear. Additionally, know that only a small percentage of furries focus on the erotic aspect of the fandom; you don’t have to do anything like this to participate in the community. As with many other dress-oriented fandoms, like cosplayers and sports fans, most furries simply enjoy expressing themselves, performing in a costume, and connecting with other fans on a social level. [10] X Research source The majority of furries don’t believe they’re animals. Some might wish for animal traits or enjoy exploring them, but most furries are just expressing their fandom of anthropomorphic animals. While it’s not what defines the furry fandom, be aware that you’ll probably encounter some erotic fan art and other content of a sexual nature. If you’re not comfortable with that, try updating your search settings on different sites and web browsers. Sticking with PG-rated furry content only is entirely acceptable!"

But the possibilities are endless; you’re free to choose any species you desire, create a hybrid, or develop a completely made-up creature. [12] X Research source For example, you might start with the huge ears and cute face of a fennec fox and give its body bird-like legs and wings. Do some research into animal photographs or illustrations to see how each animal’s anatomy works. Then adapt it so your fursona can stand up on 2 legs.

Sometimes, certain patterns are overused or taken too easily, but some are too complicated. If you wish to buy a fursuit and make a very colorful fursona with many designs, it might be more expensive and the quality will go down. [13] X Research source Consider incorporating spots, stripes, splotchy markings, facial details, scales, feathers, and other patterns and textures into your design. Refer to animal photos as inspiration for markings and coloration patterns if you want a more realistic effect. If you’re not sure where to start, check out other furries’ fursonas online.

Create a list of personality traits as well as likes and dislikes, and other fun facts about your fursona’s identity. Give them a unique name, too. The level of similarity between you and your fursona is entirely a matter of personal preference. Try using your fursona to show off your idealized self or explore an alter ego. Don’t be afraid to modify your fursona over time until it’s just right. [14] X Research source If you like writing, try writing out your fursona’s backstory or creating a narrative about them.

Use pencils and coloring tools or a digital design program to sketch out the general shape and physical characteristics of your fursona. Then add in the colorings, markings, and other details. Give them an expressive face that shows off something about their personality. For example, if your fursona is bright and peppy, give them a wide-eyed appearance. Try to sketch out as many details as you can imagine, even if you don’t plan to buy a full-body fursuit. Feel free to add your fursona’s name and a list of traits and qualities in your illustration, too. Look up \"free [animal] base\" or \"free [animal] line art\" on DeviantArt or FurAffinity for some templates to get you started if you’re basing your fursona on a widely-used animal species. If you’ve used a free template, remember to credit the artist who created it when you share or post the image. Even if you don’t like drawing and would prefer to commission artwork, try making a rough sketch so you can more easily convey your ideas to the artist.

[17] X Research source If you want to get a fursuit made, make sure that your fursona has at least a 3-view reference sheet, either drawn by you, colored on a base, or commissioned by a reference sheet artist. A 3-view reference sheet should show a front, back, and side profile view of your fursona. If you like creating artwork, have fun exploring different ways to use your fursona.

Fursuits are a big investment and a luxury item, so you’ll need to save upwards of $1,000 US – or at least $2,000 if you’re in the market for a full-body suit. If you want to buy one, research how you’d get it made and then make a savings plan so you will have enough money to cover the costs. Fursuits are completely optional. You don’t need one at all to be a furry, and the furry community won't look down on you if you don't have a fursuit. It’s best to wait until both you and your fursona have stopped growing and changing. You wouldn’t want to grow out of such an expensive costume! In the meantime, save your pennies.

Wear these pieces with clothes to make it look like your fursona is the one wearing the outfit. Opt for a plantigrade fursuit if you want something that covers your whole body and shows off all of the markings and physical characteristics of your fursona. Consider a digitigrade fursuit if you want to take the full-body suit a step further. These suits have animal-like feet and extra padding on the legs to make them appear more like an animal’s back legs. If you overheat easily, try a partial suit rather than a full-coverage suit. When done well, plantigrade and digitigrade suits can make the character come to life, but partial suits can be just as fun to wear and see. Consider trying on another furry's fursuit, as long as it’s clean, before you invest in your own."

Make sure the maker is open for commissions, then follow their instructions on their website to commission them. The process differs, but you'll usually have to submit your fursona reference sheet and other details through a form on their website. Fursuit makers may only be available to work on a handful of projects each year. Don’t be upset if a maker doesn’t accept your proposal. Find a few other makers in case your first choice isn’t possible. You can have more than 1 maker create different parts of your fursuit, if you’d like. [20] X Research source The turnaround time for a fursuit can be a few months, so don't expect your fursuit to be shipped to you within a few days of ordering it. Carefully review the makers’ rates and terms of service. Many fursuit makers don’t accept people under the age of 18, and most require a 30% down payment upfront."

Remember that you’ll be performing the whole time you’re in your fursuit. Watch videos and attend panels to learn the basics of how to act in a fursuit. Try your best to maintain a character that matches your fursuit. Does your fursuit have a grumpy expression? Stomping around and looking comically irritable could help your act. Are your fursuit eyes huge and cute? Act like a puppy or kitten and use more cutesy movements. Try not to just stand around in your fursuit. Make your performance exciting and engaging. Kids are always excited to see a cute animal, so always be child-friendly and nice to the youngsters! Make sure you have a handler who can stay by your side when you’re fursuiting. Ask them to help you watch out for rowdy kids, see that you don’t overheat, and communicate with other people as needed. They’ll be your eyes and ears, since your senses will be obscured while you’re in your fursuit."
