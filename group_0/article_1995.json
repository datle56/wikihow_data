      "content": "Attain kama by enjoying life's pleasures. Moksha is just one of the 4 major goals that most practicing Hindus hope to attain during their lifetime. Before you can reach moksha , you'll need to first work on mastering the other 3. The first, kama , translates roughly as “desire.” In order to achieve kama , make a mindful effort to enjoy the various pleasures that life has to offer. [2] X Research source These pleasures can include enjoying good food, appreciating music or art, or having a fulfilling sex life. You must enjoy these pleasures virtuously—your pleasure should not come at someone else's expense, and it's just as important to give kama as it is to receive it. For example, you can give kama by performing music, creating art, or cooking delicious food for someone else."

      "content": "Prepare to work towards moksha after attaining the other purusharthas . It can take a lifetime to achieve the other 3 purusharthas , so don't try to rush into attaining moksha . For many people, working towards moksha means renouncing your place in society after living a full life enriched by simple enjoyment, familial and material success, and spiritual devotion. [7] X Research source In many Hindu traditions, people seek moksha by cutting ties with society and their personal life after their first grandchild is born. Some people choose to bypass the other parts of the process by becoming a sannyasin (or someone who “puts away everything”) at a young age and living an ascetic lifestyle, detached from society and material things.

      "title": "Let go of your desires and your ego.",
      "content": "Let go of your desires and your ego . One of the most important components of achieving moksha is letting go of the things that tie you to your life in the physical world. [9] X Research source This is part of the reason that most people renounce society and live a simple, ascetic lifestyle once they are ready to achieve moksha . Practice selfless acts of service, such as helping the sick or needy, to help you let go of your desires and attachments. Doing any kind of task, from cooking a meal to meditating, can be considered an act of service as long as you do it with the intention of helping others without expecting any reward in return. Of course, wishing to achieve moksha is a desire in itself, but many Hindus consider the desire for moksha to be necessary for letting go of all other desires."
