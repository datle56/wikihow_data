      "content": "Use a steam cleaner. Steam cleaners use heat and high pressure to get rid of debris. However, if your grout is very old or damaged, you should avoid using a steam cleaner because it may cause further damage. Heat the steam cleaner and then move the cleaning wand along the surface of the grout lines to get rid of any dirt and debris. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Start with a mild cleaning solution.",
      "content": "Start with a mild cleaning solution. It is best to try mild solutions first, since they are least likely to damage your colored grout. Start by trying vinegar or baking soda. If that doesnâ€™t do the job, you can move on to hydrogen peroxide, which will work with moderate levels of grime. If your grout lines are really grimy, you may need to use oxygen bleach. However, chlorine bleach should generally be avoided. [3] X Research source Chlorine bleach will discolor your colored grout, so you should leave it in the cupboard. Instead, choose either hydrogen peroxide or oxygen bleach. If your colored grout is dirty around dishwashers or sinks from hard-water deposits, you can use a vinegar solution. In a spray bottle, pour an equal amount of vinegar and water. Spray a bit of the solution on the grout lines. Then, scrub the grout lines with your grout brush. If you don't have a grout brush, a toothbrush will also work. If vinegar alone isn't working, a good alternative is a baking soda and vinegar mix. Wet baking soda with just enough water to make a thick paste. Apply the paste to your grout, then spray it with vinegar. Let the solution sit until it stops bubbling, then scrub the area with a brush. Rinse with clean water and dry with a rag. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Use oxygen bleach sparingly. Although oxygen bleach does a great job on colored grout, it will eventually wear the color down because of the chlorine. [5] X Research source The main advantage of oxygen bleach is that it requires very minimal scrubbing and does not produce fumes. You can find it at most home, hardware and cleaning supply stores.

Mop the floor with a liberal amount of the cleaning solution. Then, let it sit for thirty minutes. Finally, put fresh water in your mop bucket and rinse the floor. [11] X Research source If you use vinegar, mix equal parts warm water and vinegar."

      "title": "Apply a penetrating sealer to your colored grout.",
      "content": "Apply a penetrating sealer to your colored grout. A sealer will make your colored grout stain-resistant, since it makes the grout more resistant to oil- and water-based products. If your grout is very soiled, you could also re-apply the color sealant originally used to color the grout. Depending on the amount of wear and tear and the type of sealant you choose, you will need to re-apply it every year or two. If you are not sure whether your grout is sufficiently sealed, drip some water on it. If the water stays on the surface of the grout, it is sufficiently sealed. However, if the grout absorbs the water, you need to reseal the grout. When you purchase the sealer, ask if it is both hydrophobic and oleophobic. Some sealers are only water-repelling or hydrophobic, whereas others will repel both water and oil-based substances."
