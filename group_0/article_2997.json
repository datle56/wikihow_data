      "content": "Recite a personal mantra. Mantras are statements that we repeat in our heads over and over again throughout the day. If the statement playing on a loop in your head is negative, you will feel bad about yourself or lack confidence in your abilities. Positive statements empower you to become the person you long to be. You can say your mantra in front of the mirror or you can actively think the phrase as you meditate or go through your morning activities like making your bed and brushing your teeth. Restating the positive will eventually allow it to manifest in your life. You can also use your mantra in times of great stress or when you are doubting yourself. Examples of mantras can be quotes or lyrics from songs that reflect your core beliefs, or they can be simple declarations such as \"I am enough.\" or “I am not who I’m going to be. I am always becoming.\""

      "content": "Make a list of your positive traits. If you lack self-confidence, you need to take a moment and think about your strengths. Sit down and create a list. This reminds you of all the things you have to be proud of and can slowly make you more confident over time. Sometimes, we focus so much on what we are not that we overlook what we are. These traits can be physical, academic, or work-related. For instance, you could make a list of the following attributes: I have beautiful, radiant skin. I am a hard worker. My legs are strong and healthy. I am intelligent. I am a wonderful friend. I am a prayer warrior. I am creative. My body is gorgeous. Reflect on your positive attributes and you will feel better equipped to go out into the world as the beautiful, capable person that you are. [3] X Research source Keep this list handy for when you are feeling down or not so great about yourself.

      "content": "Get a grasp on your culture. Research has shown that blacks often progress through several stages in a racial identity model in which you first view whites as being better and yourself as being inferior until the last stage where you internalize your culture and reap a great deal of self-esteem and confidence. Getting a thorough understanding of your historical and cultural background can help you to assimilate your feelings about race into a positive self-identity. You can read books and listen to inspirational speakers that explain all aspects of your culture. You can also talk to elders in your family and community who share your racial background to glean their perspectives. Become aware of the inherent strengths of your racial group. Despite racism and historical oppression, black communities have many significant values such as emphasizing the importance of togetherness and community, focusing on bettering oneself and getting an education, leaning on family in times of need, and having a strong sense of religion or spirituality. Gaining knowledge about yourself and your racial group can allow you to see all the reasons you have to be self-confident and full of pride about your race."
