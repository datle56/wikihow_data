      "title": "No, you can't directly see who looks at your tweets.",
      "content": "No, you can't directly see who looks at your tweets. You can only know who saw your post or profile if they interacted directly with the content by liking, retweeting (reposting), or replying to the post. This applies to anything on your profile, including your picture, banner, bio, posts, and more. If you're worried about accidentally interacting with a post, you can create a secondary account. You can also make your current account private. When you like a tweet with a private account, the user won't get a notification. They can see that someone liked the post in the number count, but they won't be able to see who; you won't show up in the list of interactions."
