      "content": "Cut out (or purchase) two identically-sized wooden panels for each shelf. The size of the panel will correspond with the size of the finished shelf, so choose accordingly. You can either use a nice wood or plywood/MDF (medium-density fiberboard) and then apply paint or a nicer veneer later. You should start with: 1 – 2×4 2 – Cedar Pickets These boards are great, simple projects that work equally well will plywood, cedar, or nice sheets of maple or walnut. When possible, use a table saw for clean, well-cut lines."

      "content": "Cut out (or purchase) at least two long 1-by-2-inch strips of wood. The first one will be cut into pieces and placed between your panels to create a hollow-core shelf that can fit over a shelf mount on your wall. The second will form the shelf mount itself. Note that the pieces forming the internal shelf framework will be placed narrow-side down within the paneling; this will add an extra 2 inches of height to your shelf. The wood should be 1/2-1\" thick. This piece forms the u-shaped frame of your shelf."

      "title": "Cut the 1-by-2-inch strip into three pieces, one as long as the length of the panels and two as long as the width.",
      "content": "Cut the 1-by-2-inch strip into three pieces, one as long as the length of the panels and two as long as the width. The two shorter pieces need to fit the width of your wood panels. The longer piece fits between these two pieces and covers the width. After cutting, place the strips onto the panel as a \"dry run.\" They should form a perfect frame around three sides of the panel. To get a perfect diagonal joint, cut one end of each short piece and both ends of the long piece at 45-degree angles so that all three pieces can fit together to form 90-degree angles in the corners. Leave the front strip as is and cut an inch off of both shorter pieces, enabling you to tuck them behind the longer one once placed between the panels. Always err on the side of \"too long\" when cutting. You can always cut off a little more, but you can't add it back. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Attach all three 1-by-2-inch strips to one of the two panels. Set one panel down, place the three strips on the panel to form three continuous edges (a u-shape). Then run a line of wood glue along the top of each strip and place the second panel on top. Use finishing nails or a nail gun to attach the top panel to each strip. If using wood glue, you'll need to use clamps to ensure that the board stays in place as it dries. For thicker wood, or for a sturdier build, skip the nail gun and use a power drill."

When done, gently test it by trying to fit the board snugly into your shelf. This will form the base of the wall mount. This should be at least 3/4\" thick. Some builders prefer to make this mount first. Then you can build the shelf around the mount, using it as a guide for measurements. Neither way is better, just personal opinion."

They must fit perfectly into the hollow space or the shelf won't be flush.

      "content": "Screw the two support strips perpendicular to the long mounting strip. You are basically just remaking your framework, but a little thinner so that it fits inside the shelf. Using wood glue and a nail gun, create another u-shaped frame. Make sure you use a square edge to get the mounts perfectly 90-degrees. For bigger shelves or heavy wood, use a pocket joiner and power drill to create the mount -- it will be much sturdier. For peace of mind, create a third or fourth support strip, identical to the two on the outside. You then end up with an E-shaped bracket that can hold much more weight."
