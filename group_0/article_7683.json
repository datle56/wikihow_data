      "content": "Take the guard off the clipper. Most clipper guards come off pretty easily. Press down on the tab and pull the guard to get it off. This makes cleaning it much easier. [1] X Research source Make sure the clipper is off and unplugged before removing the guard so you don’t accidentally start it. If the guard isn’t removable, you can still wash it. Just don’t get any of the electronic parts on the clipper wet."

      "title": "Brush any loose hair hair off of the guard.",
      "content": "Brush any loose hair hair off of the guard. Use either the brush that came with your clippers or a barber brush. This should get rid of any loose hair. Make sure you get in between the teeth to remove any hairs that are hiding. [2] X Research source Pros recommend brushing the clipper and the guard before and after every use."

      "title": "Rinse the guard with warm running water and soap.",
      "content": "Rinse the guard with warm running water and soap. Turn your sink to warm or hot water and use high pressure. Rinse the guard underneath the water to dislodge any loose hair and dirt. Then add some hand or dish soap and rub the clipper between your hands to make it sudsy. [3] X Research source Don’t make the water too hot or you could burn yourself. Hand-washing the guard like this is fine for general cleaning, but not for disinfection. That takes special chemicals."

      "title": "Scrub between all the guard teeth with a brush.",
      "content": "Scrub between all the guard teeth with a brush. The water pressure and rubbing might not be enough to get rid of all the trapped hair and dirt. Use the cleaning brush that came with your clipper and rub it between each tooth on the guard to dislodge any debris. [4] X Research source If you don’t have the brush that came with your clipper, you could also use a toothbrush, pipe cleaner, or similar tool.
