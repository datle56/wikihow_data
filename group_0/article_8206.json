      "content": "Use an old rag or cloth. To clean your zinc objects, use an old rag or cloth. You do not want to use a new cloth or one you currently use because it could get ruined. If you don’t have a used rag or cloth, you can make one by cutting up on old t-shirt or piece of clothing."

      "content": "Choose a lemon or vinegar to clean your zinc. If you aren't worried about removing the patina from your zinc objects, use lemon juice or vinegar to clean your objects. If you choose lemon juice, you will need one or two lemons cut in half. If you choose to use vinegar, use plain, white vinegar."

      "title": "Choose toothpaste or a baking soda paste.",
      "content": "Choose toothpaste or a baking soda paste. If you want to keep the patina intact, use solutions that are less acidic, like toothpaste or baking soda. If you choose to use toothpaste, any kind of toothpaste, i.e., Arm & Hammer, Colgate, or Aquafresh, will work. If you choose to make a baking soda paste, depending on how large the object is, use a teaspoon (for smaller objects like jewelry) to a tablespoon (for larger objects like tabletops or pots) of baking soda. Then gradually mix in water until a paste forms. Gradually mix in the water by alternating mixing with water. For example, add a few drops of water, mix, and then gradually add more water until a paste forms."

      "content": "Use a metal wadding polish. Your zinc objects that have small areas of corrosion, uneven patination, or fingerprint marks can be polished using a metal wadding polish. Working in a circular motion, rub the object with the wadding polish. After polishing, let the object patinate naturally in air, and avoid handling it. [4] X Research source You can buy a metal wadding polish online, at your local hardware store, or at a crafts store, like Michael’s. Be sure to check the effect of the metal wadding polish on an unobtrusive area before polishing the whole object."
