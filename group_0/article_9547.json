      "content": "Develop and follow a good daily hygiene routine. A good daily hygiene routine will help minimize the bacteria that cause offensive body odor. Include the following practices in your daily routine: Shower or take a bath daily. Wash your entire body with antibacterial body wash or soap, paying special attention to your underarms, groin, and feet. Shave your armpits. Hair provides additional surface area for bacteria to multiply. By shaving, you will reduce the number of odor-causing bacteria on your body. Dry yourself thoroughly. After you get squeaky clean, dry yourself off with a clean, dry towel. Excess moisture provides a breeding ground for bacteria, so dry your armpits especially well."

      "content": "Put a little vinegar on your underarms to reduce bacteria. After showering and before applying deodorant, spritz your underarms with white or apple cider vinegar. Then, wipe them dry with a cloth. This extra step will reduce the number of odor-causing bacteria on your skin and help you smell better. [2] X Research source While the vinegar smell may be a little overpowering at first, it should fade after a few minutes. You may need to reapply the vinegar a few times throughout the day if you’re not using any other form of deodorant."

[3] X Research source If you have sensitive skin, choose wipes that are odor-free. If you have hyperhidrosis, a condition that causes excessive sweating, your doctor can prescribe medicated wipes that help reduce sweating and keep B.O. at bay.

      "content": "Get an aluminum-free deodorant to reduce odors but not sweat. Unfortunately, aluminum-based antiperspirants are the only over-the-counter products on the market that actually reduce sweat. However, there are plenty of deodorants out there that can cut down on unwanted smells without the possible harmful effects of aluminum. Look for products that say “natural deodorant” or “aluminum-free.” [5] X Research source Most aluminum-free deodorants contain alcohol, which can help dry your skin and make it less friendly to odor-causing bacteria. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Some natural deodorants soak up extra moisture in your armpits, which means they work sort of like a true antiperspirant and help your skin feel cool and dry. Look for moisture-busting ingredients such as aloe and vegetable glycerin."

      "title": "Buy an antiperspirant to reduce sweating.",
      "content": "Buy an antiperspirant to reduce sweating. The aluminum chloride in antiperspirant deodorants reduces sweating, and less sweat means fewer odor-causing bacteria. Make sure that the label reads “antiperspirant” on the deodorant. If the deodorant does not say “antiperspirant,” then it will just add fragrance and reduce bacteria without controlling the sweat. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Current studies show that there’s no evidence that aluminum-based antiperspirants cause cancer or Alzheimer’s disease. However, they can cause irritation or allergic reactions in some people. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If you’re worried, stick to a deodorant without aluminum chloride. Just keep in mind that it won’t actually reduce sweating. If you struggle with excessive sweating and exceptionally strong body odor, your doctor can prescribe a stronger, medicated deodorant. Keep in mind that these can cause side effects, such as redness, itching, or swelling of the skin."

      "content": "Apply deodorant to your underarms twice daily. Apply your deodorant once in the morning and again in the afternoon or evening. Deodorant wears off as you move and sweat throughout the day, so a second application may be necessary for keeping dry and maintaining a pleasant scent. Don’t forget to clean and dry your armpits before applying a new layer of deodorant! [11] X Research source If you only want to apply deodorant once a day, do it before you go to bed. The effects will last longer if you let the deodorant sit on your skin overnight. [12] X Research source Carry a small stick of deodorant with you so you can reapply it on the go. [13] X Research source If you’re using a deodorant that doesn’t have antiperspirant ingredients, you might need to reapply it more often."

[15] X Research source Prepare a 50/50 mixture of vinegar and water in a spray bottle, turn the garment inside out, and spritz a little of the mixture onto the underarm area of your garment. Repeat this process after each wear. Spot test your garment first to make sure the vinegar solution does not cause any discoloration. Look for an inconspicuous spot to test, like under the collar. Don’t use this technique on silk or other materials that might be damaged by moisture."

Some foods can contribute to body odor, so it is worthwhile to think about what you eat and consider reducing or eliminating foods that may be making your situation worse. [19] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Think about how often you include the following foods in your diet: Spicy foods. These foods may make you sweat more than usual or cause your body odor to be unusually strong. Meat and fish. Eating a lot of meat can sometimes make your B.O. smell a bit stronger or more unpleasant. [20] X Research source Some people also have a rare condition that prevents them from breaking down certain chemicals in seafood, leading to a “fishy” body odor. Eggs. Some people experience unpleasant body odors after eating eggs. They contain a chemical called choline, which can break down into a stinky, fishy smelling compound that comes out in your sweat. [21] X Research source Sulfurous foods. Some foods contain higher amounts of sulfur than other foods, which contribute to body odor. Limit your intake of onions, garlic, broccoli, cabbage, asparagus, and cauliflower. Alcohol. When you drink alcoholic beverages, the unpleasant smell of the alcohol may linger on your skin and breath. Caffeine. Drinking too much caffeine could make you sweat more, which can make your B.O. stronger.
