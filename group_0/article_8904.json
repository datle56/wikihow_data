      "content": "Get comfortable with your sexual orientation . You might have identified as LGBTQ for a while or only recently starting exploring your orientation. Make sure that you can confidently say to yourself, “I am gay” or “I am a lesbian.” If you're having trouble acknowledging that to yourself, you might not be ready to share this with other people. [1] X Research source Don't worry that you're too young to know which sex or gender you would like to be romantically involved with. No matter your age, you can know how you feel."

      "title": "Read stories about other people's experiences.",
      "content": "Read stories about other people's experiences. Coming out is a really personal process, but it can still be helpful to learn how other people handled it. Spend some time online reading about the experiences of other LGBTQ people. There are lots of great resources to look at like The Trevor Project ( https://www.thetrevorproject.org/ ) and Pride. If you have any friends or family members who identify as LGBTQ you could also ask them to tell you about what it was like for them to come out."

      "title": "Make a list of reasons that you want to come out.",
      "content": "Make a list of reasons that you want to come out. Whenever and however you want to come out is a really personal decision. It's important that you're doing it because you want to, not because you're feeling pressure from someone else. Maybe you want to start dating or are just ready to be more open in your current relationships. Those are terrific reasons to come out! [2] X Research source Sometimes people might make assumptions about your sexual orientation. Don't feel like you have to come out just to correct or confirm their assumptions. Only come out because it is what you want to do."

      "title": "List the supportive people in your life and choose one to tell first.",
      "content": "List the supportive people in your life and choose one to tell first. It's a good idea to choose a trusted confidant before coming out to the world. Just remember, your identity is your business and you don't have to share it with anyone that you don't want to. Jot down some names of people you can count on. Someone on that list is probably a good person to start with. [3] X Research source Your list might include your parents, a sibling, a friend, or another family member. It's a good idea to just pick one person to start with because a one on one conversation can feel less intimidating than talking to multiple people. If you want to tell both of your parents at the same time, it's definitely okay to choose 2 people to tell."

You can say, \"I can see that you're upset. Maybe you can reach out to me when you're feeling calmer.\""

      "content": "Plan what you will do if you get a negative reaction. When you're young, you likely rely on your parents for all of the essentials like food, clothing, and shelter. If you get the sense that your parents might not support you, consider waiting to come out. There's absolutely no shame in waiting until you live on your own to tell your parents. In the meantime, you can try reaching out to a more supportive, understanding relative. They could help you navigate this tough situation. [5] X Research source If you are worried about their reaction, have a back-up plan. Ask a friend or family member if you can stay with them for a while if your parents kick you out.

[6] X Research source If you want to come out to a friend, you can say, “Hey, do you want to come over after soccer practice? I have something I'd like to talk to you about.” If you are worried that the other person might get angry, choose to have the conversation somewhere public, like a nearby coffee shop."
