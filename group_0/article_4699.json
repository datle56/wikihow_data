      "content": "Find a grassy, level area away from other equipment. Try to put your monkey bars in a grassy spot so it doesn’t hurt as much as concrete or solid ground if you fall down. Check that the area is level so the vertical posts aren’t crooked, or else you’ll have trouble building the rest of the bars. Leave about 4–5 feet (1.2–1.5 m) of space between the area and other structures so you’re less likely to hit something if you’re swinging on the bars. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Stake off a 3 ft × 12 ft (0.91 m × 3.66 m) section of land. Push a wooden stake into the ground to mark the first corner of the monkey bars. Place another stake 3 feet (0.91 m) away, which will be the short side of the monkey bars with the steps. Measure 12 feet (3.7 m) out from the first stake to mark the length of the monkey bars, and push a third stake into the ground at your measurement. Put a final stake 3 feet (0.91 m) away from the third one to make the last corner. [2] X Research source Your monkey bars will be 12 feet (3.7 m) long, 7 1 ⁄ 2 feet (2.3 m) tall, and about 3 feet (0.91 m) wide when you’re finished."

Spread the handles apart and pull up to remove the dirt. Keep digging until the hole until it’s about 1 foot (30 cm) across and 3 feet (91 cm) deep. Continue digging the other holes at each of the other stakes. [3] X Research source You can buy a post hole digger at a hardware or outdoor care store. if you don’t have a post hole digger, it’s okay to use a shovel instead."

      "content": "Pour 6 in (15 cm) of gravel into the holes. [4] X Research source The bottoms of your holes won’t be perfectly level, so filling them with gravel can help provide a flat surface. Buy gravel from your local landscaping store and add it to the bottom of each hole. Tamp the gravel down firmly to level the surface so the monkey bars don’t slant. [5] X Research source You will need about 3 cubic feet (0.085 m 3 ) of gravel total for all of the holes. Gravel also helps improve drainage so water doesn’t cause the posts to rot."

      "content": "Set 4 in × 4 in (10 cm × 10 cm) post in the center of each hole. Get 4 outdoor posts that are 10 feet (3.0 m) long and pressure-treated so they withstand the weather. Place your posts in the holes and stand them up in the center. Make sure they sit firmly without tipping or slanting so they remain sturdy during your build. [6] X Research source Look for the straightest posts available so your monkey bars are less likely to bow or bend. Avoid using posts that aren’t made for outdoor use, or else they could rot when they get wet."

      "content": "Fill the holes with quick-setting concrete. Concrete will stabilize the posts enough so they won’t move around while you’re using the monkey bars. You’ll need about four 50 lb (23 kg) bags of concrete to fill all of your holes. Mix the concrete with water in a wheelbarrow or large bucket using a hoe or trowel. Slowly pour the concrete into the hole around the post until it’s filled to the top. Add the concrete to the remaining holes in the same way. [7] X Research source Check the specific instructions on the bags of concrete you’re using to see if there are any special mixing instructions. Wear safety glasses and a dust mask when you’re mixing the concrete so you don’t get any of the powder if your nose or eyes. Do not use monkey bars if they haven’t been stabilized in the ground since they could easily tip over while you’re swinging around."

Set a level on top of the post and check that it’s not crooked or slanted. If the post isn’t level, slowly push the post to adjust it. Check the remaining posts to ensure they’re all level as well. [9] X Research source If you need to, lean board, sticks, or stones against the side of the post to keep it in position."

Stand in front of the posts so one is on your left side and one is on your right. Start the tape measure on the leftmost edge on the left post. Extend the tape to the rightmost edge on the right post and write down your measurement so you don’t forget it.

Buy 2 in × 4 in (5.1 cm × 10.2 cm) boards that are 8 feet (2.4 m) long so you can cut them down to size. Make sure you buy pressure-treated outdoor lumber so it doesn’t rot. Mark the lengths on your boards and use a circular saw or hand saw to make your cuts. Save any scrap wood you have left since you may be able to use it later in the build. You’ll need approximately 18 feet (5.5 m) total for your steps."

Position the step 12 inches (30 cm) up from the ground. Hold the step in place with your non-dominant hand so it stays level. Place a 3 in (7.6 cm) wood screw 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the step’s top corner. Use an electric screwdriver to put the screw through the board and into the post. Then place another screw 2 inches (5.1 cm) in from the bottom corner on the same end. Attach the other end of the step to the second post the same way. [13] X Research source"

Align the bottom edge of the next step with the mark you just made and add 2 screws to each side to secure it in place. After that, add a third step another 12 inches (30 cm) higher. Repeat the process on the other end of your monkey bars to finish the steps. [14] X Research source You can adjust the distance between the steps if you need to. For example, you may shorten the gaps if you’re building them for smaller kids or make them larger if you’re building them for yourself. Just be sure you can easily reach the top of the post when you stand on the top bar."

Mark 4 sections that are 2 inches (5.1 cm) long along the length of the board. Use your circular saw or handsaw to make straight cuts through the board at each of your marks. When you’re finished, your 4 pieces will measure 2 by 4 by 2 inches (5.1 × 10.2 × 5.1 cm).

Hold the board so the long narrow edge is on the bottom. Lift the board up onto the supports and set it down so the ends are flush with the outer edges of the posts. Then set the second board on the other set of supports the same way. Ask a helper or two to hold the boards in place so they don’t move around or shift.

      "content": "Get a set of monkey bars online or from an outdoor store. Monkey bar kits come with the bars and hardware you’ll need to attach them to your frame. Look for a set that has around 6–9 bars so you have enough to span the entire length. Aim to get monkey bars that are around 20 inches (51 cm) long so you have enough room to swing around and hold onto them. Monkey bar kits usually cost around $30 USD. You can use any style as long as they mount to a flat surface."

      "title": "Divide the run length by the number of bars plus 1 to find the spacing.",
      "content": "Divide the run length by the number of bars plus 1 to find the spacing. Find the total length of your horizontal run in inches and write the number down. Add 1 to the number of rungs you have and then divide the length by that number. Your answer will be the distance you’ll use between each bar. [18] X Research source For example, if the horizontal run measures 144 inches (370 cm) and you have 9 rungs, your equation would be 144/(9 +1). Simplify the divisor: 144/(10). Solve the equation: 144/10 = 14.4. So the distance between each bar will be 14.4 in (37 cm). This is only a recommendation so you space your monkey bars across the entire length. Keep in mind how far you or the person using the monkey bars can reach since you may need to get more bars and set them closer to each other."

      "content": "Mark the bars’ locations on the top narrow edges of the runs. Start at the end of the horizontal run and measure along its length by the distance you found. Use a pencil to draw a line across the top edge of the run at your measurement. Continue across the entire length of the run until you make a number of marks equal to the number of bars you’re adding. Then draw the marks on the second run so they line up with the ones on the first. You will not place bars at the ends of the runs, so you will have to reach out for the first one from the top step."

Set one of the screws that came with your monkey bar kit in the hole at the end of the monkey bar. Use an electric screwdriver to set the screw into the top of the run so it holds the bar in place. Then attach the other side of the bar to the top edge of the second run. Work your way down the length of the frame, adding your monkey bars on each mark. When you finish attaching the last one, you’re ready to use the bars! [19] X Research source Some monkey bars come with screws that require a star-shaped bit, so you may need to buy one if you don’t already own it for your screwdriver."
