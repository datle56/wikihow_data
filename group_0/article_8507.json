      "content": "Choose a cleaning solution meant for your type of steering wheel. Steering wheels are made of multiple different materials depending on your car. While faux leather is the most common material, it’s possible to have a plastic, wooden, or genuine leather steering wheel. When in doubt, check your owner’s manual to find the material and the best practices for cleaning them. [2] X Research source Make a mixture of 3 parts all-purpose disinfectant and 1 part water if your steering wheel is made of plastic or faux leather. Use wood polish if you have a steering wheel made of natural wood. Look for a wood grain texture on the wheel. Work with a leather cleaner or conditioner if your steering wheel is made from genuine leather. Faux leather and genuine leather are difficult to differentiate, so check your owner’s manual to be sure."
