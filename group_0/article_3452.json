This isn’t always a requirement, but it’ll make you look much better to potential employers, especially if you don’t have a lot of experience. There are many bartending programs you could take, and most last a few weeks before completion. When you complete a program, you’ll get a certificate to make your skills official. [2] X Trustworthy Source US Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. government agency that collects and reports labor-related information Go to source If you’re in the US, try to find a bartending program licensed by your state’s Department of Education. This shows that a program is legitimate. If you're considering bartending school, schedule a visit before paying. See the school and meet some of the instructors to decide if they're professional and knowledgeable about the industry. They should also use a professional textbook and class materials. This way, you can avoid getting scammed. There are also many online bartending programs, but be careful with these. Investigate them thoroughly to make sure they aren’t scams. If possible, try to talk with people who completed the program to make sure they were able to get a job afterward. Bartending school usually costs a few hundred dollars, whether in-person or online."

There are only a handful of popular drinks that people order, so focus on memorizing these. The rest you can learn on the job, especially if certain bars have unique recipes.

[4] X Research source If you commit these recipes to memory, you’ll probably have all the necessary knowledge to land a job. It’s easy to find recipes online to study. You can also get a bartending book full of recipes. Remember to look up common bar terms too, like \"neat\" and \"on the rocks,\" so you know what customers are asking for."

Some great ways to impress your customers include recommending different drinks, making small talk, listening carefully so you get orders right, and overall show all the customers a great time. [5] X Trustworthy Source US Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. government agency that collects and reports labor-related information Go to source If you don't feel like you're naturally outgoing, you can always practice this skill. Try setting up a mock bar at home and serving friends and family to improve. You also might make a mistake while you're working. This is completely normal. Just get ready to apologize to the customer and fix your mistake. Remember that you also have to be firm sometimes. Customers who have been drinking can get rude or rowdy. Be ready to cut them off if they're drunk, or kick them out of the bar if they're acting inappropriately."

[8] X Research source Always remember to include your contact information on your resume! This seems so simple, but people sometimes forget. If you don’t have specific bartending experience, be sure to highlight any customer service jobs you’ve had. Being a server, cashier, host, or helpdesk worker can show that you know how to work with people and take care of customers.

If you’re a regular at a few bars in town and already know the workers there, you can get a leg-up on the competition. Go in and mention that you’re looking for bartending work and would love to chat with the manager. If the workers already know you, the manager might be more willing to hire you.

[10] X Research source Be prepared because the manager may want to interview or test you right there. Try to visit the bar at a less busy time, like mid-afternoon.

[11] X Research source Remember that this might be different if you’re interviewing at an upscale bar. Bartenders in these places often wear ties and dress pants, so dress appropriately for the interview.

Shake their hand, make eye contact, smile, sit up straight, and speak confidently so they can see that you’re a good fit for the job. Try to make the interview with the manager conversational. This will make them like you as a person and they’ll be more willing to hire you. If the manager asks why you want to work at this bar, say something like \"This is just the perfect atmosphere that I work well in. I can tell that the customers and staff are all people that I can get along with, and I can really do my best work here.\" The manager might try to make the interview tough or stressful for you. This is probably a test to see how you handle pressure, so remain calm and friendly throughout the whole process, even if it’s stressful."

Even if you know how to make drinks well, one of the most important parts of being a bartender is interacting with the customers. The manager will probably ask about your previous experience in customer service, whether it was at a bar or not. Be ready to emphasize your people skills and comfort in dealing with the general public. This is a good way to impress the manager. The manager will probably ask you how you’d handle some hypothetical scenarios, like remembering drink orders for a very large group or spotting a fake ID. Try to anticipate all of the situations you might come across on the job and have good answers for them. Have a few stories ready about when you had to resolve conflict, like needing to kick a drunk patron out of a bar. These are situations that will probably come up on the job, so the manager wants to know you can handle it. Say something like, \"I remember once a customer came into the bar stumbling, and I could tell he was already drunk. It wouldn't be right at all to serve him, so I told him he had to leave. When he wouldn't, I let the bouncer know so he escorted him out.\""

If they were on the fence about hiring you, your interest could push them in your favor. [12] X Research source You don't have to be very wordy when you follow up.

[13] X Research source Come prepared and bring anything that the manager tells you to bring, like pens or bottle openers. Also, dress exactly like they tell you to dress. Stay calm while you’re working your shift. It’ll probably get stressful, and the manager may have scheduled you at a busy time on purpose to see how you perform. Just remember all of your skills and experience to work through it. Remember to work well with everyone else on shift at that time. Being a bartender means being part of a team, so contribute to that team as much as you can."
