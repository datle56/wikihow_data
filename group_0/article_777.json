Further decide if you want the image to link to a website, a file on your computer, another location in the document, a new Word document, or to an email address. If you share this Word document and have this picture linked to a file on your computer, the other users may not be able to see the other file unless it's shared too.

For example, if you upload a picture to Facebook , you can see a URL to that picture when you click it. Paste that address anywhere to link to your Facebook picture ( privacy settings might prevent random people from seeing your picture). This method works for uploading pictures to almost all online platforms including Flickr, Imgur , Facebook, Instagram, Google Drive , and Apple iCloud. Only use this method if you want to insert a link that redirects people to your picture on these sites. It's not a method for adding a link to a picture."
