      "content": "Study the main concepts of Hinduism. Hindu is one of the oldest religions in the world, originating before recorded history on the Indian subcontinent. It’s vital to begin your entry into this religion through an appreciation of its foundation elements. The Trimūrti is a concept in Hinduism \"in which the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified by the forms of Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver and Shiva the destroyer or transformer.\" However in most Puranic texts, Brahma's creative activity depends on the presence and power of a higher god. [3] X Research source Traditionally, Hinduism prescribed a strictly ordered social varna system with 4 main groups: Brahmin (priests), Kshatriyas (nobles and warriors or leaders), Vaishyas (craftsmen and farmers or profit-minded), and Shudras (skilled/unskilled laborers). With possible myth, a fifth “untouchable” class which is said to be outside of the Varna system, doesn't exist. Hindu religion doesn't divide people into categories and classes. The Varna system defines one's varna quotient and one can possess all varna quotient with one or more prominent. Karma refers to a cause-and-effect system where one’s deeds and acts influence what happens in life. Each person creates their own destiny through their actions in life: if one conducts good deeds, they will reap good consequences later on in life. Dharma refers to God’s divine law which orders the cosmos. When we follow dharma, our souls are brought into harmony and advanced towards God, truth, and righteousness. Reincarnation , also known as punarjanma, is a cyclic process of birth, life, death, and rebirth. Instead of an afterlife, as is found in Judeo-Christian religions, Hindus believe that the immortal soul continues to exist after the death of the body, and is reborn into subsequent new bodies. The actions that one completes in life (their karma) influence how the souls is reborn (for example, as a lower order life-form). Once one resolves or “perfects” their karma, the soul breaks free from the reincarnation cycle. Hindus also traditionally believe in Chakras . There are 7 Chakras, or energy centers, located throughout the body and connected to one’s spirit. Believers can purify or open up their Chakras through yoga mediation. While there is a wide array of perspectives on the “Divine” as well as a host of deity figures, all Hindus worship a Supreme Being who is unchanging, all-present, timeless, formless, and pure love."

      "title": "Embrace pluralism.",
      "content": "Embrace pluralism. More than most major religions, Hinduism accepts and even celebrates pluralism. It is open to multiple types of practices and traditions. The Hindu phrase, “May good thoughts come to us from all sides,” reflects this open and accepting nature. It indicates that all can (and should) seek out enlightenment from multiple sources and perspectives rather than from one dogma. Hindus do not ascribe to any one creed, and do not believe that there is any one singular view, reality, or way to reach God. Contemporary Hindus tend to practice tolerance and acceptance as an important religious virtue, rather than being exclusionary or narrow-minded."

      "content": "Learn about the main denominations. There are 4 main denominations within Hinduism. Though each have their differences, they also share a common purpose: to further the soul's journey towards its divine destiny. Under Shaivism , Hindus worship the Supreme God as Shiva, (“the Compassionate One”). Shaivite Hindus value self discipline, follow a guru, worship in a temple, and practice yoga in order become one with Shiva. Followers of Shaktism worship the Supreme as the Divine Mother, Shakti or Devi, and use chants, magic, yoga, and other rituals to channel cosmic forces and awaken one’s spine Chakra. In Vaishnavism , worshipers seek the Supreme as Lord Vishnu and His incarnations, Krishna and Rama. Vaishnavites are deeply devotional and invested in saints, temples, and scriptures. Followers of Smartism , worship the Supreme in one of six forms: Ganesha, Shiva, Shakti, Vishnu, Surya and Skanda. They accept all the major Hindu Gods and are thus known as the most liberal or nonsectarian Hindus. They follow a philosophical, meditative path and strive after oneness with God through understanding."

In other words, try not to be hurtful or harmful to other living things in the things you do, say, or think. Consider becoming vegetarian. Many Hindus, though not all, practice vegetarianism as a way to show care and respect for animal life.

According to an ancient Hindu story, the original cow, Mother Surabhi, was a treasure churned from the cosmic ocean. [16] X Research source Beef is never eaten in Hindu cuisine, though the 5 byproducts of cows -- milk, curd, butter (ghee), urine, and dung -- are revered as sacramental objects. It is considered an important and holy duty (a dharma) to feed animals. Many Hindu households will ritualistically offer food to ants, for example, or offer sweet delicacies to elephants on special holidays. [17] X Research source"

One should pursue righteousness (dharma) and live a virtuous life of purity, respect, self-control, detachment, selflessness, and striving towards truth. One should partake in pilgrimages (tirthayatra) where you regularly visit holy persons, temples, and sacred pilgrimage sites. Such journeys provide freedom from routine life and thereby freshen the mind. Pilgrimages also help to create a sense of togetherness in the family, since all members undertake the pilgrimages together. One should keep the Holy Days (Uthsava) by participating in festivals, celebrating holy days in the home or temple, and observe fasts. Hindu sages tell us that occasional fasting prevents bodily diseases, restores the body's healing power, and heals the mind by removing lust, anger, hatred, pride, and jealousy. One should perform the sacraments (samskaras) as outlined in the scriptures and that mark an individual's passage through life. One should proclaim that “God is in all” (Sarva Brahma) and look for God in all beings."
