Move the pan around so the olive oil covers the whole surface; that way, your fish won't stick. [1] X Research source To test to see if the oil is hot enough, drop a bit of water in the pan. If it sizzles, the oil is hot enough."

Cut the finger limes along one side, and release the citrus pearls along the kingfish. [8] X Research source If you're using key limes, dice the pulp and sprinkle it over the fish. \"Against the grain\" means cutting perpendicular to the lines you see in the fish, which make up the grain of the fish. Put leftovers in the fridge in an airtight container and consume them within 3 days. [9] X Research source"
