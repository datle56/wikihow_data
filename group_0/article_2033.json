      "content": "Wear nice clothes. It's not like you have to go around wearing Armani or anything, just wear clothes that fit, suit your body, don't have holes or stains, and don't look like they were the height of fashion in 1986. Don't worry so much about brands: a woman worth having won't care what brand of clothing you wear. Just make sure you're dressed such that she wouldn't be embarrassed to be seen with you.

      "title": "Smell amazing.",
      "content": "Smell amazing. Just like you love a woman who smells like a perfect princess fresh out of fairy land, women love it when men smell amazing too. You can do this by first keeping your body clean, and then adding a nice scent. This can be as simple as getting a really nice smelling deodorant. If you want to go a bit further, you can try cologne, aftershave or body sprays. Just make sure that the smell is subtle and that you put it on correctly. She doesn't want you to smell like you bathed in Axe."

      "content": "Maintain your body. Women like men who keep themselves fit and well. [5] X Expert Source Mark Rosenfeld Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 29 July 2021. Don't feel like you have to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger, because she won't care so much whether you have a six-pack or not...just get yourself to a point where you're healthy and comfortable...say, walking up a large hill. This will make you feel better in your own skin and help attract women. [6] X Research source It's not that they're vain or hung up on societal ideas about weight, it's more than not exercising shows that you don't really care about yourself enough to keep your body healthy (even if that's not true). If you've both got a couple of extra pounds, you better be prepared to work on your own weight if you're going to ask her to work on hers."

      "title": "Find your talents.",
      "content": "Find your talents. Everybody is attracted to people who can do cool things. Now, you probably already have a talent or the potential for a talent that you don't know about. You need to find that talent and feed it. Even if it isn't a classically attractive talent like playing an instrument, nurturing your talent and spending time with people who do the same thing will give you the opportunity to meet girls who enjoy the same things you do. [7] X Research source You can always learn a new talent too. Drawing is a good one, since it is a skill that can be learned, rather than something that really requires innate talent."

      "title": "Be exciting.",
      "content": "Be exciting. Don't be the guy who sits at home all weekend, eating Funyuns and playing COD. There's nothing wrong with being introverted, but you still need to spend your time doing exciting things. If you're introverted, start writing a book or teaching yourself an art. If you're more comfortable talking to people and getting outside, go do those things. Join a club, go hiking, volunteer, whatever. Just make your life about something. You want to have something to talk to women about, don't you? [8] X Research source If you're going to insist on playing COD, you better plan on becoming a championship winning competitive player because that's basically what it's going to take."

      "content": "Be kind and respectful to everybody. While you're probably not walking around, if you have a bad attitude and you treat other people poorly, you are going to have a hard time attracting women. Even if you're nice to women you want to date but a total jerk to everyone else, women will notice. Be nice, legitimately nice, and respectful towards everyone and women will be reasonably assured that they can always expect the same. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Be stable. Be stable by having a good job, doing the things you say that you will, and generally being responsible. Don't think that women want you to have an awesome job so that they'll be taken care of; they just want to know that you won't be a dead weight! Just like you might not want to have to support a woman who does nothing, women don't want a guy who sits around all day eating Cheetos. If you show her that you can pay your bills and hold down a good job, she'll be much more likely to want to date you."

      "content": "Be her knight in shining armor. Being her knight in armor isn't about treating her like she can't do things for herself. It's about giving her the tools she needs to rescue herself. Be emotionally supportive when she's had a bad day. Help her talk through her problems so that she can find a solution. When she asks you for help or advice, give it, without judgement or criticism. Find ways that you can make her life easier and help her achieve the things she wants for her life."

      "content": "Don't be a jerk. You could be Jon Hamm, it doesn't matter: women are not obligated to want to date you. Remember that. Just think, if some woman you found unattractive and boring started shouting about how you were a loser or something, how would you feel? Sometimes people just don't connect. That's not your fault and it's not her fault either. Just keep trying and you'll find Ms. Perfect. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Do your own thing.",
      "content": "Do your own thing. If you don't want to go out and actively get women, you're going to have to be sure you're going off to do your own thing. Don't hang around waiting for them or send them flowers every week. Just go do your own thing and wait for them to come to you. Some things you can do are: Hang with your friends. Gotta get in that COD time, after all. Hang out alone. At last! Peace and quiet! Underwear rock out party time! Do things you enjoy. This is a great time to develop those skills that women find so attractive."

      "content": "Give women their freedom. Women don't want to date someone who's really clingy or controlling. If you have girl friends that you're hoping to catch the eye of, show them that you're perfectly happy to go do your own thing without them. Don't annoy them by constantly asking to hang out, don't ask to go everywhere with them (or follow them around without asking!), don't try to trap them in a corner when you want to talk, and don't try to guilt them or manipulate them into going places with you. Show women that they are free to go where they want and do what they want, and if they want a buddy along for the ride, you're there for them."

      "title": "Don't be a follower.",
      "content": "Don't be a follower. Start trends, don't follow them. Women are attracted to guys they perceive as cool. Try to be independent and show your own personality, rather than copying what the other guys are doing."

      "title": "Don't be creepy.",
      "content": "Don't be creepy. This is very important for getting women to want to date you. Avoid awkward comments or jokes. Keep your eyes on her face. Don't stalk girls. If a few women decide that you are a creeper, they will probably warn others that you are a creeper and then you're just doomed. [11] X Research source A good rule of thumb is that if you wouldn't say something to your mom, don't say it to a woman you're not dating."

      "content": "Don't be too independent. You shouldn't leave women thinking you're uninterested in dating altogether. Flirt occasionally or find other ways to show that you're interested."
