Once you have a concealer, use it to cover up parts of your face that are darker than others. Often, your skin will be a little darker under your eyes and on the bridge of your nose. To find the right shade of concealer, test a color on an area of your neck, a little below your ear. The color should be a little lighter than your skin color. You want it to be lighter because the concealer must cover up dark spots on your face. [2] X Research source"

To allow your skin to breathe, you can thin down your cream foundation by moistening your sponge before dipping it in the base."

If you don’t have thin eyebrows, you can either pluck them or use concealer and foundation to cover some or all of your existing eyebrows. If you want to pluck your eyebrows to a 1920s style, use a pair of tweezers and shape your eyebrows into a thin arch. You can make your eyebrows a little thinner at the ends. If you don’t want to pluck, use concealer and foundation to cover your existing eyebrows partially or entirely. In a partial cover, dab the makeup on your eyebrow hairs, leaving a thin line of hair exposed. Layer enough concealer and foundation to make the covered eyebrow match the color of your skin. The covered eyebrow should blend into your face well. To cover your entire eyebrow, put concealer and foundation on all the hairs. After covering, you can draw in thin eyebrows with a pencil."

      "content": "Shape your mouth into a cupid’s bow. The 1920s mouth was named the “cupid’s bow” because of its special shape. The cupid’s bow is a mouth with an exaggerated bottom lip and an upper lip with a bow. To make a cupid’s bow, use a waxy dark red lip liner to draw an arch on each side of your top lip. Then draw your lower lip as slightly plumper than it really is by extending slightly on the bottom. Draw both your upper and bottom lips as shorter on the sides. Fill your new lip shape in with pencil before layering matching lipstick over it. The arches on your top lip should be even, so they look like a bow. Lip colors in the 1920s were deep reds and brownish reds. When you are through, your lips should not be as wide as they really are, giving the illusion that you have them puckered and ready for a kiss."
