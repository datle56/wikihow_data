      "content": "Most social media sites let you decide what information is public and what is only shared with your contacts. Making your posts and profile private can prevent potential stalkers from seeing information about you, including your photos, videos, and profile information. If you have accounts on Facebook , Twitter , TikTok, LinkedIn, Tumblr , Instagram, and YouTube , check your privacy settings on each and maximize them across the board."

      "content": "Disable geotagging on all of your posts. Tagging your location on posts makes it easy for people to find you in the real world. This can be dangerous because it can allow a stalker to know where you are, whether you're at home, or if you're alone. Go to the app's settings on your phone and disable geotagging or location features."

      "content": "If your friends are public, stalkers might look for information about you on their profiles. They also might contact your friends to try to get closer to you. If the app you're using has the option to hide your friend list (like Facebook ), you should do so. Let your friends know about the stalker and not to respond to strange messages or contact requests."

      "content": "Using a unique username on each social media app makes it hard for stalkers to find your other accounts. Similarly, using a different profile photo on each platform makes it hard for cyberstalkers to use reverse image search tools to find your profile photo elsewhere on the internet. If your profile picture is public, consider using a picture that is not a close-up of you. You might want to post a picture of something that is not you so it's not obvious that it's your profile."

      "title": "If someone you don't know sends you a follow or friend request, proceed with caution.",
      "content": "If someone you don't know sends you a follow or friend request, proceed with caution. Cyberstalkers may create convincing fake accounts that impersonate your friends, celebrities, or even unassuming strangers who share common interests in hopes of getting close to you. If you get a new friend or follow request, research it fully without contacting the person directly. Do you have mutual friends with the person sending the request? Cyberstalkers may follow your friends before sending you a request so the request looks more convincing. Ask your mutuals how long they've been connected to that person online—if the connection is recent, it could be your stalker playing games. If you think someone has ill intentions, block them. Then, let your friends know that a stalker might reach out to them to get to you."

      "content": "Resist the urge to reveal personal information on social media. The more information you make public, the more stalkers and cyberbullies can use that information to their advantage. If using your real name is not required by the social media network, use a creative fake name instead. [1] X Research source While many social media networks provide extensive profiles to users that can be fun to fill out, avoid filling out the parts of your profile that aren't required by the service. For example, if it's not required to enter your birthdate or phone number, don't provide this information. Sharing photos of the places you visit throughout the day can be fun, but if the wrong person gets a hold of those photos, they'll know exactly how to find you. Never share your contact information publicly on social media—if you need to give somebody your phone number, do it in a private message."

      "content": "A diligent stalker may try to hack your accounts and devices. To minimize your chances of being hacked, it's important to take basic security precautions every time you get online. Use antivirus software on your computer and keep it up to date. Scan your computer for spyware and other malware often. When you connect to public Wi-Fi at school, at the airport, in a café, or anywhere else, use a VPN. Always use unique secure passwords . Enable two-step authentication whenever available. Avoid installing apps that want to access your social media and email accounts and/or contact lists. Never leave your computer or phone unattended. Use a lock screen password or biometric to prevent others from logging in when you're not around. If you use an account from another computer, log out before you leave."

You can also try finding photos of yourself . If you find anything that concerns you, there are ways to remove your name from search engines and other sites, and even delete yourself from the internet.

A person can see any other pictures of you or your family and friends, and they'll also see the comments you left (and the comments people left about you). Your friends' photo privacy settings could affect your safety. Facebook and Instagram have privacy settings you can control to limit who can tag you in photos, including the option to approve tags before they appear on your profile. Make any online photo albums private, too, especially if you embed pictures from those albums onto your social media profiles.
