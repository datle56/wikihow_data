      "title": "Determine if your fabric will receive dye.",
      "content": "Determine if your fabric will receive dye. Fabric dye works best on natural fabrics such as cotton, linen and silk. Synthetics such as rayon and nylon are also good candidates. There are a couple of fabrics that won’t accept dye well – 100% polyester and spandex. Avoid attempting to dye those. It’s recommended that you don’t attempt to dye the fabric of any garment labelled “dry clean only”. The different fabrics absorb dye differently from one another, with results that vary in appearance. If you are concerned about a particular garment, test a swatch first."

      "content": "Prepare your workspace. Cover your entire workspace with plastic or newspaper before you begin. Make sure to have sponges and paper towels within reach in case of spillage. Use plastic buckets, stainless steel buckets or a stainless steel sink to create your dye bath. Don’t use bath tubs made of porcelain or fiberglass for any part of the dyeing process because they will stain. You will need to be wearing rubber gloves during the entire dyeing and rinsing process."

Make sure you use enough hot water to completely submerge your garment. If you want the deepest black and your tap water doesn’t get hot enough, use a stove, tea kettle or microwave to heat the water."

      "content": "Pre-dissolve your powder dye in a separate container in very hot water. Be sure to dissolve it thoroughly and use a chopstick or any other handy tool you don’t mind staining to stir the mixture until well mixed. If you’re using liquid dye, all you need to do is shake it well before adding it to the bucket. Check the dye packaging to make sure you are using enough dye for the amount of clothing you’re dying. The amount needed varies from product to product, so consult the packaging or insert for exact measurements."

      "content": "Pour the mixture into your dye bath (the bucket/sink). Make sure that the mixture blends well into the hot water. There needs to be enough water in the bucket so that your garment can move around freely and be stirred while in the dye bath. This is so that your garment will get evenly dyed. Add one tablespoon of laundry detergent to the dye bath. This will help promote dye absorption. Make sure that you stir the laundry detergent into the dye bath until it is well dissolved. When dyeing cotton, rayon, ramie, or linen, add 1 cup of table salt to the dye bath. This will intensify the color. When dyeing nylon, silk and wool, add 1 cup of white vinegar to the dye bath to intensify the color."

Try to keep the temperature of the water as consistently hot as possible. [5] X Expert Source Rani Gorgis Laundry & Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 7 April 2021. Have a stove top, microwave or tea kettle nearby to heat water up to use to refresh the dye bath. Another option would be to use a large stainless steel pot for the dye bath and go through the process with the pot being heated on the stove to keep a consistent temperature. If you soak your clothing in plain hot water for a few minutes before putting them in the dye bath, it will smooth them out so that they can accept dye even more easily."

      "content": "Hang or machine dry the clothing. You can dry your items either way, but hang drying clothing preserves their dark colors, so it’s probably a better idea to get in that habit. Once dry, your clothing is ready to wear. For the first 3 times you wash your newly dyed clothing after wearing, wash the items alone in cold water using the gentle cycle and mild, non-bleach detergent. After that you can wash the dyed items with other items of the same color that haven’t been dyed, but make sure it’s always in cold water and using a mild detergent."

This method is most effective when used on cotton fabrics, like faded black t-shirts. The effects aren't as ideal on other types of fabrics. If you want to restore clothing to a very rich black color, coffee is less effective than black fabric dye. Coffee will have more natural-looking results."

You will need 2 cups of coffee for this so use a full sized coffee maker, not a single serve or smaller coffee maker. You can also use 2 cups of black tea instead of the coffee for similar results, if that's your preference. It doesn't matter how you get the two cups of coffee, as long as they are fresh and dark. If you're an instant coffee drinker, it's perfectly fine to make your coffee with that. Being brewed by a coffee maker isn't a requirement."

Allow the rest of the cycle to finish up just as it normally would. If you've used commercial fabric dyes on your clothing before, you'll notice that this method smells much better during the process and after. The coffee method is also non-toxic, and you don't have to worry about coffee staining the basin of your washing machine."

To get away with washing your dark clothes infrequently, take them off and let them air out after wearing them instead of washing. Put the item on a hanger and hang it somewhere by itself for a day before putting it back in the closet. After wearing the item and air drying 2 or 3 times, go ahead and wash it."

Hand wash these items in cold water to preserve their color and to prevent the items from being damaged. If you really want to avoid hand washing your laundry, the next best thing is to get a small mesh bag for your delicates. Put them in the mesh bag prior to putting them in the washing machine. This will cut down on damage to your delicates. If you have any garments that you are unsure how to launder, dry clean them."
