      "content": "There's no use trying to fake it with a Cancer —he can smell a lie a mile away. The Cancer man places great value on honesty and sincerity. [2] X Research source As a Scorpio woman, this shouldn't be any problem for you, since you demand honesty and don't care to lead people on. [3] X Research source At the same time, be aware that your tendency toward brutal honesty can sometimes wound the sensitive Cancer man. Be gentle with any criticism and package it with plenty of reassurance."

      "content": "Cancerian men are naturally attracted to kind and nurturing souls. When you're out with a Cancer man, treat those around you with grace and kindness, even when they're not necessarily kind to you. He'll notice and swoon. [4] X Research source For example, if you see someone struggling to carry several bags of groceries, you might dash over and offer to help them. If you volunteer for the local animal shelter or regularly donate to a charity, it doesn't hurt to talk those up as well. A Cancer will appreciate all that you do to help others in need. He'll appreciate having a partner who hows how to give as well as receive. [5] X Expert Source Chloe Carmichael, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 29 May 2019."

      "title": "This is your natural flirting style so you shouldn't have any problems.",
      "content": "This is your natural flirting style so you shouldn't have any problems. Scorpio women are passionate, but they also tend to be pretty subtle about their attraction. This works quite well with Cancer guys as they pay attention to detail and won't let subtlety pass undetected. [6] X Research source For example, you might lean in closer to him and let your hand linger on his arm as you're chatting. You don't have to be over-the-top or dramatic with a Cancer man. In fact, if you're too aggressive or obvious, you run the risk of pushing him away."

      "title": "The chivalrous Cancer man loves a \"damsel in distress.\"",
      "content": "The chivalrous Cancer man loves a \"damsel in distress.\" Guys under this sign love when you need their help. Even though you might feel like you have things under control, giving a Cancer man an opportunity to help you can coax him out of his shell and bring out his strong protective side. [7] X Research source Don't be afraid to go to him when you're in a tough situation. He'll be thrilled to help you out however he can. Be sure to tell him how helpful he was and how grateful you are. Cancerians can be insecure, so let him know just how much you appreciate him!"

      "title": "Cancer men are eager to probe the depths of your psyche.",
      "content": "Cancer men are eager to probe the depths of your psyche. Your Cancerian wants to know you on a deeper level. [8] X Research source This shouldn't be too tough for you, Scorpio, since you love to get to know people on a deeper level and have little tolerance for superficial relationships. [9] X Research source Talking about deep matters of philosophy, religion, beliefs, and life will help a Cancer man bond with you and feel that he understands who you are and what makes you tick. Feeling like he understands you helps keep his insecurities from surfacing and potentially getting the better of him."

      "title": "Cancer is attracted to people who are just as emotional as he is.",
      "content": "Cancer is attracted to people who are just as emotional as he is. The Cancer man is highly emotional and empathetic but has a tendency to keep those emotions bottled up. By revealing your own feelings, you encourage him to open up as well. [10] X Research source A Cancerian also tends to be a great listener, so he's the perfect person for you to spill your emotions, regardless of how illogical they seem. Your Cancer man will feel them right along with you and empathize wholeheartedly."

      "title": "Let down your guard to help your Cancer man feel secure.",
      "content": "Let down your guard to help your Cancer man feel secure. As a Scorpio woman, you tend to be pretty tough and independent—traits that, unfortunately, can make a Cancer man feel anxious and unneeded. But there's nothing like a little vulnerability to bring out his strong protective streak. [11] X Research source For example, you might ask him to help you open a jar or reach something on a high shelf. Asking for help is an easy way to show vulnerability and a Cancer man will always leap to help! Sharing your fears or anxieties is a good way to show him emotional vulnerability. Expect the emotional and empathetic Cancer to envelop you with warmth and love when you're feeling vulnerable and exposed. By covering and protecting you, he'll feel loved and needed. You don't have to share all of your vulnerabilities with him at once, though. Opening your heart isn't an all-or-nothing process—it's okay to do it slow, nuanced way.

      "title": "A Cancer man can be insecure and requires near-constant validation.",
      "content": "A Cancer man can be insecure and requires near-constant validation. Since, as a Scorpio woman, you tend to be direct and clear about your feelings, you should have no problem keeping your Cancerian's anxieties in check. Just remember to express your feelings openly and show him plenty of love. [13] X Research source For example, if he holds the door open for you, you might say, \"Such a gentleman! I love that about you!\" As a Scorpio, your focus might be more sensual. Keep in mind Cancerians tend to need more emotional love."

      "title": "Respect for family is important to a Cancer man.",
      "content": "Respect for family is important to a Cancer man. You can expect him to be just as loyal to his family as he potentially will be to you. Old habits die hard with the Cancer man. Don't be surprised if he does things a certain way simply because that's how his family has always done them. [14] X Research source As a Scorpio woman, you also tend to be deeply loyal, which a Cancer man will definitely appreciate. You can't go wrong with an outing or date idea that has a nostalgic or sentimental bent. A Cancer man tends to enjoy vintage, so take him along thrift store shopping with you.

      "content": "With his focus on tradition, he's attracted to feminine women. This doesn't mean you're out of luck if you have a more alternative or non-traditional style, but a few delicate touches will make all the difference. So break out your heels and wear your favorite dress to turn the Cancer man's head. [15] X Research source If the way to a man's heart is through his stomach, the way to a Cancer man's heart is a home-cooked meal followed by an evening snuggled up on the couch together watching a movie or just talking about life.
