      "content": "Take some time to compose yourself before you apologize. Though you may want to throw yourself at the mercy of the person you have offended as soon as you realize your bad behavior, you may want to wait a little before apologizing. Depending on how bad your behavior was, you may take a day away from the person to give them some space and let your emotions cool down. Taking some time to compose yourself will also allow you to think about how you plan to apologize and what you are going to say in your apology. Often, a well-thought-out and clear apology a day after the offending incident can be more effective than a casual, awkward apology right after the incident."

      "title": "Write an apology letter.",
      "content": "Write an apology letter. If you are struggling to put your apology into words, you may want to try sitting down and composing an apology letter. Sometimes, writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you get a better sense of what you want to say to the person. It will also force you to confront your bad behavior and consider why you acted badly. Identifying the reason(s) for your bad behavior may allow you to write a more sincere and clear apology to the person. Though you may not give the letter to the person, writing down your thoughts can help you to craft a better in-person apology. In your letter, you should focus on saying “I’m sorry” but without adding any excuses for your behavior. Avoid saying “I’m sorry for my behavior, but I am under a lot of stress” and instead say, “I’m sorry for my behavior and for the way I treated you. I was stressed, and I took it out on you, which was inappropriate.” Replacing the word but with the word and can be a good start. You should also try to empathize with the person’s point of view in your letter, noting that you understand why the person may be upset at you. You should also make a point of promising that you will try to act more appropriately in the future, as this shows you are making an effort to correct your behavior. End the letter on a positive note, stating that what you did will never happen again and that you hope you can both move past the incident. You may want to sign the letter, “Sincerely” to show that you are trying to be honest and truthful."

      "title": "Apologize one on one in a quiet, private area.",
      "content": "Apologize one on one in a quiet, private area. If you decide to apologize in person, you should make sure you make the apology in a quiet, private area. This could be in your office at work, in a conference room, in your home, or a quiet area of the library at school. Apologizing in a private area one-on-one will allow you to be honest and upfront about your feelings. If the person is very upset at you for your behavior, you may want to suggest a public place that feels neutral and safe for both of you, such as a coffee shop close by where the person lives or a bar."

      "content": "Make a promise to change your behavior. You should offer some way of making up for your behavior, whether this is a promise that you will never act the way you did again or a promise that you will talk to the person with respect rather than lash out at them in the future. You should make a realistic promise to the person as a way to strengthen your apology. Make sure your promise notes your desire to change your behavior so you do not act badly again. [4] X Research source For example, you may say: “I promise that I will never speak out again in a meeting and speak inappropriately to you or to others.” You may also say, “I know I keep lashing out at you and I do not want to keep behaving this way. I will work on how I process my emotions and make sure I do not take them out on you.” Another option is to ask the person how you can make it up to them and let them dictate their expectations for you. This may be a useful option if you are apologizing to a partner or spouse and want them to give you input on how you can make up for your bad behavior. You may ask, “How can I make up for my behavior?”"

      "title": "Give the person an apology gift.",
      "content": "Give the person an apology gift. Another way to make up for bad behavior is to surprise the person you have offended with an apology gift. This could be a standard apology gift, like a bouquet or a box of sweets. Leave the gift on their desk or have them delivered with a card noting how sorry you are. The small gift may at least help them work toward letting go of their anger toward you and accept your apology. You could also think of a gift that seems particular to the person, like a mug with their favorite celebrity on it or a box of their favorite chocolates. Thoughtful, personal gifts are usually a big hit and can show the person that you feel bad for your behavior."

Once you have apologized to the person through words and/or actions, you must give the person time to process your apology. Do not expect the person to forgive you right away or say, \"No big deal\" after you apologize. It may take time for the person to accept your apology and move forward from your bad behavior. [8] X Research source You may need to give the person space and spend time away from them so they can process their emotions towards you and find it in their heart to forgive you. Be patient when giving a person time. Just because you think enough time has passed does not mean it's true. That person might need more time than you realize. Whether the person accepts your apology or not, make sure you listen to their response. Though it may be difficult to hear how you have hurt this person, listening to what they have to say is a fundamental part of taking responsibility for your actions.
