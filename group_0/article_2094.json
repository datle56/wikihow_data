Ask him engaging questions, show interest in the rigorous topics he’s passionate about, and let all of your off-the-wall opinions fly. [1] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 December 2021. Astrologer Angel Eyedealism suggests that you \"talk about ideas or concepts.\" So, for example, instead of launching into a deep conversation about love, \"talk about the intellectual construct of love or the ivory tower of love to get [him] to relax a little bit.\" He's an air sign, so Aquarius feels that stimulating chats are the ultimate pastime, but he's not necessarily interest in full depth right off the bat. Ask him open-ended questions to kick off a discussion: “Do you think there’s any chance that we’re living in a simulation?” Aquarians are passionate about humanitarian issues, so show him you’re interested in them, too: “Did you read that new report about the climate crisis?” Men of this sign love a totally unique opinion, so share your wild theories: “I genuinely believe that K-12 school should be held outside.

Ask him to expand on his logic: “What specifically do you think makes The Neon Skyline better? I might have to challenge you on this one…” Scorpio, you’re quick and observant. Use this to your advantage! Stay civil, listen close, and poke holes in his argument when you can. He’ll love it."

      "content": "For Aquarius men, the best romances come from friendship. Scorpio, when you like someone, you’d probably rather jump right into an intense, emotional deep-dive. But to snag an Aquarius, move at his pace instead. Be a great friend to him first. Hang out platonically—whether that’s in groups or alone. Bond with him, integrate him into your circle, and wait for him to initiate romance. [4] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. However, astrologer Angel Eyedealism cautions against going too far down this path: \"remember with Aquarians it's so easy to fall into the friend zone.\" Instead of forgoing the romantic connection all together, she suggests that you go slow and \"breach physical or intimate emotionality with an Aquarius carefully.\" When your Aquarius crush is hanging out with his pals, tag along. Get to know him better through the people he cares most about. Then, return the favor. Invite him to hang out with your circle of friends. If you’ve got a group camping trip coming up, for instance, save him a spot in the tent. When you're alone, focus on getting to know who he is as a person—not as a boyfriend. Ask him questions while you bowl, hike, or go sightseeing."
