      "title": "See if your vape pen has an integrated or removable battery.",
      "content": "See if your vape pen has an integrated or removable battery. You can usually find this information in the users manual or instruction booklet that came with your vape pen. Integrated batteries typically take the form of an elongated tube or cylinder (which attaches to the cartridge, or the part that heats the e-liquid), whereas removable batteries are housed inside casing of the pen itself. The majority of vape pens use “510-Thread” batteries, which have a universal design that makes them compatible with different cartridges. [1] X Research source Your vape pen’s battery may feature colors, text, or other markings distinguishing it from the cartridge."

      "title": "Hook your vape pen up to its charger using the included USB cable.",
      "content": "Hook your vape pen up to its charger using the included USB cable. First, plug the AC adapter into a nearby electrical outlet. Then, insert the large end of the USB cable into the adapter and connect the smaller end to the corresponding port in your pen. Depending on the model you’re using, you may need to unscrew the battery from the cartridge in order to access the charging port. [2] X Research source Always use the charger and cable that came packaged with your vape pen. Different units sometimes run on higher voltages, and too much juice could cause your pen to overheat or even explode. Never attempt to charge your vape pen with a laptop, mobile phone, or any other device that could potentially be damaged in the event of a short or surge."

      "title": "Wait for the battery to finish charging completely.",
      "content": "Wait for the battery to finish charging completely. Charging times for different batteries can vary from 1-4 hours. You’ll know your battery is fully charged when the indicator light turns green or begins blinking steadily. On certain models, the charging light will shut off when the battery reaches 100%. Situate your vape pen away from any nearby flammable objects (such as blankets or upholstered furniture) while it’s charging to reduce the risk of fire related to overheating. Once your battery is fully charged, remove it from the charger unit and screw it back onto the cartridge to begin vaping again."

      "title": "Watch for the red light that tells you it's time to recharge your battery.",
      "content": "Watch for the red light that tells you it's time to recharge your battery. When you’ve depleted your vape pen’s battery to a certain level, a red light will appear on the LED display. Remember: red means “stop.” Hold off on using your vape pen again until it’s been charged. Attempting to use your vape pen in a low-battery state could lead to shorts, battery death, or other defects. If your battery stops holding a charge or begins draining faster than usual, take it as a sign that it’s time to replace it."

      "title": "Open the casing of your vape pen to access the batteries.",
      "content": "Open the casing of your vape pen to access the batteries. If your vape pen runs on removable batteries, you’ll need to take them out before you can charge them. Look for the removable battery cover on the bottom or side of your pen. Once you find it, press the thumb latch or tab to pull it open. Some vape pens have to be modded in order to work with removable batteries. This usually involves fitting the cartridge into a separate device that houses the batteries. The most common type of removable battery used to power vape pens are 18650s. These look similar to standard AA batteries, only bigger."

      "title": "Place the batteries in a quality external charger.",
      "content": "Place the batteries in a quality external charger. Plug the charger’s power cord into the wall. Once the LCD display screen or power indicator light appears, arrange the batteries inside the charging slots according to the indicated pole positions. You should hear a faint click as they seat securely. If you’re having trouble getting your batteries to fit inside the charger, try turning one or both of them around. They may just be oriented the wrong way. Make sure you’re using a charger that’s compatible with your specific battery type—mixing and matching parts can easily ruin a battery. For more information about what type of charger to use, consult the literature included with your vape pen."

      "title": "Charge your batteries for at minimum of 3 hours.",
      "content": "Charge your batteries for at minimum of 3 hours. This is the average amount of time it takes for most removable vape batteries to reach a full charge. Be aware, however, that charging times can vary quite a bit based on the brand, age, and capacity of your batteries. The best thing to do is just keep an eye on them while they’re in the charger. [5] X Research source Pick out a spot for your charger that’s not too hot or cold. The optimal temperature range for charging most types of low-voltage batteries is 50–86 °F (10–30 °C). [6] X Research source If your vape pen has a \"soft start\" mode and you’re not in a hurry, consider using it. Soft start charges batteries at a slow rate rather than quickly at high heat, which can cause them to burn out faster."

      "title": "Remove the batteries from the charger when they reach full capacity.",
      "content": "Remove the batteries from the charger when they reach full capacity. Many newer chargers have LCD screens that display all of the relevant charging details that you might need to know, including charge duration, current percentage, and battery specs. Other chargers might feature a single light turns green or shuts off when the batteries are done charging. Take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with your charger’s various functions before using it for the first time. Check back on your batteries often to avoid overcharging them."

    {
      "title": "Reload the batteries into your vape pen.",
      "content": "Reload the batteries into your vape pen. Open the battery cover on the casing once again and slide or press the batteries into place. Like you did when setting up your charger, double-check that they’re oriented correctly. If you accidentally reverse their positions, your vape pen may not work when you turn it back on. A flashing indicator light on a freshly-charged vape pen usually points to a connectivity issue. Try removing the batteries and putting them back in, making sure they're correctly oriented and seated securely."

      "title": "Check the charge level of your batteries periodically.",
      "content": "Check the charge level of your batteries periodically. If you’re not sure whether or not your batteries are in need of a charge, simply pop them out, stick them in your external charger, and take a look at their current percentage. You can then either reload them or let them sit for a while to top them off. If your charger doesn’t have an LCD display screen, it might simply light up to indicate that the batteries are charging. If possible, keep them hooked up until they reach full power."

      "title": "Replace your batteries when their performance begins to suffer.",
      "content": "Replace your batteries when their performance begins to suffer. The majority of 18650 batteries are built to last for 300-500 cycles, or around 1-2 years of regular charging for most people. If your batteries start taking longer than normal to charge (anywhere over 4 hours is a bad sign), the best thing to do is get rid of them and purchase a new set. [7] X Research source Many vape shops keep 18650 batteries in stock. If you don’t have any luck finding them there, try ordering them from an online vape supply vendor to ensure that you get the kind you need. Pick up one or more extra batteries to keep with you. That way, you’ll have a spare on hand when you’re charging the others, or if your vape pen begins to die while you’re out and about. Instead of throwing your spent batteries in the trash, where they can leak corrosive acid, take them to a battery recycling center to have them disposed of safely and reduce the amount of harmful waste in the environment."
