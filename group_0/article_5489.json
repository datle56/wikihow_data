      "content": "Find the midpoint of one side of the triangle. To find the midpoint, measure the side, and divide the length in half. Label the midpoint A. For example, if one side of the triangle is 10 cm long, the midpoint will be at 5 cm, since 10 / 2 = 5 {\\displaystyle 10/2=5} ."

[1] X Research source For example, if the side of the triangle is 12 cm long, the midpoint will be at 6 cm, since 12 / 2 = 6 {\\displaystyle 12/2=6} ."

      "title": "Draw a line from the midpoint of each side to its opposite vertex.",
      "content": "Draw a line from the midpoint of each side to its opposite vertex. These two lines are the median of each side. [2] X Research source A vertex is the point at which two sides of a triangle meet."

    {
      "title": "Draw a point where the two medians intersect.",
      "content": "Draw a point where the two medians intersect. This point is the triangle's center of gravity, also called the centroid, or center of mass. [3] X Research source The center of gravity is where the three medians intersect, but since the medians only intersect in one point, you can use a shortcut and find the center of gravity by only finding the intersection of two medians."

      "title": "Divide the length of the median into thirds.",
      "content": "Divide the length of the median into thirds. To do this, divide the length by three. Again, make an exact calculation. If you round, you will not find the center of gravity. For example, if your median is 3.6 cm long, you would divide 3.6 by 3: 3.6 c m / 3 = 1.2 c m {\\displaystyle 3.6cm/3=1.2cm} , so ⅓ of the median is 1.2 cm."

      "content": "Mark a point on the median ⅓ from the midpoint. This point is the triangle's centroid, which will always divide a median into a 2:1 ratio; that is, the centroid is ⅓ the median's distance from the midpoint, and ⅔ the median's distance from the vertex. [4] X Research source For example, on a median that is 3.6 cm long, the centroid will be 1.2 cm up from the midpoint."

The coordinates may already be given, or you may have a triangle drawn on a graph without the coordinates labeled. Remember that coordinates should be listed ( x , y ) {\\displaystyle (x,y)} . [5] X Research source For example, you might be given triangle PQR, and you need to find and label point P (3, 5), point Q (4, 1), and R (1, 0)."
