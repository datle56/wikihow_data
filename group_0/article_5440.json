You won't be using this value right away, but it will determine which pumps and pipes you consider.

      "content": "Measure the height the water needs to travel. This is the vertical distance from the top of the water table (or the top of the water level in the first tank) to the final destination of the water. Ignore any horizontal distance. If the water level changes over time, use the maximum expected distance. This is the \"pumping lift\" your pump will need to generate. Example: When the gardener's water tank is nearly empty (the lowest expected level), its water level is 50 feet below the area of the garden that needs watering."

      "title": "Estimate friction losses from the pipe.",
      "content": "Estimate friction losses from the pipe. Besides the minimum pressure needed to move water a certain distance, your pump also needs to overcome the force of friction as the water moves through the pipe. The amount of friction depends on the pipe's material, internal diameter, and length, as well as the type of bends and fittings you use. Look up these values on a pipe friction loss chart such as this one . Multiply the total length of your pipe by the friction loss figure to find the total friction loss per feet of head (meaning the number of feet you \"lose\" from your pumping lift because of friction). [2] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source These charts often include an estimate of water velocity as well, based on flow rate and the pipes you use. It's best to keep velocity below 5 ft / s to prevent \"water hammer,\" the repeated knocking vibration that can damage your equipment. Example: The gardener decides to use 1\" diameter plastic pipes, and needs 75 ft of pipe total (including horizontal lengths). A pipe friction loss chart tells him that 1\" plastic pipes cause a loss of 6.3 ft of head for every 100 ft of pipe length. 75 f t ∗ 6.3 f t h e a d 100 f t = 4.7 f t h e a d {\\displaystyle 75ft*{\\frac {6.3ft_{head}}{100ft}}=4.7ft_{head}} He also looks up the friction loss from each fitting in the pipe. For 1\" plastic, one 90º elbow connector and three threaded fittings contribute a total loss of 15 ft. Adding this all together, the total friction loss is 4.7 + 15 = 19.7 ft., or about 20 ft ."

If you are pumping a different fluid, look up its \"specific gravity\" online or in an engineering reference table . Fluids with a higher specific density are denser, and require more horsepower to push through the pipe. [4] X Research source Example: Since the gardener is pumping water, he doesn't need to look anything up. Water's specific gravity is equal to 1."

Enter all the values you found into this formula to find the water horsepower for your project. [5] X Research source Example: The garden pump needs to overcome a TDH of 70 ft and produce a flow rate Q of 10 gpm. Since it is pumping water, the SG is equal to 1. Water horsepower = T D H ∗ Q ∗ S G 3960 = 70 ∗ 10 ∗ 1 3960 = {\\displaystyle {\\frac {TDH*Q*SG}{3960}}={\\frac {70*10*1}{3960}}=} ~ 0.18 horsepower ."

      "content": "Divide horsepower by pump efficiency. Now you know how much horsepower you need to supply to run your pump. However, no mechanical device is 100% efficient at transferring power. Once you have chosen a pump, check the manufacturer's info for the pump's efficiency and write it as a decimal. Divide the water horsepower by this value to find the actual horsepower of the motor you need for your pump. [6] X Research source Most modern pumps are between 50% and 85% efficient when used as intended. [7] X Research source If you cannot find an efficiency rating for your pump, you can assume the actual motor horsepower needed falls between W a t e r H P 0.5 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {WaterHP}{0.5}}} and W a t e r H P 0.85 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {WaterHP}{0.85}}} Example: To do 0.18 horsepower of work, a pump with a 50% (or 0.5) efficiency rating would actually require 0.18 0.5 = {\\displaystyle {\\frac {0.18}{0.5}}=} a 0.36 hp motor."

The water level in the tank will also equal the water level in the pipe, so this is the level the pump is currently drawing from. Read the indicator on your reservoir to find this. If you are pumping from a well, either measure the depth directly or look for an estimate of water table levels in your area (at this time of year). Government agencies such as the USGS can often provide this information."

The water horsepower of the pump is roughly equal to H ∗ Q ∗ S G 3960 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {H*Q*SG}{3960}}} , where H is the vertical distance the water travels in feet, Q is the flow rate in gallons per minute, and SG is the specific gravity of the fluid.

In reality, you are likely using more power than this on your pump. Your pump is also overcoming the force of friction in the pipes, and some power is wasted due to the inefficiency of the motor. You can double this result for a rough estimate of power consumption, or track the actual amount of fuel or electricity your motor uses, or refer to the full calculations above ."
