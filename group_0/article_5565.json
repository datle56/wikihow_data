To place an international phone call, you will need to dial your country’s exit code--the number that tells your phone service that you will be calling outside the country. In the United States, Canada, and many other countries, you'd dial 011. In other countries, you'd dial 00. For a full list of international exit codes, visit https://www.howtocallabroad.com/codes.html and look at the \"Int'l prefix\" column. If you are calling Japan from a cell phone, dial a + instead of 011. The + is shared with the 0 key on your cell phone's dial pad. You can also search the web for “[name of your country] exit code.”"
