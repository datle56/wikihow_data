Vinegar contains acetic acid, which is an effective all-natural cleaner that can be used on all kinds of different surfaces around the home. Vinegar that contains 5% acetic acid, like white vinegar, can kill germs and remove soap scum and mineral deposits on surfaces.

      "content": "Acidic cleaners like vinegar can damage cement and natural stone. Cement and natural stone tiles are beautiful, but they’re also more delicate. Vinegar and other acidic cleaners can stain them, etch the surface, and end up ruining their appearance, so steer clear of vinegar when you’re cleaning them. This goes for all tiles made from cement or natural stone, including quartz, travertine, granite, marble, limestone, and slate tiles. [3] X Research source Use a pH-neutral cleanser, like dish soap, to clean cement and natural stone tiles without damaging them."

      "content": "Most experts recommend diluting vinegar before cleaning with it. Vinegar diluted with water will be less harsh on surfaces. Mix vinegar with an equal amount of water whenever you’re using it to clean surfaces around your home, including tile. Dilute the vinegar in a spray bottle for cleaning small areas of tile, like the tile in your shower, or in a bucket if you’re cleaning tile floors.

[7] X Research source The best way to avoid that is to use a soft, gentle cleaning tool, like a non-scratch scrub pad. [8] X Research source You can also use a clean cloth or chamois mop (a mop works great when you’re cleaning tile floors).

Dirt and debris can actually scratch tile floors, so you don’t want to be scrubbing any particles into the tiles as you’re cleaning them with vinegar. [10] X Research source The best way to avoid that is to give your tile floors a good sweeping before you clean them. [11] X Research source Once your floors are cleared off, you’re ready to go in with the vinegar. A vacuum will work too, but make sure it has a soft-bristle attachment so it doesn’t scratch the floors. [12] X Research source"

Then, wipe the vinegar away from top to bottom in an S-pattern. [13] X Research source If you’re cleaning tile floors, use a clean cloth or chamois mop to work the vinegar mixture into the tiles. Then, immediately use a dry, lint-free cloth to wipe up all of the vinegar. [14] X Research source Clean your tiles once every 1-2 weeks to keep them looking their best. [15] X Research source"
