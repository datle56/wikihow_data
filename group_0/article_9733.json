So, for midnight hour, add 12 and the signifier “AM” to convert to 12-hour time. This means that, for example, 00:13 in 24-hour time would be 12:13 AM in 12-hour time. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Include the signifier “AM” for times between 1:00 and 11:59. Since 24-hour times moves from 00:00 (midnight) to 1:00, all you have to do is add “AM” to the time from 1:00 up until 11:59. You can also eliminate any leading zeroes. For instance, 06:28 in 24-hour time is equivalent to 6:28 AM in 12-hour time. This means that: [3] X Research source 01:00 = 1:00 AM 02:00 = 2:00 AM 03:00 = 3:00 AM 04:00 = 4:00 AM 05:00 = 5:00 AM 06:00 = 6:00 AM 07:00 = 7:00 AM 08:00 = 8:00 AM 09:00 = 9:00 AM 10:00 = 10:00 AM 11:00 = 11:00 AM"

      "content": "Add the signifier “PM” for 12:00 to 12:59. For the noon hour, simply add “PM” to the end of the 24-hour time to make it 12-hour time. So, for example, 12:45 would become 12:45 PM. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Subtract 12 from 13:00 to 23:59 and include “PM.” For the hours after noon, subtract 12 hours from the 24-hour time. Then add “PM” at the end. For instance, to convert 14:36 to 12-hour time, subtract 12, which is 2:36, then add “PM.” There’s no need to include a leading zero for single-digit numbers in 12-hour time. Therefore: [5] X Research source 13:00 = 1:00 PM 14:00 = 2:00 PM 15:00 = 3:00 PM 16:00 = 4:00 PM 17:00 = 5:00 PM 18:00 = 6:00 PM 19:00 = 7:00 PM 20:00 = 8:00 PM 21:00 = 9:00 PM 22:00 = 10:00 PM 23:00 = 11:00 PM"

That means all you need to do is record the minutes. For example, 12:30 AM becomes 00:30. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Eliminate “AM” for the hours between 1:00 and 11:59 AM. Changing the hours between midnight and noon from 12-hour time to 24-hour time is super simple. All you have to do is take away the “AM” signifier. If the hour number is a single digit, add a leading zero. So, for example, 6:00 AM is 06:00 and 10:15 AM is 10:15. Therefore: [7] X Research source 1:00 AM = 01:00 2:00 AM = 02:00 3:00 AM = 03:00 4:00 AM = 04:00 5:00 AM = 05:00 6:00 AM = 06:00 7:00 AM = 07:00 8:00 AM = 08:00 9:00 AM = 09:00 10:00 AM = 10:00 11:00 AM = 11:00"

Therefore: [9] X Research source 1:00 PM = 13:00 2:00 PM = 14:00 3:00 PM = 15:00 4:00 PM = 16:00 5:00 PM = 17:00 6:00 PM = 18:00 7:00 PM = 19:00 8:00 PM = 20:00 9:00 PM = 21:00 10:00 PM = 22:00 11:00 PM = 23:00"
