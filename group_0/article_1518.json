      "title": "What are nail foils?",
      "content": "What are nail foils? There are 2 main types of nail foils: the foils that come in a sheet and the foils that come in a pot. Sheet foils typically cover your whole nail, while pot foils can be placed with tweezers in specific spots on your nails. The products that you use are virtually the same, but the application method is slightly different. [1] X Research source There are also stamped foils, which is foil that looks like an image, and foil strips, which look like decoupage. Kitchen foil is not the same thing as nail foil. You can find nail foil at most drug stores or beauty supply stores, and they come in a variety of fun colors and patterns."

      "title": "What should I use—glue, no glue, or gel?",
      "content": "What should I use—glue, no glue, or gel? The main difference is how much coverage you want your nail foil to give you. If you don’t use any glue at all, the foil will still stick to your nails, but it might be slightly spottier. If you use glue, you can get closer to full coverage, but still not a totally covered nail. If you use gel, you can cover your entire nail in foils if you’d like to. Plus, gel nail foil goes on a little smoother. [2] X Research source Nail foil glue is different from typical nail glue. It’s thinner and slightly less tacky, so it dries faster. You can find nail foil glue at most drug stores or beauty supply stores."

      "title": "How do I prepare my nails for nail foils?",
      "content": "How do I prepare my nails for nail foils? Remove all of your old polish with nail polish remover, then push back your cuticles. Apply a clear base coat and wait for it to dry, then pick out a nail polish that matches the color of the foil you’ll be using. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Do I need to apply a top coat to seal my nails?",
      "content": "Do I need to apply a top coat to seal my nails? Yes, a top coat is very important—without it, your nail foils might not stay on. You can use a regular clear nail polish top coat, or you can go for a gel one for longer lasting coverage. Whichever top coat you choose, it’s important to swipe it over the edges of your nails, too. That way, the foil won’t peel up at the edges. [4] X Research source Shellac top coat is the same as a gel top coat, they’re just different names."

    {
      "title": "How long do nail foils last?",
      "content": "How long do nail foils last? Typically, only a few days. Since nail foils are so thin, they tend to peel off your fingers after only a few days. Professionals generally recommend that you save nail foils for special events or photo shoots so you can get the most out of your nails while they last. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "How do I remove nail foils?",
      "content": "How do I remove nail foils? Soak your nails in pure acetone, and the foils will come right off. Removing nail foils is pretty much exactly like removing nail polish, so there’s no special procedure. They’ll slide right off your nails, and you can get ready for your next nail polish look!

      "title": "What challenges do nail foils present?",
      "content": "What challenges do nail foils present? Nail foils can sometimes have a steep learning curve, and you may need to do some trial and error before getting them right. Make sure you place your foils precisely on each nail to avoid any crinkling or tearing of the sheet. With most foil, less is more—overdoing it can make your foil flake off faster.

      "content": "Apply your base coat of polish and let it dry. You can pick any nail polish color you’d like—even a clear coat will do! Apply it all over your nails, then let it dry completely. If you have a UV nail dryer, use that to speed up the drying process. [8] X Research source If you don’t have a nail dryer, that’s fine, too. Try using fast-drying nail polish to make your application a little faster. If you use a gel polish, use rubbing alcohol to take off the top sticky layer of your polish. Otherwise, the nail adhesive won’t work."

When you pick it up, some of the foil will adhere to your nail, and you can add more or move onto the next nail. [10] X Research source In general, nail foil in a sheet will provide almost full coverage, but not quite."

Go slowly, and don’t be afraid to move the foil around until it looks perfect. Once you’re satisfied with one nail, you can move onto the next nail.

[13] X Research source Using clear polish is a great way to make your nail foils stand out. Black nail polish is also a great neutral option, and it makes bright colors pop!"

If you’d like a full coverage look, pick up a bottle of nail glue or nail gel.
