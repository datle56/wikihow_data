    {
      "title": "Find a new hobby.",
      "content": "Find a new hobby. Keep yourself occupied. You don’t want your life to revolve around your friendship with him.

      "content": "Enjoy sports. It’s fairly obvious that boys enjoy watching and playing sports. You don’t necessarily have to enjoy the same teams or sports as he does. Enjoying your own team or sport would also be interesting to him. Guys enjoy arguing over their favourite players or watching a game together.

      "content": "Avoid applying pressure. Studies show that both girls and boys get teased by peers to turn a platonic friendship into a romantic relationship. Don’t feel obligated to do something you’re uncomfortable doing. Be open with your friends and let them know that their teasing and pressure is hurtful.

      "content": "Hide your true emotions. If he tells you about his latest crush or what’s going on in his relationship, be supportive. You are a friend first and foremost.

[8] X Research source For example, if he talks about his crush, don't start dissing her or talking smack about her. This won't out you into a good light."

      "content": "Prepare for awkwardness. A lot of TV shows and movies portray romance between friends as being an embarrassing mistake or an awkward situation.

      "title": "Go out in groups.",
      "content": "Go out in groups. You don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. People may ask if you’re a couple when they see you alone together. Limit the time you spend alone in public together.

      "content": "Avoid affection. Don’t give in to temptation and give him a hug or rest your head on his shoulder. If you get too touchy-feely you may give yourself away. Don’t blur the lines between boyfriend and friend. Wait until you’re ready and sure of yourself or you may make him defensive. For example, don't try to make-out with him before you know how he feels about you. Even if he does like you back, you have to make sure that he is comfortable with it."

      "title": "Don’t ask or give dating advice.",
      "content": "Don’t ask or give dating advice. Boys don’t talk about the details of their romantic lives the way girls do so don’t expect him to open up. Don’t talk about your own romantic relationship because if he does have feelings for you, he will become confused. Keep the conversations platonic. If you tell him about your romantic life he may think that you only see him as a friend. If he’s seeing someone you may automatically judge her and bad-mouth her. Don’t deny him a chance at romance. Don’t make him choose between her or you."

      "title": "Avoid acting like his girlfriend if you’re not.",
      "content": "Avoid acting like his girlfriend if you’re not. Avoid doting on him or flirting, especially if you guys are not officially a couple. Let him know when he’s being a jerk or acting inappropriately. Compliment him when he’s being a friend and scold him when he’s not. Acting like you are his girlfriend may also annoy him. He may see you as clingy and possessive, and he may try to avoid you as a result. Even if he flirts back with you, don't make assumptions.

      "content": "Avoid comparison. Don’t compare yourself to another girl that he likes or his current girlfriend. This will lead to a lot of anxiety and frustration. Don’t act like a jealous girlfriend when you are only friends. Don’t change who you are because you think that will win him over. You can’t make him fall in love with you. Save your dignity and be yourself."

    {
      "title": "Never assume.",
      "content": "Never assume. Don’t try to convince yourself of something that isn’t there. He may tell you that he loves you but only as a friend. He may also say that he can see himself with you but only as a remote possibility and not at this second. Save yourself from embarrassment. If he already has ambiguous relationships than he may “want to have his cake and eat it too”. Be certain that he doesn’t have another romantic interest or a serious girlfriend."

      "title": "Make sure you both know what you want.",
      "content": "Make sure you both know what you want. What may seem obvious to you may seem vague and confusing to him. You need to have a crystal clear idea of your friendship and whether romance is the next logical step. It’s okay if you discover that this isn’t a good idea. You don’t want to lose a friendship by trying to force a relationship."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tell him how you feel.",
      "content": "Tell him how you feel. If you don’t want him to think of you as one of the boys or just a temporary fling, let him know how you feel. Be direct and completely honest. Open communication is key. Be honest because any type of relationship that you want to preserve won’t last if the truth is ever found out. Being honest with yourself can also help you manage expectations."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tell him if you’re going to pursue someone else.",
      "content": "Tell him if you’re going to pursue someone else. You can’t protect his feelings or your own. Letting him know that you have a romantic life might get him to clue about his feelings for you. Don’t be vague and don’t allow him to be vague about any intimate encounters.

    {
      "title": "Be honest.",
      "content": "Be honest. Laugh it off if he doesn’t return your feelings. The longer you hold in your feelings, the harder it will be to continue being a true friend.

      "content": "Prepare for the aftermath. If you plan to cross from friendship into something more, anticipate the possibilities. Depending on the dynamics of your friendship, you may receive a variety of possible reactions. He may feel flattered, embarrassed, angry, or amused. [16] X Research source Again, respect his answer. If he is angry, then this is probably a sign that a friendship would not have worked out. If he is flattered or amused, this is not a bad sign--give him time to process the information and don't pressure him to return your feelings."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be patient.",
      "content": "Be patient. If you put yourself out there and are initially rejected, let time take its course. If he is a true friend he will support you, listen to what you have to say, and have your best interest in mind. He won’t hurt you and if he does, you’ve dodged a bullet because he wasn’t worth being your boyfriend or having you as a friend. If he rejects you, you may have to back off for a while and give him some space. Continue being his friend, but don't try to be his girlfriend, especially if he doesn't want it."
