      "content": "Keep in mind most people are neither fully extroverted or fully introverted. Famed psychologist Carl Jung, who coined the terms “extroverted” and “introverted”, argues there is no such thing as a complete extrovert or a complete introvert. In fact, most people have a mix of extroverted and introverted tendencies, but tend to fall more on one side of the continuum."

Generally, the people most likely to display all the qualities of emotional, mental, physical and spiritual well-being are those who have a well-rounded balance between the introverted and extroverted sides of their personality. [3] X Research source For instance, if we prefer a life of solitude and are aware of our introverted nature, taking some new risks and adventures that involves interaction with groups of people could enrich our lives in a different and interesting way. Similarly for extroverts, if we are \"the life of the party,\" we may also benefit from adding a \"time-out\" to our lives, such as a time for reflection, a daily walk around the neighborhood or perhaps committing to reading a book 15 minutes a day."

      "content": "Keep a journal. While extroverts are primarily concerned with what's going on outside themselves, introverts are often preoccupied with their inner world. One way to shift focus is by keeping a journal; commit to a daily writing practice. [4] X Research source Ask yourself questions like: What did I feel? Why? What did I learn today? Who did I learn from? What ideas arrived? Who did I think about today? How was today different than yesterday? Than last week? Than last year? What can I be grateful for? Who in my world seems lonely? Why?"

The more you observe outside you, the more you take notice and the more connections you can make from concepts that may not naturally fit together. When you're by yourself, what do you notice? What impressions does the world make on you? Creativity could be seen as 'self-absorbed', but a tremendous external focus is involved.

Think of learning how to embrace solitude similar to starting a new sport, one that you're not already naturally talented in. At first it's awkward and repetitive, but once you get the hang of it, you'll start having fun. Keep in mind that introversion is not a mountain waiting to be climbed. In fact, most introverts use 'alone time' to recharge themselves. Alone time can be a good way to replenish after giving a lot of energy to a highly social situation or to someone that is also extroverted. [9] X Research source"
