After you finish the mission “Seeking the Remaining Plates,” the Celestica Flute will transform into an Azure Flute, and you’ll unlock mission #27, “The Deified Pokémon.” [1] X Research source To complete this mission, catch every Pokémon in the game (you don’t need to have Shaymin, Phione, Manaphy, or Darkrai). Talk to Professor Laventon to turn in the mission. Travel to the Coronet Highlands, then climb Mt. Coronet and visit the Temple of Sinnoh. Defeat Arceus to obtain an Arceus fragment that you can use in battle. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Trade for Arceus if possible.",
      "content": "Trade for Arceus if possible. Arceus is an Event Pokémon, meaning that it could only be acquired legitimately through special events held by Nintendo. The last Arceus event was in 2010 and there are no more planned, meaning the only way to get one in Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum without cheating is to trade with someone who got one from the event. Arceus is an incredibly rare Pokémon, so you'll likely only be able to trade for one if you have an equally rare Pokémon to offer in return. Event Legendaries such as Landorus and Deoxys are good choices. If you have a Shiny Legendary such as a Shiny Mew or Shiny Rayquaza, this will also be good for trading."

      "content": "Transfer Arceus from another version. This can be done by trading Pokémon to yourself or by downloading 3DS software like Pokémon Bank , which allows you to perform transfers with a single system. The steps for transferring Pokémon will vary depending on which versions you are transferring to/from. Since Arceus is not available in earlier versions, you will at least be transferring from Generation 4. You can trade an Arceus from Diamond, Platinum, Pearl, HeartGold, or SoulSilver using Poké Transfer, as well as from any of the Black or White games as a regular trade. In order to get an Arceus from an older version of the Pokémon to X or Y, it will need to first be transferred to Black, White, Black 2, or White 2. You can then use Poké Transporter and Pokémon Bank to transfer Arceus into X or Y."
