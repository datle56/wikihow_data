[1] X Research source For larger parties, you might even hold a contest and have the other partygoers vote on their favorite costumes. Offer prizes for different categories, such as “overall best,” \"scariest,\" \"funniest,\" and “most clever idea.” [2] X Research source Keep in mind that not everyone likes playing dress up, and that’s okay. If you have guests who would prefer not to wear costumes, don’t try to force them to."

Holiday-appropriate hits like Boris Pickett’s “Monster Mash” and “Riboflavin-Flavored, Non-Carbonated, Polyunsaturated Blood” by Don Hinson and the Rigamorticians have been giving partygoers goosebumps for decades. For a more contemporary twist, you can also queue up some pop favorites like Michael Jackson’s “Thriller,” The Cranberries’ “Zombie,” and “Howlin’ for You” by The Black Keys. [3] X Research source Other popular additions to hip Halloween playlists include “Werewolves of London” by Warren Zevon, “Psycho Killer” by Talking Heads, “Disturbia” by Rihanna, and “Sympathy for the Devil” by The Rolling Stones. Pad your playlist with the theme songs from iconic horror movie franchises like “Halloween” and “Friday the 13th.”"

      "content": "Mix up some putrid Halloween punch. Start with a blend of fizzy soda pop and tangy fruit juices—you’ll find lots of simple and tasty recipes online. Once you’ve got your punch tasting the way you want, add a few drops of food coloring to make it resemble blood, yucky green slime, or bubbling purple witches’ brew. [4] X Research source To make a simple yet satisfying Halloween punch, combine 2 litres (68 fl oz) of ginger ale with 4 cups (950 mL) of pineapple juice, 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, and a few scoops of lime sherbet. Serve your punch in a plastic cauldron on top of a block of dry ice for added \"witchiness\"! [5] X Research source For a more gruesome touch, create edible \"eyeballs\" by stuffing blueberries into larger lychee berries and plop them into your punch so they stare back at your guests from the surface. [6] X Research source If you're planning on serving alcohol at your party, consider whipping up a second bowl of punch that you can spike with your favorite liquor. Label your punches to indicate which is which, and keep your alcoholic concoctions off-limits to underage guests."

Set out trays piled high with tantalizing sweets like cookies, cupcakes, and chocolates, or keep it simple with a few baskets of candy. If you have a knack for food decoration, this can be a great opportunity to conduct mad science experiments on your own Halloween-themed confections, such as candy apple skulls, vampire fang cookies, and layered candy corn parfaits. [7] X Research source Don’t forget to also provide a few nutritious snacks, like a veggie tray or some homemade granola bars, for your more health-conscious guests. Label the various items you put out and list their major ingredients (like the kind of nuts you used to make your brownies) in case any of your guests have food allergies or sensitivities."

Fill a large bucket or wash tub with water, dump in a few apples, and challenge your guests to try to pluck them out using only their mouths. Win or lose, you can bet that there will be no shortage of laughs. [8] X Research source If apples aren’t your thing, you can bob for other items, too, such as pears, marshmallows, or plastic-wrapped candies. Just about any small food or beverage item will work, so long as it floats and won't disintegrate in water. [9] X Research source Bobbing for apples is good, clean fun, making it a perfect activity for parties with kids and younger guests in attendance."

[10] X Research source Only show movies that are appropriate for the average age of your guests. The last thing you want to do is give some poor child nightmares! If you're looking for some kid-friendly titles, try Beetlejuice , The Addams Family , Hocus Pocus , Casper the Friendly Ghost , Frankenweenie , or Hotel Transylvania . If there’s going to be alcohol at your party, start a drinking game for of-age guests who want to play along with the movies you’re watching. For instance, you might take a drink anytime someone screams or a doomed character splits off from the group. [11] X Research source"

Keep 1 or 2 bowls of candy or other treats on hand and take turns passing out handfuls to the boys and ghouls who find their way to your door. Try to guess what your trick-or-treaters are as you portion out their treats. If you’d rather not have to keep running back and forth to the door while you’re entertaining your guests, set out an oversized bowl of candy, along with a note instructing trick-or-treaters to take a single piece for themselves. The kids in your neighborhood will be thankful that you did! [12] X Research source"

Afterwards, use your finished pumpkins to adorn your dining table, porch steps, or window sills. [15] X Research source Have your kids personalize their pumpkins with monsters, animals, or characters from their favorite books, movies, or TV shows.

Scribble criss-crossing red lines onto your construction paper eyeballs using a red pen, marker, or crayon to lend them a bloodshot appearance. Another fast and easy option is to use giant stick-on googly eyes, which you can buy online or at most major arts and crafts stores. [18] X Research source"

Be sure to bring along a bucket or bag big enough to lug your haul home! [20] X Research source Wear reflective clothing or carry a flashlight to make yourself visible to drivers once it gets dark, and remember to walk, not run. Not everyone enjoys receiving trick-or-treaters on Halloween. If you come to a house that has its lights off, it’s usually a sign that the person who lives there doesn’t wish to participate."
