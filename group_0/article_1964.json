Some of the common names for forearm tendinitis are tennis elbow and golfer's elbow. You may have forearm tendinitis if you experience any of the following symptoms: [1] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Mild swelling in the area Tenderness with use and when pressing on the tendon Pain that is often described as a dull ache Pain that occurs more often when moving the affected limb"

      "content": "Consider whether you may have golfer’s elbow. The medical term for golfer’s elbow is medial epicondylitis. The pain associated with golfer’s elbow is on the inside of the elbow due to inflammation in the flexor muscles, the muscles that allow your elbow to bend. [2] X Research source Placing too much stress on these tendons through repetitive motions will increase your risk of developing this condition. Symptoms of golfer's elbow include: Pain starting at the elbow and radiating out to the lower part of the arm Stiffness in your arm Increased pain when you bend and flex your wrist [3] X Research source Pain that is aggravated by certain motions, such as opening jars and shaking hands [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Determine if you have tennis elbow. Tennis elbow, or lateral epicondylitis, is located on the outer portion of the elbow. The pain starts from repetitive movement which involves the extensor muscles, or those which work to straighten the elbow. [5] X Research source The symptoms of tennis elbow often start with mild discomfort and then graduate to more significant pain over months. There is often no injury or specific incident to which you can attribute the start of the pain. Common symptoms of tennis elbow include: Pain or burning on the outer part of your elbow and down your forearm A weakened grip Worsening of symptoms when you overuse the associated muscles, such as by playing racquet sports, turning a wrench, or shaking hands"

      "title": "Think about whether you are having symptoms in one or both arms.",
      "content": "Think about whether you are having symptoms in one or both arms. With any kind of forearm tendinitis, it is more common for your dominant hand to be affected, but both arms may be affected. Tendinitis will occur in the tendons against which you consistently exert the most force. [6] X Research source Tendinitis may also occur in the tendons that control either extension or flexion (straightening or bending), but it rarely occurs in both at the same time. The repetitive motion that exerts the most stress — either force against flexion or against extension — will cause tendinitis."

[7] X Research source Although tennis elbow is often caused by playing tennis, using a lighter racquet and a two-handed backhand swing may reduce your chances of developing this condition. Some other types of movement that may also cause tennis elbow include: Repetitive heavy lifting or using heavy tools Jobs that involve the use of squeezing and twisting movements or precision motions New or uncommon movements, such as gardening for the first time in the spring, lifting a new baby, or packing and moving your home"

Although named after the sport of golf, golfer’s elbow can also be caused by other sports that involve gripping and/or throwing motions, such as baseball, football, archery, or javelin throwing. [8] X Research source Some other types of movement that may cause golfer’s elbow include: Doing jobs that involve repetitive motion of the elbow, including computer use, gardening, chopping or painting Using vibrating tools Using a racquet that is too small or heavy for your ability or putting excessive topspin on the ball Participating in other repetitive activities for an hour or more on consecutive days, such as weight lifting, cooking, hammering, raking, or chopping wood [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Get treated right away. Although it is not life threatening, forearm tendinitis can restrict your movement and activities for weeks or months because of pain and discomfort. Without treatment, tendinitis will also increase your risk of suffering from a tendon rupture. This is a more serious condition that requires surgical repair to restore function to the tendon. [10] X Research source If tendinitis persists for several months, you can experience tendinosis, which has a negative effect on the tendon and causes abnormal new blood vessel growth. Long-term complications of tennis elbow can result in recurrence of the injury, rupture of the tendon and failure to heal with either non-surgical or surgical repair due to a nerve entrapment in the forearm. Long-term complications for chronic golfer’s elbow can lead to chronic pain, limited range of motion and a lasting or fixed contracture (bend) in the elbow.

Early diagnosis and treatment will lead to more successful outcomes for your forearm tendinitis.

Your physician may order x-rays if you were injured before the pain started."

Make sure that you follow your physician’s instructions for treating your forearm and ask any questions that you have about the treatment. Your physician may prescribe an anti-inflammatory medication to help reduce the inflammation in your forearm, reduce pain, and improve arm function. You may need to wear a brace to support the area and reduce any stress on the muscles and tendons. This brace may immobilize the area or just provide support, depending upon the severity of your condition. Your doctor may inject corticosteroids around the tendon to reduce inflammation and pain; however, if the condition lasts more than 3 months, repeated injections may weaken the tendon and increase the risk of tendon rupture.

Platelet rich plasma therapy treatments involve taking your blood, spinning it to separate the platelets and re-injecting those platelets into the tendon area. [14] X Research source Although this treatment is still being researched, it has been beneficial in the treatment of some chronic tendon conditions. Talk to your doctor to find out if this treatment is a good option for you."

In physical therapy, you will learn how to do forearm stretches designed to reduce any tightness in your muscles. Knowing how to reduce this tightness is important because it contributes to the micro-tearing associated with tendonitis. [15] X Research source Occupations and recreational activities that require a lot of gripping, force placed against extensor or flexor muscles or repetitive hand or wrist motions can develop tight muscles that contribute to tendinitis. Your physical therapist may recommend deep friction massage to trigger the release of natural stimulants that may help to heal the tendon.

Although you should see your doctor for a diagnosis and treatment of your tendinitis, there are some home remedies that may help to alleviate minor pain from tendinitis.
