Be careful not to overload the washing machine. Laundry that is packed in too tightly will not rotate as freely, and the agitator will not be able to clean it as well. [1] X Research source"

If this is the case, use the hottest setting recommended on the care label."

      "content": "Use the associated cap to measure the right amount of detergent. If your washing machine has a detergent dispenser, pour the detergent to the “max-fill” line. If your machine does not have a dispenser, add the detergent directly to the hot water as it fills the machine. Most laundry detergent bottles have a cap that functions as a measuring device. Read the label on the detergent bottle to know exactly know much detergent you need for the size of the load. It’s important to use the right amount of laundry detergent. Too much detergent will cushion the load and decrease cleansing performance, while using too little will keep the towels from being fully cleaned. [3] X Research source"

If your washing machine has a bleach dispenser, pour 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of undiluted bleach to the “max-fill” line. The machine will automatically release the bleach at the appropriate time.

If the towels are not as white as you would like, repeat the process until you reach your desired result. Skip the fabric softener, as it tends to leave a coating on towels that reduces absorbency and decreases whiteness. [6] X Research source"

If the water does not cover the towels completely, remove the towels and add 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water and 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of bleach to the solution.

Additionally, check the tag on the towels you want to bleach, as some towels will specifically say not to bleach them. Chlorine bleach is the most popular form of bleach used for cleaning and may be used to bleach white towels as long as it is properly diluted. Use a color-safe bleach containing hydrogen peroxide to bleach colored towels without damaging them. [18] X Research source Since this kind of product might not be readily available, it might be a good idea to take your towels to a professional cleaner. Never apply chlorine bleach directly to towels, as this can cause them irreversible damage."
