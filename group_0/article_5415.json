Alternately, the employer could offer severance at termination even if it was not included in the employment contract. Severance may be paid as a lump sum or in installments. Severance pay also is not “unemployment insurance.” Unemployment benefits are cash payments based on a percentage of your earnings. Each state sets a maximum amount. The insurance is paid for by your employer. For tips on calculating your unemployment benefit, see Calculate Unemployment."

      "content": "Learn about a waiver and release. Some employers will offer severance to employees in order to limit their exposure to potential lawsuits. While offering severance pay is not itself evidence of an employer’s wrongdoing, some employers will nevertheless offer severance pay if they suspect an employee may sue the company. In order to get the severance pay, the employee must sign a waiver of all legal claims. These waivers release the employer from legal liability and are valid so long as the employee signed it voluntarily and knowingly.

      "title": "Read your employment contract.",
      "content": "Read your employment contract. If you have been laid off, then you should look at your employment contract to see if you are eligible for severance. If so, the contract should state how severance is calculated. Severance is most often calculated according to the length you have been with the company. For example, it is common for hourly-wage employees to be offered one week’s pay for each year that they have been with the company. [5] X Research source If you have worked for a company for five years, then you would get five weeks of pay at your current pay rate. Salaried employees sometimes are offered at least two weeks’ pay for each year that they have been at the company. [6] X Research source Accordingly, you would divide your yearly salary by 52 to get the weekly pay rate. Then, multiply this pay rate by the number of weeks. If you earn $39,000 a year, then you make $750 a week. If you worked for the company for 10 years, then you would get $7,500 in severance."

In fact, few state laws require an employer to do so. [7] X Trustworthy Source Workplace Fairness Nonprofit organization focused on public education and advocacy on issues related to employment and labor law Go to source You should read your employment contract to see what rules govern cashing out this time. If you can’t find any rule, then ask your employer if you will be paid for this time."

      "content": "Negotiate for severance pay. If your contract does not have any clause pertaining to severance, then you can try to negotiate for it. You should think over any initial deal offered by your employer without immediately accepting it. If you are over 40, then federal law allows you 21 days to consider a severance package. [8] X Research source To counteroffer, you should come up with a reason why you need more money. Career coaches advise that you can mention the fact that you just bought a new house or have other recent, large expenses. [9] X Research source An employer may be sufficiently motivated to get you to sign a waiver and release that they will increase the amount of severance just to get you to sign. If you have an illness in the family, then ask for extended health benefits. You could get an additional six months before having to go on COBRA. [10] X Research source"
