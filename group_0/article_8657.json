      "title": "Activate your selenite with the intention of cleansing other crystals.",
      "content": "Activate your selenite with the intention of cleansing other crystals. First, make sure your selenite is cleansed and charged by laying it in natural light (30 minutes for sunlight, overnight for moonlight). Then, hold the stone and meditate on your connection to it to tune it to you. Once you feel connected, meditate on or speak out loud your intention to cleanse other stones with it. [1] X Research source Try to sum up your intention in just one sentence. If you find yourself rambling, it means your intention is not super focused or specific. Intentions or affirmations might be something like “I cleanse you so that you may cleanse my other crystals” or “I will use you to heal my spirit.” Cleansing your selenite first clears any leftover energy or influence from previous owners."

      "title": "Rest crystals with flat faces on a large piece of selenite for 24 hours.",
      "content": "Rest crystals with flat faces on a large piece of selenite for 24 hours. Selenite will draw negative energy out of other crystals when they come into physical contact. Simply lay your crystals on top of a large piece of selenite and let them rest. The selenite doesn’t have to be a specific size, shape, or even be flat—as long as it’s bigger than the crystals it’s cleansing, it’ll work. [2] X Research source Selenite slabs or charging plates have large, flat surfaces so you can rest other crystals on top of them easily. [3] X Research source This works best for faceted crystals that won't roll off of the slab and potentially break. Do this ritual indoors. Too much exposure to sunlight or any exposure to water or rain will damage your selenite."

      "content": "Place fragile, small, or rounded crystals and jewelry in a selenite bowl. Selenite bowls make beautiful decorations as well as potent crystal cleaners. Simply put any gems or jewelry you want to cleanse in the bowl and let them rest for a few hours. Your crystals enjoy the healing energy of selenite, so you can even use the bowl as permanent storage for them. [4] X Research source A bowl ensures rounded crystals and gems won’t roll away like they might on a slab or charging plate. Alternatively, wrap jewelry like bracelets and necklaces around selenite sticks or wands, or place your jewelry on top of any piece of selenite you have. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a selenite tower to cleanse many crystals at once.",
      "content": "Use a selenite tower to cleanse many crystals at once. First, move your tower to a space where you won’t mind having a bunch of crystals laying around for a while. Arrange your crystals in a circle around the tower, preferably so they’re touching it. Let the tower and crystals sit in this formation for about 24 hours, or until you sense that the room is clear of negative energy. [6] X Research source The selenite tower can still cleanse the crystals if they aren’t touching, but physical contact makes the process faster and more thorough."

      "title": "Charge selenite with sunlight to give your other crystals a charge, too.",
      "content": "Charge selenite with sunlight to give your other crystals a charge, too. Sunlight has powerful charging energy that can be transferred between crystals. First, charge your selenite by letting it absorb natural sunlight for about 30 minutes. Then bring it inside and place your other crystals on top of it. The selenite will share it’s solar charge with the others in addition to cleansing them. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Lay selenite in sunlight for 30 minutes for a quick cleanse and charge.",
      "content": "Lay selenite in sunlight for 30 minutes for a quick cleanse and charge. Sunlight blasts away stagnant energy and charges crystals with vibrant potential. Lay your selenite bowl, slab, tower, or jewelry on a windowsill or safe spot outdoors to absorb some direct sunlight. Bring it in after about 30 minutes to 1 hour since too much sun can cause the crystal to fade. [8] X Research source Make sure your selenite is in a spot where it won’t easily roll away or get knocked over while it’s charging. It doesn't have to be an especially sunny day to work. Any exposure to natural light is cleansing and refreshing. Cleanse your selenite when you feel its protective and healing energy weakening, it’s absorbed a lot of bad energy at once, or it's your first time using a particular piece of selenite."

      "title": "Let selenite absorb moonlight overnight for a gentle cleanse and charge.",
      "content": "Let selenite absorb moonlight overnight for a gentle cleanse and charge. Moonlight is a pure, cleansing force that’s safe to use on any crystal. Simply rest your selenite in a safe place on a windowsill, patio, or porch that gets lots of moonlight and leave it overnight. In the morning, it will be refreshed and ready to heal at max capacity. [9] X Research source The moon’s cleansing power will be even stronger during a Full Moon. Try leaving your selenite out during dawn or dusk so it can absorb the energies of the sun and moon at the same time. Charging selenite with moonlight is usually considered a less potent and slower way to charge crystals than with sunlight."

      "title": "Smudge selenite in sage smoke to absorb healing energy.",
      "content": "Smudge selenite in sage smoke to absorb healing energy. Sage has been used as a spiritual cleanser for thousands of years. To cleanse with sage , burn one end of a sage stick until it starts smoking, then place it in a ceramic or heat-safe bowl. Grab your selenite and move it through the smoke, or use a feather to waft the smoke around for a few minutes. Imagine all of the stone’s negative energy floating away and dissipating with the smoke. Perform this ritual outdoors if possible. If you’re doing it inside, open up some doors or windows to clear out the smoke. Cleanse with incense, Palo Santo, or any herb that you feel a special connection with in place of sage if you don’t have any."

      "title": "Bathe large selenite pieces or towers in sound waves for 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Bathe large selenite pieces or towers in sound waves for 10 minutes. A drone or chant generates waves that help remove vibrational impurities from your selenite. Sit right near your crystal and make a constant tone with a singing bowl , tuning fork , or bell (you can even sing or chant if you don’t have any of these). Visualize sound waves washing over the selenite and carrying away bad energy. [10] X Research source The exact pitch you make doesn’t matter as long as you have a clear, cleansing intention. Sound waves are great for cleansing large stones that are hard to move or a big collection of many smaller stones all at once."

      "title": "Bury selenite in dry Himalayan or sea salt to absorb bad energy.",
      "content": "Bury selenite in dry Himalayan or sea salt to absorb bad energy. First, place your selenite and salt in a container or bowl, making sure the selenite is completely covered. Then, move the container outside where it can sit in natural light and let it rest for 24 hours (or until you sense that it’s been cleansed). Afterward, gently brush or rub the selenite with your fingers or a soft cloth. Do not rinse it with water, since it will make the selenite dissolve. Try adding cleansing herbs like sage, cedar, or sandalwood to your salt for an extra boost."

      "title": "Cover selenite in uncooked brown rice to harmonize unbalanced energy.",
      "content": "Cover selenite in uncooked brown rice to harmonize unbalanced energy. Brown rice is a safe and easy way to draw negative energy out of a crystal. Fill a bowl or container with rice and your selenite, and make sure the stone is covered completely. Let the bowl sit for up to 24 hours, or until your intuition tells you that the selenite has been refreshed. [11] X Research source Throw out the rice afterwards. It’s full of bad vibes, so you definitely don’t want to cook or eat it!"

      "content": "Selenite can also purify your home and soothe your mind. As a self-cleansing crystal that works nonstop, it’s a common household stone. Its high vibrations bring good luck and protection to your home, plus it purifies and cleanses the air in whichever room you place it. It’s also said to bring peace and tranquility to anybody inside its field of energy. [12] X Research source Place your selenite in a room that will benefit from its healing powers, like your living room or bedroom. Cleanse and charge your selenite so it can continue healing your home, spirit, and crystals to the best of its ability."

      "content": "Selenite has incredible healing properties for your body and spirit. When you wear selenite, impurities (free radicals that damage cells and cause disease) are blocked from entering your body. Common reported physical benefits include better spine alignment, metabolism, and circulation, as well as improved eyesight and stable blood pressure. [13] X Research source Spiritually, selenite is said to fend off hostile or destructive spirits. It’s said to heal and soothe the spirits of anyone who wears it, and can be used to heal others too."

      "content": "Selenite sharpens your intuition and keeps you emotionally unburdened. Selenite is known to balance the Crown Chakra , the violet or white pool of spiritual energy at the top of your head. Sleep with selenite under your pillow to open this chakra, unlock dreams, and find guidance from helpful spirits (and your own instincts). [14] X Research source Highly empathetic people can use selenite’s clearing energy field to stop picking up other people’s emotions as well. Carry or wear a piece during your day to stay light and upbeat."
