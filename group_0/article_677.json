      "content": "Purchase fabric that matches your dress. Once you've chosen a strapless dress to alter, buy at least 1 yard (0.91 m) of fabric that matches the dress. If you're making other adjustments to the dress, such as making a shorter hemline, you might be able to use excess fabric from the dress itself. [1] X Research source If you can't find fabric that matches the dress, choose a fabric that complements the style of your dress. For example, if you have a floral print dress, pick a fabric that's the same color as one of the flowers. Alternatively take fabric from the bottom of the dress to create the strap.

If you want a lot of coverage or will be wearing the dress to a very formal event, consider adding full-length or three-quarter sleeves. If your dress is casual or loose, you might want a capped sleeve or off-the-shoulder sleeve. [5] X Research source If you're unsure what style sleeve to use, check fashion magazines for dresses that are a similar style to yours and see what sleeves they have."

Once you know the style of sleeves you want, you can figure out how wide to make the strap. For example, if you want to make a delicate cap sleeve, you probably want a thin strap that doesn't cover a lot of your shoulder. If you're making an off-the-shoulder sleeve, you'll want a very thin strap, such as a spaghetti strap. [7] X Research source If you're attaching a full sleeve, it's alright to make the straps as wide as you like. Keep in mind that if your straps are over 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide, they'll completely alter the shape of the neckline."

This will give you seam allowance and you can always cut off excess fabric. Use sharp scissors to cut out 2 long strips of fabric according to your measurements. [8] X Research source For example, if your original strap measurement was 14 inches (36 cm), add 4 to get 18 inches (46 cm) for the length."

If you don't have double-sided sewing tape, you can simply pin the sleeve in place. It just might not be as secure. If you can, place your dress on a form or you might need to ask a friend to help you pin the sleeves while you're wearing the dress."
