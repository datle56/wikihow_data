      "content": "Opt for a jacket that’s 1 size larger than your shirt size. This is the general advice for buying a jacket so that it won’t be too tight. Having the jacket a little bigger than your normal size will also help to ensure that you can easily layer it over other items. [1] X Research source [2] X Expert Source Taissha G. LaReau Wardrobe Consultant & Stylist Expert Interview. 31 January 2022. For example, if you normally wear a size medium shirt or sweater, look for size large jackets. Be sure to consider the style of the jacket when deciding what size to get. Some jacket styles are meant to fit closer to your body than others. For example, a sleek leather jacket will look better if it’s somewhat snug, while an oversized puffer jacket will look best if it’s loose. The bigger you go, the easier it is to layer clothing under your jacket. [3] X Expert Source Taissha G. LaReau Wardrobe Consultant & Stylist Expert Interview. 31 January 2022."

Wear or bring a sweater along with you when you go jacket shopping. [4] X Research source You could also try on the jacket over a blazer, vest, or other item that you plan to wear with it."

      "content": "Move around in the jacket while you’re wearing it. Try raising your arms above your head, shrugging your shoulders, and crossing your arms in front of you. Look in a mirror as you do this to see how the jacket looks when you move in these ways and notice how the jacket feels as well. [5] X Research source If it’s difficult to move or if the jacket looks puckered or stretched in these positions, you might want to try on the next size up."

      "content": "Check for a sleeve length that comes to the base of your thumb. Allow your arms to hang loosely at your sides and look at yourself in a mirror to see where the hem of the sleeves fall. The hem should hit right where your thumb and index finger meet so it covers your wrist completely and the bottom 1/4 of your hand. This length will help to ensure that your hands stay warm. [6] X Research source Avoid jackets that have a shorter hemline than this. However, if the sleeve goes past the base of your thumb, you can always have the sleeves tailored to a more comfortable length."

      "content": "Look for jackets no longer than the middle of your thigh if you’re short. If you are petite or short, a long jacket can overwhelm you and make you seem shorter. For a more flattering look, opt for a peacoat or a jacket that ends midway down your thigh. These styles will help to enhance your stature. [7] X Research source Some styles to avoid if you’re petite include long parkas, trench coats, and knee-length jackets."

Note any details about the jacket’s fit that comes up more than once. [9] X Research source For example, if customers who bought the jacket commented that it was tighter than they expected, then you may want to get the next size up. If they commented that the jacket was longer than expected and you’re concerned about length, then you might want to opt for the petite size."

      "content": "Take the required measurements for the jacket’s sizing information. The most common measurements for fitted jackets include the chest and waist, but hip and arm length measurements may also be required for some jackets. After you take your measurements , write them down so you can use them to find the right size jacket. [10] X Research source For example, to get your chest measurement, wrap a tape measure around the widest part of your chest and record the measurement in inches or centimeters (depending on what the manufacturer uses). Measure the narrowest part of your waist in the same way."

      "title": "Purchase a jacket the next size up from your measurements.",
      "content": "Purchase a jacket the next size up from your measurements. You can also do this if you want the jacket to fit you more loosely or if you fall between sizes. However, if the jacket is meant to be fitted, opt for the exact size whenever possible. For example, if you have a chest measurement of 38 in (97 cm) and a waist measurement of 30 in (76 cm), opt for a jacket in this size. If you’re a size large and you want the jacket to fit you loosely, opt for an extra-large instead."
