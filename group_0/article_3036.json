      "content": "Decide if you want to be a free spirit. Before beginning a more free-spirited life, ask yourself a few important questions, including: Is it important for you to always be on a set schedule, or on time for events? Free-spirited individuals are likely to have more flexible schedules. Do you like to plan ahead or be spontaneous? A major aspect of being free spirited is learning to “go with the flow”: accepting things as they come, rather than deciding everything ahead of time. How organized are you? A free-spirited lifestyle will probably mean a less organized life and/or living space. In its place, however, comes the opportunity for excitement and spontaneity. How practical and grounded are you? A free spirit can be just as successful as anyone else, but cultivates imagination, daydreaming, and idealism along the way."

      "content": "Be prepared to be unique. [1] X Research source A free spirit is a non-conformist, who isn’t afraid to think for his or herself, and who follows his or her passions. This can be liberating, but it also takes courage. Think of the books, ideas, people, etc. that you find fascinating or inspiring. You don’t have to think or do things exactly like these models, but think of them as ways for encouraging you to find your own path."

This doesn’t mean that every free spirit has to be a great artist or inventor, just that he or she is able to be expressive, whether through clothing, decorating, speaking, cooking, or any other activity."

      "content": "Give yourself time to be spontaneous. [2] X Research source [3] X Research source Strange as it may sound, you may need to give yourself time to be spontaneous. This is especially true if you have a busy life or are just learning how to be a free-spirited person. If you are having difficulty being spontaneous at first, schedule a few minutes per day, or per week, in which you have nothing planned. Do whatever comes to mind, or nothing at all. Stop to chat with strangers, friends, or coworkers, even if you feel busy. You will enjoy the company, and taking a detour in your day. Be wary of time traps. Some activities, like endlessly surfing television channels you don’t really want to watch, or getting lost in a smartphone, can eat up lots of time that could be spent being spontaneous. Don’t plan every day. Sometimes we want to do this so that we aren’t bored. But if you leave time open, you can discover new things. Try leaving an unplanned weekend, for starters, and use the time to get out of the house and do something you’ve never done before."

      "content": "Open your mind to spontaneity. [4] X Research source A spontaneous and free spirit will look at the world with a child’s eyes, thinking about how much one doesn’t know, exploring whatever seems interesting, and always asking “why?” and “how?” Give yourself the chance to open up and try new things before making judgments about them."

      "content": "Take advantage of opportunities to be spontaneous. There are many ways to learn and experience new things. A free spirit will seek out these opportunities: [5] X Research source Travel to a place you’ve never been before. Try a new type of cuisine. Get up and dance, right now, whether or not there’s any music. Do a routine activity in a different way. Take a different way home for instance, or have your morning coffee on a walk rather than sitting at your breakfast table or in your car. Offer free hugs. Strike up a conversation with a stranger when you’re standing in line at a store—you never know what you might learn, or who you might meet. Take up a new hobby or try to learn a new skill, and don’t be afraid of failing, or of what others will think."

      "content": "Let it go. [6] X Research source A free spirit is not tied to many things beyond his or her ideals, and people he or she cares about. Part of being a free spirited person is learning to let some things go in life before they hold you back or weigh you down. As a free spirit, you can certainly still worry about and fight for things that matter. If something seems to be holding you back rather than helping you achieve your dreams, however, it might be time to let it go."

      "content": "Consider downsizing your home or moving. [7] X Research source A home that is larger or more complex than you need, filled with more material things than you need, costs too much, or is in a location you don’t want to be in can keep you from being a free spirit. You could move into a different or smaller home that is more manageable for your free-spirited lifestyle, such as a tiny house."

      "content": "Be less materialistic. No one can get through life without some material things. However, too many things can weigh you down if you are trying to be a free spirit. Try these techniques: Buying fewer things will decrease clutter and simplify your life. This will also free up finances for things that might matter more to you, such as traveling or spending time with friends. Buy less, but of better things. Having quality things but fewer things overall can help you be less materialistic. Higher-quality clothes, for instance, will last longer than lower-quality ones, and you will need to have fewer of them. Keep in mind that reducing is good for the environment.

      "content": "Decide what to get rid of. [9] X Research source Decluttering your life is one of the first steps you can take toward becoming a more free spirited person. When choosing how to simplify things, consider the following: Think about how often you use particular items. Many experts suggest that if you are trying to declutter, if you haven’t used an item in six months, you should consider getting rid of it. Irreplaceable items of great sentimental value might be an exception. [10] X Research source However, remember that memories are more important than things, and you might not need to keep everything. Photographs, for instance, can be scanned for safekeeping without taking up space, and then discarded. Consider donating items you no longer need to a thrift store, community center, religious organization, or other worthwhile cause. That way, others in need can benefit from the items you can live without."

      "content": "Try some breathing exercises. Getting plenty of oxygen contributes to physical energy and mental alertness. This can give you an overall boost of positivity. Try one of these breathing exercises periodically: [11] X Research source Sit up straight. Put one hand on your belly and the other on your chest. Inhale deeply through your nose. You should feel the hand on your belly raise, but the hand on your chest should not move. Breathe out slowly, with your mouth barely open. Use your hand on your belly to push air out, if you want. Repeat this exercise ten times. Quickly inhale and exhale through your nose (about three breaths a second), keeping your mouth closed. Then breathe normally. Repeat this process for fifteen seconds or more."

      "content": "Practice mindfulness. [12] X Research source Mindfulness is a practice that helps people become more aware of their thoughts and feelings, and of how they relate to the world around them in the present moment. It is like a particular type of meditation that will leave you feeling more self-aware and positive. Since living in the present is key to being a free spirit, this technique can be very helpful. Sit in a comfortable position, whether in a chair, cross-legged, or kneeling. Begin to pay attention to your breathing. Your mind will eventually wander. When you catch your mind wandering, bring your attention back to your own breathing. Don’t stop to dwell on or judge your thoughts. Continue this process for a short time, such as five minutes if you are trying it for the first time. Repeat this practice frequently, at least once a day. As you begin to practice mindfulness mediation regularly, you can gradually increase the length of the sessions, if you desire. Many people engage in mindfulness through prayer or meditation as part of a spiritual practice. A free spirit can absolutely willfully participate in these practices."

      "content": "Let go of mental hang-ups. Everyone has things in life that can weigh them down, from having to deal with ignorant people to worrying about physical flaws. In developing a positive outlook on life, a free-spirited person will also learn to overcome as many of these hang-ups as possible. Remember that flaws, including physical imperfections, are part of what makes each person unique. [13] X Research source Be proud of what makes you unique, and don’t constantly worry about being the same as others. Practice compassion. This includes being as forgiving to yourself as you would be to others. If you are able to accept others for who they are, extend the same compassion to yourself. Practice tolerance. By being tolerant of other people, you will free your mind and emotions. Be ready to accept differences in other people, and always ask yourself how you would feel or think if you were in their place. [14] X Research source"
