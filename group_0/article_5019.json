      "title": "Drill 2 holes in a small container.",
      "content": "Drill 2 holes in a small container. An old pill bottle, a film container, a plastic bottle of Coca-Cola, whatever you have lying around (with a lid!) will do. Be sure to wash it first, though; you'll be putting the side of the bottle in your mouth. One hole needs to be centered on the bottom and the other centered on the side. A 5/16\" drill bit is best for a standard pen, but it can vary. Choose a drill bit that matches the width of your pen, as the pen will be inserted through the hole shortly."

      "title": "Deconstruct a regular pen.",
      "content": "Deconstruct a regular pen. You know, the kind they give you at hotels and seminars for free. A straight-tubed, not fancy, ballpoint pen with no frills. There are three steps to this: Unscrew the cap surrounding the ink point. Take out the guts -- the ink, the spring -- to create an empty barrel for your BBs to fly through. Ram out the lid at the top with a screwdriver or other slim, pointed object. A sturdy straw will also do the trick."
    },
    {
      "title": "Insert the pen into the hole in the bottom of your container.",
      "content": "Insert the pen into the hole in the bottom of your container. It should protrude about 1/2\" (1.25 cm) into the inside of the container. A regular pen should fit fairly snugly into a hole drilled with a 5/16\" bit. It's a good idea to hot glue the barrel to the bottom of the medicine bottle. Just put a ring of glue around the pen where it meets the edge of the container. This way no air will escape, pressurizing your BBs."

      "title": "Blow in the hole in the side and watch the BBs come out the barrel.",
      "content": "Blow in the hole in the side and watch the BBs come out the barrel. Experiment with distance and aim -- you should be able to go a considerable distance away (the length of your garage, say) and still maintain direction and velocity. Do not inhale with your mouth up against the container. You could inhale pellets and choke. Instead, take a breath away from the gun and then blow inside."

      "title": "Thread the adapter into the blowgun and remove the nozzle.",
      "content": "Thread the adapter into the blowgun and remove the nozzle. By blowgun, we mean one that attaches to an air compressor -- not a blowgun you would use to throw poison darts into your nearest enemy. Screw the adapter in until it's sturdy and tight. [1] X Research source The nozzle of the blowgun (where it would connect to the tube of an air compressor) will twist out counterclockwise."

      "title": "Drill a hole into the side of the soda bottle.",
      "content": "Drill a hole into the side of the soda bottle. It should be about 1\" (2.5 cm) below the bulge in the top of the bottle. It should also match the size of the nozzle of the blowgun that you just threaded out. [2] X Research source If you refer the method above, you'll see that a regular pen requires a 5/16\" drill bit. Your nozzle is probably just a bit bigger than that."

    {
      "title": "Insert the nozzle into the hole from the inside.",
      "content": "Insert the nozzle into the hole from the inside . This is the trickiest part: Put the nozzle into the bottle. With a metal file or other similar, long, thin object, pick up the nozzle. Place it snugly into the drilled hole, threaded part sticking out."

    {
      "title": "Screw the blowgun into the nozzle.",
      "content": "Screw the blowgun into the nozzle. Keep the metal file supporting the nozzle so the weight of the blowgun doesn't dislodge it. Be patient as you thread the blowgun onto the nozzle. Once it's tightened, the blowgun should be sturdy and unmoving. At this point, the soda bottle and blowgun base should be as one."

      "content": "Thread the brake line onto the bottle cap. Pull the line through so the entire tube is through the cap, bolts and nut on the exposed end. [4] X Research source If available, it's wise to seal the drilled hole on the cap with hot glue. This will also hold the line in place, creating a foolproof vacuum."
