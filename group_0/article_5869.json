      "content": "Car flipping is when you buy a used car and quickly sell it for a higher cost. When you flip a used car, you typically buy it from a private seller or online through websites like eBay, repair and detail it as needed, then quickly flip it at a higher cost in order to make a profit. It’s a good side hustle if you’re willing to invest your time into learning the used car market. [1] X Research source Flipping vs. Selling Cars: Flipping cars is about buying a car and selling it quickly to make a profit. Selling cars is about getting a car off your hands for any given reason, not just profit. It’s best to have some basic knowledge about cars before getting into car flipping, that way you’ll have a better idea of labor and repair costs before buying."

      "content": "Yes, if you’re knowledgable about cars and put effort into flipping them. If you aren’t willing to learn about the mechanics of cars, how to source parts, and how much specific cars are worth based on their conditions, car flipping may not be for you. But, if you have a lot of mechanical knowledge and are willing to put in the time and effort to learn how the market works, you can quickly turn a profit. [2] X Research source Car flipping requires a lot of knowledge about cars and the used car market to yield a consistent profit. Car flipping requires a lot of time and energy, as you may need to dedicate hours to repairing different vehicles. Lower-end cars will typically require more repairs, which can eat into your profits. Search for good deals on used cars to find used cars below market value and increase your profits."

Check under the hood and underneath the car for any mechanic issues, like leaks or damaged parts.

When taking a test drive, Hamby says to check your alignment by driving 15-20 mph on a flat road. As you’re driving, take your hands off the wheel to see if it pulls right or left. If so, find out whether it needs an alignment or if it’s something bigger. To check the balance of the tires, Hamby says to take your car out on a freeway and drive at 60 mph to see if it wobbles.

Once you’ve agreed on a price, have the seller sign over the title and buy the car. [11] X Research source People often sell their cars because they don’t want to pay for the repair costs and you can typically negotiate a lower price. Hamby says when buying from a private seller, send the money however they receive it. It’s best to pay with cash, but a cashier’s check is usually recommended for anything over $2,000-$2,500."
