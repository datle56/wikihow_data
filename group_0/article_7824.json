[5] X Research source While toothpaste is generally safe for headlights, test it on a small area before covering the entire lens to make sure it won’t cause any unusual reactions. [6] X Research source If you don’t have a gritty toothpaste, mix it with about 1 teaspoon (6 g) of baking soda before applying it to your headlights. Use pressure as you work the toothpaste into the headlight lens. Apply more toothpaste as needed to remove the yellowing from each headlight. [7] X Research source"
