      "content": "Be observant of your surroundings and senses. If you want to be more mentally aware, the first step is becoming more observant of your surroundings. In your day-to-day activities, try to take stock of the environment, your senses, and your breathing. Walk with purpose. Do not zone out when walking to the bus stop or to work or school. Pay attention to the movement of your body. Take in the scenery. What does your world look like? Smell like? Feel like? Watch the movement of those around you. Be aware of your feet connecting with the ground, your lungs taking in the air, the sense of your clothing against your body. [1] X Research source Paying attention to your own breathing can help increase your overall awareness. If you find yourself getting caught up in worry and zoning out of the moment, pause to think of your breaths. Distracting thoughts can be quelled by tuning into breathing as it's a natural and rhythmic bodily process. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Pay attention to all your senses. What does morning coffee smell like? Taste like? How does it feel against your tongue? How do you feel about starting off another day? As you drive to work, take stock of the sensation of the steering wheel against your hands, any songs on the radio, what the air smells like through your car's window. Try to stay in the current moment as much as possible by paying attention to your senses. [3] X Research source"

This can lead to overeating as well as eating itself becoming less pleasurable. Try to be mindful when you eat. Do not attempt to engage in other activities when you eat. When you eat, eat and do not do anything else. Have regular meals at the table, away from the television.

Try to pause between activities. Let the phone ring a few times before it picks up. Take in the sound and think of who might be calling you and why. Feel the door handle for a moment before entering your home. Take short, mini-pauses to feel, observe, and consider the present moment throughout your day. [6] X Research source"

You end up planning activities in your head while listening, considering how you're going to respond, or making judgment's on the speaker's character.

      "content": "Practice mindfulness. Paying attention the present moment, as well as your own thoughts and feelings, is referred to as mindfulness. Practicing mindfulness throughout your daily activities can help increase your overall mental awareness. The first step to mindfulness is simply, as has been discussed above, being aware of the present moment. However, you should also strive to be aware of your own thoughts. Many people find it helpful to have a set time period each day to simply observe your own thoughts. Allow your mind to wander and any worries, concerns, or interests to creep in uninterrupted. Do not try to judge or control your thoughts. Simply be aware of what you're thinking. It can sometimes be helpful to silently name thoughts as they come in. This can help you address negative thoughts without engaging in them or trying to talk yourself out of them. Simply think to yourself \"Here is my worry that I'm not as successful as I should be\" or \"Here is my concern that my friends don't really like me.\""

      "content": "Consider your life story. Whether consciously or not, everyone lives by a narrative. The story you tell yourself about your life and experiences matters when it comes to mental awareness. Your understanding of your personal narrative has an impact on your current actions and future goals. [11] X Research source Personal mental narratives can be constricting in some ways. For example, you may learn to see yourself as a victim of circumstance. Inaccurate feelings of helplessness and hopelessness can result. In order to become more mentally aware, periodically reevaluate your mental narrative. Look back on your earliest memories. What people, events, and experiences had the greatest impact on you? Why? How do you frame setback in your life narrative? What times in your life did you feel most emotionally and mentally stimulated? Answering these questions can help you see places where negative thought patterns may be tied to an inaccurate view of your life story."

      "title": "Reevaluate your core beliefs.",
      "content": "Reevaluate your core beliefs. Everyone has core beliefs that they try to live by. Core beliefs are developed both by yourself and by your circumstances. How you behave is often linked to your belief system. Evaluating your belief system can help you become more mentally aware of your own behavior. [12] X Research source Identify your core beliefs. Try to write down a list of five values you live by. Then, write down assumptions you also believe. For example, what do you think of other people? Do you feel you can be trusting of others? Why or why not? Think about abstract values. What do you think it means to be a good person? A bad person? Do you react to people in a particular way because they defy your core belief system? Look for examples of black and white thinking in your core beliefs. These types of thought patterns can subtly affect how you interact with other people. You may be unaware of the impact you have on others as a result. Maybe you believe lying is wrong, regardless of the situation. You may then have a tendency to overreact to white lies told to spare your feelings. You may also be too blunt around other people, giving them your version of the truth instead of modifying your response to be more tactful. Look for black and white core beliefs about yourself. Oftentimes, people do not try new things or push themselves hard enough enough to succeed because of inaccurate and self-defeating thoughts. For example, maybe a big rejection earlier in life has led you to convince yourself you'll never find romantic love. You may feel you're not lovable in that way and have stopped dating or seeking out companionship. Therefore, your core belief about yourself becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy."

      "content": "Seek honest feedback about yourself. People who are most self aware do not fear criticism. In fact, they seek out honest feedback in order to improve themselves and their behavior. If you want to increase your level of self awareness, seek to do the same. For example, if you're having trouble getting along with someone at work, you could take your concerns to HR. Instead of blaming your co-worker, ask something like \"What can I do to get along better with Mike?\" This way, you're not leaving the blame on the other person.

Go to source No one is going to make things better for you. If you want to improve a situation, you must take responsibility and do so yourself. Mentally aware people have long since accepted this fact. Be willing to admit to your mistakes and shortcomings. Keep in mind mentally aware people accept reasonable responsibility. Just as it can be bad to refuse to acknowledge your ability to change a situation, you need to make peace with the fact some things cannot be changed by your actions alone. Let go of inevitable setbacks and unavoidable circumstances that temporarily alter your path. If it rains all day and you want to go for a run, for example, accept that you'll have to catch up on your workout tomorrow."

[19] X Expert Source Jennifer Clark Life Coach Expert Interview. 7 February 2020. Unconsciously, you probably personalize circumstances quite a bit. Try to catch yourself personalizing throughout the day. For example, say you get to the office early one morning and a normally chatty co-worker gives you a hasty \"Hello\" without stopping to make small talk. You may immediately start blaming yourself. Did you do something wrong? Does this person not like you? You are personalizing a situation that may have nothing to do with you. When you catch yourself in these moments, try to pull yourself out of your head for a moment. Ask yourself, \"In all likelihood, does this have anything to do with me?\" Take the co-worker example. Maybe she was running late for a meeting. Maybe she isn't feeling well. Maybe there's something going on in her personal life that's causing her stress. Chances are, her quiet nature this morning has nothing to do with you."

They do not waste time longing for times gone by but instead strive to make the best of the present moment, even if the situation is not ideal. Reminiscing about the good times can be fun. However, keep in mind that you may miss positive aspects of the present moment by romanticizing the past. Appreciate your memories but do not let them tether you."

However, certain habits people use to disengage in negative thoughts can be more harmful than helpful. Things like drinking and drug use, for example, should not be used to avoid negativity. Instead of trying to cope through avoidance, try to take a moment to acknowledge the feeling the next time you're sad, in pain, or stressed.

Sometimes, acknowledging that you don't understand a situation, feeling, or person is better than seeking an inaccurate explanation or assumption. Accept that life is sometimes confusing and answers are not always apparent. [24] X Research source People often engage in behaviors to try to avoid dealing with uncertainty. These include seeking excessive reassurance from others, list-making, double-checking, procrastination, and avoiding situations. Keep a diary of how you avoid coping with uncertainty head on. Write down any activities you engaged to avoid uncertainty. [25] X Research source Once you have an idea of how you avoid uncertainty, try engaging in behaviors that allow you to practice living with uncertainty. For example, if you excessively double check e-mails before sending them out, try sending a few e-mails out each day without re-reading them before hitting \"send.\" Leave your house without double checking to make sure you locked the door. Keep up with your diary. Write down how you felt about, say, sending an e-mail without reading it over. Writing about your feelings can help you cope with them. Keep practicing. It can take awhile to feel comfortable with uncertain aspects of life. Move from small stakes activities, like leaving without double checking the door is locked, to activities that are more difficult for you. For example say you dislike going to parties as you're uncertain about what precisely will occur in social situations. Force yourself to go to a party by yourself or attend a social gathering you would normally avoid."
