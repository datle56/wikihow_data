      "content": "Yes, diesel fuel additives help rejuvenate your diesel engine. Fuel additives are useful for diesel fuel, as it ages and deteriorates a lot faster than gasoline fuel. Adding fuel additives to your diesel fuel can prevent mold and bacteria from growing, lubricate your engine, or tackle corrosion, depending on the type of additive you get and how often you use it.

      "content": "Yes, in fact, using too much diesel fuel can lead to engine damage. Adding too much diesel fuel additive to your engine can lead to a host of problems, including clogged filters and decreased engine performance. Too much diesel fuel can cause your engine to lose efficiency, slip more, and lead to other issues in the future. Don’t over treat if you’re losing lubrication, and always follow the frequency instructions that come with the specific additive you're using. [8] X Research source Consult a mechanic if you’re still dealing with engine issues after using a diesel fuel additive."

      "content": "Pour your diesel fuel into a 50-gallon drum and add a fuel additive. Get a 50-gallon drum and pour 50 gallons of old diesel fuel into it to drain the tank. Check the treat rate on your fuel additive to see how much to add (for example, a 1 to 500 treat rate would require 1 gallon of additive for 500 gallons of fuel) and add it directly to the fuel. [9] X Research source Let it sit for a day or two before using. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "When diesel ages, it forms gum, sediment, and bacteria.",
      "content": "When diesel ages, it forms gum, sediment, and bacteria. The gum and sediment form when fuel and oxygen react together as the diesel ages. This sediment can block your filters, leading to engine stalling in some cases. They don’t burn off well, either, which often creates carbon deposits on the fuel injectors. Old diesel fuel may also contain mold or bacteria, which can clog the filters and damage your engine. [11] X Research source"
