Avoid letting the hot dogs split, since they'll lose a lot of flavor if they do. If you're boiling a large pack of hot dogs, they may need extra cooking time. Test a dog by making a small center slit to see whether it steams. If not, continue cooking for another minute or two.

[4] X Research source If you made enough hot dogs for people to come back for seconds, leave the extra dogs in the pot of warm water. Put a lid on the pot and move it to a cool burner; the extra dogs are still likely to be hot when you're ready to eat them. If you've set up a hot dog bar and you're serving a big crowd, you can keep the dogs warm by turning the burner to the lowest heat setting."

If you're cooking more than a few hot dogs, they will need an extra minute or two to fully heat. Hot dogs can be contaminated with Listeria after they’ve been cooked at the plant.
