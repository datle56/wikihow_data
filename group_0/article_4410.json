Keep the hair tightly close to the scalp. Keeping that strand secure between your thumb and index finger, place the middle strand between the index and middle finger, while the outside strand is between your middle and ring finger. The strands have now shifted position.

The amount of cornrows you braid into your hair might depend on the kind of extensions you are braiding into your hair. If you are braiding bulky extensions, you can braid less cornrows into your hair.

This tool closes the hook so that it doesn't tear, break, or snag on your hair. If you use a regular crochet needle, you might damage your hair. Alternately, you can use a bobby pin. Slide the bobby pin under your cornrow until just the looped end is sticking out on the other side. Slide your extension through the looped end of the bobby pin.
