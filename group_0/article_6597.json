      "content": "Change your strings when they are rusty, gummy, or falling out of tune quickly. If you're a serious guitar player you'll be changing your strings frequently, and some musicians change weekly. If your strings feel slow and sticky, or you have to re-tune frequently, you're due for new strings. If you haven't restrung in 3-4 months, get new strings. If you're about to play a big gig, change the strings that morning to prevent unexpected breaking."

You'll know you're loosening if, when plucked, the string sounds deeper. While you can also cut your strings off, this method eases tension gradually and, in the worst case scenario, you can reuse an old string if one breaks while restringing. If you're a beginner, just loosen one string at a time. Then replace it and repeat with the next string. Once loose, you can unwind the string off the tuning peg and free it from the neck of the guitar. [2] X Research source"

On a regular bridge, like a Fender Strat or any other string-through guitar, just pull the strings out of the back of the guitar's body. To make it easier, carefully push the strings through, providing some slack and making them easier to grip. Grab the string by the small, donut-shaped metal end and slowly pull it through the guitar. Most guitars are strung in a simple, straightforward manner, so just follow the string through the guitar to remove it. Do not yank the strings out. Protect your guitar by taking your time. If you have a wrap-around bridge, you will be able to pull them out of the underside of the bridge. Wrap-arounds started out as Toms when players like ZZ Top wrapped the strings around the tailpiece to give the string height a low profile without any buzz.

While some guitarists use heavier gauges or odd string configurations, you can't simply grab a set of strings if your guitar is not made for it. Strings that are too heavy for your guitar can warp or bend the neck without the proper adjustments, so stick to regulars until you know more about your guitar. In general, you want your high E to be a \".008-.0011\" thickness. This is for medium, lite, and extra lite strings. If you use drop tunings, like a drop D, you might want heavier strings. Ask your music store staff for a specific recommendation."

Thread it from the inside of the guitar out. In general, most guitarists will begin with their heaviest string, the top E. It will often be marked as \"6th string,\" or by the highest gauge number (usually around .050). Slide it in the opposite way you took the other strings out, then run it through the hole in the tuning peg, pulling the string away from the guitar. Make sure you leave 2-3 inches of slack, as well -- you don't want the string to be taut before you even start tightening. The tuning pegs aren't marked, but you should just replace the strings in the same order you took them out. On most electric guitars, the first peg is for the top string, then each one further towards the tip of the head is for a string further down."

Simply grab both sides tightly, then turn your hands clockwise to crimp both sides of the string along the tuning post. If you pulled the string out, it would look like the \"S\" in the Van Halen logo. Your right hand will be coming towards your body, away from the guitar. Your left hand will be pushing up, in towards the other tuning pegs."

Take the end of the string and pull it under the other side of the string (the side being fed into the tuning post). After you go underneath the string, bring the end back over the top and pull it taut, pulling towards the very tip of the guitar. You're basically creating a loop with the end of the string around the rest of the string. You'll have a small coiled bit of string right where the string meets the tuning peg."

Then you can turn your tuner slowly counter-clockwise. Make sure that your string is winding around the peg in a uniform manner. Use a tuner to slowly get yourself up to the proper tension.
