      "content": "Soak the bracelet in a jewelry-cleaning solution for a few minutes. Place the bracelet in a natural jewelry cleaner . Many of these solutions come with a basket to place the jewelry directly in the container. If there isn’t a basket, place the bracelet in a small bowl and pour enough cleaner to cover it. Leave the bracelet to soak in the cleaner for 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Each cleaner may have a different soaking time, so refer to the directions for exact timings. [1] X Research source Soak the bracelet with the charms still on, or remove them and soak them separately for a deeper clean. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove it from the solution and brush it with a soft brush.",
      "content": "Remove it from the solution and brush it with a soft brush. Use a jewelry cleaning brush or a soft toothbrush to gently scrub the bracelet and charms. Since you soaked the bracelet first to soften bits of dirt and debris, most will come out of the nooks and crannies of the pieces with a little light pressure from the brush. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Rinse the bracelet, dry it, and then buff it with a soft cloth. Once the bracelet is clean, rinse it with lukewarm water. Then, blot it dry with a clean microfiber cloth or soft towel. [4] X Research source Once the bracelet and charms are completely dry, buff them with a silver-cleaning cloth. Jeweler and Certified Jewelry Appraiser Cory Shifter says that silver polishing cloths do a good job of removing dirt and tarnish from silver jewelry. He recommends using it with a silver cleaning solution to get the best results."

      "title": "Mix hot water and mild dish soap in a small bowl.",
      "content": "Mix hot water and mild dish soap in a small bowl. Use 1 cup (250 ml) of hot water with 1-2 drops of mild dish soap. If the pieces are particularly dirty, you can drop the bracelet right into the solution and let it soak for 5-10 minutes. [5] X Research source Pandora Rose and Pandora Shine bracelets and charms are gold-plated products, so mixing dish soap with water is the best cleaning method. Never use silver polishing liquids, silver dips, or ultrasonic cleaning and a tumbler, as they may remove the finish."

      "title": "Use a soft cloth and soapy water to gently wipe the jewelry.",
      "content": "Use a soft cloth and soapy water to gently wipe the jewelry. Dip a microfiber cloth into the soapy water and wring it out so it’s only damp. Then, gently rub the cloth along the jewelry to remove any dirt. [6] X Research source Do not use a brush on Pandora Rose and Pandora Shine bracelets and charms, or you may damage the gold plating."

      "content": "Rinse the jewelry with clean water and blot it with a dry cloth. After cleaning your Pandora Rose and Pandora Shine jewelry, rinse it with clean lukewarm water. Then use a soft, dry cloth to blot it dry. [7] X Research source Don’t use a silver cleaning cloth on the Pandora Rose or Pandora Shine items. A soft microfiber cloth works and won’t remove the finish."

      "title": "Line a small bowl with aluminum foil.",
      "content": "Line a small bowl with aluminum foil. Choose a bowl that is large enough for the bracelet and any charms to fit inside and has enough room for water to cover them. Tear off a piece of aluminum foil that’s roughly the same size as the inside of your bowl or a little larger. Press the foil inside the bowl with the shiny side up, folding any extra over the edges to hold it in place. [8] X Research source Use an aluminum pie pan in place of the bowl and foil if you prefer."

      "content": "Mix baking soda, salt, and hot water in the bowl. Measure 1 tablespoon (17 g) of baking soda and 1 tablespoon (18 g) of salt into the bowl. Pour about 1 cup (250 ml) of hot water over the salt and baking soda. [9] X Research source Stir the mixture until the salt and baking soda are completely dissolved. Add a few drops of mild dish soap or laundry detergent if you like, but these are optional."

      "title": "Put the bracelet in the water and let it soak for 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Put the bracelet in the water and let it soak for 10 minutes. This will gently loosen and remove the tarnish from the pieces. Take the charms off the bracelet before soaking them for a deeper clean. [10] X Research source Use this method to clean silver Pandora jewelry , including rings, necklaces, bracelets, and charms. However, it’s not recommended to clean Pandora Shine and Pandora Rose pieces. For extra fizzing power, slowly pour ½ cup (120 ml) of white vinegar into the bowl after placing the bracelet in the mixture. This is optional, though."

Rinse it with clean, lukewarm water, and then dry it with a soft microfiber cloth. [11] X Research source For extra shine, polish the bracelet with a silver jewelry-cleaning cloth, but not if it’s a Pandora Rose or Pandora Shine product. While Pandora has not commented on using baking soda to remove tarnish from their jewelry, some silver conservators feel it may cause surface damage to silver pieces. Use this method to clean your Pandora pieces at your own risk. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Thoroughly clean your bracelet every 2 weeks.",
      "content": "Thoroughly clean your bracelet every 2 weeks. If you wear your bracelet every day, it can pick up dirt, sweat, and oils that may dull the finish. Cleaning your bracelet regularly and using an anti-tarnish cloth keeps it looking like the day you brought it home. [13] X Research source Put on your bracelet last to prevent getting lotion, perfume, or hairspray on it. These can build up on the surface and possibly ruin the finish. Take your bracelet off before working out, and don’t wear it on high-temperature days to avoid getting sweat on it."

      "content": "Store your bracelet in an anti-tarnish pouch inside a jewelry box. When you aren’t wearing your Pandora bracelet, store it in a jewelry box , preferably in its own anti-tarnish pouch . This prevents scratching the finish or getting tangled up with other pieces of jewelry. [14] X Research source Never store your Pandora bracelet in direct sunlight. Don’t store your jewelry in high-humidity areas like the bathroom. The anti-tarnish pouch is designed with an airtight seal to prevent oxidation that causes tarnish."

      "content": "Don’t wear your bracelet in the shower, bath, or swimming pool. It’s always best to keep your Pandora bracelet dry to prevent tarnishing. Also, the chemicals used to keep pools clean can cause extreme tarnishing that may be difficult to clean.

      "title": "Why is my Pandora bracelet tarnishing?",
      "content": "Why is my Pandora bracelet tarnishing? When silver comes into contact with the sulfur in the air, it causes a chemical reaction. This reaction creates a dark surface layer of tarnish. While tarnishing can usually be removed with cleaning or polishing, some silver is lost each time it tarnishes. [16] X Research source This isn’t as much of an issue with solid sterling silver pieces. However, the Pandora Shine and Pandora Rose lines are plated in 14K gold and rose gold, which can wear off with multiple polishings."

      "content": "How should I clean Pandora leather bracelets? Wipe the leather gently with a soft, dry cloth after each wear. Use a mild leather cleaner, such as saddle soap , to remove stains before they set in. Dip a small, soft brush or microfiber cloth in water and rub it on the surface of the saddle soap to work up a lather. [17] X Research source Gently rub the soapy brush or cloth on the leather bracelet to remove the dirt. Rinse the brush or cloth as needed. Wipe the lather off the leather with a soft, dry cloth. Slightly dampen a clean cloth and remove any additional soap residue. Allow the leather bracelet to dry completely (up to 24 hours). Then, protect it by applying a leather conditioner . Remember to keep leather out of direct sunlight."
