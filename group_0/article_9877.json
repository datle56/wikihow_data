      "content": "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232 degrees Celsius). Prepare a shallow baking dish by coating it lightly with nonstick cooking spray. You could also cover the dish with nonstick aluminum foil."

      "title": "Cut the squash",
      "content": "Cut the squash into quarters. Use a sharp knife to cut the delicata squash in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds and fiber and divide each half once more. Use a serrated knife for best results. A knife with a smooth blade is more likely to slip on the skin of the squash, making it harder to cut open the squash and easier to accidentally cut yourself. Use a metal spoon or melon-baller to scoop out the seeds and \"fuzzy\" fibers inside the squash. Save the seeds for roasting, if desired. When cutting the halves into quarters, cut each half diagonally, working from the top corner to the opposite bottom corner. The resulting pieces should vaguely resemble boats."

      "title": "Rub the squash with butter.",
      "content": "Rub the squash with butter. Use your hands to apply a generous coat of softened butter to the cut sides of the delicata. Allow the butter to sit out on the counter for 10 to 15 minutes prior to use in order to make it softer and easier to spread. Alternatively, you could also use butter or margarine spread from a tub."
    },
    {
      "title": "Season with salt.",
      "content": "Season with salt. Sprinkle the salt over the delicata slices liberally. The salt can be used according to taste, but if you aren't sure how much to use, try a total of 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of salt for one full squash. For a sweeter taste, add brown sugar, as well. Sprinkle up to 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of brown sugar over the slices, patting it down into place so that it sticks to the squash."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cook for 30 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven.",
      "content": "Cook for 30 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven. The delicata squash should be tender enough for you to easily glide a knife through. The top should also be browned. If you used brown sugar, the top should be caramelized. Roasting at a lower temperature will make the squash even more tender. As such, you could also try roasting it at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) for a full hour."

      "content": "Serve warm. Eat the flesh of the squash directly out of the skin with a spoon or fork."

      "title": "Cut the squash in half and remove the seeds.",
      "content": "Cut the squash in half and remove the seeds. Use a sharp serrated knife to cut the delicata squash in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds and interior fibers with a metal spoon. A serrated knife will break the skin of the squash more easily and is safer to use than a smooth blade. You could also remove the seeds with a melon-baller."

      "content": "Add water and cover. Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water into the dish and cover with a lid or microwave-safe plastic wrap. You may also use vegetable broth instead of the water for an added boost of flavor. If desired, you can also add a dash of salt to the water for flavor. Make sure that the dish is tightly covered."

      "title": "Microwave on High for 10 minutes.",

      "title": "Peel and cube the delicata squash.",
      "content": "Peel and cube the delicata squash. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin of the squash and a sharp knife to cut the squash into 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes. After peeling the squash, cut it in half lengthwise using a serrated knife. Remove the seeds and fibers inside with a metal spoon or melon-baller. Cut each half into cubes using the same knife. You could also cut the squash into slices by diving each half into four parts, cutting in an \"x\" pattern from each top corner to the opposite bottom corners."

      "content": "Boil 1/2-inch (1 1/4-cm) of water in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Allow the water to reach a rolling boil. Do not use too much water, since the water level needs to remain fairly low. Only the steam is needed to cook the squash, not the water itself."

      "title": "Add the squash to a steamer basket and cook until tender.",
      "content": "Add the squash to a steamer basket and cook until tender. The squash is done once it can be easily pierced with a fork. For cubed delicata squash, this should take 7 to 10 minutes. Slices of delicata squash will need to cook for 12 to 15 minutes. Cover the pan and reduce the temperature to low or medium-low as the squash cooks. The water should be at a simmer rather than a rolling boil."
