      "content": "Giving someone the benefit of the doubt means believing something good about them instead of something bad, even if you’re unsure. By giving them the benefit of the doubt, you're choosing to trust them instead of assuming the worst. For example, if your friend is late meeting you for lunch, you might give them the benefit of the doubt by assuming something important came up rather than assuming they just don't respect your time. Even though you're not 100% sure, you're choosing to see the good in them. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use “benefit of the doubt” to signal trust in someone or something. If someone says or does something that seems out of character for them, you can choose to believe the reason for their behavior was innocent rather than malicious. It's a great phrase to use when you want to demonstrate that you trust someone (even if you aren't sure of the truth). Here are some examples of the phrase in action: \"Everyone says she broke my phone on purpose. She's always been a good friend to me, though, so I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt.\" \"Henry is consistent and always turns his assignments in on time, so I think we can give him the benefit of the doubt about the missed deadline. It was just a fluke.” \"That bakery messed up my order last time, but it could have been an honest mistake, so I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt and try ordering from them again.\" \"The customer said the package was never delivered, even though the tracking number says it was. Still, I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt and provide a refund this time.\""

      "title": "Give the benefit of the doubt when you’re unsure of the truth but trust the person.",
      "content": "Give the benefit of the doubt when you’re unsure of the truth but trust the person. When things don’t go according to plan with someone you trust—plans get canceled, or a phone call is missed, for example—give them the benefit of the doubt instead of jumping to negative conclusions. This can help keep your relationships more positive and supportive. [2] X Research source However, if someone is continuously canceling plans, not returning your calls, showing up late, etc., it's okay to feel frustrated and upset. At that point, it's reasonable if you're not willing to give them the benefit of the doubt anymore."
