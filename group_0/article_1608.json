      "title": "Get a physical exam from a doctor to make sure you’re healthy.",
      "content": "Get a physical exam from a doctor to make sure you’re healthy. In order to qualify and handle the challenges of the show, you need to be in great physical and mental health. Getting an official medical exam will tell you and show the producers of Big Brother that your body and mind can handle the rigors of the show. [2] X Research source Ask for a signed copy of your physical from your doctor so you can provide it to the producers if they request it."

      "content": "Ask your job if you can take time off to be on the show. During the initial application process, you can work around your work schedule to focus on completing your application and audition video. But if you make it to the final stages and are being considered as a cast member, you must be able to meet the producers when and where they ask you to meet them. Check with your job to see if they would allow you to take time off to be on the show. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider carefully whether you can handle the challenges of the show.",
      "content": "Consider carefully whether you can handle the challenges of the show. As a contestant– or \"HouseGuest\"– on Big Brother, you’ll be completely isolated from the outside world, but any and all of your actions could be broadcast on live TV. You’ll have to participate in weekly challenges and competitions, and you’ll be expected to share very personal information about yourself with people you don't know. Before you decide to apply to be on Big Brother, you need to think about whether you’re up for the difficulties inherent to the show, including lack of privacy and isolation from your friends and family.

      "title": "Write out a script",
      "content": "Write out a script for your audition video. Your audition video must be less than 3 minutes, and it shouldn’t revolve around crazy costumes or wacky antics. The producers of Big Brother are looking for genuine people to cast on their show, so you should use your script as a guide as you talk about yourself in a natural and confident manner. Don't read from a script verbatim, or you’ll appear rigid and unnatural. [5] X Research source Tell the producers why you think you would do well on the show and why you think you could win. Talk about your life: where you grew up, your childhood, your hobbies, and your passions."

      "content": "Rehearse your video with friends to get their feedback. Before you record your video, you should test out your script in front of some friends.

      "content": "Record a 3-minute video. The easiest way to record a high-quality short video is to use a smartphone camera, but you can also use a digital camera. Use your script as your guide and try to relax and act natural. Remember: you can shoot as many takes as you want, so take your time and get it right! [7] X Research source Record in a well-lit room with the lights in front of you, and avoid shooting in front of a window with sunlight behind it. Don’t record with the sun directly behind you and shoot during the day for better lighting. Try to avoid loud and crowded rooms or windy areas for better sound quality."

[12] X Research source The producers of the show will not verify if they received your application, so if you don't hear back from them for awhile, it's probably safe to assume that you are no longer under consideration."
