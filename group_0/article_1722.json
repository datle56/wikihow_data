      "content": "Yes, their deep and observant natures make an excellent pairing. These signs are both slightly mysterious, but very empathetic, which can make for some memorable conversations and passionate intimacy. So long as a Virgo and Scorpio have enough independence to take some occasional time for themselves, romance should be no problem for these two. [1] X Research source Virgo is an Earth sign, which can be stubborn, but stable. Scorpio is a Water sign, which is fluid enough to handle a Virgo’s stubbornness, and deep enough to add excitement to a Virgo’s stability. Both a Virgo and a Scorpio require alone time. Scorpios tend to be a little secretive, and Virgos often need time alone to reset, so some occasional space is needed. These two signs are 60º apart from one another on the zodiac wheel, which means they have a natural attraction towards one another. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Scorpios tend to be deep and Virgos like to explore mysterious people. Scorpios are passionate and secretive, which can make them see quiet and moody to outside observers. Luckily, the inquisitive Virgo gets a kick out of trying to peel back a person’s layers. In fact, being forward with a Virgo is a quick way to turn them off! The things about a Scorpio that would normally bother other signs are actually a big plus with a Virgo. Early on in a relationship, this can be a really fun and exciting game. The secretive Scorpio refuses to open up, and the inquisitive Virgo gets a kick out of probing for more information. Expect exciting dates and long, flirtatious conversations."

      "title": "Virgos are loyal enough to handle Scorpios when they become distant.",
      "content": "Virgos are loyal enough to handle Scorpios when they become distant. Scorpios tend to need a lot of alone time. For many signs, this can make it feel like the Scorpio is running away from them, which can lead to conflict, jealousy, or distrust. Not for the deeply trustworthy Virgo, though! This little bit of space piques a Virgo’s interest and Virgo is loyal enough to handle their feelings of abandonment without it being a major issue. [3] X Research source A Scorpio’s need for alone time can also “reset” a Virgo’s desire for them. Virgos get bored easily when something becomes too familiar, and these breaks can prevent that."

      "content": "Both signs are pragmatic and sensible enough to remain stable. This pairing has a healthy dose of respect for reality. It’s unlikely that you’ll find a Scorpio and Virgo gambling their life savings away at a casino or maxing out credit cards on fancy vacations. This makes them great partners for the long run, so if you’re a Virgo or Scorpio looking for Mr. or Ms. Right, this is a great combination if shared values are important to you. [4] X Research source If a Virgo and Scorpio pair up for the long haul, they should have no problem saving money and budgeting. If these two start a business together, it’s sure to succeed in the long run. Scorpios care about status and public image, while Virgos tend to be extremely ambitious. This can work out if the two balance one another out, but if Scorpio prioritizes form over function, a Virgo may be irritated.

      "content": "Both signs will need to give their partner personal space. A Virgo can tire out quickly if they’re around someone they know very well for too long. [6] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. A Scorpio can feel suffocated if they don’t have the freedom to go out gallivanting alone every now and then. For Virgo, this can be challenging since a Scorpio’s need for alone time can come across like they’re not being loyal. This is why a Scorpio and Virgo may get into it a bit when they move in together, or take a long road trip. When moving in together, a Scorpio and a Virgo might want to choose an apartment or house where each partner can have their own office."

      "title": "This pair handles emotions differently.",
      "content": "This pair handles emotions differently. Scorpios can seem a bit mischievous and shrewd at first, which will captivate the excitable Virgo. However, once a Scorpio opens up, they can be extremely passionate and emotional. This can be a bit of a turn off if a Virgo isn’t in the right headspace to be around a Scorpio’s boisterous, emotional side. Virgos like to take care of their partners, but a Scorpio bawling during a sad movie may be a bit too over-the-top for a Virgo to take seriously. Virgos really enjoy order. They’re very neat and efficient. An openly-expressive Scorpio can make a Virgo feel like a chaotic hurricane is flowing through their tidy personal space. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "A Scorpio and Virgo should collaborate openly to solve conflicts.",
      "content": "A Scorpio and Virgo should collaborate openly to solve conflicts. Virgos can be a little quick to assume conspiracy, and Scorpios tend to play things close to the vest. When this happens, neither side will be likely to say exactly what’s on their mind. A Scorpio and Virgo should check in with one another regularly to curb tiny conflicts before they get out of hand. [8] X Research source A Scorpio may be quiet about a personal conflict at work that’s bothering them. A Virgo will pick up on their frustration, but might assume the Scorpio is cheating or lying when they refuse to open up about it. It doesn’t help that a Scorpio can turn on a dime when they’ve been hurt, and Virgos tend to be very unwavering when they feel like they’ve been wronged."

      "title": "A Virgo and Scorpio will have a deeply loving sex life.",
      "content": "A Virgo and Scorpio will have a deeply loving sex life. Sexual intimacy is no problem for the profoundly emotional Scorpio, and Virgos are phenomenal caretakers when it comes to meeting their partner’s needs. This can lead to some passionate, emotional, and meaningful sexual experiences. [9] X Research source A Virgo’s need to help and a Scorpio’s highly emotional side can occasionally cause friction in day-to-day life, but this is a great combination in the bedroom."

      "title": "Virgos may have trouble exploring new things with a Scorpio.",
      "content": "Virgos may have trouble exploring new things with a Scorpio. Scorpios are infamous for being a little kinky. But things like roleplaying or some light BDSM will be a little too…messy for the clean and organized Virgo. These two will be totally on the same page when it comes to a quiet, sensual night at home, but a Scorpio may need to encourage a Virgo to tap into their wild side. This is rarely a dealbreaker, though. A Virgo and Scorpio normally get along so well that they’ll have no problem discussing what they want and need from one another in the bedroom."

      "title": "Conversations will be deeply rewarding and meaningful.",
      "content": "Conversations will be deeply rewarding and meaningful. As a Water sign, the Scorpio is dynamic and mysterious as the ocean is deep. As an Earth sign, Virgo can be kind of distant and sensible at first, but a Scorpio takes so long to open up that a Virgo will have plenty of runway to work their way into the right headspace for a long convo. [10] X Research source A Scorpio can seem a little guarded and stoic to other signs, which can be very frustrating. But for the Virgo, this is just another puzzle to be figured out. While Virgo is an Earth sign, they’re mutable, which means they’re capable of adapting to others. As a result, communication might be a challenge for a Virgo and a fixed Scorpio at first, but it shouldn’t stay that way for long."

      "content": "There can be friction if a Scorpio doesn’t let a Virgo help out. Scorpios really like to keep things to themselves. As a natural helper, this can be frustrating for a Virgo. [11] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. When a Virgo asks, “Can I get you anything?” or “Is there anything you’d like to do today?” a Scorpio won’t always lay their cards on the table. This can lead to conflict over time if it goes on for too long. A Scorpio would benefit from opening up over the little things, while a Virgo should work on dealing with a little uncomfortable silence from their partner."

      "title": "Virgos might have to work on letting things go.",
      "content": "Virgos might have to work on letting things go. Virgos tend to hold on to grudges with both hands, and the independent Scorpio is usually too free-spirited to care about disarming a tense situation. Communication may break down if a Virgo can’t force themselves to forgive pointed comments, passing criticisms, or emotional outbursts. [12] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. The Virgo’s need to be right is often a much bigger roadblock in relationships, but Scorpios are often okay with taking the blame if it means they can move on to something more important. Scorpios can be a little too critical for a Virgo’s taste. Virgos need to set clear, concrete boundaries with a free-spirited Scorpio. Scorpios can help Virgos along here by owning up to mistakes and moving on quickly. This will keep a hot-headed Virgo from spinning out of control."

      "title": "A Scorpio and Virgo can make great long-term partners.",
      "content": "A Scorpio and Virgo can make great long-term partners. These two signs have the perfect combination of traits when it comes to building a long and lasting relationship. There may be periods of conflict whenever major changes take place, but once the kinks are ironed out, it’s usually smooth sailing. So long as a Scorpio can curb their sensitive side a bit and a Virgo doesn’t take their need for order too seriously, there’s no reason this relationship won’t have legs. [13] X Research source If you’re a Scorpio dating a Virgo, try to cut your partner a break when they ask you to clean up after yourself, and don’t read into it too much if they aren’t always down for a deep convo. If you’re a Virgo with a Scorpio, try to not take it personally when they take charge and mess things up a bit. If you’re not used to trying new things in the bedroom, give it a shot! You never know what you might like. Both signs are grounded, realistic, and loyal—this can absolutely be a wonderful match if you want long-term love!"
