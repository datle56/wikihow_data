      "content": "Take out your shoelaces to protect them while you clean. If your leather shoes have shoe laces, pull them out gently and set them aside. Never use any leather cleaning products without removing the laces, since they’re typically made of cloth and leather cleaner and polish may stain them. If your laces are dirty, place them in a mesh bag and toss them in the washing machine to clean them."

      "content": "Remove dirt and debris with a soft-bristled brush. Lift the shoe up in your nondominant hand and gently rub the brush against the surface of the shoes to remove dirt with your other hand. Brush gently and take your time to keep the bristles from scratching the leather. To be thorough, run the brush along the seams and soles of your shoes. [1] X Expert Source Marc Sigal Shoe Care Specialist Expert Interview. 15 January 2020. You don’t need to clean your leather shoes if they’re already pretty clean. This is a good idea if you just got home and you notice a few scuffs or chunks of dirt sticking to your shoes, though. Avoid using anything with hard bristles, like a wire brush, since you could scratch the leather if you aren’t extremely careful."

      "content": "Remove stubborn scuffs and marks with a leather cleaner and soft brush. Squirt a small dollop of leather cleaner on a soft-bristled brush and gently wipe the surface of the leather with the bristles. Work the cleaner into the leather by moving the brush back and forth like you’re dusting your shoes. Continue brushing until the dirty leather is restored to its former glory. [2] X Expert Source Marc Sigal Shoe Care Specialist Expert Interview. 15 January 2020. Leather cleaner is certainly a unique product, but it’s really helpful if you want to make cleaning your leather shoes easy. You can use a clean microfiber cloth if you don’t have a soft-bristled brush. Avoid using water to clean your leather shoes. Water causes leather to shrink and it may dry the leather out over time, which can make your shoes stiff and wrinkly."

      "content": "Sprinkle talcum powder over oil and grease stains to soak them up. If you have a tough oil or grease stain on your leather shoes, cover it with an absorbent powder, like talcum or baby powder. Let it sit for 2-3 hours to absorb the oil. Softly brush the powder away with a soft brush. [3] X Expert Source Marc Sigal Shoe Care Specialist Expert Interview. 15 January 2020. It’s pretty satisfying to brush that powder away and see that greasy mark disappear. This works because the powder lifts the moisture from the oil or grease out of the leather. You can also use cornstarch to absorb oil stains, but you must leave it on for 7-8 hours to fully absorb the oil."
