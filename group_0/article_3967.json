      "content": "Be sensitive to how your jokes are received and apologize if needed. Keep an eye out for how people are taking your jokes: even if nobody says, “Hey, knock it off,” their body language can tell you a lot about whether they’re really enjoying what you’re saying or if they’re silently tolerating it. Does their smile seem genuine? You can tell if a smile is genuine if it reaches the eyes: a real smile engages the whole face, including the eyes, while a fake smile usually only engages the mouth muscles. Is their posture open and relaxed? A person who’s genuinely having a good time will likely display a more relaxed, loose posture with their arms out or by their sides, while a person who’s uncomfortable will likely seem more physically closed off, with arms crossed, shoulders hunched, and body turned away from you. [3] X Research source If someone does seem offended or voices discomfort, be gracious and empathetic, and back off immediately. Apologize sincerely, and let them know you won’t make the same jokes in the future: “I’m so sorry, I was messing around, but I took it too far. I won’t make these jokes anymore.”"
