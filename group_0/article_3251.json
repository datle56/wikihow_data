      "content": "Fill in your job and education to give more information about yourself. Although it’s optional on a Tinder profile, adding your occupation and your education can help the Top Picks algorithm pick you out. The more information you provide about yourself, the more likely it is that you'll matched with someone as a Top Pick. For example, put something like “Studied Engineering at ASU, currently working as a technical engineer for a startup.”"

      "content": "Use keywords to get the label that you want. The Tinder algorithm uses your bio to assign labels that up your chances of being a Top Pick. If you want to be labeled an athlete, put “fitness” in your bio. If you want to be labeled a scholar, put “literature” or “university” in your bio. You can’t choose your own labels, so try to write your bio with key words that the algorithm will pick up. For example, if you want to be labeled an adventurer, you could write, “I’m always jumping from city to city, traveling around and seeing new things. I don’t stay in one place very often, want to join me on this adventure?” Common labels include “Adventurer,” “Scholar,” “Doctor,” “Entrepreneur,” and “Creative,” as well as others."

      "content": "Link your Instagram to your Tinder profile to boost your visibility. Not only will this allow your potential matches to look a little deeper into your life and personality, but it also boosts your profile and gives you a better shot at becoming a Top Pick. The more content you have on your profile, the better. [1] X Research source Linking your Instagram can help your matches strike up a conversation, since they’ll know a little bit more about you."

      "content": "Use clear, straightforward language to avoid confusing the algorithm. Since the Top Picks feature is run by a computer, the algorithm it uses can be duped by certain phrases or unclear wording. For example, if you say something like “My exercise includes walking to the fridge and back,” the algorithm will pick up on the word “exercise” and label you as an athlete. Stick to straightforward statements about yourself that highlight who you are. [2] X Expert Source Lisa Shield Dating Coach Expert Interview. 13 December 2018. You can still put jokes into your profile, but try not to use humor with keywords that could label you as something you’re not."

      "content": "Make sure your best picture is the very first one. Tinder Top Picks only show the first picture of your profile when they assemble all their profiles in a grid. Make sure that your first photo is in focus, has good lighting, and doesn’t have a bunch of other people in it to distract from your smiling face. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose head shots of yourself to look great in the Top Picks grid.",
      "content": "Choose head shots of yourself to look great in the Top Picks grid. Pictures that show only the upper 2/3 of your body from your shoulders up usually get more matches in general. If you have a photo like this, make sure you put it as your first picture so it shows up in the Top Picks grid. [4] X Research source Head shot images make up almost all of the Tinder Top Picks, since they look the best when compiled in a grid."

      "content": "Make sure your eyes are visible in each image so you seem friendly. Pictures where you are hiding your eyes with sunglasses or a wide-brimmed hat make you look mysterious and not very likable. Make sure your face is mostly free of obstruction so the Tinder algorithm can see who you are based on your profile. [5] X Research source This will also probably get you more matches in general, since it lets people see who you are right away."

      "content": "Choose a photo of you by yourself so your matches know who you are. The Tinder Top Picks algorithm favors profiles with photos of people alone, since it’s easier to pick out who you are in your photo. If you do have some group photos of you and your friends, that’s fine! Try to limit it to 2 or 3 shots, and put them near the end of your pictures. [6] X Research source Too many group photos can make you blend in, and people may not be able to tell which person you are.

      "content": "Take pictures on a self-timer to avoid putting up a low-quality selfie. Although it’s super easy to pick up your phone and snap a selfie, photos like that don’t look very engaging, especially in the Top Picks grid. Instead, try choosing a photo of yourself enjoying a hobby, spending time with friends, or chilling outside in nature. [8] X Research source If you do have a really great selfie, try to put it in the middle of your picture roll so it’s not the very first one. Avoid filtering your selfies, especially with filters that distort your facial features. This can be off-putting for potential matches, and heavily filtered photos don’t do well with the Tinder Top Picks algorithm."
