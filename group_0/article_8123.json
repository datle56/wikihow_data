Hydrogen peroxide Hydrogen peroxide has antibacterial and antiviral properties, as well as a bleaching effect, which makes it a good choice for vomit stains.

You can either use a wedge pillow or just add another pillow or two to your normal set-up in order to elevate your head and upper body. Drink a very small amount of a sweet liquid, like soda or apple juice.
