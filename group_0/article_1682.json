      "title": "Try this behemoth to taste every meat on the Arby’s menu at once.",
      "content": "Try this behemoth to taste every meat on the Arby’s menu at once. Legend has it this carnivore’s dream started out as a joke—the Arby’s marketing team made a poster of an imaginary sandwich with all the meats on the menu, but customers believed it was real and started asking for it. [1] X Research source The Meat Mountain is still available at most Arby’s. Just ask for it by name, or order a sandwich with some of every meat they have (and add a slice of cheddar and a slice of Swiss). [2] X Research source Cost: $10 (price may vary if you have to build it yourself) The Meat Mountain includes 2 chicken tenders, 1.5 oz (43 g) of roast turkey, 1.5 oz of ham, 1.5 oz of corned beef, 1.5 oz of brisket, 1.5 oz of Angus steak, 1.5 oz of roast beef, 3 half-strips of bacon, 1 slice of cheddar cheese, and 1 slice of Swiss cheese."

      "title": "Name a better combo than ham and Swiss cheese—we’ll wait!",
      "content": "Name a better combo than ham and Swiss cheese—we’ll wait! If your cashier doesn’t recognize the Ham N' Swiss by name, don't worry—any Arby’s will have the ingredients for it. Just ask for ham and Swiss on a honey wheat bun with tomato, lettuce, mayo, and spicy brown mustard. Cost: $3.99 Customize this sandwich however you like when you order. A few strips of peppered bacon on top sounds good!"

      "title": "Relive the glory days when the BLT was on the regular menu.",
      "content": "Relive the glory days when the BLT was on the regular menu. The Ultimate BLT debuted in 2002 but has since disappeared from Arby’s menu. Your nearest Arby’s definitely has the ingredients to make this classic sandwich, though—just ask for the Ultimate BLT. If your cashier doesn’t recognize the item, order a sandwich on any bread you like with bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. Feel free to customize it however you want! Cost: $3.99 The original Ultimate BLT came with 5 strips of bacon. Rumor has it that if you order it off the secret menu now, it comes with 8 strips (yes, please!)."

      "title": "Gobble this up if you need carbs and cheese (and just a little meat).",
      "content": "Gobble this up if you need carbs and cheese (and just a little meat). Mac & cheese comes and goes on the Arby’s menu, so your local franchise may not have noodles on hand year-round. When they do offer it (like when they feature their limited-time-only White Cheddar Mac & Cheese), order it and ask for bacon on top for extra protein (and flavor!). If they won’t or can’t prepare it for you, ask for bacon on the side (it’s free) and crumble it on top yourself. [3] X Research source Cost: $3.29 While you’re at it, why not order some chicken tenders and peppercorn ranch to recreate Arby’s Loaded Mac & Cheese (also only available for a limited time)?"

      "title": "Devour this if roast beef is what gets you out of bed in the morning.",
      "content": "Devour this if roast beef is what gets you out of bed in the morning. Sometimes called a Double French Dip, this secret menu item has double the meat of the regular sandwich (with the same tasty sub roll and slice of Swiss cheese). If your cashier doesn’t recognize the order, get a regular French Dip & Swiss and ask for extra roast beef. [5] X Research source Cost: $7"

      "content": "Customize the French Dip for spicy, Windy City-inspired goodness. Order a regular French Dip & Swiss, then add banana peppers, roasted peppers, and Arby’s Italian seasonings (it’s up to you if you want to keep the Swiss cheese or try another kind. A true Chicago-style Italian beef is cheeseless). The result is like if a French Swiss Dip and Arby’s now-discontinued Loaded Italian Sandwich had a baby. You’ve got to try it! Cost: $4.49"

      "content": "Jump on this secret sandwich if a regular Reuben just doesn’t cut it. Reubens are only available seasonally and may not find their way to every Arby’s location, so snap this up when you get the chance. The Double Stacked Reuben has twice the corned beef of the regular version (that makes 7 oz (198 g) of meat!), plus Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and Thousand Island dressing. Yum! [8] X Research source Cost: $8.49 To shake things up, try ordering the Double Stacked Reuben with half corned beef and half turkey (or any meat you like). Or, swap all the corned beef for roast turkey to recreate The Rachel (now discontinued). The original Rachel also used coleslaw in place of sauerkraut, but most Arby’s don’t carry that side anymore."

[10] X Research source Cost: Price of whichever sandwich you choose to hack Arby’s actually featured these sandwiches sans-meat in 2016 as a Leap Year promotion, but vegetarian customers have been doing this for years!"
