      "content": "Heat the water in a pot on the stove. Place the pot over high heat, and bring the water to a boil. You can also do this step in a large frying pan if you prefer, which will heat the water faster. [1] X Research source Poaching kippers creates the least amount of smell as opposed to other methods. Kippers can be fairly potent."

    {
      "title": "Remove the pan from the heat to add the kippers.",
      "content": "Remove the pan from the heat to add the kippers. The water doesn't need to stay boiling to cook the kippers. Take the pan off the heat and put the kippers in so you gently poach them instead of overcooking them. [2] X Research source You can gently drop the kippers in with your hands or use tongs to lower them into the water."

    {
      "title": "Wait 5 minutes for the kippers to cook.",
      "content": "Wait 5 minutes for the kippers to cook. Kippers cook pretty fast, and they're typically done in this amount of time. You can leave them for a bit longer if the kippers don't look done. They should flake apart easily. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pour the water off after 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Pour the water off after 5 minutes. Use a sieve or colander to drain the water off, but be gentle, as the kippers may break apart. You can also use a slotted spoon or tongs to gently pull them out of the water. [4] X Research source Try serving them with scrambled eggs and toast for breakfast. You can add a bit of butter on top of each fish for flavor. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge. Eat them within a couple of days. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Find a jug large enough to hold the kippers.",
      "content": "Find a jug large enough to hold the kippers. You can use any jug that can handle the heat of boiling water, such as a ceramic pitcher. You can even use a heat-proof glass measuring cup that holds 4 cups (950 mL) of water. It's fine if the tails stick out of the water a little bit. Poaching the kippers in a jug is a traditional cooking method."

      "content": "Put the kippers in the jug, head side down. Line the kippers up lengthwise in the jar from top to bottom. [6] X Research source They can go at angle if the jug is a bit short. You can also cut the heads and tails off before putting the fish in the jug if the jug is too short. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pour in enough boiling water to cover the kippers.",
      "content": "Pour in enough boiling water to cover the kippers. Cover the fish up to the tails at least, though you don't need to cover the tails with water. Place a plate, lid, or piece of aluminum foil on top of the jug to hold the heat in. [8] X Research source You can actually do this process at the table, as an impressive way to cook and serve kippers."

      "title": "Let the fish sit in the water for 5-8 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the fish sit in the water for 5-8 minutes. Kippers will cook fairly quickly. Check them after about 5 minutes to see if they're done. They should flake easily if they're done cooking. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Drain off the water and serve the kippers.",
      "content": "Drain off the water and serve the kippers. Pour off most of the water in the sink, and then gently remove the kippers from the jug. Set them on a warm plate to drain off the rest of their water. You can also gently drain them in a sieve over the sink. If you're serving the kippers at the table, use a slotted spoon or large tongs to pull the kippers out of the water and drain them. Serve them with a bit of butter on top of each fillet and a squeeze of lemon. You can also use fresh parsley or a dash of apple cider vinegar."

      "content": "Pre-heat the oven and cover a sheet pan with foil. The oven needs to be hot before you stick the pan in, so set it to \"broil.\" Line a baking sheet with foil, so that it won't absorb the fishiness of the kippers. [10] X Research source In British cooking, \"grilling\" refers to cooking under the heating element in the oven, known as the grill. In the United States, this type of cooking is called \"broiling.\""

This helps fully incorporate the butter flavor into the kippers. Cook the fish on this side for 4-6 minutes. [16] X Research source However, if you don't want to use that much butter, just stick to basting the kippers once on each side."
