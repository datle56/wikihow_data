Place the shoes in the water and use a soft cloth or sponge to gently clean them. Wipe the shoes with a soft cloth dampened in water to remove any remaining detergent when you're done. To get rid of stubborn stains, spray carpet cleaner or an all-purpose cleaner on any stains on the fabric parts of the shoe. Wait 5 minutes, then blot the stains with a damp cloth or sponge. Alternatively, dip a soft brush in a small bowl of warm water and 1 tablespoon (0.52 oz) of laundry detergent and scrub stains in a small, circular motion."

      "content": "Clean the outsoles using a baking soda paste and a soft brush. If the outsoles aren’t completely clean after the laundry detergent bath, create a paste using ¼ cup (2.11 oz) of baking soda and 1 tablespoon (0.52 oz) of water. Apply the paste to the rubber outsoles and scrub any stains with a soft brush or old toothbrush. [3] X Research source Dip a cloth in clean water and wipe the outsoles with it to remove any gunk and paste. If the toothbrush hairs are too soft to scrub, cut the hairs using a pair of scissors to make them short and strong. For extra stain-scrubbing power, make a cleaning paste using 2 tablespoons (1.04 oz) of baking soda, 2 tablespoons (1.04 oz) of laundry booster , 1 teaspoon (0.17 oz) of hydrogen peroxide , and 1 tablespoon (0.52 oz) of water. Alternatively, slightly wet a Magic Eraser with water and scrub at any stains or scuff marks on the rubber edges and the bottom of the shoe. [4] X Research source"

Avoid placing your shoes on direct heat sources like radiators. The intensity of the heat might cause the materials in your shoe to warp or lose their shape. Once the laces, insoles, and shoes are completely dry, reassemble your shoes and store them in a warm, dry place out of direct sunlight."
