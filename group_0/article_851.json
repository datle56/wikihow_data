Because the second number is negative, we change the direction we move on the number line. Adding normally moves to the right, but adding a negative number moves to the left instead. Start at +5, move 2 spaces to the left, and you end up at +3. So 5 + (-2) = 3.

Don't get confused by where you start on the number line. The first number only tells you where to begin on the number line. You'll always move right or left based on the type of problem and the second number."

It also takes two lines to draw a plus sign, so - - is the same as +, moving to the right."

The absolute value of -6 is also 6. 9 has a greater absolute value than 7. -8 has a greater absolute value than 5. It doesn't matter that one is negative."

If the number line doesn't help you figure it out, here's another way to solve it: [7] X Research source Rearrange it so you're subtracting the smaller absolute value from the larger one. Ignore the negative sign for now. For our example, write 4 - 2 instead. Solve that problem: 4 - 2 = 2. This isn't the answer yet! Look at the original problem and check the sign (+ or -) of the number with the largest absolute value number. 4 has a higher value than 2, so we look at that in the problem 2 + (-4). There's a negative sign in front of the 4, so our final answer will also have a negative sign. The answer is -2 ."
