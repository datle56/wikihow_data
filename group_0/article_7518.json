In a typical MLA in-text citation, you would place the last name of the author and the relevant page number in parentheses at the end of any sentence that references a source. Here, no page numbers are available. Normally, you would just use \"World Bank\" in your parenthetical citation. However, in some instances, you may need a little extra information. [6] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source For example, if you've used more than one World Bank data page as a source, you would include part of the title so your readers would know which one you were referring to. Your parenthetical citation might look like this: \"(World Bank, \"C02 Emissions\").\" If you mentioned the World Bank in the text of your paper, you don't have to include the name again in a parenthetical citation. Likewise, if you include the name of the page or table in the text of your paper, you don't need to repeat it. If both were mentioned in your paper, you wouldn't need a parenthetical in-text citation at all."

[12] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source For example, if you mention the World Bank in the body of your paper, you would only need the year in the parenthetical. The parenthetical with the year is typically placed immediately after \"World Bank.\" If you're citing more than one development indicator that was published in the same year, include part of the title in your parenthetical to distinguish them for your readers.
