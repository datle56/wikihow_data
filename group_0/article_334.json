Here are a few ways that you can get the most study potential out of each day: [1] X Research source Phone alarms: Program an alarm or reminder for yourself so you remember when you’re supposed to study. Calendars: Mark any upcoming quiz or exam dates on a calendar. Then, schedule your future study session before these dates. To-do lists: Create a weekly or daily checklist to help you stay on top of your assignments and study obligations. This is a great way to stay focused on and on-topic during your study sessions.

      "content": "Work somewhere you can focus and be comfortable. If you're not studying well in your current location, you might be better off moving to a new spot. There’s nothing wrong with switching study spaces if you aren’t able to concentrate on your study materials or don't have what you need nearby. [2] X Research source Some people may like the soothing background chatter of a coffee shop, while others may prefer a silent corner of the library. Test out different study spots and see what works best for you! Make sure that your desk is organized if you have one. Stack and organize any loose papers, and toss out or recycle anything you don’t need anymore. Try to keep all of your school supplies in designated places, too. [3] X Research source Choose a study space that has good lighting as well as a comfortable place to sit."

      "content": "Long-term studying is better for your memory than cramming. Give yourself an hour or so to go through your notes, assignments, and any new material you learned throughout the day. Continue to review this new material throughout the week, so you have a better grasp of what you’re learning. [4] X Research source This is a great way to stay on top of what you do and don’t understand. Feel free to ask a teacher or professor for help if something doesn’t make sense during one of your regular study sessions."

Instead, step away from your study space for around 15 minutes so your brain can unwind and recharge. Here are some things you might do on your break: [5] X Research source Head outside for a walk Munch on your favorite snack Pop on social media Watch a funny video"

      "content": "Many learners fall into 3 categories: auditory, visual, and kinesthetic. These groupings are fairly self-explanatory—auditory learners study by hearing information spoken out loud; visual learners study best with special visual cues; and kinesthetic learners prefer hands-on study techniques. Explore your learning style by testing out different types of studying strategies. Here are a few ideas to get you started: [6] X Research source Visual: Create a color-coding system for your class notes and/or represent information with diagrams Auditory: Record and listen to yourself reading through your notes and/or chat about study topics with other students Kinesthetic: Act out a scenario with another person and/or craft physical models"

Try sprinkling some visuals into your study sessions when you’re trying to memorize and recall a lot of different terms at once. [7] X Research source You might: Picture a container of disinfectant wipes while memorizing the word “antiseptic” Associate a picture of a mirror with the word “albedo” Connect the image of a white circle with the term “lymphocyte”"

Start with all of your flashcards in the first box—if you get the flashcard right, move it to the second box. If you get it wrong, leave it in the first box. Over the next few days and weeks, go through each box and move a card to the right if you get it correct. Continue reviewing the different flashcard boxes until all of the cards stay in box 5. Here’s a helpful timeline that you can follow: [11] X Research source Review the cards in box 1 every day Review the cards in box 2 every other day Review the cards in box 3 every 4 days Review the cards in box 4 every 9 days Review the cards in box 5 every 2 weeks If you forget the information on a specific card, move it to the previous box. For instance, if you answered a box 3 card incorrectly, you’d shift it over to box 2."
