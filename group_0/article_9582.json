Ruminating on the past, which you have no power to change, or projecting into the future, which you can't possibly predict, are sure ways to lose control of your thoughts. Focus on the here and now — the very tangible situation you're in that you can control — and your thoughts will follow.

Go to source Try a simple grounding technique like sitting in a chair and focusing on the sensations your feet feel as they touch the floor. This can help you connect with what you feel in the moment and tune out other concerns. Many spiritual practices recommend staying in the moment to promote inner peace and clarity. A simple question to ask yourself is: what can I do right now to change how I feel?"

All this means that you can never control every thought — nor should you try. Instead, watch your thoughts come and go without any attachment and avoid repressing those you don't want to have. Accepting them may help you feel less anxious about them. [4] X Research source Thinking about ignoring something, paradoxically, never works.

Your environment can include other people whom you let influence you, including friends, family, co-workers, and followers on social media. By taking the reins of your mind, you're reclaiming responsibility for your own happiness and removing that power from external forces. For example, when you're in control of your thoughts, you no longer feel compelled to let other people's negative criticism or gossip affect you. You also understand that it's up to you to make yourself happy. For example, rather than let one bad interaction at work ruin your whole day, you choose to focus on the positive and cultivate a good attitude."

For example, let's say you have a habit of thinking and worrying about work even after you clock out for the day.
