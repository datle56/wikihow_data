[1] X Research source Don’t use a wet cloth and don’t leave any wetness behind. Never get your cast wet or submerge it in water, even if it gets dirty. Plaster casts disintegrate in water, and although fiberglass casts are waterproof, the soft lining inside is not.

      "content": "Keep the cast from getting dirty and smelly. Since casts can’t have water on them, the best way to keep them clean is to prevent them from getting dirty. Keep your cast away from dirt and sand, and limit your physical activity to prevent sweating in it. [4] X Research source Be careful when you eat. Try not to drop food onto or into the cast. If you need to, cover the cast while you eat. This may be important if a child has an arm cast. Sweating in your cast can make it smell bad, so don’t play sports or exert yourself more than you need to. If you have a cast on your leg or foot, consider getting a boot to cover it with."

      "content": "Determine if you have a fiberglass or plaster cast. Though taking care of a fiberglass or plaster cast is similar, there are important distinctions between the two. Make sure you know what kind of cast you have and the type of liner you have so you can care for your cast properly. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Fiberglass casts can hold up better if they happen to get wet. However, you should not submerge them in water, go swimming with them, or take a shower with them if you have a normal liner. The liner can get wet and irritate or cause sores on your skin inside the cast. Some fiberglass casts come with waterproof liners. If you have a waterproof liner, you may be able to submerge it in water, but only with your doctor's approval. For example, you may be able to go swimming or take a bath with it. Plaster casts cannot get wet. Water can damage the cast and cause problems. It may even cause the cast to dissolve and fall apart. Take care to always keep your plaster cast dry."

See a doctor if the smell is bad because it might mean you have an infection."
