These vitamins and minerals can increase the number of T-cells in your body, so try to include them in your daily diet. Studies show that vitamins B6b and B12 help T-cells mature and replicate more effectively. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Similarly, dietary folic acid helps maintain T-cells in various parts of the body, including in the colon. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Thiamin (thiamine or vitamin B1) also supports T-cells and makes them more effective at fighting foreign cells. [3] X Research source One of the best ways to get these nutrients is to eat a varied diet that includes fresh fruit and vegetables. Good sources of these nutrients include: [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Leafy greens Cauliflower and broccoli Peas, chickpeas, and kidney beans Squash Carrots Tomatoes Strawberries Bananas and oranges Nuts Whole grain bread Some fortified cereals"

Try to sip green tea (hot or cold) throughout the day to get these polyphenols. [8] X Research source If you dislike the taste of green tea, mix in a little lemon or honey to improve the flavor. Green tea is not as potent as other drugs or supplements for boosting your T-cell count, but it comes with far fewer long-term side effects or health risks."
