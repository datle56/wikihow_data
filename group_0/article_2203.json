      "content": "Create habits to help you remember things. If, for example, you always forget to pack your yoga mat for class after work, you can work on making this part of your daily routine and create a new habit. Making something a habit takes time (longer for some than for others), but it can be done. Try forming habits by using the 3 Rs: Reminder, Routine, Reward. [4] X Research source Reminder—This is the cue that begins the behavior. Try picking something you already do every day as your reminder. For instance, let's say you pick out your outfit for the next day before you go to bed. Use this as a cue to put your yoga mat with your work bag. Piggybacking on something that is already an established habit will help you remember. Routine—This is the action. Sticking with the previous example, the action would be packing your yoga mat. It could also be flossing, putting down the toilet seat, paying a bill, or anything else you need to do. Reward—This is the payoff for the behavior. If something good happens as a result of your routine, you are more likely to stick with it. You can even congratulate yourself each time you follow through, saying something like, \"Yes! I did it!\""

Distractions can be your own avoidance technique, or they can be external forces that inhibit focus and concentration. [6] X Research source Are there people at work or school that regularly consume all your time and energy? They can be external sources of distraction and inhibit your focus. Do you worry about something regularly that makes it difficult to focus and concentrate? By focusing your time and energy on worries, you may be less able to remember things you need to do. Try minimizing distractions at work by disabling notifications for emails and designating a specific time at the beginning and end of each day to respond to them. Put your phone on silent and, if you have your own office, close the door when you need to focus and don't want to be disturbed."

If you're a student, make sure that schoolwork and extracurricular activities aren't consuming all of your time. Remember to take breaks, particularly if you're looking at a computer screen for more than 2 hours at a time. If you're career-focused, make sure that you set boundaries about what is \"work time\" and \"personal time.\" Don't let all of your time become \"work time.\" If you're a parent or caregiver, it's important to carve out time each day or week to do something that is specifically for you. Your life may be focused on caring for others, but to avoid burnout or high stress, you need to have \"me time.\""
