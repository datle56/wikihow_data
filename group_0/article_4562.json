      "title": "Make sure your tank is big enough.",
      "content": "Make sure your tank is big enough. Cichlids need a tank that is at least 4 feet long (1.3 meters) in order to breed. This can ensure your cichlids have enough space to comfortably breed and hide if necessary. Keep in mind that most people keep multiple cichlids in one tank, so the bigger the tank you can get, the more optimal the environment is for breeding."

      "content": "Maintain high water quality. Good water quality is important to keeping your Malawi cichlids healthy and happy. Making sure the water quality is appropriate to Malawis can also give them the best environment in which to breed. Test the water with fish tank water testing, which you can get at most pet stores. These tests can identify problems with the water quality, such as if the water is too acidic. Malawi cichlids like alkaline water that is a pH of 8.0 or above. If the water is not alkaline enough, you can use a carbonate buffer, calcium, or magnesium buffer to raise the levels and make the water harder. [2] X Research source Make sure the water temperature is 80 °F (26.7 °C) (27 Celcius). You may also want to test that oxygen saturation in the tank exceeds 70%. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Filter the water. Cichlids can create a lot of waste in their water. An important part of maintaining their water quality, which will also optimize breeding, is to filter it. It may also help the spawn survive. Choose a gentle filter or a freshwater trickle filter, which is good for large stocked tanks with cichlids. Make sure you replace or clean your filter once a month or more often as necessary.

      "title": "Arrange hiding spots.",
      "content": "Arrange hiding spots. Most tanks for Malawis do well with a layer of sand on the bottom. [5] X Research source But they also like to have hiding spaces, especially during breeding. This will give your Malawi cichlids a place to breed and the fry, or baby fish, a place to hide from adults that may eat them. [6] X Research source Place a few flattish stones near one another on the bottom of the tank as breeding sites. [7] X Research source You can also glue small stones together with aquarium silicone to form a “cave” in which the Malawis can breed and fry can hide. Use a few small clay pots in the tank as hiding spaces. You can easily make these more natural—and beautiful—looking in the tank by using aquarium silicone to glue small stones on the pots."

      "title": "Make sure you have males and females of each species.",
      "content": "Make sure you have males and females of each species. There are several different species of Malawi cichlids and you likely have a mixture in your tank. Make sure that you have males and females of both species in the tank. [8] X Research source This can prevent hybrids, which may not have the same beautiful color as their parents and could also be sterile. [9] X Research source It can also ensure that males and females also have partners with which to breed in the event that a specific pairing doesn't work. Be aware that most cichlid species are dimorphic, which means the males and females have distinct coloring patterns. If you have dimorphic fish and are unsure, you can check a guide to find a picture of the specific coloring. [10] X Research source Recognize that you may have difficulty discerning subtle color differences in dimorphic cichlids or your cichlids may be monomorphic. If this is the case, you'll need to “vent” them, which means checking the genital papilla. You can find this by taking your fish out of the water and finding its anal pore. Just underneath this is the genital papilla, and the female's is generally larger than the male's papilla."

      "content": "Feed your cichlids appropriate amounts. The health and vitality of your cichlids is important to breeding. Making sure that you feed—and not overfeed-- your cichlids This can optimize breeding and make sure the eggs and fry survive. Make sure to feed your cichlids according to their specific species need, which can range from small shrimp to algae in the tank. In most cases, specialized cichlid food is enough to keep your cichlids healthy. Consider getting something with Spirulina flakes which is high in protein and other nutrients Malawi cichlids need. [11] X Research source Give your fish only as much food as they can consume in 20-30 seconds. Do this by sprinkling in food 3-4 times a day, which can ensure that each fish gets enough to eat and can prevent aggression. Avoid overfeeding your cichlids because this can lead to “bloat” and is often fatal."

      "content": "Treat health issues. Unhealthy fish do not make good breeding fish. If any of your Malawi cichlids are showing signs of illness, you'll need to treat them before they breed. If you don't know the cause, use a commercial fish medication. This can relieve the fish of any illnesses or parasites and help breeding. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Recognize typical symptoms of illness in fish: white spots or velvety patches on the body, missing scales, incomplete or ripped fins, bulging or cloudy eyes, ulcers or lesions, shaking and rapid breathing. You may also see behavioral signs of disease such as scraping against the tank, erratic swimming, listlessness, gasping at the surface, or sulking in a corner. [13] X Research source Talk to a pet store associate about commercial fish medications if you are unsure of what to get. Recognize that commercial fish medications are not regulated by laws or government agencies. This means the medication may not work or could harm your Malawi cichlids. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Check for readiness to breed. Although there is no definitive way to tell if your Malawis are ready to breed, there are certain signs that males and females are ready to breed. Watching them to detect signs can help you figure out if your Malawis are preparing to breed. This can also let you know when to remove males that may eat the fry. [15] X Research source Look to see if the males are digging caves, which are actually nests, in the sand and near hiding spots. Observe the shape of the female to see if she is slightly plumper than normal. If she is, this can be a sign that she is ready to lay eggs in the nest the male has dug."

      "title": "Detect attraction in your cichlids.",
      "content": "Detect attraction in your cichlids. Just as they exhibit certain signs of being ready to breed, Malawi cichlids also have specific behavior they use when trying to attract a mate. Looking for signs of attraction can alert you to watch for eggs and fry as well as remove the male so that he doesn't eat the babies. See if the male fish starts shimmying towards the female and flicking water her way with his tail. If he does, the female may follow him to his designated spot. This begins the breeding process. If the female isn't ready, she may not follow the male and he may move on to another female."

      "title": "Let nature take its course—or provide a little help.",
      "content": "Let nature take its course—or provide a little help. Many people who breed cichlids have problems with the process while others can't keep their fish away from one another. If you have several males and females from each species and have a healthy, natural environment, your cichlids may just need a little time before they start breeding. Keep in mind that cichlids are animals and will pair off naturally when they are ready. It make take a while for your cichlids to get used to their tank or their tank mates. Make sure the tank is as natural and clean as possible. Adding a little sand, clean water, or some natural stones for hiding spots if you don't already have them may stimulate the desire to breed. You also need to make sure that you're not moving hiding spaces or caves around as they give your cichlids a sense of permanence and security. This can also help them relax and find a mate. Check your feeding patterns. Overfed fish rarely breed. Is there food leftover in the tank? If so, consider cutting back one feeding a day and how long you feed the fish. For example, cut back to 20 second feedings 3 times a day to see if that helps. You can even cut down to one quality feedings a day if necessary. Use high quality foods and increase proteins with foods like spirulina."

      "title": "Observe breeding.",
      "content": "Observe breeding. If a female Malawi cichlid follows her male to his nest, then they will begin the breeding process. You can easily observe this by watching for the pair to continuously circle around one another, head to tail. Be aware the male and female Malawi cichlids may stop every half circle so that the female can collect fertilized eggs in her mouth and the male can fertilize laid eggs. After the pair has mated the female will have a mouthful of eggs. Her throat will be distended and her face will look square like. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Allow the female to rest.",
      "content": "Allow the female to rest. Once the Malawis have bred, the female will need some rest to allow the eggs to develop in her mouth. Not disturbing her for 5 days should be sufficient time for the female to rest. Be aware that she may not eat during this period. [17] X Research source Consider partitioning your tank so that the female can have her own space. This is especially true if you choose to not remove the male from the tank. Likewise, you can also put the female in a separate tank. Remember to disturb her as little as possible because she may spit out the eggs or even swallow them."

      "title": "Look for the female to release the fry.",
      "content": "Look for the female to release the fry. A female Malawi cichlid will hold her fertilized eggs in her mouth for about 21 days. At this point, she will begin to release the fry, or baby fish, from her mouth into the hiding spots or tank. Be aware that it may take a couple of days for the female to release the fry into the water. Recognize that Malawi cichlids have relatively small batches of eggs—only 10-30. You may see anywhere from 1-30 fry, depending on their survival rate. [18] X Research source Make sure that there are hiding spots in the tank under or in which the fry can hide from males. Don't be surprised if the female takes the fry into her mouth several times. The females will eventually abandon their fry, and it's important for the young fish to have hiding spots."

      "title": "Feed the fry.",
      "content": "Feed the fry. Your fry will need nutritious food to develop into healthy Malawi cichlids. There are a number of different nutritious foods you can feed Malawi cichlid fry. You can also watch if they're eating enough of their food by watching their bodies with a magnifying glass. You can feed your fry the following foods to promote growth: Brine shrimp Daphnia Microworms Grindal worms The fry are large and well developed, so infusoria is too small for them."
