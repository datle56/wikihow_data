      "title": "Sweep both sides of the rug to remove loose debris.",
      "content": "Sweep both sides of the rug to remove loose debris. Before cleaning the rug, you want to make sure that there isn’t any dirt or dust on its surface. Run a broom over the entire surface of the rug, and then flip it over to brush the other side as well. The carpet should be on a flat surface to make the cleaning process easier. You can use any broom to clean the rug, but a hand broom, which is essentially a handheld brush with bristles that are long like a traditional broom, offers the most control."

      "title": "Mix carpet shampoo with warm water and vinegar.",
      "content": "Mix carpet shampoo with warm water and vinegar. To create a gentle cleaning solution for the kilim rug, combine ½ cup (118 ml) of carpet shampoo designed for hand cleaning rugs, 4 ½ cups (1.1 l) of warm water, and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of white vinegar. Stir well to ensure that the ingredients are well blended. [1] X Research source The vinegar will help keep the colors in the rug from running."

      "title": "Dip a brush in the solution and apply it gently in vertical strokes.",
      "content": "Dip a brush in the solution and apply it gently in vertical strokes. Use a scrub brush with fairly strong bristles, and wet it so it’s saturated but not dripping. Stroke the brush over the rug in gentle vertical strokes, starting in one corner and brushing up and down in an overlapping motion. Continue brushing in the same manner until you’ve cleaned the entire rug. [2] X Research source Don’t scrub the rug too vigorously with the brush. Its fibers are more fragile when they’re wet so you may damage the rug if you’re too rough. When you reach the fringe, work the brush over them vertically. It's not necessary to go over them a second time horizontally, though. Re-wet the brush whenever it seems to be getting dry."

    {
      "title": "Go over the rug a second time with horizontal strokes.",
      "content": "Go over the rug a second time with horizontal strokes. After you’ve brushed the entire rug vertically with the cleaning solution, rub the brush over it left to right. Start in one corner of the corner, and continue brushing until you’ve cleaned the entire rug. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat the process on the other side of the rug.",
      "content": "Repeat the process on the other side of the rug. When you’ve brushed the rug with the cleaning solution in both directions, turn it over to the other side. Clean the second side in exactly the same manner, so the rug is fully cleaned. If the rug is particularly dirty, you may want to repeat the cleaning process on both sides two or three times."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse the rug with clean water.",
      "content": "Rinse the rug with clean water. Remove all of the cleaning solution and dirt from your bristle brush by running it thoroughly under water. When you’re sure there’s no cleaning solution residue left behind, wet the brush with warm water and brush over the rug vertically and then horizontally to rinse it. You may want to rinse the rug more than once with a clean, wet brush to ensure that there’s no residue left behind on the fibers. You may use a hose to rinse the rug, but don’t let it get fully soaked."
    },
    {
      "title": "Leave the rug flat to dry.",
      "content": "Leave the rug flat to dry. If possible, lay it out flat on an inclined surface. You can set it out in the sun or leave it out under a fan to help the process along. Keep in mind that it may take up to two days for the rug to dry. Flip the rug over every six hours or so to ensure that it dries on both sides. Don’t walk on the rug or place any items on it until it’s completely dry. If you notice any residue from the cleaning solution once the rug is dry, use a clean, dry brush to brush it away. If you leave the rug outside, set it on grass or gravel so it can drain properly."

      "title": "Vacuum the rug weekly.",
      "content": "Vacuum the rug weekly. You won't have to scrub your kilim rug too often if you keep it free of dirt and dust. Running a vacuum over it once a week is usually sufficient, though you may want to vacuum more if the rug is in a heavily trafficked area. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Use low suction.",
      "content": "Use low suction. You can use a vacuum cleaner to keep your kilim rug clean, but you shouldn’t use a high suction setting or the revolving brush on your vacuum. Both can snag the fibers and cause damage. [5] X Research source If your vacuum doesn't have a low suction setting, use the extension hose or crevice tool attachment to go over the fringe. Use a small handheld vacuum if you have one. They are not powerful enough to damage the fibers."

    {
      "title": "Vacuum both sides of the rug.",
      "content": "Vacuum both sides of the rug. Because a kilim rug is hand-knotted, it doesn’t have the backing that other rugs often have. To keep it clean, make sure to run the vacuum over both sides to remove all of the dirt and debris. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid vacuuming the fringe.",
      "content": "Avoid vacuuming the fringe. The fringe definitely adds to a kilim rug’s charm, so you want to keep it intact. Don’t run your vacuum over the fringe because it may snag the fibers and unravel or tear them off. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove any solids in the spill. If the food or another item that you’ve spilled contains any solid pieces, use a spoon to carefully scoop them up. Avoid using too much pressure to remove them or you may wind up pressing the items into the fibers and making the stain worse. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Blot away as much of the liquid as possible. Use a clean sponge or piece of paper towel to carefully press against the stain and remove the excess moisture. Start blotting at the outer edge of the spill and work in toward the center so you don’t spread the stain.

      "content": "Pass clean water through the stained area. Fill a small glass, mug, or bowl with clean, warm water. Pour it over the area with the spill so it rinses the rug and passes into the container below. [11] X Research source The amount of water that you'll need depends on the size of the spill. Start with ½ cup (118 ml) and add more if necessary to fully rinse the area."

Place the rug flat on the ground again, and use a clean sponge or piece of paper towel to blot the area with the spill once more. [12] X Research source If there is a stain left behind even after you rinse and blot the stain, you should consult a professional rug cleaner to handle the job. Trying to remove it yourself may damage the rug."

Pour it over the affected spot on the rug to rinse away any remaining urine. The container beneath will catch the water so you can discard it. Allow the rug to dry for 12 to 24 hours without walking or placing any items on it. [17] X Research source Avoid using urine removal products since the enzymes in the solution may damage the fibers."
