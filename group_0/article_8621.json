      "content": "Use a wooden or plastic toothpick to carefully pluck out any dust or dirt. Take the point of the toothpick and poke it just barely into the microphone hole, twist it around, and pull it back out. Repeat as needed until clean. To avoid damaging your iPhone: Don’t push the toothpick too far into the microphone. It may be helpful to start at an angle. Insert the point so it’s just past the inner rim of the opening but not farther. You can puncture the microphone if you jam it in down the center. You’ll feel it pop if you’ve gone too far. Make small, gentle movements and go slowly. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Try a super-soft bristled toothbrush for a more gentle method. If the idea of shoving a wooden stick into your phone is too scary, try using a clean toothbrush with super-soft bristles. Gently brush the microphone hole to sweep away any blockages."

      "title": "Opt for a small paint brush if you don't have a spare toothbrush.",
      "content": "Opt for a small paint brush if you don't have a spare toothbrush. If you happen to have a small craft brush like the kind that comes with a children’s watercolor kit, you can use it as a cleaning tool. Brush around the microphone and allow the thin bristles to poke into the hole. Make sure the brush is 100% clean and dry before using it, or you'll just make the problem worse. If possible, use a brand new paint brush."

      "title": "Use compressed air to gently puff away any stuck debris.",
      "content": "Use compressed air to gently puff away any stuck debris. Compressed air is a great tool for cleaning dust and dirt from inside electronics and other hard to reach places. Pick up a can at your local retailer. Note: Apple does not recommend using compressed air on your phone. [2] X Research source Use it at your own risk. Never blow the air directly into the hole as that can damage your phone. Aim the blast at an angle parallel to the microphone to avoid spraying coolant into the microphone, which can damage it."

      "content": "Use an electronics cleaning putty to pull out any stubborn gunk. You can purchase this product online or in stores. Take a pinch of the putty and press it gently into the microphone hole and quickly remove. Repeat as needed til your microphone is squeaky clean. [3] X Research source Do not allow the putty to sit for more than a couple seconds or it can begin to ooze and ruin the device. This putty works great for clearing debris out of the rear camera microphone as well."

      "title": "Use blue poster tack if you don't have any cleaning putty.",
      "content": "Use blue poster tack if you don't have any cleaning putty. Take a pinch of the poster tack and push it against your microphone and remove it promptly. Don't squish the tack into your microphone or it will get stuck too. Also, don't leave the tack on your phone for too long, or it could damage the surface of your device or get stuck inside the microphone further."
