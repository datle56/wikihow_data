      "title": "Smash and peel the garlic cloves.",
      "content": "Smash and peel the garlic cloves. Take 5 to 6 cloves of garlic, and pound the side of a chef’s knife blade against them to smash them. Once the cloves are smashed, remove their skins and discard. Set the garlic aside for a moment. [1] X Research source When you’re selecting your garlic, try to find cloves that are as large and thick as possible."

      "title": "Heat the olive oil in a skillet.",
      "content": "Heat the olive oil in a skillet. Place a large skillet on the stove, and add approximately ¼ inch (.63 cm) of olive oil to it. Turn the burner to medium, and allow the oil to heat for 3 to 5 minutes. [2] X Research source You can reduce the oil to ⅛ inch if you prefer. However, keep in mind that by caramelizing the garlic in it, you’ll infuse the oil with the flavor so you can use it for pasta, salad dressings, and other dishes."

    {
      "title": "Cook the garlic in the oil until it's golden.",
      "content": "Cook the garlic in the oil until it's golden. When the oil has heated for several minutes, place the smashed garlic cloves in the skillet. Lower the heat to medium-low, and allow the garlic to cook until the edges have a golden color, which should take approximately 2 to 6 minutes. [3] X Research source If the garlic looks like it’s turning brown, turn the heat down to low."

    {
      "title": "Remove the garlic from the pan, and use or store it.",
      "content": "Remove the garlic from the pan, and use or store it. When the garlic has caramelized, use a slotted spoon to remove it from the skillet. If you plan to use it right away, separate it from the oil. However, if you plan to store the garlic for later use, it’s a good idea to leave it in the oil because the oil will help preserve it. [4] X Research source The garlic will keep for up to two weeks in the refrigerator. If you’re separating the oil and garlic but want to save the oil for future use, pour it in a glass jar and store in the refrigerator."
    },
    {
      "title": "Preheat the oven.",
      "content": "Preheat the oven. To ensure that your oven is hot enough to caramelize the garlic, it’s important to preheat it. Set the temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius), and make sure that the oven rack is set in the middle position. [5] X Research source Keep an eye on the oven so you know when it’s fully preheated. Many models will beep or flash an indicator light to let you know that it’s reached the desired temperature."

    {
      "title": "Peel and trim the garlic.",
      "content": "Peel and trim the garlic. Leave the head of garlic intact, but peel away the outer papery layers from the bulb. Use a sharp knife to carefully trim away approximately ¼ inch (.63 cm) from the top of the head so the tops of the individual cloves are visible. [6] X Research source When you’re peeling and trimming the garlic head, make sure that all the cloves remain connected to one another. You don’t want them to come loose."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drizzle the garlic with the oil.",
      "content": "Drizzle the garlic with the oil. Once the garlic is peeled and trimmed, place it on a piece of foil. Next, drizzle approximately 1 to 2 teaspoons of olive oil over it to cover all of it. [7] X Research source When you’re pouring the oil over the garlic, make sure that it sinks down into and between the individual cloves."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bake the garlic.",
      "content": "Bake the garlic. Wrap the foil up over the garlic head, and place it on the middle rack of the oven to bake. After 40 minutes, unwrap it and check the garlic. The individual cloves be a deep golden color and soft when pierced with a knife. If the garlic isn’t fully caramelized yet, let it keep baking but check on it in 10 minute intervals until it’s done. [8] X Research source The exact roasting time necessary to caramelize the garlic will depend on its size, age, and variety. When you check on the garlic, be sure to use an oven mitt or pot holder because the foil will be very hot."

    {
      "title": "Allow the garlic to cool, and serve or store.",
      "content": "Allow the garlic to cool, and serve or store. When the garlic has finished baking, remove it from the oven, unwrap it, and allow it to cool for approximately five minutes. To remove the garlic from the paper, push on the bottom of the clove. You can use the caramelized garlic right away or store it in the refrigerator for later use. [9] X Research source The garlic will last up to two weeks in the refrigerator. If you freeze it, it can last up to three months."

    {
      "title": "Season the garlic.",
      "content": "Season the garlic. Take four heads of garlic that have been cut in half horizontally, and place them on a piece of foil. Drizzle 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil over the garlic halves, and sprinkle a pinch of a salt over them. You can omit the salt if you’re trying to limit sodium in your diet."

    {
      "title": "Seal the garlic in foil with thyme.",
      "content": "Seal the garlic in foil with thyme. Once the garlic halves are covered with the oil and salt, put them back together to form a full head. Tuck four sprigs of thyme among them, and fold the foil up around the garlic to create a sealed pouch. If you aren’t a fan of thyme, you can substitute rosemary or omit the herbs entirely."

      "title": "Cook the garlic in the slow cooker until caramelized.",
      "content": "Cook the garlic in the slow cooker until caramelized. Place the foil pouch with the garlic inside your slow cooker. Turn the heat setting to low, and allow the garlic to cook until it is caramelized, which should take approximately six hours."
