    {
      "title": "Start your entry with the first author's last name.",
      "content": "Start your entry with the first author's last name. When a source has 2 authors, list the last name of the first author's name in your Works Cited entry, followed by a comma. Then add the author's first name.

      "title": "Provide the second author's name in first name-last name format.",
      "content": "Provide the second author's name in first name-last name format. After the first author's name, type the word \"and\" followed by the second author's name. Reverse the order from the first author, typing their first name followed by their last name. Place a period at the end of the second author's name. Then continue the rest of your entry. [3] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source To continue the previous example, you would write the names of the two authors as \"Potter, Harry and Luna Lovegood.\""

    {
      "title": "Use the abbreviation \"et al.\"",
      "content": "Use the abbreviation \"et al.\" for works with 3 or more authors. \"Et al.\" is an abbreviation for the Latin phrase \"et alia,\" which means \"and others.\" For 3 or more authors, type the first author's last name, followed by a comma. Then type their first name. Add the abbreviation \"et al.\" with no intervening punctuation. [4] X Research source For example, suppose you were using a book as a source that was written by Severus Snape, Minerva McGonagall, and Horace Slughorn. Your Works Cited entry would start \"Snape, Severus et al.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "List both authors' names for works with 2 authors.",
      "content": "List both authors' names for works with 2 authors. When you paraphrase or quote from a source, MLA style requires a citation in-text that will lead your readers to your full Works Cited entry. Often this takes the form of a parenthetical citation at the end of the sentence that includes the authors' last names and the page number where the material you paraphrased or quoted appears. Place the sentence's closing punctuation outside the closing parenthesis. [5] X Research source For example, you might write \"The class intended to teach students how to defend themselves against the dark arts, however, was ineffective (Potter and Lovegood 47).\" [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use \"et al.\"",
      "content": "Use \" et al .\" for in-text citations to works with 3 or more authors. If your source has 3 or more authors, it is only necessary to include the last name of the first author, who is also listed in your Works Cited entry. Follow the name with the abbreviation \"et al.\" and the page number where the material you paraphrased or cited appears. [7] X Research source For example, you might write \"Hogwarts professors were deeply disturbed that Voldemort appeared to have infiltrated the school (Snape et al. 92).\" [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Omit authors' names from your parenthetical citation when they appear in your text.",
      "content": "Omit authors' names from your parenthetical citation when they appear in your text. If you want to include the author's names in the text of your paper, there's no need to repeat them in the parenthetical citation. Simply place a parenthetical at the end of the sentence with the page number where the material quoted or paraphrased appears. [9] X Research source For example, you might write \"Potter and Lovegood described the Defense Against the Dark Arts class as worthless when it came to teaching them anything they could use to protect themselves from a wizard as powerful as Voldemort (47)."
