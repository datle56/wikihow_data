If your dog suddenly is unwilling to put any weight on a particular foot, is excessively licking it, or tracking blood, odds are they have a paw pad injury.

[2] X Research source Check for bleeding, cuts or abrasions, debris stuck in the pad, or an injured dew claw . Your dog may also have a ripped nail, which can cause a lot of bleeding. Approach your dog cautiously, since they may be prone to snapping if they’re in pain. Be gentle and talk in a soothing voice."

However, if the cut is deep, swollen, discolored, bleeds excessively, or oozes fluids other than blood, consult a vet.

Gently take your dog’s paw and swish it around in the water for 1-2 minutes to clean the wound and rinse out any debris. [4] X Research source If your dog is hesitant or resists, simply run the paw under lukewarm water instead, targeting the wound as best you can. Also, remove any easily dislodged debris with tweezers. If the debris is deeply embedded, see a vet. Avoid the use of any antiseptics or antibiotics without vet approval. [5] X Research source"

If your dog's paw continues to bleed after you have removed any debris and washed the wound, use a clean bandage or cloth to apply light pressure to the area until the bleeding stops.

      "content": "Wrap the injured paw with a self-adhering bandage. With light pressure, wrap the paw with a self-adhering bandage, ideally one made for animals (such as Vertrap, Pet-Flex, or Pet Wrap). Leave the front toes out, and wrap the paw up to the wrist joint. [8] X Research source The claws of the paw should be nearly touching. [9] X Research source Check that the wrapping is snug enough that it stays on their foot but loose enough that you can place two fingers under the bandaging. If the claws are separated or if the foot feels cold, you have tied the bandage too tight. Remove it and rewrap the paw. Tying the bandage too tight can cut off the blood supply to the paw and may even cause limb death. Call your vet if you are worried about tying the bandage too tightly. This will not only protect the injury from being infected, it will also offer additional cushioning for the foot pad."

Since dogs sweat from their paws, keep a close eye on the bandage to ensure it stays dry and clean.
