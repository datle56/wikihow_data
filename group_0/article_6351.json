While some Catholics have a prayer routine, there’s no right or wrong way to do it! Simply take a moment to relax and talk to God. Here are a few tips: [35] X Research source Try not to rush into prayer. Think about what you’d like to say and calm your nerves. What would you like to ask God? What do you need help with? Meditate on what you’d like to say. Is there something you’d like more clarity on? Taking the time to analyze your thoughts can help you articulate your message to God. [36] X Research source Sit in a comfortable position. While you can pray anywhere, if you’re planning to pray for a long time, it may be best to find a space that’s free of distractions and is comfortable. Say “thanks” to God. As Holy Bible expert Olivia Woodford explains, the best way to stay praying is to “express gratitude” and tell the Lord what you’re thankful for. Have trust in the Lord. Know that God can hear you no matter where you are—He’s always there to listen."
