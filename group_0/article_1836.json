      "content": "Chat them up during a time when they don’t look busy. A simple way to begin conversation is by mentioning something that interested you during class. Introduce yourself and tell them what you’re studying or would like to study. Then you can ask them the same. [1] X Research source You don’t have to ask them to be your study buddy right away. Take some time to get to know them first. That way, you’ll know if your personalities are a match. Take interest in what they have to say, make eye contact, and pay attention. This will show them that you are interested in what they have to say. You’ll learn whether or not their personality and interests will complement yours."

      "title": "Put out a public request for a study buddy.",
      "content": "Put out a public request for a study buddy. You may have people in your immediate social network who are also looking for a study buddy but haven’t spoken up. They may even be people that you already know well and feel comfortable around.

      "content": "Observe your classmates. If there’s a particular classmate of yours that asks interesting questions, makes comments that intrigue you, or you already know you work well with, consider approaching them. Chances are, they have the same interests as you. Also observe those who are in the same school clubs as you are or are interested in the same extra-curricular activities. While you and your study buddy don’t necessarily have to have the same level of intelligence, you should share a similar level of commitment and get along well. [7] X Research source Remember, your energies will influence each other’s work habits."

Are there any places you absolutely wouldn’t study?” ”Are you easily distracted while studying?” ”Do you like to take a lot of breaks?” ”Do you have any major time commitments that get in the way of studying?”"

      "content": "Ask them if they’d be interested in being your regular study buddy. The best way to ask someone for something is to be clear and direct about what you want. That way, they will know you’re sincere. They’re likely to be flattered as well. People usually feel complimented and excited--not burdened--when they’re asked for assistance. [8] X Research source An example could be: “I’ve enjoyed spending time with you lately, and it seems like we really get along and have a lot in common. I’ve been looking for a study buddy recently. Would you be interested in being my study buddy?”"
