      "content": "Buy pre-bonded keratin extensions and a melting connector tool. Purchase pre-bonded extensions with the glue already on the tips. The color, length, and weight of the extensions is up to you! Don't forget to buy the melting connector tool (some brands call it a hot fusion wand). This tool heats the keratin glue on the tip of each extension so it bonds to your real hair. [1] X Research source Keratin extensions are usually sold in packs of 10-20 individual strands. If you want to apply a full head of extensions, you'll need 100-180 strands. [2] X Research source Get extensions that match your hair's texture so they’ll blend in naturally. Buy pre-bonded keratin extensions and the melting tool online or at a salon."

      "title": "Wash your hair with clarifying shampoo and dry it completely.",
      "content": "Wash your hair with clarifying shampoo and dry it completely. Clarifying shampoo strips oils and product buildup out of your hair so the keratin glue can bond strongly to your real hair. Extensions may fall out early if you don’t get a good bond during the application process, so don't skip this part! [3] X Research source Let your hair air-dry completely or blow dry it before applying extensions."

Pile all of your hair on top of your head and use a rattail comb or your fingers to section out the bottom 1 in (2.5 cm) of your hair. Make sure this thin, horizontal row of hair stretches from one end of your nape to the other. [4] X Research source Go ahead and plug in the melting connector tool so it can heat up for a few minutes."

      "title": "Grab a small clump of hair about the same width as the extension.",
      "content": "Grab a small clump of hair about the same width as the extension. Start on one side of your head so you can work systematically to the other side. Pick up a small chunk of hair about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the edge of your hair. The chunk's thickness should be about equal to the extension. [5] X Research source Be sure to leave a thin layer of hair beneath the bottom row so the extensions won't be visible when your hair is in a ponytail. Each chunk of hair needs to be the same thickness as the extension so your hair can support the extension's weight. If the extension is too heavy, it might pull out or damage your natural hair. [6] X Research source Start 1 in (2.5 cm) from the edge so the extensions won’t be visible when you have your hair up."

      "content": "Place the extension next to your real hair 1 in (2.5 cm) from your scalp. Hold the extension so the tip with the pre-bonded glue is facing your scalp. Put the extension right next to the chunk of hair, leaving about 1 in (2.5 cm) of room between the extension and your scalp. [7] X Research source If you bond extensions closer to your scalp than 1 in (2.5 cm), they'll be tight and uncomfortable."

Squeeze the tool to clamp it down. Make sure the tool is directly on top of the keratin bond so the glue melts evenly. After a few seconds, unclamp the tool and pull it away. [8] X Research source The melting connector tool melts the glue and fuses the extension to your natural hair. [9] X Research source Don’t clamp for longer than 5 seconds. Too much heat can damage your natural hair and the extension. [10] X Research source"

Then, roll them together with your fingers for a few seconds to finish fusing the extension to your hair. [11] X Research source Since the glue melts easily without a ton of heat, you should be able to pinch the hair right after you move the tool away. If the glue is too hot to touch, give it a few seconds to cool and try applying less heat for the next extension."

      "content": "Keep applying extensions 2 in (5.1 cm) apart until you get to the end of the row. The spacing between extensions depends on your goal—the closer you put the extensions to one another, the thicker your hair will look. If you aren’t sure, 2 in (5.1 cm) spacing is pretty standard. Continue grabbing chunks of hair and fusing extensions to them until you reach the end of the horizontal row of hair. [12] X Research source"

Once you finish adding the first row of extensions, move up your scalp about 1 in (2.5 cm) and use the end of a rattail comb to pull out the next thin, horizontal row of hair. Work from one end of the row to the other, continuing to space the extensions 2 in (5.1 cm) apart. Once you finish the second row, move up 2 in (5.1 cm) and pull down another thin, horizontal row of hair. Continue applying extensions using the same process. This is probably starting to get a bit tedious, but your new look will be totally worth it! [13] X Research source Each time you pull down a horizontal row, be sure to leave the rest of your hair clipped up and out of the way. Working with 1 in (2.5 cm) horizontal rows is standard for a full head application, but you can put more space between rows if you want. The more space you put between horizontal rows, the less voluminous your results will be."

The top layer of hair that's still clipped up will cover the last row of extensions. Once you apply the final row, remove the clip and shake out your hair. Run your fingers through your hair gently while the hair is still warm to blend in the extensions so they look natural. [14] X Research source Give the keratin glue about 30 minutes to cool before brushing your hair. Wait 48 hours before washing your hair so the bonds can seal completely."

Buy sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner with plenty of proteins and moisturizing ingredients to keep your hair healthy and strong. Wash the extensions by gently working in the shampoo from the top down and rinse well. Apply conditioner from the mid shaft to the ends and rinse it out thoroughly. [15] X Research source Sulfates can break down the keratin glue and cause extensions to fall out. [16] X Research source Products usually say “sulfate-free” on the label. To confirm, check the ingredients for sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate. [17] X Research source"

Gel, mousse, and other styling products are safe to use, but stick with lightweight, oil-free formulas. [20] X Research source Heavy product buildup and oils can weaken the keratin bonds. Your extensions won't be visible when your hair is in a ponytail, top knot, or other up-dos. You may want to avoid half ponytails since the extensions might be visible."
