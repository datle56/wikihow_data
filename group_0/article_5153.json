      "content": "Check what type of blaster you have. There are four main kinds of Nerf blasters that take darts – Nerf Dart Tag blasters, Elite blasters, Nerf Mega blasters, and N-Strike blasters. They each take a specific type of dart, so you’ll need to know which type of blaster you have before you select darts. There should be a molded label on the side of your blaster that says what kind it is."

      "title": "Purchase MEGA darts for MEGA blasters.",
      "content": "Purchase MEGA darts for MEGA blasters. The MEGA N-Strike sub-series uses large, red MEGA darts or mega accustrike darts which are better. MEGA blasters are usually large and red."

      "content": "Select the right darts for your N-strike blaster. The Nerf N-strike series uses a few different types of darts, depending on the type of blaster you have. The darts for this series are mostly not interchangeable like the Dart Tag or Elite blasters, so be very careful when selecting your darts. The name of the gun should be on the side of the gun, either on a sticker or etched in to the plastic. The Stampede ECS, Raider Rapid FireCS-35 Blaster, and Longstrike CS-6 all take clip system darts or elites, and airstrikes The Barricade RV-10 and the Maverick Rev-6 take Whistler darts, but can also use Elite darts. The Maverick uses suction darts, but can also use Elite darts. The Nite-Finder X-3 uses glow-in-the-dark suction darts, but, again, can also use Elite darts. The Reflex IX-1 and the Jolt Blaster take Elite darts. The Nerf Modulus line, despite being marked as an N-Strike subseries, use Elite darts."

      "content": "Make sure your gun doesn’t use discs. Some Nerf guns use discs instead of darts. Those guns will usually have a drum that the discs go into, and you’ll notice that the drum is way too big for the darts. Don’t get darts if you need discs!"

      "content": "Shop at an online retailer. Online retailers like eBay and Amazon are a great option for buying new darts for your Nerf gun. You can filter your search by brand, the type of gun you have, or the darts you need. You can also use Nerf's official website, although if your gun has been discontinued, it might not be listed.
