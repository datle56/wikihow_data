With a point system, everything you do in the class will be worth a certain number of points.

You can get these numbers from the assignments themselves (if your teacher listed your point score) or you can get them by asking your teacher for your scores. [3] X Research source If you are trying to guess what grade you will end up with, you will have to guess how well you will score on future assignments in order to calculate your final grade. You can guess these numbers by choosing a number of points similar to the percentages you have been getting or you can choose a higher number of points (to see what would happen if you study harder) or a lower number of points (to see what would happen if you studied less)."

You can use the points only for assignments so far or you can use the number of points for the entire class. It depends on the information available to you and your reasons for calculating your grade. [4] X Research source An example of this equation would look like this: Sam has completed ten assignments and one test. Altogether, these assignments were worth 200 points. Sam added together their scores and found that they had earned 175 points. Sam calculates the grade (175/200=.87) to find a score of 87% for their class grade."

      "content": "Determine if you are using weighted assignments. Your teacher may be using a weighted grading system. This means that your work will still have points, but those points will be worth different amounts based on what category it falls into. [5] X Research source Common categories include homework, tests, quizzes, final exam, and participation. [6] X Research source Each category will be worth a certain percentage of your grade. To get a good grade, you will need to score all or a majority of the points in each category. However, scoring fewer points in a category which is only worth a small percentage of your grade will not affect your grade as much as if the category was worth a large percentage. For ease of calculating, we will assume that each category is worth a number of point equal to its percentage weight (For example, a category worth 20% will be worth 20 points). This should make the total number of “points” for the class equal 100, which should make it significantly easier to calculate your grade. Different teachers will prioritize different things in their class, based on their philosophy of teaching and what they believe is most important. For example, some teachers will most heavily weight the final exam, whereas others will most heavily weight participation."

In order to figure out how much you need to raise your grade with a point system, you will first need to decide what letter grade you want in the class overall and what the corresponding percentage is (you can use the chart below). Next, use this percentage to determine how many points, out of the total number of available points in the class, are necessary to earn this percentage. Compare the number of points you’re already earned against how many points are needed to get the grade you want. Compare that number against the point count for the work you have not yet done. If the number of points available is small than the number of points needed to gain that grade, you will not be able to achieve the grade you want without some form of extra credit."

The easiest method will be to ask your teacher for help and advice. [11] X Research source You will want to focus on doing better in the categories which are more heavily weighted. This will raise your grade faster than focusing on the lesser categories. However, if those more lightly weighted categories are easy to raise (such as regular attendance to raise a participation grade), then you certainly should not ignore them."

Standard-based grading is a system where all of your work can earn a set number of points and the number of points you earn directly results in your grade.

      "content": "Understand rank-based grading. Rank-based grading is a more complicated system that has been adopted by some teachers and schools. In this system, all of the grades earned across all of your classmates will be placed on a curve. The majority of students will receive a middle range grade, whereas students who score higher or lower than the middle group will receive correspondingly high or low scores. Where you placed on the curve will then determine your final grade, so it can complicate your calculations. For example, you may get an “A” (even if you scored only an 85%) if your classmates all scored worse than you did. This system can be used to determine your entire grade or just particular parts. Sometimes teachers will apply it only to a final exam, for example."
