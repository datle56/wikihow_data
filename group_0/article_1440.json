Try your best to hold them open with your thumb and index finger. If you have no luck, ask someone to help you hold your eyelids open and apply the ointment. It can be tough to stop blinking when the tube is close to your eye and you feel the strange sensation of the ointment. Try to relax and remind yourself that the medicine will help you feel better. It's a little easier to apply an accurate dose of eye ointment than it is to use eye drops, which are easily washed away if you blink a lot."
