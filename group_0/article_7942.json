This will prevent people from tracking dirt into your house."

      "content": "Wash the tiles with clean water once per week. Every few days (or whenever you notice a little dirt or grime building up) you should clean your outdoor porcelain tires with warm water. Fill a bucket with clean, warm water and mop the tiles. This will remove most of the dirt and keep the tiles looking their best. Try to wring most of the water out of the mop. You don't want excess moisture just sitting on the tiles."
