      "content": "Motorola moto tag. The moto tag by Motorola is an upcoming tracker that is very similar to the AirTag in both specifications and design, but works with all Android devices (running Android 9 and up) and the Google Find My Device network. The moto tag has an Ultra-Wideband sensor (UWB) just like Apple's AirTag, which allows the tracker to be very precise. [1] X Research source The moto tag will be available on August 2nd, 2024. One tag retails for $29.99, and a four-pack is $99.99. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Chipolo ONE Point. The ONE Point by Chipolo is a Bluetooth tracker made specifically to work with Google's Find My Device Network (for Android devices running at least Android 9). However, unlike the moto tag or the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2, the ONE Point doesn't have UWB technology and relies only on Bluetooth to track your items. The ONE Point retails for $28 for a single tracker and $112 for a four-pack."

      "content": "Pebblebee Clip for Android. Pebblebee has released a version of their Clip Bluetooth tracker that specifically works with Google's Find My Device, though it also works with the Pebblebee app, which is available for both iOS and Android. Like the Chipolo ONE Point, this tracker does not have UWB, so it's a bit less precise than other trackers that do. The Pebblebee Clip for Android retails as a single pack for $29.99, a two-pack for $59.99, or a four-pack for $120."

      "content": "Tile Mate. The Tile Mate was first released in 2016, years before Apple released the AirTag in 2021. However, unlike the AirTag, the Tile Mate (nor any of Tile's products) doesn't have UWB, so it isn't as precise as other trackers that do feature that technology. It also only works with the Tile app and doesn't connect to the Google Find My Device network. The Tile Mate retails for $24.99 for a single-pack, $47.99 for a two-pack, and $74.99 for a four-pack."

      "content": "Functionally, AirTags don't work with Android. You can't track your items with an AirTag if you have an Android device, so for the most part, the two don't mix. However, Android devices have an \"unknown tracker alerts\" setting that will notify you if any Google Find My Device network-compatible tracker or Apple AirTag is traveling with you.
