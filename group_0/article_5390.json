      "content": "Make sure you are using a perfect circle. This method won't work with ellipses, ovals, or anything but a real circle . A circle is defined as all the points on a plane that are an equal distance from a single center point. The lids of jars are good household objects to use for this exercise. You should be able to calculate pi roughly because in order to get exact results of pi, you will need to have a very thin lead (or whatever you are using). Even the sharpest pencil graphite could be huge to have exact results. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Measure the circumference of a circle as accurately as you can. The circumference is the length that goes around the entire edge of the circle. Since the circumference is round, it can be difficult to measure (that's why pi is so important). [4] X Research source Lay a string over the circle as closely as you can. Mark the string off where it circles back around, and then measure the string length with a ruler ."

      "content": "Use the formula. The circumference of a circle is found with the formula C=πd=2πr . Thus, pi equals a circle's circumference divided by its diameter. Plug your numbers into a calculator: the result should be roughly 3.14. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Repeat this process with several different circles, and then average the results. This will give you more accurate results. Your measurements might not be perfect on any given circle, but over time they should average out to a pretty accurate calculation of pi. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Use the Gregory-Leibniz series.",
      "content": "Use the Gregory-Leibniz series. Mathematicians have found several different mathematical series that, if carried out infinitely, will accurately calculate pi to a great number of decimal places. Some of these are so complex they require supercomputers to process them. One of the simplest, however, is the Gregory-Leibniz series. [8] X Research source Though not very efficient, it will get closer and closer to pi with every iteration, accurately producing pi to five decimal places with 500,000 iterations. Here is the formula to apply. π=(4/1)-(4/3)+(4/5)-(4/7)+(4/9)-(4/11)+(4/13)-(4/15) ⋯ Take 4 and subtract 4 divided by 3. Then add 4 divided by 5. Then subtract 4 divided by 7. Continue alternating between adding and subtracting fractions with a numerator of 4 and a denominator of each subsequent odd number. The more times you do this, the closer you will get to pi."

      "title": "Try the Nilakantha series.",
      "content": "Try the Nilakantha series. This is another infinite series to calculate pi that is fairly easy to understand. While somewhat more complicated, it converges on pi much quicker than the Leibniz formula. [9] X Research source π=3+4/(2·3·4)-4/(4·5·6)+4/(6·7·8)-4/(8·9·10)+4/(10·11·12)-4/(12·13·14) ⋯ For this formula, take three and start alternating between adding and subtracting fractions with numerators of 4 and denominators that are the product of three consecutive integers which increase with every new iteration. Each subsequent fraction begins its set of integers with the highest one used in the previous fraction. Carry this out even a few times and the results get fairly close to pi."

      "content": "Try this experiment to calculate pi by throwing hotdogs. Pi, it turns out, also has a place in an interesting thought experiment called Buffon's Needle Problem, [10] X Research source which seeks to determine the likelihood that randomly tossed uniform elongated objects will land either between or crossing a series of parallel lines on the floor. It turns out that if the distance between the lines is the same as the length of the tossed objects, the number of times the objects land across the lines out of a large number of throws can be used to calculate pi. Check out the above wikiHow article link for a fun breakdown of this experiment using thrown food. Scientists and mathematicians have not figured out a way to calculate pi exactly, since they have not been able to find a material so thin that it will work to find exact calculations.

The reason this is called a Limit is because the result of it is 'limited' to pi. As you increase your number x, the result will get closer and closer to the value of pi."
