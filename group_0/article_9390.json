If you found a headline you’d like to share with Ellen for her segment “Correct Me If I’m Wrong,” want to show off your special skill, or just want to tell Ellen a personal story, you can get in touch with Ellen’s team by filling out an online message form on ellentube, the companion website to Ellen’s television empire. Just visit the web page, select the reason why you want to get in touch with Ellen, and fill out the requested information. To submit an online form, you’ll have to provide your name, email address, phone number, and home address in addition to the photo, video, or message you want to send. Try not to be discouraged if you don’t hear back right away. The Ellen Show receives lots of messages every day, and it might take them a while to read yours."
