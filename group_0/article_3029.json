      "content": "A femboy is a person whose self-expression is traditionally feminine. The femboy style and aesthetic typically combines feminine clothing and accessories, such as skirts and knee-high socks, with more traditionally masculine pieces, like T-shirts or hoodies. Folks who identify as femboys are typically in their teens or 20s. [1] X Research source Some people prefer a stricter definition where only teenagers can be referred to as femboys, while others are cool with anyone under 30 calling themselves a femboy. [2] X Research source The most important part of being a femboy is acting young and boyish (or “girlish”) and feeling young at heart. Pop stars such as Harry Styles, who include feminine clothes and accessories in their 'fits, have made a lot more guys feel comfortable being out as a femboy."

      "content": "A femboy can be any sexuality or gender, but they’re often men. Being a femboy has nothing to do with your gender or sexuality. A lot of femboys are straight, but just as many are gay or bisexual. This distinction sets femboys apart from crossdressers (who usually identify as heterosexual) and drag queens (who usually identify as queer). [3] X Research source The #FemboyFriday trend on TikTok, in particular, made this aesthetic popular with cis straight guys. [4] X Research source A key point of the whole femboy aesthetic is that acting or dressing in traditionally feminine ways doesn't say anything about who you are or who you're attracted to.

      "content": "Shop at thrift stores for women's clothing and accessories. Thrift stores allow you to try a lot of different styles without spending a lot of money. That way, you can find what you like and figure out how you want to style it. The low prices also give you the freedom to take risks. [6] X Research source Pleated skirts tend to look great on guys, as do tunics (especially if you have broad shoulders). You might also alter some of the clothes you already own to give them a more feminine vibe. For example, you might trim a T-shirt to bare your midriff or for an off-the-shoulder look. Look for a feminine cardigan that could replace a jacket or hoodie in a more masculine look. It's also pretty easy to find a women's cardigan that will fit your body. Check out women's fashion magazines and bloggers for inspiration. There are lots of femboy style and fashion inspiration boards on Pinterest as well. In addition to the clothing and styles themselves, pay attention to how women wear the clothes and how they pose in them."

      "content": "Play around with makeup if it's part of your look. While femboys don't have to wear makeup, some of them do. Researchers studying a group of femboys on TikTok noted that only 2% of their sample wore makeup. [7] X Research source That being said, a little eyeliner is a pretty quick and easy way to feminize an otherwise masculine fit. Many femboys who do wear makeup tend to keep it simple, much like how a young woman might do everyday makeup . Some femboys also use makeup in the same way that women traditionally do (to smooth their skin tone or accentuate their best features). You can also use makeup to look more feminine or look more androgynous . Femboys who are bolder with their makeup often offer tutorials on social media to help you achieve the same look.

      "content": "Experiment with traditionally feminine hairstyles. Femboys tend to grow their hair out a little on the longer side and favor softer, trendy cuts. Some also go for bold, asymmetric cuts or bright colors. Don't be afraid to ask for a traditionally feminine cut—hair is hair; if the stylist can cut a wolf cut on a girl, they can do it on anyone! [9] X Research source If your hair is super short, you might get it trimmed into a pixie cut , which you can style in more feminine ways while it grows out. Many femboys get a longer layered bob , which can be styled in many different ways and can look either masc or femme. If you have textured hair, twists are a great option."

      "content": "Spritz on a feminine perfume. Culturally, most people associate fruity and floral scents with women (and spicy, musky scents with men). [10] X Research source Your scent can be an important part of your overall persona and femboy aesthetic. You might try a soap or body wash in a more feminine scent as well. Layering scents with your body wash, lotion, and some perfume adds complexity."

      "content": "Feminize masculine clothing with jewelry. One study of femboys on TikTok showed that more than half of them wore jewelry regularly in their video posts. [11] X Research source Jewelry can be a quick and easy way to feminize even the most masculine attire. If you're just getting started and don't have much feminine clothing, a few inexpensive pieces of jewelry are a great investment. For example, you might go for a strand of freshwater pearls , which works great for feminizing a basic t-shirt and blazer. Throw on a pleated mini skirt ] and you're ready to go!"

      "title": "Shave or wax your legs.",
      "content": "Shave or wax your legs. A lot of femboys who wear short skirts and bare their legs will also tend to shave so that they have smooth legs. Shaving or waxing your legs can also help you feel a little more traditionally feminine, since women are societally encouraged to remove their body hair. Some femboys shave or wax all of their body hair, but remember—shaving isn't required to be a femboy (or to fit any gender or aesthetic!). It's just a matter of what you're most comfortable with. Keep in mind that shaving can be a commitment. If you change your mind, expect the stubble to be prickly and itchy for a little while."

      "content": "Get your nails done. The simple act of going to a salon and getting a manicure will help you embrace your feminine side. Plus, salons tend to be super feminine places, so soak up the vibe while you're there. You don't have to splurge on a professional manicure all the time. You can learn how to do your nails or even throw a manicure party with a few femboy friends."

      "title": "Develop a soft, higher-pitched femboy voice.",
      "content": "Develop a soft, higher-pitched femboy voice. While not all femboys feminize their voice, many of them do (and some consider it an essential part of their overall aesthetic). While femboys typically don't go as far to heighten their pitch as a transgender woman might, they typically alter their voices to speak at a slightly higher pitch or with a brighter resonance. They might also speak in a softer, gentler tone. Speak more slowly than you normally would and focus on enunciating your words and keeping your consonants relatively soft. The most basic things you can do are get plenty of sleep and stay well hydrated—your voice will naturally be low and scratchy if you're tired or dehydrated. [12] X Research source Most femboys favor a bright, high-pitched, girly voice—but not all of them! Play around with this if you're interested, and you'll find the tone that works for you."

      "title": "Practice more feminine stances, like crossing your legs.",
      "content": "Practice more feminine stances, like crossing your legs. Sit somewhere in public, like a sidewalk café or a park, and watch the way women move. The more you can emulate their movements, the more feminine you'll seem—even if most of your clothing is masculine. This step is something you can get some tips from other femboys on, but nothing's quite as valuable as just watching how women naturally move in the world and occupy space. Take note of the ways women move that are very different from the way men move. Those are areas you can focus on that will immediately make a big difference in terms of making you look more feminine. For example, you might note that most women tend to sit on the edge of a chair and cross their legs instead of sitting back in the chair and spreading their legs. That simple change in how you sit can project more femininity."

      "title": "Wear women's underwear or lingerie.",
      "content": "Wear women's underwear or lingerie. Not all femboys do this, as the feminine undergarments won’t be immediately obvious to people around you as part of your aesthetic. However, you might find that wearing women’s underwear or lingerie helps you to naturally move in a more feminine way. If you're not interested in trying to wear a bra , a racerback tank can give you a similar feeling without requiring any stuffing."

      "content": "Follow other femboys on social media. Checking out stuff posted under #femboy on various platforms is a great way to get started finding accounts you want to follow. Femboys tend to be the most active on platforms such as TikTok that cater to younger users. [13] X Research source Many femboy influencers also go into detail about their hair, makeup, and styling routines—if you see something you like, you can easily incorporate it into your routine. On TikTok, leading femboys include @thatsusboi (Seth), @flawlesskevin (Kevin Ninh), and @imnotrozi (rozi).

      "content": "Make friends with other femboys. Other femboys are just going to get you in a way that probably no one else can, and that's why surrounding yourself with other femboys will help you feel more confident about your femboy self. It's a lot easier to feel comfortable dressing feminine when you're with two other guys who are doing the same thing. If you don't know any other femboys where you live, try reaching out to others online through social media. LGBTQ+ events can be popular with femboys, even though femboys aren't necessarily gay. They also offer an environment where you can feel comfortable dressing or acting effeminate."

      "content": "Build an affirming self-care routine. Self-care is a lot more than bubble baths and mani-pedis (although femboys certainly enjoy those too). As you're beginning to explore and express your feminine side, you're likely to have a lot of questions. Create a self-care plan for yourself that takes your needs into account.

      "content": "Embrace your femininity. It's common for guys to have a hard time feeling comfortable displaying anything feminine. You might have been taught to hide that part of yourself. But the more you can learn to embrace and love your feminine side, the more confident you'll feel about expressing it openly. [16] X Research source You might start with an accessory, such as a feminine scarf, that you can easily remove if you get too uncomfortable or if you're in a situation where you're worried about how people might react. You might also think about embracing your feminine side even when you're dressed and presenting entirely masculine, such as sitting with your legs crossed or swishing your hips when you walk."

      "title": "Read about fragile masculinity and misogyny.",
      "content": "Read about fragile masculinity and misogyny. In the US and other Western cultures, fragile masculinity encourages people to look down on effeminate men, primarily because women are viewed as being less than men. Femboys disrupt this paradigm by embracing their feminine side openly and with pride. [17] X Research source Learning more about fragile masculinity can help you uncover other areas in your life that might have been affected. It's also much easier to embrace your feminine side when you're not harboring internalized feelings of hatred toward women. Learning more about these old-school norms can help you better understand why some things might make you feel uncomfortable, so you can figure out how to overcome that discomfort."
