      "title": "Pour 1 to 2 cups (237-473 mL) of Coke into the toilet bowl.",
      "content": "Pour 1 to 2 cups (237-473 mL) of Coke into the toilet bowl. Open a bottle or can of Coca-Cola and pour it around the upper rim of the toilet bowl. Just pour in enough Coke for it to flow over all the stains in the bowl, or about 1 to 2 cups (237-473 mL). [1] X Research source Coke is great for dissolving mineral buildup, like limescale, and rust stains. Its cleaning power comes from the carbonic and phosphoric acid present in Coke’s carbonation. Diet Coke works just as well as regular Coke. Other fizzy sodas and drinks like club soda also work well in place of Coke. For hard-to-reach stains high in the bowl, soak an old rag in Coke and place it around the rim. Or, fill a spray bottle with Coke and spray it directly on the stains."

      "title": "Let the Coke sit overnight.",
      "content": "Let the Coke sit overnight. Simply wait and let the Coca-Cola work its magic in your toilet bowl. Just leave it in the toilet for at least 2 hours, though overnight is better. This gives the Coke more time to eat away at the unsightly stains in the toilet bowl. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Flush the toilet to rinse away the Coke and the stains.",
      "content": "Flush the toilet to rinse away the Coke and the stains. While you let the Coke sit, its acids were busy loosening up the mineral and rust stains in the toilet bowl. To clean off the Coca-Cola and the stains, simply flush the toilet once. The loosened stains will simply rinse away with the help of the toilet water. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply the Coke again as needed.",
      "content": "Apply the Coke again as needed. If there are still stains in the toilet bowl after flushing away the Coke, pour 1 to 2 cups (237-473 ml) of Coke in the bowl again. Just let the Coke sit for longer this time to give the Coke more time to lift up the stains. While Coca-Cola works well for rings of limescale or rust stains in toilets, it may not completely eliminate every stain. If a second application of Coke doesn’t remove your stains, move on to using a cleaning option in the section below. While Coke dissolves tough stains, it’s not recommended to use it in place of your regular toilet cleaner. If used repeatedly, Coke can stain or darken the color of your toilet bowl."

      "title": "Scrub the stains with a toilet brush.",
      "content": "Scrub the stains with a toilet brush. If simply flushing away the Coke doesn’t remove the stains, get out your tried and true toilet brush. Just give the stains a quick scrubbing, pour in the Coke, let it sit for at least 2 hours, and scrub the stains again. Then, flush the toilet to wash away the Coke and the stains. [4] X Research source The mechanical action of a brush or an abrasive pad loosens built-up stains and removes them from the toilet bowl. After you clean your toilet , wash your hands to disinfect them. Or, wear gloves."

      "title": "Heat the Coke in the microwave before pouring it into the toilet.",
      "content": "Heat the Coke in the microwave before pouring it into the toilet. The acids in Coca-Cola typically dissolve stains faster when the Coke is hot. This is because chemical reactions happen quicker at high temperatures. Just pour your Coke into a microwave-safe cup and heat it up for 30 to 60 seconds, or until it’s hot to the touch. Then, pour it into the toilet bowl. [5] X Research source Never microwave soda (or any liquid) in a sealed container or a container made of metal. This can cause a dangerous explosion of hot liquid. Instead, pour the soda into a microwave-safe cup, like one made of glass or ceramic. Wear oven mitts or gloves when heating the Coke. It usually fizzes more than normal, so this protects you from getting splashed by tiny soda drops."

      "title": "Use white vinegar, baking soda, and Coke to remove tough stains.",
      "content": "Use white vinegar, baking soda, and Coke to remove tough stains. To dissolve mineral buildup, rust, and grime, combine the power of Coke, vinegar, and baking soda. Just mix ½ cup (118 ml) of vinegar and ¼ cup (68 g) of baking soda into a ½ gallon (2 l) jug of water. Pour it into the bowl, scrub the stains, then wait 1 hour before flushing. Then, follow it up with the Coke treatment. [6] X Research source Vinegar is also a great disinfectant that cleans away bacteria. Or, mix 2 parts borax, 1 part lemon juice, and 1 part Coke. Pour the mix inside the toilet bowl, let it sit for 1 hour, then scrub the stains."

      "content": "Remove mold with hydrogen peroxide and Coca-Cola. If you have spots of mold growing in your toilet, mix 1 part hydrogen peroxide with 2 parts water in a spray bottle. Spray the solution onto the mold, let it sit for at least 1 hour, and then scrub off the mold with a brush. [7] X Research source Then, pour Coke into the bowl to remove any residual stains or scaling around the moldy spot."
