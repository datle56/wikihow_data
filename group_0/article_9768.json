      "content": "Earn credit by caring for your current dog. How you behave up to the point of asking can affect whether or not your parents say \"Yes.\" Try to earn credit by caring for the dog you have now. This will show your parents you're responsible enough to care for a new pet. [1] X Research source Step up and take on more responsibility in terms of caring for your current dog. For example, if your mother usually takes the dog for its nightly walk, start volunteering to do so. You can also be vigilant about feeding the dog at the right times. You should also spend time with your dog. Your parents may worry a second dog will take attention away from the first. Showing how much you value your current dog can help reassure your parents both dogs will get plenty of love and attention."

      "title": "Research dogs and dog care.",
      "content": "Research dogs and dog care. You want your parents to feel you have truly thought out this decision. You should do some research about dogs and dog care to show your parents you're ready and understand the responsibility. It can even help to do something like write a brief essay about how you plan to care for your new dog. [2] X Research source Cover the basics. Talk about how often to feed a new dog, let a dog out, and things like grooming, bathing, and playing with your new dog. You should also consider how to best introduce dogs. Do some research on website like the ASPCA and have a game plan in place for introducing two dogs. For example, you should keep the dogs in separate rooms for a few days before a face-to-face interaction."

      "title": "Think about what you want to say.",
      "content": "Think about what you want to say. You want to go into the conversation with some idea of what to say. You don't have to write out your script word-for-word, but think about a general idea of how to ask. [3] X Research source It can help to jot down your thoughts and then read them over. This can help you identify what you need and want out of the situation, allowing you task more effectively."

    {
      "title": "Pick a good time and place to talk.",
      "content": "Pick a good time and place to talk. When and where you talk can impact whether or not your parents say \"Yes.\" Talking when your parents are busy or stressed may result in them not listening. Find a place free of distractions when both of your parents will be free and relatively relaxed. [4] X Research source For example, if you have a quiet dining room in your house, try asking here. If your parents, say, sit in the dining room and have coffee on Saturday mornings, this will be a good time to ask as they'll be relatively relaxed."

      "title": "Discuss the positives.",
      "content": "Discuss the positives. Try to make a new dog sound enticing. Bring up the potential positive aspects of having a new dog. For example, you can talk about how a new dog could keep your current dog company. You could also talk about the potential benefits for the family. Have a new dog to train, walk, and play with will give everyone more exercise. You can also have more family time together, as you can take the dog on weekend hikes or attend obedience classes together."

      "title": "Illustrate you understand the responsibility of a new dog.",
      "content": "Illustrate you understand the responsibility of a new dog. A lot of kids decide they want animals on a whim. Your parents may feel you have no thought this through on a practical level. Illustrating that you have will make you look responsible enough to handle a second dog, so tell your parents how you plan to care for the dog. [5] X Research source Talk about how you understand there will be extra work. For example, say, \"I'll make sure to let the dog out and feed it.\" Bring up anything you learned while researching introducing a new dog into the home. For example, say, \"We can introduce the dogs slowly. The new dog can stay in my room until Sparky gets used to having another dog here.\""

      "title": "Show gratitude.",
      "content": "Show gratitude. Your parents may be hesitant to say, \"Yes\" if you come off as entitled. Showing a little gratitude can go a long way in terms of getting a \"Yes\" answer. Tell your parents how much you respect them when asking for a dog. [6] X Research source For example, say something like, \"I know how hard you two work and I really appreciate you getting me one dog. I know raising a kid and a dog is hard when you're both working full time.\""

      "content": "Listen to your parents perspective. Do not interrupt when your parents are sharing their perspective. Remember, there are two sides to every story. Your parents may have good reasons to be hesitant to get another dog, so try to hear them out. [7] X Research source Let your parents speak. After you've stated your case, be quiet and allow your parents to contribute to the conversation. Try to empathize with your parents when they talk. Your parents work hard to make money, and want to spend it wisely. A new dog may be costly. It will also take a lot of time to introduce a new dog to the home. Your parents' time may be limited, so they may be hesitant to get a new dog. You need to accept this and try to come up with a solution to financial struggles."

      "content": "Do not argue. If your parents say \"No,\" or express uncertainty, avoid arguing. The more mature you are, the more likely your parents are to allow you to get another dog. Dogs take a lot of responsibility, so you want to show your parents that you are responsible. [8] X Research source Instead of arguing, listen to your parents in a calm fashion. Do not say, \"It's so unfair you won't let me get another dog.\" Instead, say, \"Okay, I understand why it would be a lot of work for you.\""

Could we please talk about why?\""

If you can offer to earn the dog in some way, they may agree to get one eventually. For example, you can offer to bring up your grades in exchange for a dog. [9] X Research source If your parents say \"No\" initially, gently introduce the topic of you earning the dog. Try asking first. Say something like, \"Is there any way I could earn the dog as a reward?\" Provide your parents with some examples of what you would do to earn the dog. For example, \"I know you're not happy with my math grade. What if I tried to bring that up in exchange for the dog?\""

      "content": "Accept a \"No\" for now. Even if you ask calmly and maturely, your parents may still say \"No.\" A dog is a big responsibility for both you and your parents and they may not be up to get another one right now. Instead of arguing, maturely accept the \"No\" answer for now. In the future, your parents will be more likely to reconsider if you take a \"No\" with grace in the present. [11] X Research source End the conversation on a good note. Say something like, \"Okay, I understand you don't want a new dog right now. Thank you for listening to me anyway. I appreciate it.\""
