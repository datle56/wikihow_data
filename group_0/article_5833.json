      "title": "Puddle shapes",
      "content": "Puddle shapes This is perhaps the primary method of reading, whether the puddles are around the base of the candle or in the bowl of water. For the most part, this is intuitive, and the shapes and their meanings are up to your own interpretation—the shape of a heart may indicate love is on the way, and so on. That said, many necromancers use the same interpretations as reading tea leaves , so feel free to consult a tea leaf dictionary for more specific insights. [1] X Research source Acorn : Your health may improve, or good health may continue. Anchor : A symbol of luck. Good things are coming in terms of business or love. Birds : A symbol of luck. A flying bird indicates good things coming. A resting bird indicates a fortunate journey ahead. Clover : A symbol of good fortune and happiness. Door : A sign that something out of the ordinary will happen soon. Hammer : A message that your hard work will pay off. Heart : You’ll find new love, or an existing love will strengthen. Heavenly bodies (planets, stars, moons, etc.) : Powerful symbols of good luck, or that guidance will soon come. Letters : Initials of names of people that may soon be important. Moons or crescents : A message of fame and prosperity. Numbers : Time in weeks or years until a significant event. Snake : Enemies or minor misfortunes lurk nearby. Triangles : A sign of unexpected good fortune."

      "title": "Amount of wax remaining",
      "content": "Amount of wax remaining If your candle burns all the way to the base with no unmelted wax remaining, that’s a great sign of positive energies and good fortune, or a successful spell, if you recently cast one. If it leaves a base, or at least 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) of wax at the bottom, it may be a sign of unfinished business, or a problem that you need to turn and face. [2] X Research source If your candle has wax remaining, think of things you may have given up on or left in the past. It may be time to revisit them."

      "title": "Cascading wax",
      "content": "Cascading wax Sometimes, wax flows out of the candle, dries, then flows out and dries again, forming structures along the side of the candle. This is a sign of change in your future, and also a sign of growth, just as the wax structures grow along the sides of the candle. At first, the change may be uncomfortable, but it’s ultimately for the better. Deal with life changes by allowing yourself to feel your feelings. Then, think of all the changes you’ve gone through before to remind yourself that you’re resilient and capable."

      "title": "Cratered candle",
      "content": "Cratered candle A cratered candle, or when the wick burns down into the middle of the candle and a wall of wax on all sides prevents wax flow, may be a sign that something is blocking your intention. [3] X Research source The energy may not be right for the reading, or your emotions may not be steady enough for a clear interpretation. Try again later. In the meantime, relax and clear your mind. Go for a walk, or take a warm bath. You may have more clarity when you return."

    {
      "title": "Curling wax",
      "content": "Curling wax During some readings, the wax at the side of the candle leans away from the flame and curls down the side, like a flower petal. This is often a sign that you have a strong will and the power to manifest anything you set your mind to. It may also mean that you have the ability to overcome the obstacles in your path. The more curls you observe, the more powerful the sign."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clockwise or counterclockwise wax flow",
      "content": "Clockwise or counterclockwise wax flow When the wax overflows the candle, it may drip and puddle in a certain direction. If that direction is clockwise, it’s a sign of positive energy or good fortune to come. If it’s counterclockwise, it’s a sign that the energies or timing isn’t right to manifest your intentions, and to try a divination later."

    {
      "title": "Splits or flooding",
      "content": "Splits or flooding Occasionally, the wax may pool around the wick, then come rushing all at once out from a split in the side of a candle. This is an indicator that your manifestations or spells are especially powerful, and may even have unintended consequences. It may also represent an overflow of energies that may be difficult to manage."

      "title": "Burned on one side",
      "content": "Burned on one side Each side of your candle corresponds to an element and a faculty—the west side is water and emotions, north is earth and physical sensations, east is air and communication, and south is fire and matters of will. [4] X Research source If your candle burns through only one side, that faculty may be experiencing blockages, like a lack of physical touch if burns through the north side of the candle. If the candle burns on all but one side, those other faculties may be lacking, but the side left standing has proven strong."

      "content": "Tidy and cleanse your space with some meditation. Before you begin, it’s important to make sure you’re working with a clean space, both as a safety precaution and to ensure the energy is right for the reading. Clear any negative energy in the room by meditating on positive thoughts. If you like, burn sage to smudge and purify the space, as well. Expert spiritual life coach Jennifer McVey says to “have some type of holder underneath it, like... a bowl [or] dish” when working with smudge sticks."

      "title": "Place a small candle on a flat, heat-safe surface.",
      "content": "Place a small candle on a flat, heat-safe surface. Set your candle somewhere sturdy and flat, and on a surface you don’t mind covering with wax. Some ceromancers use cast-iron pans, others use mirrors, plates, or even baking sheets. It’s best to use a fresh candle, but a used candle works fine, as well. The color of your candle can also affect your reading. For example, red candles may better channel a love reading, while white candles represent protection. Green or gold candles may lend extra power to a professional or money-related reading. If you like, surround the candle with your favorite herbs or crystals. Expert energy healer Karuna Jain says that rose quartz “helps to bring up the energy of love within our heart,” and is good for love readings. Use a glassless votive candle for a shorter reading that ends when the flame goes out, or a taller, upright candle for a longer reading that may offer more apparent wax patterns."

      "title": "Set your intention for the reading and focus on it in your mind.",
      "content": "Set your intention for the reading and focus on it in your mind. It’s best to enter any sort of divination with a specific goal in mind. Close your eyes and contemplate what you want out of this reading. Do you want an answer to a question, like, Will I find love soon? Or do you just want a general reading of your energy? Decide on your goal for the wax reading, then focus on and visualize it in your mind. Write your intention on a bit of paper to externalize it and focus its energies."

    {
      "title": "Light your candle and observe the flame.",
      "content": "Light your candle and observe the flame. When you feel ready, light your candle. As you do, relax your mind and remember to keep your intention in mind. Then, observe the candle flame. Spiritual life coach Jennifer McVey says it’s “like if you were looking into a crystal ball.... unfocus your eyes a little bit” and relax your body, letting the shapes and motion of the flame speak to you. How does the flame make you feel? Take note—that’s a good indicator of the energy of the reading. For example, if the flame is erratic and flickering, it may indicate a negative answer to your intention. If it’s still and strong, that’s a sign of positive energy. Trust your emotions and instincts."

      "title": "Observe the melting wax and write down any shapes you see.",
      "content": "Observe the melting wax and write down any shapes you see. Reading the wax while the candle is still burning may provide some valuable insight. These readings are called “transient images,” and may disappear as the candle burns, so write down anything that feels significant to meditate on later. For example, note any drippings that run down the candle’s side, which are known as “tears” and may signify future grief or other trials. [5] X Research source If the tears melt away as the candle burns, it signifies the grief will pass quickly. Otherwise, it may linger. Much of ceromancy relies on your own instincts. If you see something that feels significant, write it down and ask yourself how you feel about it."

      "title": "Tip some wax into a bowl of water to create wax shapes.",
      "content": "Tip some wax into a bowl of water to create wax shapes. This is a common method of ceromancy, and can add to your readings. While the candle burns, tip it over a bowl of water. As the wax pours into the water, it will cool into a variety of shapes that you may read and interpret after the candle has gone out. [6] X Research source Note your initial impressions, then set the bowl aside to look for patterns after the flame extinguishes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Analyze the wax dripping after the candle has burned out.",
      "content": "Analyze the wax dripping after the candle has burned out. For a short reading, feel free to blow out your candle yourself and move on to interpretation. For a longer reading that may provide more insight, wait for the candle to go out on its own. This can offer more signs, like whether or not the candle burned all the way down before it went out. You don’t need to be present the whole time the candle burns. You might come back later to analyze the wax once the candle has run its course."
