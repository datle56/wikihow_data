For example, if you post a picture of a frog, you might use #animal, #frog, and #nature. Don’t use #sunset just because it is popular. Special events might have specific hashtags. If you are at a large event, be sure to tag your posts with the relevant hashtags to reach others who are there. Search your Instagram “Explore” page to find popular hashtags. Try to use ones that many people are using and searching for."
