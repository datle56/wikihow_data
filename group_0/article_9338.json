It may seem obvious, but a common mistake that's often made when connecting to the internet is not making sure the source of the internet is on. Especially if you've just set up a router and/or modem, ensure that it's on and that everything is plugged in properly, and that any lights on it aren't indicating that there are problems. Cords can also be unplugged or slightly pulled out of the wall, rendering the operation futile. Make sure that everything is plugged in properly and is working right before getting started. If you’ve just moved somewhere new, the internet might not be active. To set up your internet , call your internet service provider (ISP) to turn on the internet connection for your residence."

Devices like smartphones, tablets, iPods, handheld gaming systems, and so forth can usually only connect to Wi-Fi services, due to the portable nature of them. Therefore, you won't be able to connect a mobile device to ethernet or to a dial-up network. Ethernet and dial-up connections are limited to non-portable gaming devices (not covered in this article) and computers. [1] X Research source"

Wi-Fi or hotspot names can be changed, but if you've changed the name of your network or hotspot, you probably know what it is.

The default password will usually be listed on the router, but if you don't know the password, ask the person in charge of the network. Some protected public networks may have varying passwords per person. For example, a school may allow students to log on to the network with their student ID number, rather than a single set password.

However, some aren't built to do that. Laptops, for example, often don't have a port for using ethernet. For that reason, make sure you get any adapters you may need for the ethernet cable to ensure that you can use it. Ethernet cables are all different; for example, a Cat-5 or Cat-5e cable runs at slower speeds than a Cat-6. However, it's also largely dependent on the router's connection and how many people will be connecting to the network at once. Unless you're doing very, very intensive upload work, you're probably not going to need a Cat-6 cable if you're the only one on the network. You cannot connect a mobile device (e.g. a smartphone) to ethernet with an adapter."

One ethernet port on the router will already be filled by the modem’s ethernet connection. Select one of the other free ethernet ports on the router to connect your device to the internet."

Go to source Make sure there's no problem with the ethernet cable (which can range from \"the cord wasn't plugged in all the way\" to \"the cable is faulty/broken and needs to be replaced\"). Check if the router is having trouble, and reboot it if so. Contact your ISP if resetting the router doesn't work, but the cord and computer's ethernet connection work fine. You can also try resetting your home network to resolve the issue. Rarely, your computer's ethernet card may turn out to be defective.
