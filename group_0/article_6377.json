[15] X Research source Why? It likely began in 1923, when a couple of Norwegian authors—Nordahl Grieg and Nils Lie—wrote a crime novel called (in English) Bergen Train Looted in the Night and advertised it in the papers the Sunday before Easter. The ad was so believable that most people didn’t realize it was fiction—which caused the novel to become a huge success! After that, Easter crime became a massive tradition in Norway. It helps that Norwegians get a lot of days off during Easter—far more than many other countries—giving them plenty of time to read!"

On Holy Wednesday, Judas decided to betray Jesus and the story of his persecution begins. Maundy Thursday commemorates the Last Supper, which took place between Jesus and his disciples. Good Friday is the day of Jesus's death on the cross. Holy Saturday and Sunday, or Easter, are the last two days of the Holy Week.

Rabbits and bunnies became associated with Easter after Georg Franck von Franckenau, a German Professor of Medicine, mentioned an “Easter hare” in his book Satyrae Medicae in 1722. It’s possible he made this connection because rabbits are known for breeding quickly, creating a connection with the new life associated with springtime. [20] X Research source In European folklore, hares were purported either to lay eggs or to hide the colored eggs that children searched for in the garden."
