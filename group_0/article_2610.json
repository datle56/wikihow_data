Brainstorm something clear with a deadline like “Finish this report by Friday at 5pm” or “Save $1,000 for vacation by the end of the year.” Make it measurable—you’re more likely to save $1,000 than to just put away “as much as you can.” [1] X Research source Choose something that’ll be helpful or rewarding in your work, academic, or personal life. You’ll stay motivated and enjoy the benefits more! Remember that diligence requires consistent and thorough effort. It may not feel fun at the moment, but the end result makes it worth it."

Choose a weekly or monthly planner for long-term goals or a daily planner to help you manage short-term or last minute tasks. Fill in important dates and deadlines as soon as you know about them (things like exams, special occasions, work deadlines, or even intentional down time). [3] X Research source Use your planner consistently. It takes nearly 2 months to build a secure habit, so remind yourself to use it daily. Consider color coding your tasks and events with highlighters or sticky notes to keep track of different projects, classes, or commitments."

Ask yourself, “What’s the one thing I need to get done today?” and make it your #1 priority (and maybe even the only thing on your list). [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Tackle the biggest, most important item on your list first thing in the morning (after you’re fully refreshed and ready to work, of course). If you can’t contain your list to 3 items, make another list of everything you need to do that week, then put it away (this is a brain dump, not a new to-do list). Break large tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Instead of “work on paper today,” try “create paper outline today” and “finish first draft tomorrow.”"

      "content": "Look at deadlines and start working before you’re in “panic mode.” Resist the urge to procrastinate —at minimum, check out your calendar and plan out when to work on specific aspects of your assignment instead of waiting until the week, day, or night before it’s due. [5] X Research source Aim to finish early. That way, you have some buffer time to edit or make adjustments (or finish your work if an unexpected conflict got in the way). Talk to professors, supervisors, or colleagues in advance to get an idea of what you need to do if you’re unclear on the details or instructions. Try to do early, short work sessions instead of cramming an entire project into one day or week."

Assign letters to each item on your to-do list—A for the most important, B for the second, and so on. To sort through many items, make a matrix with 4 squares—one for “must dos,” and others for “decide or schedule,” “delegate,” and “delete” (you can always un-delete a task later if needed). [10] X Research source Consider upcoming deadlines or whether not doing something will have a major impact on your goals or on others. If you need help prioritizing , ask a professor, your boss, or a friend to help you decide what’s most important or helpful to get done.

[11] X Research source Set mini-deadlines for yourself to stay on track. You can always adjust your timeline if something is taking longer than expected or a conflict pops up.

More practice at a certain skill? Then, decide on a few small things you can do each day to accomplish these things. Try out your routine for a week, then evaluate your success. [14] X Research source Be consistent with your time. For example, if you need to practice more scales on the flute, try doing it around the same time each day. Use a calendar or checklist to track your progress. You’ll feel great when you see you jogged every day if more exercise was your goal.

[19] X Research source Sometimes, stuff happens—reevaluate your goals and determine if your plan still works. Be kind to yourself if life gets in the way (it isn’t your fault). If something unpredictable like an injury prevents you from meeting a deadline, communicate with your professor or colleagues ASAP. For example, if you have to do a mass mailing and normally print envelopes individually, try learning a new program that automates the process."
