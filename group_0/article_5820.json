Additionally, if your driver is over 5 minutes late, you can cancel your ride for free. If you’re canceling an Uber Share ride, you can only cancel a request without getting a fee for the first 2 minutes after a driver accepts it. [4] X Research source"

Cancellation fees may also apply if your driver cancels after waiting for you for a specific amount of time (usually 5 minutes, or 10 to 15 for Comfort and Premium)."
