If necessary, delete posts that are outdated and don’t represent who you are now. [8] X Research source For instance, you might hide or delete photos of you during nights out on the town.

[11] X Research source Consider typing your answers in a word processing document so you can easily proofread it. Then, copy and paste it into the application. If you want the employer to know something about you, such as past job responsibilities that relate to the position you want, include it in the relevant application fields.
