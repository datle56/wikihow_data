      "content": "Check the labels. While most faux suede fabrics used for clothing, towels, drapery, and other garments, accessories, or decor will be machine washable, always check the labels first to be sure. If the label is missing or too worn to read, err on the side of caution: hand wash the garment with a gentle soap or detergent and hang or lay it to dry. A care label with a washing basin full of water on it means you can machine wash your item. If there is a number as well, this indicates the temperature at which to wash it. [1] X Research source For a washing basin with a hand on it, wash the garment by hand instead of the washing machine. A square with a circle inside means you can tumble dry your garment as well. A single circle means dry clean only. A triangle means it’s safe to use bleach. If any of these symbols appear on your care label with an X or cross through them, it means you cannot use that method of cleaning."

      "content": "Do a spot test. Before washing or cleaning any new fabric, you should always do a spot test on the fabric to ensure that the cleaning product you want to use won’t damage the fabric in any way. Choose a small spot on the fabric that won’t be seen, and apply a small amount of your desired cleaner to the area. [2] X Research source Let it sit for five to 10 minutes, and blot the area with a clean, white cloth. Check to see that no color bleeding, discoloration, or shrinking has occurred. Use a damp cloth to remove the cleaner."

      "title": "Spot clean stains.",
      "content": "Spot clean stains. For tough stains or hard-to-clean dirt, spot clean the stains with soapy water, a clear alcohol like isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol or vodka, or a gentle liquid laundry detergent that’s been diluted in water (use a teaspoon (6 ml) of detergent in one cup (240 ml) of water). To spot clean: Apply a small bit of cleaner to the fabric with a cloth or clean sponge. Gently rub the area with either the sponge, a lint-free cloth, or a soft-bristled brush, such as a clean toothbrush. If you use a cloth or sponge, make sure it’s white or undyed, as the dye could transfer to the fabric."

      "content": "Treat stubborn stains. Sometimes fabrics just don’t want to come clean, but there are methods you can use to remove stubborn stains from your favorite clothes. [3] X Research source To remove deodorant or perspiration stains, rub a small amount of liquid laundry soap into the armpit areas and let it sit for 10 minutes before washing. For oil stains, lay the stain face-down on a clean wash cloth or hand towel. Pour some liquid laundry soap onto the back of the stain and let it sit. As the oil and soap soak through and dry, replace the cloth with a clean one. Rinse the area once it has dried and launder it normally. To get rid of stubborn organic matter (such as food, beverages, grass, and blood), pre-treat the stains by rubbing them with a detergent that contains enzymes, such as OxiClean, Tide Stain Release, and Ultra Plus. [4] X Research source Let it sit for 10 minutes and wash normally."

      "title": "Launder the garment.",
      "content": "Launder the garment. For machine-washable items, always wash faux suede items together to prevent the material from collecting lint. Wash larger items, such as curtains and bedding, alone. To machine wash a single faux suede item, place it in a lingerie bag to separate it from the rest of the clothes in the load. To be on the safe side, always use the delicate or gentle cycle and a mild liquid detergent when washing faux suede. To hand wash your item, fill a large bowl or sink with warm, soapy water. Place your item in the water and let it absorb the water. Gently agitate the fabric with your hands, concentrating on areas that are particularly soiled."

Your best bet for a cleaner will be isopropyl alcohol in a spray bottle. Spray a small amount of alcohol on the soiled area, and gently rub it with a clean, undyed sponge or lint-free cloth. [8] X Research source Blot stubborn stains if necessary, and use a clean spot on the cloth for each soiled area. Allow the area to dry before using. Always use strong cleaning agents in a well-ventilated area, and never near an open flame. To clean the entire piece, work in small sections using the same method. Don’t forget about removable pillows and cushions."

Luckily, faux suede is quite durable, and most stains can be removed without damaging the fabric. To remove oil, wipe up as much of the oil as possible with an absorbent cloth or paper towel. Soak a rag in alcohol and wring out the excess. Use this cloth to blot at the oil stains, then remove the oil and dirt with a clean, dry cloth. To remove wax, heat an iron on high. Lay a clean cloth over the affected area on the furniture, and gently rub the hot iron back and forth over the cloth. [9] X Research source As the wax melts, it will be absorbed by the cloth. To remove gum, apply an ice cube to the gum to freeze it. When it’s very cold or frozen, gently scrape it off with a spoon or spatula."
