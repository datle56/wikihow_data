      "content": "Put your phone away. It can be tempting to keep your cell phone closeby while you're out, but it is rude to do it on a date. Keep your phone in your purse or pocket and give your date your full attention. If you need to have your phone on hand in case of emergencies, place it face down on the table and only touch it if it rings or vibrates. If you are only on alert for a call from one particular number, set it to a particular ring tone and volume setting so you aren't interrupted unnecessarily."

Avoid a negative response like, \"no, I'm not that attractive.\""

      "content": "Ask questions about your date. A good date should involve a back-and-forth talk where you ask questions about your date and they ask questions about you.

      "content": "Avoid awkward topics. Certain subjects should be off-limits on dates as they are awkward and might make your date feel uneasy. Avoid any discussion about former relationships, which will ruin the vibe of your outing. Don't ply your date for information they don't offer freely and never push a topic that they don't want to talk about. Don't share anything too personal before you get to know the person well enough to share secrets."

Wash with warm water and keep the shower under 15 minutes to keep your skin from drying out.
