      "title": "Contract the disease \"Sanguinare Vampiris\".",
      "content": "Contract the disease \"Sanguinare Vampiris\". This is the disease that will eventually lead to vampirism. You can contract the disease by getting attacked by vampire enemies. Physical vampiric weapons and the spell \"Vampiric Drain\" both have a 10% chance of transmitting the disease each time you are attacked. Morvarth’s Lair is one of the easiest place to contract Sanguinare Vampiris, as the opening area of the cave has several low-level vampires. You will be able to take several hits before dying, giving you a greater chance to get infected. Other locations include Bloodlet Throne, Haemar's Shame, Fellglow Keep, Red water Den (Dawnguard) and Broken Fang Cave."

      "content": "Ensure that you are not immune. If you are infected with Lycanthropy (werewolf), you will be immune to Sanguinare Vampiris. Hircine's Ring will also make you immune. Argonians and Wood Elves are less likely to contract it as well thanks to their natural disease resistance."

      "title": "Do not cure Sanguinare Vampiris.",
      "content": "Do not cure Sanguinare Vampiris. The disease will take 72 hours in game to transform into vampirism. After this period, the player will become a vampire. You will see messages accompanied by red flashes as you come nearer to the 72 hour deadline. You will need to touch sunlight at least once before the game will allow you to transform into a vampire. Sanguinare Vampires can be cured by drinking a Cure Disease potion or by praying at a shrine. Avoid doing either of these for three days."

Vampire Lords have significantly different weaknesses to frost and fire compared to standard Skyrim vampirism. Vampire Lords can transform into fearsome winged beasts. You will be able to cast Blood Magic and can unlock a variety of powerful vampiric abilities."

This is your first chance to become a Vampire Lord, but you will have two more chances later on if you decline here. In the quest Chasing Echoes, Serana offers to turn the player into a Vampire Lord. This is because living things cannot normally enter the Soul Cairn. After defeating Harkon completing Kindred Judgment, the final quest in the Dawnguard questline, the player can ask Serana to make her/him into a Vampire Lord."

There are four possible stages, with increasing bonuses and negative effects. Feeding will always return you to Stage One. Each stage will increase your resistance to Frost, but will increase your susceptibility to Fire. The damage you take from sunlight increases each stage. Each stage grants you access to more vampiric spells and increases your vampiric strength. NPCs will become more hostile towards you as the stages increases, attacking you on sight at Stage Four."

      "content": "Feed to quell your bloodthirst. If you want to avoid most of the negative effects of vampirism, you will need to feed regularly. If you are playing standard Skyrim, you can feed on sleeping people by approaching them and pressing the interaction button as if you were Pickpocketing. Another option will appear, allowing you to Feed. If you're playing Dawnguard, you can feed on a conscious person if you cast the Vampire's Seduction spell first. Feeding will cause witnesses to become hostile, and will incur a 40 gold bounty if you're caught. Feeding on your spouse is one of the easier ways to manage your bloodthirst."

First, ask any bartender for rumors and you will be told about Falion, who studies vampires. You can find Falion in Morthal. Falion will inform you that vampirism can be reversed with a filled Black Soul Gem. You can fill a Black Soul Gem by casting Soul Trap on a humanoid opponent before defeating it. Falion will sell you an empty Black Soul Gem if you need one. Turn filled Soul Gem over to Falion and he will remove your vampirism. This can be repeated as often as you'd like, as long as you have a filled Black Soul Gem."
