Leave the legs in the pan until the skin gets brown and crispy, which should take around 15 minutes at medium heat.

Remove the outer skin from the onion with your hands and use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin from your carrots. Use a chef’s knife and a cutting board to dice the veggies so they are 1 ⁄ 2 by 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 by 1.3 cm) cubes. This ensures that they cook evenly.
