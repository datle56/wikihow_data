For the project in the illustrations, rough sawn treated yellow pine privacy fence boards were used because they are inexpensive and lightweight. They also resist rot and insect damage, making it suitable for use as a planter box. You will also need: Drill and circular saw Corrosion resistant screws Basic hand tools"

Here, a 1 inch (2.5cm) by 1/8 inch (3.1mm) piece of aluminum flat stock is a good material to use, being easy to form and drill, and weather/corrosion resistant. Each side of the angle should be about 4 inches (10cm) long, and you will need to drill 3/16 inch (4.7mm) holes for the mounting screws on one side of each piece."

A 1/4 inch (6.3mm) bolt 2 1/2 inches (6.3cm) long will hold this piece in place. You can dimple the end of the bolt where the threads come out of the nut to prevent it from loosening during use."
