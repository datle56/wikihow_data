      "content": "A plus sign (+) means that side is the underdog. When you see a plus sign (+) next to the name of a sports team or an individual player, it means that the sportsbook, or the organization running the betting lines, believes that that team is the underdog, and has a lower probability of winning. This means you’ll make more money if you bet on them and they win. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "A minus sign (-) means that side is the favorite. A minus or negative sign (-) next to a sports team or player on a betting line means that that team is expected to win. If you bet on them and they do win, you won’t make as much money (but you’ll still make some). [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Negative odds tell you how much to bet in order to win $100. For example, if you see a moneyline bet (which is simply a bet on whether or not a side will win) of -110, which is fairly common, you’d have to wager $110 dollars in order to win $100. This is because they’re the favored (-) team, so they have better chances, and more people are betting on them, which means a lower payout. [3] X Research source Of course, you can bet however much money you want, but $100 is the standard by which bets are calculated and displayed."

      "title": "Positive odds tell you how much profit you’ll make on a bet of $100.",
      "content": "Positive odds tell you how much profit you’ll make on a bet of $100. For example, if you read a moneyline odds of +200 and you wager $100, you’ll earn a total of $300, since you win your initial bet back , plus the $200 indicated by the probability. [4] X Research source Your potential earnings are much better on a positive odds bet, since the odds are lower and fewer people are also betting that way."

      "title": "Sportsbooks also integrate “spreads” to make bets more even.",
      "content": "Sportsbooks also integrate “spreads” to make bets more even. A “point spread” is like a handicap that ensures an uneven matchup still has a fairly equal chance to pay out in either direction. Spreads also use pluses and minuses, and when you see them, they indicate by how much a team must win or lose by in order for a bet to pay out. [5] X Research source A team with a minus (-) in their spread is the favorite, and they’ll have to win by at least the specified number. For example, if a favorite team with a spread of +5 only wins by 3, their bets will not pay out. A team with a plus (+) in the spread is the underdog, and they’ll have to either win or lose by less than the spread to win the bet. For example, if an underdog with a spread of -2 loses the game by 1 point, their bets will still pay out."

      "content": "Odds are calculated based on past performance and existing bets. Sportsbooks (the organizations that host bets) look at a team’s record, as well as the other side’s record, to calculate their bets—this is the implied probability . Then, they factor in the existing bets to adjust for the probability of your own bet winning. [6] X Research source If you bet on a favored team (+) that already has a lot of bets, your chances are good, but your payout is small, since the bets are divided among many bettors. Each sportsbook calculates their own bets with their own (often secret) formulas and speculations, so odds often look different from book to book."

      "content": "Odds also factor in the “vigorish,” which is the buy-in. The “vigorish” or “vig” (a.k.a. the “juice”) is the amount of money a sportsbook charges for placing a single wager. The vig is how a sportsbook makes money, even when paying out high sums. This makes it so that you often have to wager more money than you expect to gain in order to make a profit on a bet. [7] X Research source For example, normally you might expect to win $20 if you successfully bet $10 on a coin toss—earning back your bet, plus the other bettor’s bet. With a vig, though, if you wanted to win $20, you’d often have to bet $11 to earn back $9 for a total winnings of $20."

A favored team has a decimal below 1.00, and an underdog has a decimal above 1.00. Find your potential winnings by multiplying your bet by the decimal, then adding back your initial bet. For example, if you bet $100 on a favored team with 0.8 odds, you’d make $80, plus $100, for a total of $180. This system is widely used outside the US, and especially used in Europe."

Find your potential payout by multiplying your bet by the numerator, dividing it by the denominator, then adding back your initial bet. [16] X Research source For example, if you bet $200 on an underdog team with 5-4 odds, find your payout with the following equation: (200 * 5) / 4 = 250, + 200 = $400. Fractional odds are mostly used outside the US, and are common in horse racing."
