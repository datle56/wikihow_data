When you don’t like someone you work with, you might be forced to interact with them more than you like; however, whenever you have an ability to influence your situation, try to avoid working directly with them. This might be an active choice that you are able to make or a request you may have to put forward to create a better working situation for yourself. [1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source When communicating the request, Clinical Psychologist Susan Pazak recommends you \"Communicate that you can no longer spend time with the person and the reason why [...] speak with respect and kindness. Use I statements when communicating the message.\" [2] X Expert Source Susan Pazak, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist & Professional Life Coach Expert Interview. 22 February 2022. If you get to choose what projects you work on at work or what groups you are in at school, actively choose an option that doesn’t involve the person you don’t like. If you are placed on a team with someone you dislike, you might consider respectfully asking your boss to move you to another team. But make sure you keep your focus on your work/productivity, not just on your personal feelings. Try saying something like, “I think I could be much more productive if you would consider placing me on a team with Sam instead. We have already proven to be an effective team when working together.” Reader Poll: We asked 163 wikiHow readers what they find most effective for dealing with a difficult coworker, and 63% of them said limiting my time with the coworker.

While it is true that socially you aren’t obligated to have long conversations with anyone you don’t want to, sometimes this isn’t the case at work or school. You may be required to interact with people you don’t like in a professional setting. [4] X Research source In cases like these, keep conversations as brief as possible. To end a conversation gracefully, have an exit line ready. Try saying, “I’ve got a lot of work to do, so I don’t have time to talk right now.” When possible, choose to correspond via email or over the phone rather than face-to-face."

Friday, April 22, 2022. Before you start rearranging your life to avoid someone, take some time to evaluate what is important to you. If you cherish every last second of sleep in the morning, ask yourself if it's worth sacrificing that time to go in early just to avoid someone annoying. Think about if there is a respectful way you can assertively deal with the person that doesn't require you to alter your entire schedule. [8] X Expert Source Julia Yacoob, PhD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 July 2021. Start coming in to work a little early so you can finish your day a little bit earlier if it will help you avoid them. Try to find out what classes they are taking and choose different classes. If the other person is annoying and is giving you trouble, consider bringing it up with a manager. [9] X Expert Source Julia Yacoob, PhD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 July 2021."

      "content": "This is a good way to branch out and remove yourself respectfully. If you are encountering someone you don’t like during activities at school, you might want to try some different activities so that you can avoid this person without causing a scene. This is a great way to remove yourself from the situation without making it obvious that you dislike the person. This may be a good idea if you are already looking to branch out and try other things, but before you stop your activity, you need to consider what you are giving up to avoid this person. Are you willing to sacrifice a hobby or activity you really enjoy? If you start avoiding all the things that you enjoy in life to get away from a temporary discomfort/dislike, you may end up creating a life that is unfulfilling. Carefully consider what is worth giving up just to avoid this person. Consider taking a more assertive approach rather than avoidance. If you are in the same yoga class and you want to avoid the person, try going to Pilates instead. If you both go to the same trivia night at the local bar, try trivia night at a different spot. If you are both rushing for the same sorority or fraternity, consider joining a different one."

If you are in the same study group, try to expand your social circle and find a new study group to join."

At work you may be forced to interact with people you don’t like, but in your personal life you have much more freedom to choose who you do and do not engage with. If you notice your nemesis standing by the bar, head towards the patio instead. Don’t make eye contact with them because this could invite them to approach you and begin a conversation. It may not always be possible to avoid the person — they may approach you anyway or join a group conversation, and you may want to gracefully remove yourself from the situation. You can chat with the person for a moment and then say, \"Well, I hope you enjoy the party! I'm needed by the food table.\""

If you have a particularly annoying family member, try to avoid them even though it might be a bit complicated. Try not to answer the phone when they call. If they do catch you on the phone, try getting away respectfully by saying something like, “I wish I had more time to chat, but I have a lot of things to get done at the moment.” You could try planning a vacation during the holidays. This way, you can spend time with your immediate family while limiting your responsibility to attend other, more stressful gatherings. Don’t add them on social media. This will give them access to your life and more things to try to talk to you about. Or add them, but manage your privacy settings so they can't see your posts. Again, you may want to consider whether avoidance is the best strategy. Is it really worth missing out on seeing the rest of your family just to avoid that uncle you don't like? Consider finding an appropriate time (i.e. not during a big family gathering) to address your issues with the person . One uncomfortable conversation may be worth it to save yourself a lifetime of opting out of family gatherings."

If your personal space has been invaded, try to realize that it is only for a very short time in the span of your lifetime. Then edge away, or steer the person away from you by holding their elbow and gently moving them away from you. [12] X Research source Take a step back if you are feeling crowded. Or try to come up with an excuse to step away from the situation for a moment, like that you need to use the restroom or grab something to drink. You are perfectly entitled to make a request for more space in a polite way. For example: \"Thanks for your concern Mr. Close, however, I would feel more comfortable standing further apart.\""

      "content": "Determine what specific thing that really bothers you about the person. Often, when a person is extremely annoyed by someone else, it has a great deal to do with the person who is annoyed, not the annoying person. Consider a session with a therapist or taking some time on your own to identify what it is that really bothers you about this person. Write it down or state it out loud — is it because they are loud? They choose inappropriate topics of discussion? They stand too close? They are unpredictable? How touchy they are? Pay attention to the moments when you have no patience for this person. Your stomach may tighten up, and you may start having thoughts that sound like, \"I can't believe they... Don't they realize... How can they be so incompetent....\" [14] X Research source Once you have identified what you dislike about the person, ask yourself if there is something behind this. For instance, is the trait that annoys you about the person actually a reflection of a personal trait you don't like about yourself? Is it a reminder from the past — something a family member or former partner used to do that now sets you off?"

      "content": "Being patient is a skill that must be developed; it is not something you are born with. [15] X Research source While your instinct may be to avoid someone who bugs you, this is a temporary fix and does nothing for your personal growth. Instead of finding ways to avoid someone you don't like, work on building up your patience and tolerance for minor annoyances. Consider your encounters with the person as a growth exercise in patience and assertiveness. One way to increase patience is to rethink discomfort. When you find someone irritating, it's often natural to want that person to change or to avoid them, but the real issue is with how your mind is set. When you are around someone you don't like, try thinking to yourself: \"This is uncomfortable but not intolerable.\" Remember that growth is not easy and can be uncomfortable. [16] X Research source"

According to Clinical Psychologist Susan Pazak, one of the steps on the journey to being more assertive is to \"learn what keeps you from being assertive such as lack of confidence, fear, low self esteem, lack of a belief that you are worthy or valuable, etc.\" [18] X Expert Source Susan Pazak, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist & Professional Life Coach Expert Interview. 22 April 2022. You may be afraid of hurting the other person's feelings, causing drama or a scene, or being uncomfortable, and think that avoiding them is better than facing them head-on. Usually, though, this method causes confusion for the other person, inconveniences you as you try to rearrange your life to avoid them, and never actually addresses the problem. Being assertive doesn't mean being aggressive or mean. [19] X Research source Being assertive means advocating for yourself instead of avoiding the situation and becoming resentful and hanging on to those negative feelings. Assertive communication is respectful, clear, and diplomatic. [20] X Research source For instance, maybe you dislike your uncle because at every family event he brings up something embarrassing you did when you were five. Instead of avoiding him, you could talk to him one-on-one and say, \"Could you please stop bringing that up? It's embarrassing and I don't like it.\" Being assertive helps you realize your own power and the control you have over your interactions with others. Tell the truth from your own perspective, without attacking the other person. [21] X Expert Source Susan Pazak, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist & Professional Life Coach Expert Interview. 22 April 2022. Always speak with I-statements when communicating your desire to stay away from people.

If you find yourself in a situation in which you must be around a person you don’t like, try to make a graceful exit to remove yourself from the situation.

This kind of behavior shouldn’t mislead them into thinking you like them, but it also won’t come across as overly rude."

But it is important to set up clear boundaries about how your encounters will go. [24] X Research source If you leave it up to the other person to set the boundaries, you might not like the outcome. So take the initiative and make it clear how you want to interact with them. For instance, be clear about what is and is not okay to talk about, how you would like to be talked to (i.e. names, nicknames, voice level, etc.). You might say, \"Sandra, it makes me uncomfortable when you talk about your family like that. Can we stick to other topics from now on?\""
