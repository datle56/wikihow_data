      "content": "Use the dust brush attachment on your vacuum. Attach the dust brush to the end of your vacuum and run the vacuum over the wall. This is the least abrasive way to clean walls and should always be your first step. If you find that your walls are sufficiently clean after using the vacuum, you should stop after performing this step. [1] X Research source Do not put pressure on the wall as you vacuum it. Lightly rub the vacuum over it and allow the suction to pick up dirt. Pick a section of the wall. Start at the top and move the vacuum from side to side, then down, until you reach the floor. When you reach the floor, move on to the next section. Use a ladder if you cannot reach the ceiling. Empty the vacuum cleaner before beginning this process."

      "title": "Consider adding detergent to the water.",
      "content": "Consider adding detergent to the water. A small amount of detergent can also be thrown into the water, just enough to create a few bubbles. However, this creates the danger of damage to your paint job. Consider starting without detergent. Add detergent if warm water does not seem to be sufficient for cleaning the wall. You should begin the cleaning process with the least abrasive cleaner available and then work up to more abrasive cleaners only if necessary."

      "content": "Use the sponge to clean sections of the wall. As you did with the vacuum, pick a rectangular section of the wall to clean. Start at the ceiling moving left and right, then when you reach the end of the section, move further down. Keep on moving until you reach the floor. Use a ladder to reach the ceiling if necessary. Consider wearing gloves to keep your hands clean during this process."

      "title": "Test the solution.",
      "content": "Test the solution. Before you expose large parts of the wall to the solution, test it on a less noticeable part of the wall. Rub it in and then dry it off. If there is no mark on the wall or discoloration, then you can use the solution on more conspicuous parts of the wall. If the solution has damaged the wall, consider other options for fixing the wall. You can, for example, repaint it or hire professional cleaners. Glossy enamel paints tend to hold up best to abrasive cleaners. Flat, satin, and eggshell latex paints are sensitive to washing. [4] X Research source"

Refrain from using your solution on unstained parts of the wall. [5] X Research source This should be enough to clean most stains from beverages, like coffee or wine. If you believe that your whole wall needs a heavy cleaning, then you could use the solution throughout the room. Generally though, a light cleaning without heavy solutions should suffice for anything but a heavy stain. The risk of damage to your paint job outweighs the benefits of using a cleaning solution on the entire wall."

      "content": "Repeat the process if necessary. If your solution was not strong enough to clean the spot, try using a more abrasive solution. Consider a baking soda paste or commercial cleaner. Once again, test this solution on a less noticeable part of the wall before using it. For a baking soda paste, mix ½ cup of baking soda with a few tablespoons of water. Mix thoroughly and then apply it to the sponge. A degreaser can be particularly useful when cleaning grease splatters."

However, if the paint on your wall is not sufficiently loose to scrape up on its own, you might need to use a stripper. Dip a paintbrush in the stripper and then rub the paintbrush over a section of the wall. Let the stripper sit for five minutes. Then, use a putty knife to scrape away with paint. Repeat this process until you have cleaned the wall. Ideally, once you have scrapped off a portion of the paint, you will be able to use the putty knife to remove the rest, without using a chemical stripper."
