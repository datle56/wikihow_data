      "content": "In the Islamic faith, there are 7 heavens or levels of paradise. According to the Quran, the 7 heavens (also called the “7 skies”) are 7 unique celestial realms. These realms are believed to exist beyond the natural world and are stacked on top of each other. Allah created the 7 heavens for those who have led a virtuous life as a Muslim. Within different levels of the 7 heavens, you may find righteous souls, doers of good deeds, martyrs, angels, Muhammad, or Allah. [1] X Research source Islamic tradition teaches that Jannah (“heaven”) actually includes 100 levels in an incredibly complex series of realms. The 7 levels of heaven each contain angels that test the believers who enter their realm and ultimately decide whether or not these souls can progress to a higher level. [2] X Research source In Arabic, many names of the 7 heavens include the word “jannat,” which means “garden” or “paradise,” but also translates as “heaven.” The very similar word “jannah” means “heaven” as a generally otherworldly paradise. The 7 heavens represent the power of Allah within the Islamic faith. One example of Quranic text links the concept of the 7 heavens to the Islamic creation story: “Do you not see how Allah has created the seven heavens, one above another, and made the moon therein a light, and made the sun a lamp?” — 71:15-16 [3] X Research source"

[5] X Research source Those who reside here live in palaces of pearls, rubies, and emeralds and drink from rivers of wine that don’t intoxicate. Most importantly, those here experience a constant closeness with the creator, along with great spiritual riches. [6] X Research source Quran verse : “Allah has promised to the believing men and the believing women gardens, beneath which rivers flow, to abide in them, and goodly dwellings in gardens of perpetual abode; and best of all is Allah's goodly pleasure; that is the grand achievement.” — Surah At-Tawbah 9:72 [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Living righteously by good deeds can help believers reach paradise. By turning away from sinful acts, believers can more closely align themselves with righteousness and the promise of the 7 heavens. They can voluntarily perform good works while practicing kindness, charity, and love toward their neighbor. These virtuous acts can help erase any minor sins they’ve committed and make up for areas in their spiritual life where they fell short. [21] X Research source How to get to Jannat-al-Adan : It’s believed those who practice Islam by obeying Allah and his prophet Muhammad can enter this realm. They also end up here once they repent and face any punishments for sins they’ve committed. [22] X Research source How to get to Jannat-al-Firdaws : As with Jannat-al-Adan, believers can enter this higher realm because of their worship and devotion to Allah, along with good deeds and charity they take part in during their lives. [23] X Research source How to get to Jannat-an-Naim : People who have strong faith in Allah and do good works in their lives can reach Jannat-an-Naim. Others who have powerful convictions to remain virtuous throughout their life can also end up here. [24] X Research source How to get to Jannat-ul-Mawa : Jannat-ul-Mawa is a place meant for devotees and martyrs of the purest kind. A martyr is someone who gives their life to defend their faith. [25] X Research source How to get to Jannat-ul-Khuld : This level is intended for those who follow their religious path with the highest level of devotion and do not leave the path or transgress. Jannat-ul-Khuld also makes up for any hardship and loss that believers meet during their lives. [26] X Research source How to get to Dar-us-Salam : Those in Dar-us-Salam must live a righteous life, perform all good deeds and religious duties, follow Islam’s teachings, and ask for forgiveness from Allah for any sins.

It’s considered a complex network of levels with a single purpose: dispensing justice against sinful deeds. Jahannam is used in Islam to encourage believers to follow Allah’s teachings and the rules of Islam . [32] X Research source Jahannam : For sinful Muslims who still believe in Allah. Ladah : For those who deny Allah’s existence. Saqar : For Muslims who don’t pray in Islam , ignore the poor, and gossip. Al-Hutamah : For those who consume false wealth and cause strife to others.

Illiyyun is also called “the highest place,” which may have led to the idea of Illiyyun being thought of as the 8th level of heaven. Most agree that Illiyyun more closely refers to a record of the deeds of the righteous where the highest rewards are kept. Angels of Hafaza (meaning “protection”) are said to await the virtuous deeds of true believers to arrive in the Islamic record of good deeds. [33] X Research source"

The only instance where more than one heaven is referenced includes an except when Paul mentions a “third heaven” in 2 Corinthians 12:2. The Bible does refer to the word “heavens” on occasion, but isn’t meant to mean a multilayered idea of the heavens created by God. #*Outside of the Bible, Dante’s Divine Comedy discusses more than 1 heaven in Paradiso . [36] X Research source The verse reads, “Now the pilgrim sees the two courts of heaven made manifest, as the river's sparks transform into angels and the riverbank's flowers into saints.” The text refers to “two courts of heaven,” one human and one angelic. [37] X Research source The term “7th heaven” in English means to be “extremely happy” about something. It’s based on the Islamic (and ancient Jewish) concept of 7 heavens and is an expression that’s been used since the 19th century. [38] X Research source"
