      "content": "Clean and dry the surfaces where you want to place your Velcro. The adhesive on your strips won’t stick very well if the surfaces are dirty. You can use any multi-surface cleaner to wipe the items you’re attaching the Velcro to. After cleaning off any dust or residue, dry the surfaces completely with a clean cloth.

      "content": "Peel the backing off of one strip. The Velcro’s hook side and loop side will each have their own adhesive backing. Peel the protective sheet off the strip to expose the adhesive underneath. Once you take the backing off, be careful not to touch the sticky sides, or else they might not adhere very well.

      "content": "Press the first strip onto your item. You can use the hook or loop strip on either surface, so it doesn’t matter which one you use right now. Line the strip up with where you want to place it and push it firmly against the surface. Press down on the strip with your palm to make sure it’s flat.

      "content": "Wait 24 hours for the strongest adhesion. While you can attach the Velcro strips to one another right away, it won’t quite hold at full strength. If you’re worried about the adhesive coming undone, then give it at least a day before putting the strips together. [6] X Research source Adhesive Velcro strips won’t stick as well if you peel them off and try reusing them."

You can either sew by hand or use a sewing machine to attach the Velcro. Go around each edge of the strip with your needle and thread so the Velcro doesn’t lift up off of the fabric. Be sure you backstitch the seam to make it more secure. [12] X Research source Try using the same color thread as the Velcro so it blends in. You can also sew an X through the center of the Velcro to keep it flat against the fabric. [13] X Research source"

Pick at an edge with your finger to see if it moves. If the edge stays in place, then you’re finished! If it peels back, go over it with your iron before checking again. [20] X Research source Wait 24 hours after attaching the Velcro to wash or dry your fabric again. When you do, close the fastener so lint doesn’t get caught in it."
