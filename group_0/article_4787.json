      "content": "Place a metal object (such as a knife, a nail, etc) in the saltwater. The foil is one terminal, and the water/metal object combination is the other. Do not allow the water or the metal object to touch the foil or spill over the side. This will short the capacitor and make it impossible to charge. Later you can use a voltmeter to verify if the capacitor can hold a charge."
