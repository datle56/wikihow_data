      "content": "Divide the squash into quarters. Use a sharp serrated knife to cut the squash into quarters lengthwise. Cut the squash in half from top to bottom. Use a sawing motion. Cut each half in half, again working from top to bottom in a sawing motion. Peeling the squash is not necessary Use a metal spoon or melon-baller to remove the seeds and stringy pulp."

Divide the butter equally among all the quarters. Dot the cut surface with small chunks of butter. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the squash. This should be done according to taste, but if you are uncertain where to start, use roughly 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) salt and 1/8 tsp (0.62 ml) pepper per quarter. Additional herbs and seasonings can also be used. For instance, you can sprinkle the squash with thyme or parsley for a savory taste or a dash of red pepper for a spicier flavor."

If desired, you can also drizzle the halves with melted butter or a little olive oil. For a tangier twist, consider drizzling the squash with lime juice. To make the squash easier to serve, you may wish to cut the halves in half again, ultimately dividing the squash into quarters."
