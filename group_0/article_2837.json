      "title": "Be active.",
      "content": "Be active. If a person needs followers and friends they need to be more active. Being active will also help the person meet new people and increase the chances of them following the person. In fact, Scratch has people all over the world and each Scratcher lives in their own timeline zone and if a person becomes online once the person leaves it is most likely for the person not to be followed or viewed by that particular person."
    },
    {
      "title": "Follow the community guidelines.",
      "content": "Follow the community guidelines. Scratch is a friendly place and is made for all ages, religion and cast. The person will come across many different people in Scratch. Be respectful towards people. A polite and friendly attitude will go a long way in winning more followers. Avoid keeping a negative attitude and follow community guidelines. If a person Ignores the community guidelines they will get responded in the following ways - People can get banned(A person can get banned for a maximum of 4 times. After that, they will get permanently blacklisted.) The number of followers the person is maintaining will decrease. There is a chance that people who support the person unfollow you and spread hate. There is an 80% chance of the person getting banned from Scratch forever."

      "title": "Make good projects.",
      "content": "Make good projects. Making good quality projects increases your chances of getting featured. If your projects are popular, people will be more likely to follow your account. In fact, most of the Scratchers only follow the people who blow their mind with amazing projects for example Sterlon, a Scratcher, makes amazing animations and is followed by almost everyone."

    {
      "title": "Give credit when necessary.",
      "content": "Give credit when necessary. By refusing to give credit the person will not grow higher in the website, and will also face problems. There are many remixes with a lot of views. Change the coding in all remixes or else others might report the project saying it is copied head to toe and people would comment or even tag the certain project to the team and the person will not only get a ban but will also lose a lot of followers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Join studios.",
      "content": "Join studios. By joining studios and adding projects to them people who are known as Scratchers will be aware that there is a good newcomer or a Scratcher and will follow the newcomer so that they can know what the person does in the website and get notified when the person shares a project! Apart from that studios are fun and can also be a hang out or a chill spot for others. By joining them there is a 100% chance of meeting new people."

    {
      "title": "Have a strong determination.",
      "content": "Have a strong determination. The website Scratch is a place for all, from adults to children but in the case of being famous the person needs a strong determination. The person needs to concentrate in a specific project or studio and perfect it to its full potential.By following this the person would really succeed. The person should not give up no matter what happens in the website as Scratchers mostly distract the bright ones."
    },
    {
      "title": "Advertise.",
      "content": "Advertise. Although advertising is often not good and can even sometimes get you banned, if you advertise on certain studios (eg: studios like \"advertise!\") your projects will likely get more views. You can also add projects to studios like, \"become popular\". However, avoid advertising on other people's projects, as you may get reported."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be friendly.",
      "content": "Be friendly. In Scratch people who are friendly , helpful , and kind are respected by Scratchers. By being friendly the person may follow and trust the certain Scratcher and when a person trusts a Scratcher then it benefits the Scratcher as they will support and be on the person's side when falling into trouble. They will also help the person when the person needs followers and be there whenever the person faces problems."
    },
    {
      "title": "Help others.",
      "content": "Help others. Remember Scratch is a community and communities help each other. Being famous doesn't need the brag of having a lot of followers or knowing a lot of Scratchers in personal, it is when a person is kind, helpful and when there to help for others in their hard times. For example the quote from J.Cornell Micheal on the pretty ones are usually unhappy, They expect everyone to be enamored of their beauty. How can a person be content when their happiness lies in someone elseâ€™s hands, ready to be crushed at any moment? Ordinary-looking people are far 1. superior, because they are forced to actually work hard to achieve their goals, instead of expecting people to fall all over themselves to help them."

    {
      "title": "Visit Forums and Contests.",
      "content": "Visit Forums and Contests. Other than just coding Scratch has more fun things to do like forums and contests. The Forums are a place where the Scratchers can meet up and share their skills with new beginners and the beginners can ask for help and so on! Other than forums Scratch has fun and exciting Contests where people make projects according to the theme and the winner gets prizes that is awarded from the Founder of scratch.mit.edu."

      "title": "Contact the team.",
      "content": "Contact the team. Scratch is a website and websites are made by a specific person or an assembly of people, Scratch is a really popular website and can't be controlled by a singular person. The Scratch Team are a group of people who maintain Scratch and asking or contacting with them for help, doubts or anything can benefit the person as the Scratch Team are experienced Scratchers over the age of 18 from all around the world."
