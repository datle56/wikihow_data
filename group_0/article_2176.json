      "title": "Improve your vocabulary",
      "content": "Improve your vocabulary to find better word choices. The best starting point for writing more formally is building a larger vocabulary. If you learn more words, you can replace nondescript words like “good” and “bad” with more formal alternatives like “negative.” This avoids repetition and makes formalizing your writing much easier. [1] X Research source Reading widely is a great way to improve your vocabulary. Look for upper-level publications like The Atlantic or Foreign Affairs for articles with more advanced language. College-level books also have a wide selection of potential new words for you to learn. Consider signing up for a “word of the day” app or website. These resources help you learn at least 1 new word every day."

      "title": "Spell out words instead of using contractions.",
      "content": "Spell out words instead of using contractions. Contractions are combinations of 2 words. For example, “don’t” is a combination of “do not.” People use contractions when they speak all the time because it’s faster, but formal writing should have few or no contractions. Whenever you write, proofread to find any places where you used contractions and convert them to use the full words. [2] X Research source Some other common contractions are “can’t,” “won’t,” “isn’t,” and “aren’t.” Replace these words with “cannot,” “will not,” “is not,” and “are not.”"

      "title": "Avoid nondescript filler words.",
      "content": "Avoid nondescript filler words. Formal writing is concise and clear. Extra filler words make your tone sound less professional and precise. Go through your writing and find any broad or general words. Either replace them with more exact words or eliminate them altogether. [3] X Research source Some imprecise words or phrases are “a lot,” “very,” or “totally.” Replace “a lot” with a more precise figure, like “12%.” “Very” and “totally,” in most cases, can be eliminated entirely. Adverbs like “really” or “clearly” are usually filler words that don’t add much detail to your writing. Reduce your use of adverbs to eliminate unnecessary words."

      "title": "Replace phrasal verbs with more precise words.",
      "content": "Replace phrasal verbs with more precise words. A phrasal verb is a combination of a verb and a preposition that creates a phrase with a different meaning. These phrases are usually less formal than other words, so replace them with other words that convey the same message more specifically. [4] X Research source For example, in the sentence “John put down the conclusions in last month’s study,” the phrasal verb “put down” makes the sentence sound informal. Writing “John dismissed the conclusions in last month’s study” instead makes the sentence more formal. This is a case where building your vocabulary is very helpful. With a larger vocabulary, you can quickly replace phrasal verbs with more formal alternatives. Use a thesaurus or dictionary if you need help coming up with different words to replace phrasal verbs."

      "content": "Write in the third person in most situations. Generally, formal writing doesn’t use “I,” or “We.” Rather, write in the third person. [5] X Expert Source Tristen Bonacci English Teacher Expert Interview. 21 December 2021. This means avoiding terms like \"I\" or \"We.\" Instead, refer to “the team” or “this company.” This language keeps your writing fact-based and doesn’t make it seem like you’re inserting your opinions into it. [6] X Research source One exception to this rule is in a cover letter or personal statement. In these documents, you should be writing about yourself specifically."

      "title": "Avoid using slang words and phrases.",
      "content": "Avoid using slang words and phrases. Slang refers to very informal language that people commonly use around their friends. While it's fine to use in conversations, do not use any slang language in formal writing. Words like \"cool,\" \"chill out,\" or \"hyped\" don't belong in your writing. Replace them with more professional substitutes. Never use \"textspeak\" like \"lol\" or \"omg.\" [7] X Research source If you aren't sure about using a particular phrase, consider if it's something you often say when hanging out with your friends. If it is, then it's probably an informal slang term. Replace it, just to be safe. For example, if you were writing a professional review of an amusement park, don't use slang language like, \"Everyone had a really cool time.\" Instead, say \"The group had an enjoyable experience at the park.\" There are many more slang terms and phrases, and the list grows every year. Try searching for a phrase you're considering using to see if it's been added to a list of slang terms. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Write in a confident tone. All formal writing should have a confident, authoritative tone. Establish yourself as someone who knows what they’re talking about and command your readers’ respect. Using clear language, facts, and statistics helps to establish a confident tone. Also remove any words or phrases that make you sound unsure or nervous. Don't write, \"It's a possibility that we could conclude...\" Instead, say, \"We can firmly conclude that...\" Make sure all your writing conveys this tone. [9] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source In a job cover letter, for example, phrases like “I think I am qualified” are not appropriate. Instead, convey confidence by saying “I am qualified for this position.” Don’t present yourself as arrogant, however. Saying “You have no choice but to agree with my conclusions” is inappropriate. Instead, write “I am confident in my conclusions.” This shows your authority without seeming arrogant."

      "content": "Use specific statements rather than general expressions. Broad generalizations are not professional or formal. In a formal essay, qualify all of your statements. Tell your readers the point you're making right away and what evidence you're using to support it. [10] X Research source As an added bonus, using specific information helps you sound more confident. Whenever possible, use figures, statistics, and evidence to support your point. For example, writing that “Kids today spend too much time on the phone” is too general and doesn’t give your reader any evidence or statistics. Writing “In 2017, kids spent an average of 7 hours per day on their phones. The American Medical Association says that is an excessive amount,” provides a clear, precise statement that makes your point."

      "content": "Write in the active voice for most situations. The active voice is when the subject of the sentences is doing the action. In the passive voice, the subject receives the action. Both have their role, but use the active voice for formal writing as much as possible. The active voice is clearer, more concise, and sounds more professional than the passive voice. [11] X Research source Determine if a sentence is in the active or passive voice by asking yourself, \"Who or what is doing the action?\" In, \"The door was opened by Mike,\" Mike is doing the action but the door is the subject. Switch it to, \"Mike opened the door\" to convert the sentence to the active voice."

Replace any cliched statements with specific figures and information. [12] X Research source Some common clichés are “raining cats and dogs,” “as strong as an ox,” “open the floodgates,” or “delicate as a rose.” Avoid using statements like these.

As the author, present a more detached tone and don’t appeal to readers’ emotions. [14] X Research source For example, “It was a heartbreaking scene” is an emotional phrase. Replace it with a more detached, informative statement. Note that this doesn’t mean you aren’t allowed to express opinions in formal writing.

Only use question marks when you're asking a specific question, like in a letter. Use other punctuation marks like dashes and semicolons sparingly.

      "content": "Vary your sentence length. There is no set rule on how long your sentences should be, but don’t write sentences that are all the same length. An essay made up of all short sentences sounds too simplistic, while an essay of all long sentences seems wordy and confusing. Alter your sentence construction to come up with sentences of varying length throughout the essay. Check your writing and see if there are sections where you use several short or long sentences in a row. Break up these sections by altering the length on 1 or 2 of these sentences. Consider shortening long sentences by breaking them into 2 or even 3 separate sentences. Join 2 short sentences with a comma. However, make sure these 2 sentences are not both independent clauses or you might have a run-on sentence."
