    {
      "title": "Put single quotation marks around the speech if it's only part of the quoted passage.",
      "content": "Put single quotation marks around the speech if it's only part of the quoted passage. If the passage you're quoting includes both speech and expository text, use double quotation marks at the beginning and end of the quoted passage. Use single quotation marks to set off the part of the passage where the character is speaking. [2] X Research source For example, you might write: Nick, the narrator of the story, clearly has class insecurity: \"'You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,' I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. 'Can't you talk about crops or something?'\" (Fitzgerald 15)"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use double quotation marks if you're quoting only the speech.",
      "content": "Use double quotation marks if you're quoting only the speech. Let your readers know through your text that the quote is a character speaking, then use only double quotation marks around the speech itself. You don't have to use an extra single quotation mark to show that you're quoting dialogue. [3] X Research source For example, you might write: Tom brings his racism full center when he exclaims that \"civilization's going to pieces.\" (Fitzgerald 15)"
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the page number or range in parentheses after the quote.",
      "content": "Place the page number or range in parentheses after the quote. If you haven't mentioned the author in the text of your paper, include their last name first. Then, type only the page number, or the first page of the range and last page of the range, separated by a hyphen. Place a period outside the closing parenthesis. [4] X Research source For example, you might write: Tom describes a book he's been reading and asserts \"The idea is if we don't look out the white race will be — will be utterly submerged. It's all scientific stuff; it's been proved\" (Fitzgerald 16)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Introduce the block quote with a colon.",
      "content": "Introduce the block quote with a colon. Use a sentence in your paper to set up the block quote by explaining what it shows, summarizing its content, or describing its importance in relation to your paper's theme. End that sentence with a colon. [5] X Research source For example, you might write: \"You don't have to read far into Fitzgerald's book to encounter outright racism:\" and then follow with a block quote about Tom discussing his white supremacist thoughts."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set the left margin of the block quote 0.5 in (1.3 cm) over from your text.",
      "content": "Set the left margin of the block quote 0.5 in (1.3 cm) over from your text. This new left margin applies to the entire block quote. The right margin doesn't change. For each new paragraph or line of dialogue, indent another 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the block quote's margin. This includes the first line, so if your block quote starts at the beginning of a paragraph or first line of dialogue, the first line would be indented 1 in (2.5 cm)from the margin of your main text. [6] X Research source With dialogue from a novel or short story, retain the paragraph format that appears in the original source and use double quotation marks around the spoken dialogue. If you're quoting dialogue from a play, the margins are different. The entire quote is set off 1 in (2.5 cm) from the text of your paper. Each subsequent line beyond a character's first is indented an additional 0.25 in (0.64 cm) (about 3 spaces)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Start each line with the character's name when quoting a play.",
      "content": "Start each line with the character's name when quoting a play. Type the character's name in all capital letters, followed by a period. Then, copy that character's lines. If your block quote includes lines from more than one character, do the same for each character you quote. Don't use quotation marks anywhere in the dialogue when block-quoting dialogue from a play. For example, you might quote the dialogue before Romeo and Juliet's first kiss: ROMEO. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? JULIET. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. ROMEO. O then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. JULIET. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake. ROMEO. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take. (Shakespeare 1.5.112-117)"

    {
      "title": "Add the page number or range in parentheses at the end of the block quote.",
      "content": "Add the page number or range in parentheses at the end of the block quote. With a block quote, the page number or range goes outside the closing punctuation for the quote. No punctuation is necessary after the closing parenthesis. If you haven't included the name of the author in your text preceding the block quote, add it to your parenthetical before the page number or range. [7] X Research source For example, the last lines of your block quote might look like this: And I hope she'll be a fool — that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.\" (Fitzgerald 19-20)"

Place a period at the end of the author's first name. Include initials as necessary, if they're included on the title page of the source. [8] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source Example: Fitzgerald, F. Scott. If there are 2 authors, list them in the order they appear on the title page of the book. Place a comma after the first author's first name, then type the word \"and,\" followed by the second author's first and last name. (Example: Smith, John and Sally Ride) If there are 3 or more authors, list only the first author's name, add a comma after their first name, then type the abbreviation \"et al.\" (Example: Smith, John, et al.)"

      "title": "Add the title of the source.",
      "content": "Add the title of the source. For most works of literature, the source is a book or similar volume, so you'd put the title in italics. If you happen to be quoting from a smaller work, such as a story in a magazine or literary journal or a play in a collected volume of plays, put the title in double quotation marks. Capitalize the first word of the title and all nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives. Place a period at the end of the title (inside the double quotation marks, if you're using those).

Capitalize it the same way you capitalized the title of the source, with a comma at the end. If there's an editor, add the words \"edited by\" followed by their name.
