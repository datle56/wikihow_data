      "title": "Find gentle cleanser.",
      "content": "Find gentle cleanser. Look for an oil and alcohol-free cleanser. Excess oil especially can break down the adhesive on your extensions. Opt for a foaming face cleanser or gentle face soap. You can even use baby shampoo. [1] X Research source Be careful with baby shampoo because it can be drying. You can dilute a foaming cleanser with a little water to make it gentler. Seek out a cleanser that is specifically designed for eyelash extensions."

      "title": "Wash your lashes.",
      "content": "Wash your lashes. Wet your lashes with warm water. Put some cleanser on your fingertips and work it gently into your eyelids and lashes. Use up-and-down movements. Don’t use side-to-side motions or tug your lashes so you don’t lose extensions or damage your natural eyelashes. Rinse thoroughly with warm water. Be sure to clean your lash line well because this is where bacteria and other dirt can build up most."

    {
      "title": "Avoid cotton pads or wipes.",
      "content": "Avoid cotton pads or wipes. Don’t use cotton pads or balls to clean your lashes. The fibers can get stuck in them and you’ll need to carefully pick those out. Also skip using cleansing wipes because those can loosen or rip out your extensions. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Dry your lashes naturally.",
      "content": "Dry your lashes naturally. After washing your lashes, gently pat your face dry with a towel, but avoid your eyes to protect your extensions. Let your lashes air dry instead. To speed up the drying process, you can wrap some toilet paper around your finger and gently blot your lashes. If you want to be especially careful of your extensions, just let your lashes sit on the toilet paper for a few seconds so the water can be absorbed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Blow them dry.",
      "content": "Blow them dry. Set your blow dryer on its coolest setting. Next, blast your lashes for about ten seconds on each eye. Be sure to keep the dryer about arm’s length from your face. Don’t do this too often because you want to maintain the adhesive in your extensions."
    },
    {
      "title": "Comb them out.",
      "content": "Comb them out. Close one eye. Using a clean, dry mascara brush, gently roll it over your lashes. Next, fluff out the lashes a bit with the brush. Don’t drag the brush through the base of your lashes. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Clean your extensions regularly.",
      "content": "Clean your extensions regularly. Take the time to wash your extensions at least a few times a week if not daily. Remove light debris and dust in between washings with a little warm water and combing. Do this by wetting your lashes with a little warm water and then very gently combing them out. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your lashes oil-free.",
      "content": "Keep your lashes oil-free. Don’t let moisture-rich products like shampoos, conditioners, glycerin, or heavy creams near your lashes or lash line to protect the integrity of the adhesive. For example, tilt your head back in the shower to keep these products away from your eyes. Also try dabbing a very thin line of 70% isopropyl alcohol on your lash line once a week to wipe away excess oil that can be produced by sweat when you exercise frequently. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Don’t rub your eyes.",
      "content": "Don’t rub your eyes. Avoid tugging, rubbing, or pulling at your lashes. This will loosen them and make them look clumpy if you’re not careful. It can also pull out your natural lashes. Get them professionally removed if the extensions itch or are otherwise really bothering you. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use eye makeup carefully.",
      "content": "Use eye makeup carefully. Avoid cream eyeshadows, and use powdered eyeshadow as you normally would, focusing application at the very corners of your eyes. Steer away from liquid eyeliner, which can damage your extensions. Most importantly, never use mascara. It will damage your extensions and leave them looking and feeling crusty.
