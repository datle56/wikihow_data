      "content": "Show your interest by casually dropping it in conversation. When you’re chatting with your parents, test the waters by mentioning a pet cat. Talk about why cats would make a good pet or simply ask them what they’d think of a new pet in the house. [1] X Research source If you want to be a little more subtle, talk about a friend that has a cat and how you’re ready to take care of one too. However, avoid bringing it up every single day since it might annoy your parents. [2] X Research source For example, you could say something like, “Did you know cats are pretty easy to take care of? And they’re so quiet so you wouldn’t even notice them around!” or, “My friend just got a new kitten and it’s so cute! I wish I could have one too.”"

      "content": "Your parents might change their mind if they see how adorable cats are. Search on YouTube or look through social media sites to see what new videos and pictures people post of their cats. Then, send the videos to your parents or show them in person so they see how excited you are. As your parents see how cats interact and behave, they might warm up to the idea of you getting one too. [3] X Research source Ask your friends to send you pictures and videos of their cats. For example, you could say something like, “Look at this picture Dan just sent me of his cat sleeping on his lap! That would be pretty cozy, wouldn’t it?”"

      "content": "Find out why your parents are hesitant about getting a pet. If your parents aren’t sold on the idea of you having a cat, they might have some good reasons why. Sit down with them and ask them directly so you know what they’re worried about. Let them explain all of the reasons they’re concerned and write them down so you look for ways to resolve them. They may be concerned about how responsible you are, how you’ll afford a new pet, or who will care for your cat while you’re gone. [4] X Research source For example, you can ask, “I know you don’t want a cat in the house. Could you please explain why?” Your family might also have an issue if they’re worried about the cat making a mess or if someone has a cat allergy."

      "content": "Become an expert so you can answer your parent’s questions. Look into different breeds and how they behave to see what works best for your living situation and lifestyle. Keep in mind any concerns your parents have mentioned so you can look for cats that are a better fit for your family. On top of that, check what sorts of food, toys, and supplies you’ll need for a cat so you know exactly what you’re getting into. [5] X Research source For example, you may want to find a breed that’s more relaxed and doesn’t require a lot of attention while you’re at school, such as Maine Coons or Ragdoll cats. [6] X Research source Get your parents involved while you’re researching so they can warm up to the idea even more. Look into the pros and cons of getting an adult cat compared to a kitten. Kittens require a lot more supervision and attention than adult cats.

      "content": "A slideshow or poster is a great way to explain why you’re ready for a pet. Include any information you’ve learned and cover any issues your parents have with owning a cat. Practice giving your presentation a few times before sitting down and showing it to your parents. When you present, answer any questions they have to show them you’re prepared and that you’ve thought through everything. [8] X Research source For example, you could have sections listing what breeds you’re interested in, how they behave, and what ways you’ve shown that you’re responsible enough for a pet."

      "content": "Finding answers for your parent’s concerns shows that you’re thoughtful. Sit your parents down and mention the issues they initially had. Come up with some counter-arguments for each issue based on your research so your parents understand how dedicated you are. Even though your parents may still say no, don’t get discouraged. They’ll still start to realize how important getting a cat is to you and appreciate the hard work you put in.

Go to source For example, if you have a family member that’s allergic to cats, you can say, “I know you were concerned about mom’s allergies, but here are a few hypo-allergenic breeds I found.” As another example, if they’re worried about a smelly litter box, you can bring up odor-eliminating litter options or a covered litter box."

Tell them that a pet cat could help decrease blood pressure, reduce stress, and make you feel less lonely.

      "content": "Cleaning up demonstrates your responsibility. Before your parents have a chance to ask you, start doing things around the house to clean up and help out. Rather than complaining about your chores, do them happily and ask if there’s more that you can do. Showing the initiative makes your parents realize that you’re ready and willing to put a lot of effort into owning a pet cat.

      "content": "Taking care of some of the expenses takes the burden off your parents. Between the supplies, food, and vet trips, the cost of owning a cat can add up pretty quickly. Estimate how much you’ll have to spend each month on your cat so you can start saving. Rather than buying things you don’t need, set your money aside to show that you have enough to cover the costs of a cat. If you need to, apply for a part-time job so you can earn a little extra cash. [15] X Research source Even if you can’t afford the cost of a cat entirely, your parents will see that you took the initiative and are willing to help out and take care of your new pet."

As you’re watching their cat, play with it and make sure you follow all of their care instructions. Take some pictures or videos to show your parents so you can prove that you’re able to look after a cat on your own.

      "content": "Meeting some cats in person might sway your parents’ decision. Research some local animal shelters in your area and choose one to visit with your parents. Interact with the cats that are available and ask the employees for more information about them. Let your parents play and meet the cats too so they can get used to being around them. If your parents were hesitant before, spending time with some of the cats might be enough to get them on board. [17] X Research source If you can’t get your parents to go to a shelter with you, show them some brochures or look online to see if they’ve posted pictures of the available cats online. Ask the animal shelter if they have any fostering programs. That way, you can bring a cat home and test-run taking care of it before committing to adopting or buying one."
