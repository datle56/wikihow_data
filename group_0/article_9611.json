[2] X Research source hhttps://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/conversions/celsius-to-fahrenheit.php Example 1: If the Celsius temperature is 20, multiply 20 by 1.8 to get 36. Alternatively, multiply the temperature (20) by 9, which equals 180, then divide 180 by 5, which equals 36. Example 2: If the Celsius temperature is -10, multiply -10 by 1.8 to get -18. Alternatively, multiply the temperature (-10) by 9, which equals -90, and then divide by 5 —this also gives you -18."

After subtracting 32 from the temperature, multiply the answer you calculated by 5 9 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {5}{9}}} (or 0.55). [6] X Research source Example 1: Multiply 58 1 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {58}{1}}} by 5 9 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {5}{9}}} , which gives you 290 9 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {290}{9}}} . Divide this fraction to get 32.2—thus, 90°F is equal to 32.2°C. Example 2: Multiply − 37 1 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {-37}{1}}} by 5 9 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {5}{9}}} , which gives you − 185 9 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {-185}{9}}} . Divide this fraction to get -20.5—thus, -5°F is equal to -20.5°C. Keep in mind that 0.55 is actually short for 0.5555555555555556—so, only use the abbreviated decimal in your formula if you don’t need a precise conversion. It is more accurate to divide the subtracted difference by 1.8 instead of multiplying by 0.55, as it does not incur the loss of precision. This is because 1 1.8 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{1.8}}} = 10 18 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {10}{18}}} = 5 9 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {5}{9}}} exactly. Example 1: Divide 58 {\\displaystyle 58} by 1.8 {\\displaystyle 1.8} , which gives you 32.2—thus, 90°F is equal to 32.2°C, as above. Example 2: Divide − 37 {\\displaystyle -37} by 1.8 {\\displaystyle 1.8} , which gives you -20.5—thus, -5°F is equal to -20.5°C, as above."
