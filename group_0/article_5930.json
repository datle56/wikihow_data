      "content": "Choose a high-quality cat food. Most commercial cat foods will provide your Himalayan with adequate nutrition, but a high-quality food will help to ensure that your cat looks and feels his best. Look for a cat food that lists meat (not just a meat by-product) as the first ingredient. If you are unsure about whether or not a food is high-quality, ask your veterinarian for a recommendation. Make sure that the cat food you choose contains taurine. This is an essential amino acid that all cats need. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Only feed your cat a food that is specially formulated for cats. Other foods may not have the nutrients and amino acids that your cat needs to be healthy. This may lead to heart and vision problems for your cat.

      "content": "Set up a regular feeding schedule. To keep your Himalayan at a healthy weight, you will need to create a feeding schedule and stick with it. Free-feeding (placing food out and allowing your cat to eat whenever he wants) can cause your cat to become overweight. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source That is why it is ideal to feed your cat a measured amount of food twice per day. Use your cat's weight and age to determine how much food to give for each feeding. The food that you purchase for your Himalayan should indicate how much food to give your cat for his weight and age. For example, a cat that weighs five to nine pounds needs about 1/3 to 2/3 of a cup of dry food per day. A cat that weighs between 10 to 14 pounds needs about 2/3 of a cup to one cup of food per day. If you are not sure about the amount to give your cat, then ask your veterinarian for a recommendation. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Split the amount of food that you are supposed to give your cat every day into two or three feedings because cats prefer smaller meals. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For example, you might give your eight pound cat 1/3 of a cup of food in the morning and 1/3 of a cup of food at night. If your cat weighs 12 pounds, then you might give him 1/2 cup of food in the morning and 1/2 cup of food at night."

      "content": "Provide plenty of fresh, clean water. Your Himalayan will need to have access to fresh, clean water at all times. Make sure that you place the water somewhere that is easy for your cat to access and that is not near a litter box. Cats do not like to eat or drink near their litter boxes. Change your cat's water at least once per day."

      "content": "Give your Himalayan treats. You can purchase special kitty treats in pet stores and grocery stores, just make sure that you do not give your cat too many of these treats. Too many treats may cause your cat to become overweight or lead to picky eating habits. Offer him a few treats per day, but make sure that treats do not make up more than 10% of his daily calories. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Give your cat a little piece of turkey, chicken, fish, or lean deli meat now and then. Cats are natural carnivores so they tolerate these foods well. Just make sure that the meat has been cooked to protect your cat from harmful bacteria.

      "title": "Brush your Himalayan's fur daily.",
      "content": "Brush your Himalayan's fur daily. Use a stainless steel comb or a wire brush to groom your Himalayan's fur every day. If you do not brush your Himalayan every day, it is likely that she will become matted. Matting can be painful for your cat and frustrating for you to deal with as well. Brush your cat daily from a young age so that she will be used to it. Offer your cat lots of praise and give her a treat after the grooming session so that she will like grooming even more. Start by brushing your cat's back with a wire slicker brush and then move to the sides of her body. Make sure that you brush your cat's tummy, chest, and tail with the slicker brush as well. If you encounter any tangles, switch to the stainless steel greyhound comb and use it to break up the tangles. Work from the bottom of the tangle and then move the comb a bit closer to your cat's skin as you loosen it."

Make sure that you choose a groomer who knows how to groom long-haired cats. Keeping your Himalayan's fur trimmed short can also be a good way to keep her clean and mat-free if you do not have time for daily brushing. Just keep in mind that each visit to the groomer will cost around $35 to $50. [10] X Research source"

Himalayans are quite fond of their human companions and will want to be wherever you are. Your Himalayan may even follow you from room to room and try to “help” you with things.

To protect your furniture from scratching, you will need to make sure that your Himalayan has some appropriate places to scratch. [11] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Try getting some corrugated cardboard scratching boards or setting up a few upright wooden scratching posts around your house. If you ever catch your Himalayan scratching the furniture or carpet, do not punish him. Just pick him up and take him to the nearest scratching post.

Fill the boxes with about two inches of a fine-grained clumping clay cat litter. You will need to scoop the litter box daily and change the litter twice per week. You should have one more litter box than the total number of cats in your home. For example, if you have two cats, then you need three litter boxes.
