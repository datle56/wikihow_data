Look at the trapezoidal port in your laptop to see if it says “HDMI input.” [2] X Research source If your laptop does have an HDMI input port: Plug one end of the HDMI cable into it and the other into the HDMI port on the back of your PlayStation.

Even if you can’t connect your laptop directly to the PS4, you can use the Remote Play app to play the games from your PlayStation on your laptop with a PS4 controller."
