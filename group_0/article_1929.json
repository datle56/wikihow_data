      "title": "Choose the right time.",
      "content": "Choose the right time. Don’t ask someone for help when they are obviously busy or distracted. For example, don’t ask your professor for help with homework right as they are trying to start class. Similarly, don’t ask your boss for advice as they are rushing out the door. [2] X Research source If you’re not sure whether or not it is a good time, just ask. You can say, “I’ve love to ask for your help with something. Is there a time that’s good for you to talk?”"

    {
      "title": "Speak up.",
      "content": "Speak up. In most cases, if you don’t ask for help you won’t receive it. Sometimes people might be hesitant to step up and offer help. If you need something, speak up and ask. [3] X Research source Maybe you’re traveling alone in a new city. If you’re lost, ask for directions. Stop into a nearby store, or ask the bus driver which stop you need. You may feel vulnerable speaking up for help, but a certain degree of vulnerability can help you find the help you need. Don't feel weak, insecure, or embarrassed by asking for help."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be specific.",
      "content": "Be specific. People aren’t mind readers. Instead of just saying, “I need help,” clearly state precisely what it is that you need. For example, instead of saying to your teacher, “I’m confused. Can you help me?”, say, “I don’t understand how to solve the equation for X. Can you please show me a sample problem?” [4] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source Instead of saying to your partner, “I need you to help more around the house,” you may say, “Could you please take the trash out and also do a load of laundry, please?”"

    {
      "title": "Frame the request in a positive way.",
      "content": "Frame the request in a positive way. Sometimes it’s tempting to whine a little bit. This could be a defense mechanism if you feel uncomfortable asking for help. It will help if you ask in a positive way instead. [5] X Research source Don’t tell your co-worker, “I’m so swamped! Could you cover for me at the meeting this afternoon?” That might imply that you’re busy, but you don’t think your co-worker is. Instead, say, “I know we’re both busy, but you seem to be handling the stress better than me. Do you have time to take my place at the meeting this afternoon so that I can get caught up?”"

    {
      "title": "Don't be self-deprecating.",
      "content": "Don't be self-deprecating. No one wants to hear you put yourself down. Try not to talk negatively about yourself when asking for help. Instead, act confident. You'll be more likely to receive the help you need. Try not to say things like, “I’m so stupid. I’ll never get Algebra. Can you help me again?” Instead, say, “This is complicated, but I know I can do it. Would you mind showing me another sample problem?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Be persistent.",
      "content": "Be persistent. Sometimes the help you receive might not turn out the way you expected. That can be frustrating. However, it is important not to give up. Keep trying to get help and make it work for you. [6] X Research source Maybe you just had your first mentoring session with your boss. You might feel like you didn’t receive the sort of helpful advice that you were hoping for. Instead of canceling your next meeting, try again. Prepare a list of specific questions that you have for them. If you asked someone for help and they didn't come through, don't be afraid to ask someone else. Sometimes, you may need to reach out to a few people before getting assistance."

If you see a co-worker who has too much on their plate, offer your assistance. They’ll likely return the favor when you find yourself frazzled.

      "content": "Make a list of what you need. It’s normal to feel overwhelmed in general and just want some help. However, you’ll be better prepared to ask for help if you can clearly articulate your needs. For example, maybe you’ve recently had surgery and need a lot of help just getting things done. Your list might look like this: [8] X Research source Go to the grocery store Take the kids to dentist appointments Walk the dog Help with depression"

      "title": "Rate the importance of each need.",
      "content": "Rate the importance of each need. Assign a number from 1-10 to each need. A 10 means that this task is essential, a 1 means that it is not that important. This will help you figure out your most pressing needs. You can start with getting help for those, and then work your way down the list. For example, it’s normal to struggle with depression after a surgery. That would be rated a 10, since it can impact your ability to take care of other needs."

While it might seem daunting to ask for help, remember that there are likely plenty of people in your life who will be more than happy to help you. Start with family and close friends and then think about other parts of your network. Your list might include: [9] X Research source Your partner Your siblings Your children Your best friend Your neighbors"

      "content": "Match each person with one specific need. Now it is time to compare your lists. Choose which person to ask for help with each task. Maybe your sister is a therapist. Ask her for some ideas about how to cope with depression. If your kids are old enough, they can walk the dog. Ask your partner to take a break from work to make sure the kids get to the dentist. Ask your neighbor if they would mind picking up a few things at the grocery store the next time they make a run. Choose people based on their abilities and their relationship to you. [10] X Research source This is called delegating tasks. Delegating tasks to people you trust can help you reduce stress, especially in times when you need extra help."

      "content": "Recognize that it is healthy and smart to ask for help. It is important to remember that it is not weak to ask for help. In fact, it shows that you are strong enough to voice your own needs. You won’t be able to do much good for others if you don’t ask for the help you need. It’s also smart to ask for help.
