      "title": "Look for opportunities to make mischief.",
      "content": "Look for opportunities to make mischief. Every seemingly normal situation can be made funnier and more interesting when you add some mischief. Change the way you see everyday life in order to create something fresh and act differently. [1] X Research source For example, instead of seeing a banana on the table as just a piece of fruit, pick it up and start talking to your dentist. Cultivate your impulsive side by acting in ways you might not normally act. Being mischievous relies on your ability to act spontaneous. The point is to always be on the lookout for an opportunity."

      "content": "Take life less seriously. Risk taking is a critical aspect of being mischievous. Live to your fullest potential by not worrying too much about the consequences. If you tend to be a serious person, this can be a difficult. Try to replace your feelings of stress or anxiety with lightheartedness. For example: it’s late at night. You and your friends are bored and hungry. That's the perfect opportunity to go outside and find an adventure. Why not take a late night walk to the 24-hour diner across town?"

      "title": "Have mischievous role models.",
      "content": "Have mischievous role models. There might be someone in your friend group, class, or at work who is considered mischievous. Observe how they crack jokes or play practical jokes for fun. There is no need to seek out people who vandalize public property. These people aren't being mischievous; they're just being jerks. Don’t ask for advice from this person, but instead observe how they act. You could even try to hang out with them if it is appropriate. There are many famous characters who are mischievous. For example, Peter Pan values play and friendship over anything else. Peter Pan can be reckless, but that is what makes him an influential and mischievous leader to the Lost Boys."

      "title": "Avoid taking things too far.",
      "content": "Avoid taking things too far. While you are first starting to get the hang of acting mischievous, you need to be careful you don't take things too far. If you are ever in a situation where somebody may be hurt physically or emotionally, back out of the prank. Avoid anything that is illegal, like graffiti or arson. There is a line between mild jesting and being a nuisance. It is not always clear, in the beginning, what side of the line you stand on. Take advice from your peers seriously. If your friend says you are acting hurtful, you are becoming more of a nuisance than a mischief."

      "title": "Act on your impulses.",
      "content": "Act on your impulses. If a thought of action enters your mind, go for it. Try to adjust your brain’s filter and act more spontaneously on what you want to do. Make a snowball and throw it at your buddy if the idea pops up. Spook a coworker by hiding behind their door. Draw a mustache on a poster on the side of the road. [2] X Research source One aspect of acting on impulses is to take a step outside of your comfort zone. For example, instead of taking the same route home, go a different route, even if you’re unclear about the directions. You’ll be forced into a new area and will rely on your instincts to direct you. Try to spend a day channeling your inner-practical joker. You could pick up a whoopee cushion from the dollar store and test it out on people. Another easy joke is the fake gum pack: purchase a trick gum pack and offer a stick to your friends. Instead of a stick of gum, they’ll get a small pinch."

      "content": "Seek out competitions. Creating contests everyday between your friends or yourself can enhance your days. [3] X Research source Competitions can add fun and even a sense of danger to typical routine. Here are some examples of easy competitions you can try out: You and a colleague play a contest of who can say “meow” in professional conversations the most. Play a game of who can get through a crowded hallway or sidewalk the fastest. See how many high fives you can get in a day."

      "title": "Swear.",
      "content": "Swear. Swearing is not appropriate in many situations and can even get you grounded. The act of swearing can be viewed as a common trait to being mischievous. When you’re feeling flustered and don’t know where to turn; say a ‘’bad’’ word. Swearing allows people to release pain or anger by activating the brain's circuitry that is linked to emotions. [4] X Research source Don’t cross the societal boundaries by swearing at the bank or in school. Use swear words with caution. [5] X Research source If you're uncomfortable cursing, you can use safer words that give off the cursing effect like: \"dang,\" \"frick,\" or \"shoot.\""

      "content": "Stall your time. In today’s culture of instant gratification, slowing down can actually be mischievous. Slowing down in aspects of your life can have positive mental benefits. If you are asked to speak for a presentation, begin by stalling with a joke. It can be more effective for the audience and yourself to stall for comfort. You can use this idea for any part of your life. For example, try walking as slow as you can on the sidewalk or into class. Use it in your speech for fun. For example: during a conversation with a family or friend, start slowing down your words. It will add a small bit of mischief to an everyday event."

      "content": "Be untidy. Don’t live a messy life, but don’t be afraid to create a mess. Though it may be your ritual to make your bed every morning, try leaving it unmade one day. Kick your shoes off and leave your socks in the middle of the floor. Go see a movie instead of doing your laundry or washing the dishes. Being untidy signifies a carefree mentality, which can be interpreted as mischievous. [6] X Research source If you tuck in your shirt everyday, leave it loose one day and see how you feel."

      "content": "Listen to loud music. Turn up your speaker to 7, instead of 3, and rock out. One of the best feelings is playing your favorite music in the summer with the windows down. You can irritate those around you by blasting music out of your car. The punk rocker is a classic icon of mischief. Be a punk who values loud music and has an in-your-face attitude. To get inspired, try listening to classic punk bands like The Ramones, The New York Dolls, or The Clash."

      "content": "See the prank potential in every situation. Mischief does not have to be a large act. Use your situation to create a prank without exerting much effort. Approach any situation as an opportunity to pull a mischievous prank. Act on your spontaneous thoughts as they enter your mind. Look at these examples of how to interact with an everyday situation: When your teacher steps out of the room, run up and either erase something or write something unusual. The same thing can be done to your boss. If they step away at lunch, move their pencil cup or rotate their computer in a new position. Do this in small increments each time. Then they are left to wonder at the change."

Pretend you didn't notice anything odd. You could also sing one of your favorite songs at a random time. Pretend you have headphones on, even if you don't. Keep your eyes closed for effect. Be aware of angering people around you. Try not to annoy somebody on the street. If you’re confronted by someone, apologize and be silent."

When someone enters the room, they’ll be shocked by the sound of the air horn. If you’re in an office, you can do the same technique, but on an office seat. Use duct tape to tape the base of an air horn to legs of an office chair. When your colleague goes to sit down, they bounce back up with a fright from the air horn."
