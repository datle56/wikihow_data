Male and female brains, for example, are virtually identical. [2] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source While social and cultural pressures often have rigid standards for what “counts” as feminine, part of becoming a stronger woman is deciding just what “woman” means for your life. Reject standards and ideas that do not fit with who you want to be. Societies may have particularly rigid or oppressive standards for marginalized groups, such as women of color, religious minorities, or trans women. It can be difficult to balance developing your identity as the woman you want to be with maintaining personal safety. You have to decide for yourself what you feel comfortable with, and what is safe for you at a particular moment. Even some women can be unfortunately limiting when it comes to what they think “counts” as appropriate for women. Some people may try to say that you cannot be a feminist woman and a stay-at-home parent, while others may argue that having a career is incompatible with “true” womanhood. Remember that whatever you choose, whether it’s being a nurse or being a bodybuilder, is womanly, because you’re a woman. Be aware that behavior that goes against accepted norms may meet with resistance. For example, women who wear clothing that is coded as “sexy,” such as short skirts and stiletto heels, may be perceived negatively, especially in the workplace. Women who wear clothes that are coded as “modest,” such as longer skirts and flats, are often perceived more positively at work. It can be difficult to navigate between what society accepts and what you want for yourself. Learning how to manage this balance is part of becoming a stronger woman."

There are many reasons why we might make choices that aren’t value-congruent. Because women are subjected to many social and cultural pressures, it can be difficult to choose options that do not conform to traditional expectations. There is a very strong sense of “should” for many women. Even worse, many of these “shoulds” are completely contradictory, such as the common social pressure to look sexually attractive but remain “modest”. [9] X Research source Accepting these “shoulds” can encourage you to make choices that aren’t in line with what you really value. [10] X Research source Think about a time when you made a difficult choice. For example, perhaps you decided to leave your baby with a daycare provider so that you could return to work. Was this because you felt pressured by others to return? This is an example of “shoulding.” Was it because you find personal fulfillment at work that you missed? This could be an example of a value-congruent choice. Sometimes, necessity can mean you have to make choices that aren’t ideal. Try to make as many choices in your life that are value-congruent as possible. That will make the compromises you must make easier to deal with."

[17] X Research source Women are often socialized to “be nice” and consider others’ feelings, often at the detriment of their own. [18] X Research source Learning to say “no” can be hard, but it’s a crucial part of becoming a stronger woman. [19] X Research source Be aware that setting boundaries and enforcing them, especially at work, can be met with backlash. Because women are typically considered to be “helpers,” behavior that appears to go against this perception may be interpreted negatively. One way to say “no” productively in work situations can be to remind the person making the request what else you’re working on. For example, you could ask to sit down with your boss: “That does sound important. I have a lot on my plate right now, so let’s sit down together for a few minutes so you can help me find a way to prioritize my projects. I want to make sure I focus on the most important things.” [20] X Research source Take 24 hours to decide before agreeing to something. You can always say, “Let me think about that and get back with you.” This will give you the time to consider whether this request is a good opportunity, and whether you can really afford the time it will take. [21] X Research source It’s also okay to say no to friends. You can say something like, “I really wish I could help you move this weekend, but I’ve already committed to such-and-such” or “I would usually love to go to your party, but I’ve had a rough week and need some time to unwind on my own this weekend.” There’s no need to feel guilty for taking care of yourself, and your loved ones will understand this.

Write down any times when you feel upset, when you judge yourself, or when you experienced pain. Then, use mindfulness, common humanity, and self-kindness to process these feelings. For example, imagine that someone said something hurtful about your appearance. Write how you felt, how you reacted, and what you did. Try not to judge yourself or your experience: “A person on the bus made a comment about my body. I felt hurt and embarrassed.” Next, acknowledge that this experience is part of being human: “It’s natural to feel hurt when someone is unkind.” Finally, give yourself some words of comfort: “That person did not know me, and they judged me for something I cannot control.

I am beautiful, and I can be kind to others.” Reader Poll: We asked 417 wikiHow readers who journal what practice helps them get the most out of tracking their thoughts and feelings, and only 10% of them agreed that the best way is to record evidence for or against their beliefs about themselves.

Unfortunately, many of us seem to play negative thoughts on a loop at the back of our minds without even thinking. Take the time to challenge negative thoughts about yourself with positive statements. You may find that speaking these statements out loud helps, too. [27] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, imagine that you are at the grocery store and your child is misbehaving. You snap at her, and immediately regret your behavior. A negative thought could appear such as, “I’m a terrible mother.” This is an unfair generalization about you from one specific event. Instead, remind yourself that you are human as you acknowledge your mistake. “I snapped at my daughter, which was wrong. I can do better next time.” Challenging negative thoughts does not mean you don’t take responsibility for when you do something wrong. For example, you would still apologize to your daughter for snapping at her even if you rejected your negative self-talk about the incident. The difference is that in one case you generalize yourself as “a failure,” and in the other, you recognize and acknowledge a mistake. This latter way of thinking promotes growth and real strength."

Because social and cultural pressures often encourage women to view themselves as responsible for everyone else’s well-being, personalization could be a difficult challenge for you to overcome. Realizing that you are not responsible for others can help you feel stronger. For example, if your romantic partner has been less interested in sex recently, a personalizing approach would be to blame yourself: “My partner doesn’t want to have sex with me because of something I did.” A way to challenge this distortion is to recognize that the other person has his/her own life and thoughts that you’re not always aware of. Your partner could be under a lot of stress at work, fighting off a cold, not feeling attractive themselves, or a host of other things that are not your fault. Communicating directly can be a good way to challenge personalization. For example, you could talk with your partner about why s/he has had a lower sex drive recently. Approach the issue without judgment, just ask the other person what’s going on and invite him/her to share with you: “I noticed that we haven’t had sex in a while. I miss that experience with you.

It makes me feel as though you are not sharing the household responsibilities with me.” Give constructive criticism without judging. For example, “I feel frustrated when you rush me to get ready. It makes me feel anxious and it’s harder for me to enjoy our time out. I would like you to stay out of our room while I get ready.” Use co-operative phrases, such as “What are your thoughts on this?” or “What would you do?” Make clear statements of wants and needs.

      "content": "Use assertive body language. It can sometimes be hard to feel as though others take you seriously. While you cannot change others’ beliefs, and some people will remain stubbornly prejudiced against women, you can alter how you present yourself to communicate strength and confidence. [70] X Research source Claim your space. You don’t have to take more than you need, but women may subconsciously make themselves smaller by tucking their feet under their chairs, folding their hands in their laps, or crossing their legs or ankles. Studies have shown that these timid body postures can actually make you feel more anxious and unconfident. [71] X Research source Claim your space by planting your feet firmly on the floor while sitting. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Lean back in your chair or use your armrests. [72] X Research source Stand with your shoulders back and your chest out. Slouching can communicate weakness or timidity. Keep your arms uncrossed. Crossed arms indicate that you’re closed off to communicating, or that you’re trying to defend yourself. Make eye contact. Aim for maintaining eye contact at least 50% of the time while speaking, and at least 70% of the time while listening.

Avoid pointing; use an open palm to gesture instead. Don’t shift your weight back and forth. Distribute your weight evenly."

      "content": "Speak up for others. Research has shown that women who behave assertively may face backlash due to social prejudices. However, this research also suggests that women who behave assertively in support of others are more likely to be viewed positively. [74] X Research source Frame your assertiveness as benefitting the team, rather than only yourself, and you may find that more people listen to you. This may be because advocacy for others conforms to the stereotypical gender norm that women are “nurturers” or “helpers.” It’s important to recognize that this norm isn’t universally true, but it is commonly accepted. Sometimes, you have to work within a limiting framework while you work to change it. For example, you could frame your request for a larger office this way: “We’re working on that big project, and I could really use a bigger office to accommodate the extra files and team members. If I had the corner office to work in, we’d have an easier time making headway on this project.”"

      "content": "Support other women in your workplace. Research has demonstrated that society tends to confound gender and status so thoroughly that, if status isn’t “externally conferred” or confirmed by others, people will assume women to automatically have lower status than men who are in the same position. However, supporting and speaking up for other women in your workplace can help confirm their status and improve how others treat them. [75] X Research source For example, imagine that you have a position in upper management, and you have two assistant managers beneath you: one male and one female. If someone interacting with your assistant managers makes the mistake of assuming that the male AM is higher up than the female AM, gently correct the mistake: “Actually, Juanita is the same rank as Joseph. She can easily help you with what you need.”"

      "content": "Consider the context when making requests. Research has shown that women are more able to act assertively, make requests, and seek resources when those resources are plentiful. In times when business is good, the restrictions on normative gender behavior may loosen a little. [76] X Research source For example, asking for a raise right after your company has posted a quarterly loss isn’t likely to be effective for anyone, but particularly for women. However, if your company just closed a big deal or landed a big client, it could be just the right time for you to make your request. Several studies have shown that women who can be more flexible or more assertive, depending on the situation, get more promotions than either men or other women. [77] X Research source"

      "content": "Accept praise. Women may be taught to diminish the value of their efforts. Women are often told that they should be “humble” and reject compliments and statements of praise. [78] X Research source Learning to accept praise when it’s given can help you realize the value of your efforts. For example, if your boss tells you you did a great job on your presentation, don’t feel compelled to say something like, “Oh, it was nothing, really.” Instead, take credit for your real accomplishment, and acknowledge others if appropriate: “Thank you! I put some long hours in to prepare for it and I’m glad it went well. I had some great help from Shao, too.” This is very different from accepting sexual harassment masked as a “compliment.” You are under no obligation to acknowledge or appreciate cat-calling, unsolicited comments on your appearance, or any other statements that may be presented as “compliments.”"

      "content": "Involve your partner. Many couples have dual breadwinners, but the strong gendered norms in most societies mean that women are still considered to hold primary responsibility for household duties, such as getting kids to school, caring for the house, cooking meals, etc. Studies suggest that women in heterosexual couples carry out 67 percent of household duties and cook up to 91 percent of weekday dinners. [79] X Research source If you’re in this situation, attain a better balance by asking your partner for his/her help. [80] X Research source Research has shown that couples who create a system to share responsibility for household duties are significantly happier overall than couples who don’t. [81] X Research source Approach duty-sharing as collaboration, rather than blaming or guilting. For example, sit down with your partner and discuss what duties each of you is best equipped to handle. Decide together on a schedule or rotation. This will help keep one of you from feeling like the other’s constant reminder or caretaker. [82] X Research source Standing up for your needs is important; you will not be able to care for others if you don’t first care for yourself."
