      "title": "Beef is divided into 8 main—or primal—cuts.",
      "content": "Beef is divided into 8 main—or primal—cuts. When a cow is butchered, it’s cut in half lengthwise. Each half is then broken down into 8 primal cuts. From there, a butcher will divide the primal cuts into subprimals, which are the consumer-sized cuts you might recognize from the butcher counter or grocery store. [1] X Research source The 8 primal cuts are: Chuck: The cow’s front shoulder. Chuck meat tends to be tough but flavorful. Common cuts from this section include budget-friendly options like chuck roasts, flat iron steaks, and ground chuck. Brisket: Located below the chuck on the front of the chest. Brisket is fatty and can be tough if cooked improperly, but is tender and juicy when cooked low and slow. Rib: Ribs are cut from the side of the cow. Beef from this section is tender and well-marbled. Popular cuts include ribeye steaks and back ribs. Plate & Flank: The plate is located just behind the front leg along the belly section and the flank is right behind that. These cuts have long fibers so they need to be sliced against the grain. Hanger steak, skirt steak, and flank steak are all popular, inexpensive cuts from this section. Loin: The area right behind the rib. Loin cuts are tender and flavorful—they include steakhouse favorites like the Porterhouse, T-bone, and NY strip. Sirloin: Located just behind the loin. Sirloin cuts tend to be lean. Sirloin steaks and tri-tip roasts are common cuts from this section. Round: Behind the flank and above the rear shank. Round cuts are lean and tough, but can be made tender with slow cooking. Common cuts include roasts and round steaks. Shank: Shank cuts come from the cow’s legs. They’re often sold cross-cut with the bone intact and are best when braised or stewed."

      "title": "Chuck is the section near the cow’s front shoulder.",
      "content": "Chuck is the section near the cow’s front shoulder. The chuck contains a significant amount of the usable meat on a cow—about 26%. Because the front shoulder is one of the hardest-working areas on the cow, most of the meat from the chuck is fairly tough, but it’s also loaded with flavor. It’s usually budget-friendly, and when it’s cooked properly, it can be very tender. [2] X Research source Common chuck cuts include: Chuck roasts: Chuck provides tough but well-marbled roasts that are good for braising. Flat iron steak: This steak cut from the top of the cow’s shoulder blade is surprisingly tender and very flavorful. Chuck short ribs: Chuck ribs are available boneless or bone-in. They’re inexpensive and perfect for braising. [3] X Research source Chuck roll: A chuck roll is tender for a chuck cut. It’s also very flavorful and can be used for roasts or sliced into country-style ribs or steaks. Shoulder petite roast (Petite tender): This tender, lean roast is similar to a tenderloin. It can be roasted whole or sliced. [4] X Research source Ground chuck: Ground chuck is flavorful 80-20 beef—it’s a popular choice for burgers. Stew meat: Chuck roast is sliced into smaller pieces for beef stew."

      "title": "Braise chuck cuts to make them tender.",
      "content": "Braise chuck cuts to make them tender. If you have a larger chuck cut, like a chuck roast or chuck ribs, braising will help break down the tough muscle fibers and connective tissue, leaving you with tender, flavorful meat. [5] X Research source To braise , season the meat and brown it on all sides. Transfer it to a Dutch oven or crockpot and add beef stock, red wine, or another braising liquid to the pot. Use enough braising liquid to cover about half of the meat. Cook at around 325 °F (163 °C) until the beef is tender enough to fall apart—usually around 2–4 hours. [6] X Research source Use ground chuck for burgers, meatballs, chili, and tacos. Ground chuck is usually around 20% fat, so it’s great for pretty much any recipe that calls for ground beef. [7] X Research source Cook flat-iron steaks over dry heat. Flat iron steaks are more tender than other chuck cuts, so they can be cooked with dry heat, like grilling, pan-searing, or broiling . Slice them against the grain for a juicy, flavorful steak that’s great in fajitas or stir-fry. Cook stew meat slowly to make it tender. According to Marrow Private Chefs, “When you’re making beef stew, cook it low and slow. Don’t rush—the longer you cook it, the more tender the beef will be."

      "title": "The brisket is just below the chuck cut on the front of the chest.",
      "content": "The brisket is just below the chuck cut on the front of the chest. This is another working muscle, so the brisket is tough, but it’s also fatty and flavorful. And as that fat renders, it results in a tender, flavorful meat that can be chopped or sliced . [8] X Research source It’s usually not very expensive, and because the meat is so rich, a single brisket can feed several people. [9] X Research source Brisket is usually cut into two subprimals: Flat cut (first cut): The flat cut of the brisket is the rear section of this cut. It has a roughly rectangular shape. [10] X Research source Point cut (second cut/deckle): The point cut is taken from the front of the brisket and has more of a triangular shape."

      "title": "Cook brisket low and slow.",
      "content": "Cook brisket low and slow. It’s a favorite for barbecue—just wrap it in aluminum foil and grill or smoke it at around 215–225 °F (102–107 °C) for 10–12 hours. [11] X Research source When prepared properly, brisket will form a “bark,” or crust, on the outside, and it will be almost impossibly juicy inside. Slice it against the grain and enjoy! [12] X Research source Marinate the brisket to make corned beef. Marinate the roast for 5–7 days in a brine made with pickling spices. Then, simmer the corned beef or cook it in a slow cooker for several hours until it’s fork-tender. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "The rib cut comes from the side of the cow.",
      "content": "The rib cut comes from the side of the cow. This section starts at the top of the cow, running down between the 6th and 12th ribs. This part of the cow isn’t responsible for much heavy lifting, so it’s an especially tender cut with a lot of marbling—and the fat cap running across this section keeps it juicy while you’re cooking. [14] X Research source Common rib cuts include: Standing rib roast: This roast comes from the end of the rib cut. It contains several rib bones and is often roasted. [15] X Research source Ribeye steak: These well-marbled steaks are high-quality. They can be a little pricy—especially specialty steaks like the Delmonico and cowboy cuts—but they’re tender and flavorful. Back ribs: Beef ribs are lean and tasty. They tend to be budget-friendly and do best when they’re cooked low and slow."

These cuts are already tender, so they don’t need braising or slow cooking—and they’re flavorful, so they don’t need a lot of seasoning. Try grilling, broiling, roasting, or pan-searing—just don’t overcook these cuts, or they’ll dry out. [16] X Research source Roast a standing rib roast with veggies for an all-in-one meal. Season your roast with salt, pepper, and your favorite herbs and seasonings. Place the bone-in roast in a roasting pan with onions, potatoes, and carrots and cook it at 325 °F (163 °C) for about 2 hours. Add beef ribs to your next BBQ. Braise, smoke, or grill beef back ribs to get them nice and tender. [17] X Research source Sear ribeye steaks to keep them tender. Ribeye steaks are tender enough for grilling or pan-frying .

The plate and flank are both somewhat tough, but they’re also flavorful and fairly inexpensive. [19] X Research source Common cuts include: Hanger steak and skirt steak (Plate): Skirt steaks and hanger steaks are inexpensive and flavorful, and because they can be chewy, they should be sliced thinly against the grain after they’re cooked. [20] X Research source Short ribs (Plate): Short ribs from the plate are short, rectangular-shaped cuts with rib bones and visible fat layering. [21] X Research source Flank steak (Flank): Flank steaks are long, flat, and lean. Like other plate and flank cuts, they do best when cut across the grain."

      "content": "Marinate plate and flank cuts, then sear them and slice against the grain. Hanger, skirt, and flank steaks are made up of fairly loose fibers, which means they pick up the flavors of a marinade extremely well. After you marinate these cuts, pat them dry, then sear them on a hot grill or in a skillet to about a medium-rare. Serve them sliced thinly against the grain. [22] X Research source Grill short ribs: Korean BBQ expert Hans Cho says, “Boneless beef short ribs can be cooked in a cast iron skillet, frying pan, or broiled in the oven. But if it’s possible, grilling them is the best way to cook them.”"

As a result, cuts from the loin section also tend to be some of the most expensive. [23] X Research source Common loin cuts include: Strip steaks (NY strip): Strip steaks are available bone-in or boneless. It’s a nice balanced option—good marbling, decently tender, and extremely flavorful. [24] X Research source T-bone: Maybe the most iconic of all beef cuts, the T-bone steak is cut so it contains some of the tenderloin and some of the strip (where the strip steaks are cut). Porterhouse steaks: A favorite of steak lovers, the Porterhouse has both tenderloin and strip, with a little more tenderloin than the T-bone. Filet mignon: One of the most tender—and expensive—steaks, this round cut is taken from the tenderloin. Tenderloin: The tenderloin is a tender and flavorful cut that can be roasted whole or cut into rounds."

      "content": "The sirloin is just behind the short loin and in front of the back hip. The muscles in the sirloin work a little harder than the ones in the short loin, so it’s not quite as tender. The top half of the sirloin is usually sliced into sirloin steaks, which are a good choice if you’re looking for a leaner steak option. The bottom half is cut into larger cuts, including: [27] X Research source Tri-tip roast: Tri-tip roasts are lean, fairly inexpensive, and triangle-shaped. The roast may also be sliced into tri-tip steaks. Sirloin steaks: Sirloin steaks cut from the top of this primal—called top sirloin—are lean, tender, and tend to cost more.

      "content": "The round is located just behind the flank but above the rear shank. These are hard-working muscles, and they’re lean and tough as a result. But round cuts are pretty inexpensive, so they’re worth the extra time it takes to make them tender. Round cuts are often used for lean ground beef, deli roast beef, and beef jerky. [31] X Research source Round cuts for cooking include: Round steaks: This lean steak has a round bone and can be cut from the top, bottom, and eye sections of the round. It’s also sold with the bone removed. [32] X Research source Top round roast (London Broil): This boneless roast comes from the top of the round. Tip roast: This is a wedge-shaped roast that comes from the thin side of the round primal. Unlike other round cuts, this roast has a fat cap, although the cap is sometimes removed before selling. Bottom round roast (rump roast): This is a lean roast with a triangular shape. It can be cooked with dry or moist heat. Eye of round roast: This roast is cut from the long center muscle—or eye—of the round primal. Like other round cuts, it’s very lean."

To avoid that, simmer them in a flavorful broth, cut them into smaller pieces and stew them down, or pop them into a slow-cooker for a hands-free dinner. [33] X Research source Cook top round or eye of round in a hot oven. Personal chef Jennifer Levasseur says, “Season the roast with salt, then sear the sides in a cast iron pan. Place it into the oven at 375 °F (191 °C) until the roast reaches 125 °F (52 °C). Let the roast rest for at least 30 minutes before you slice it.”"

They’re usually inexpensive, although they can be difficult to find. They do have a lot of flavor though, and if you take the time to cook shanks right, they can be exceptional—so they’re a nice option for a special meal. [34] X Research source Shanks are usually cut into: Cross-shanks: The shank is cross-cut into sections about 1–2.5 in (2.5–6.4 cm) thick. It can be sold with or without the bone. [35] X Research source Whole shank: While cross-cut shanks are more common, you will sometimes see the whole shank sold intact. Whether cut or whole, shanks need to be braised until they’re tender."

When you cook them over low heat for a long time—usually at least 3 hours—the connective tissue cooks down into a rich, silky broth and the meat becomes tender. [36] X Research source Try your hand at osso buco. This popular Italian recipe calls for braising beef shanks (often veal), and then serving them topped with a vibrant garnish of parsley, lemon, and garlic. Osso buco takes patience, but it’s so flavorful and delicious that it’s worth it. Boil the shanks to make beef broth. Toss the beef shanks into a stock pot with plenty of water, salt, and a few aromatics—onions, carrots, celery, whatever you have on hand. Bring the water to a boil then drop it down to low heat. Simmer the broth for 3.5–4 hours, then use it in soups or stews (pho, anyone?). [37] X Research source"
