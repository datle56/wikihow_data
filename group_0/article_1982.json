      "content": "Slipknot the yarn onto your crochet hook. Make a slip knot by creating two loops side by side. Push one loop through the other and pull, forming a single loop. This becomes an adjustable knot. After making this slipknot on one end of the yarn, let the loop be bigger than the tip of your hook. Place your crochet hook into the loop, then pull gently on the long end, till the loop is gently snug around the hook."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the squares face to face.",
      "content": "Place the squares face to face. Doing so lets you see the edges side by side. Note that the 'back loop' of the square closest to you truly looks like the 'back loop' of that square; but the 'back loop' of the next square is actually the very next loop, the one touching the loop you are getting ready to use by following the instructions right now. Insert the hook through the back loop of both squares on the upper right side. With your hook, grab the yarn from the other side of the back loops and pull the yarn through to form a second loop on the same side as the yarn you are using to join the squares. TIP: Use a contrasting color to practice with. This will let you see clearly where you are placing each stitch. Some people like to use a contrasting color the entire time. This creates a nice pattern. Note that the first loop on your joining yarn, at this point, is the loop you created with your slipknot. This loop now sits over the crochet hook."

      "content": "Continue along the rest of the side/edge. You will be forming one slip-stitch for each back loop. Do not crochet too tightly. Slip-stitches need to be worked a bit loosely as they do not stretch much. As a result, worked tightly, they can make your project 'bunch up' or not be very flexible."

      "content": "Add more squares and rows as needed. You can attach more squares to your original two squares using this same method around the other edges. Expand the blanket, scarf, or other project outward by adding one square at a time. Finish the piece with a border or by weaving the end/tail of the yarn back into the final seam to hide it. This will keep the yarn secure."

    {
      "title": "Match up the squares.",
      "content": "Match up the squares. The first square in your row should be placed on the left and the second square should be placed to its right. The second square should be on top, and the back sides of both squares should be facing each other. Note that if you have a layout or pattern in mind, you should arrange it before you crochet your rows together. Stack the first row together. The last square in that row should go on the bottom and the first should go on top. Smaller stacks are easier to work with. This method will create a flexible, decorative seam between the squares."

All the squares should be lined up with the right side facing up. It is also recommended that you start with the bottom pair of squares in the middle row of your overall project.
