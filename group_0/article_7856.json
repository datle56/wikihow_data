      "content": "Use a wooden toothpick to clean the grips. Many lawn bowls have grips to help you hold the bowls more easily during gameplay. Dirt and grime can quickly build up in the grips, especially if your bowls have ring or groove grips. Before washing your bowl, chip any stubborn dirt out of the grips with a large wooden toothpick or skewer. Don’t use a metal toothpick or skewer to clean the grips. This could scratch up your bowls."
