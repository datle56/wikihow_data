      "content": "Endorse your check before depositing it. Endorsing your check means signing it on the back. Flip the check and look for 3 lines. Sign your name on one of these lines in blue or black ink to endorse the check. Cash or deposit the check immediately after you endorse it. Once you've signed the check, it becomes a “bearer instrument,” meaning anyone who finds it can cash it. [3] X Research source The person whose name is listed as the payee on the front of the check is the person who should endorse it. If more than one person is listed as a payee, both must endorse the check if the payees are listed as [Name] & [Name]. If 2 or more names are listed as [Name] or [Name], either person may endorse and cash the check. These are general rules that may be different depending on the bank or other organization cashing your check."

      "content": "Deposit your check at one of your bank’s ATMs. Modern ATMs (Automated Teller Machines) make it easy to insert and deposit paper checks to your account . Depending on your bank, the funds may be available immediately, or you may need to wait up to three days for the cash to go through. But, if you already have sufficient funds in your account, you can just withdraw the amount you need in the meantime. [4] X Research source To deposit: Insert your debit card. Type in your PIN and press Enter. Select “Deposit Check.’ Choose the account you want to deposit the check into. Insert the check into the check deposit slot. Confirm the amount on the check. Use the ATM to withdraw the money you need."

      "content": "Use a website or mobile banking app to deposit the check. Many banks now allow you to deposit checks into your account using a smartphone or the bank’s website. The process may vary between banks, but it usually involves visiting the website or downloading the bank’s app and using a scanner or your smartphone camera to upload an image or take a photo of your check. [5] X Research source TO deposit: Make sure to follow all the directions on the website or in the app. Endorse the check, then take clear, well-lit photographs of its front and back sides. Keep the check until you receive confirmation that it has been deposited, then destroy it. Once the check clears, though, you will have to leave the house to withdraw the money you deposited from an ATM or bank branch. Vogel recommends keeping any check that you deposit through a mobile app until you can confirm it's in your account."

However, when you cash a check in person, Vogel says you need to show some type of valid photo I.D. Driver’s licenses and passports are usually the best choices. In some cases, military or school I.D.s may be accepted. Many banks prefer that you have your bank debit card with you as well. If you do not have your debit card, you may be required to fill in additional forms to cash your check. Contact the bank branch with any questions about their I.D. requirements. You won’t be required to show a photo I.D. if you cash the check at an ATM or via your smartphone."

If the bank on which the check is drawn refuses to pay your bank—in other words, the check “bounces”—your bank will reimburse itself from your bank account. Banks will also usually charge a fee ranging from $10-$35 USD for the trouble of dealing with a returned check."

Large grocery store chains and general merchandise retailers (like Walmart) often let you cash business or payroll checks for minimal fees—some, but not all, may also cash personal checks. This can cost less than doing the same thing at a bank you don't hold an account with or at a cash-checking service. [12] X Research source Go to the store’s customer service desk with your check and a valid photo I.D. Don't sign the back of your check until you are in front of the person who is cashing it for you. Some retailers may require you to be a member of their rewards or loyalty program, but these are nearly always free and easy to join. Retail stores may charge a small fee to cash a check for you. In many cases, the fee depends on the amount of the check. For example, Walmart charges up to $4 USD for checks up to $1,000 USD and $8 USD for checks over $1,000 USD. [13] X Research source"

By signing the back of your check over to someone you trust and know well, they can just as easily go into their own bank, cash it, and hand you the money. Of course, the stipulation here is that you should only ask someone you truly trust to do this for you. In most cases, it’s best to accompany them to the bank when they are cashing your check, though it is not necessary for you to be present. [16] X Research source To endorse the check to another person, write “Pay to the order of _______” on the reverse side of the check. Sign your name below. In some cases, you may also be required to initial near the written and numerical amounts on the front of the check. Never ask someone you do not know very well to cash a check for you. Never cash a check for someone you do not know and trust extremely well. Some banks don’t accept third-party checks due to the risk of fraud."

These firms charge the most money for cashing personal and payroll checks. On the upside, they’re often the quickest way to get most of your cash immediately. However, the commission that these check-cashing places take is hefty—often more than 10%—due to the extra risk they take by cashing nearly all checks brought to them. [17] X Research source These places know that they are working with customers who need the money from the check ASAP and, therefore, can charge high fees. If you don’t have a bank account and need cash immediately from a personal check, check-cashing services may be your only option."

If you're asking for payment from someone you've never met before, it's better to ask for the amount of money in cash. But if you do have a check, make sure you have the following information: The correct first and last name and address of the person giving you the check. Contact information for the person who wrote you the check so you can reach them if you have trouble cashing it. The name of a legitimate bank where the check is being drawn from.

(driver’s license, passport, etc.). The person paying you should write a check with the amount written in numerals and script. Different rules may apply if you own a small business.

[22] X Research source If there is more than one payee — e.g., “Pay to the order of Jackson and Leanna Teller” — all payees must endorse the check in order to cash it.
