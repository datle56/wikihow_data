    {
      "title": "Soak the beans.",
      "content": "Soak the beans. Place the beans in a large stockpot and fill the pot with water. Allow the beans to soak in the water at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours. [2] X Research source With most dried beans, it is recommended that you soak the beans before cooking them. Doing so softens the beans and also removes most of the water-soluble components responsible for digestive upset. Note that with adzuki beans, however, you can often skip the soaking process without suffering adverse reactions. Soaking will make the beans slightly easier to digest, but it is not absolutely essential. [3] X Research source You can soak the beans anywhere from 1 hour to overnight."
    },
    {
      "title": "Replace the water.",
      "content": "Replace the water. Drain the water by pouring the contents of the pot through a colander. Rinse the adzuki beans several times under running water before returning them to the pot and adding fresh water. The water will need to cover the beans by about 2 inches (5 cm). Fill the stockpot with cold water so that the beans cook more evenly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the bacon, if desired.",
      "content": "Add the bacon, if desired. If you want to add bacon to the beans, you can do so at this point. Cut the bacon into 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces and place it directly into the pot of water and beans. [4] X Research source Bacon gives the adzuki beans a smoky, salty flavor. As such, this works well if you intend to eat the beans on their own or want to add them to a hearty dish, like chili. It may not work so well if you intend to use them in a sweeter or milder dish."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring the pot of beans to a boil.",
      "content": "Bring the pot of beans to a boil. Cover the stockpot and bring the water up to a boil over high heat."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let simmer until tender.",
      "content": "Let simmer until tender. As soon as the water reaches a boil, reduce the heat to medium and let the beans continue to simmer until they become tender enough to pierce with a fork. [5] X Research source If you soaked the adzuki beans beforehand, this should only take about 60 minutes. If you did not soak the beans or soaked them for less than an hour, you might need to wait closer to 90 minutes. Tilt the lid slightly as the beans simmer so that steam can escape, thereby avoiding a build-up of pressure. Periodically skim off excess foam that rises to the top of the water as the beans cook. If necessary, add more water if too much of it seems to escape during the cooking process."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add desired seasonings.",
      "content": "Add desired seasonings. The beans can be served or added to recipes as they are, but if you want something a little more flavorful, you can add salt, black pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, or your other favorite bean seasonings after turning off the heat and draining the beans. You should drain the beans before adding your seasonings to ensure that the seasonings stick to the beans and do not get lost or diluted in the water."
    },
    {
      "title": "Serve.",
      "content": "Serve. Drain the beans, if you have not done so in the seasoning step, and serve the beans while still hot. You can serve adzuki beans in tortilla shells, in a bowl with a side of cornbread, or with cooked rice. [6] X Research source The beans can also be added to casseroles, bakes, chili, and stew. Alternatively, you can cool the beans and add them to fresh salads. You can store cooked adzuki beans in airtight containers for five days in the refrigerator or six months in the freezer."

    {
      "title": "Soak the beans.",
      "content": "Soak the beans. Place the adzuki beans in a medium to large saucepan or bowl and fill the container with enough water to cover the beans. Let the beans soak overnight at room temperature. Strictly speaking, it is not essential to soak adzuki beans. You can cook them in a pressure cooker without pre-soaking them, but pre-soaking will reduce the cooking time and can also help strip away any water-soluble components responsible for digestive upset. [7] X Research source If you want the beans to keep their color, shape, and aroma, do not soak them before cooking them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drain the water.",
      "content": "Drain the water. Pour the beans and water through a colander to drain them. Rinse the beans under running water several times. Rinsing the beans after draining them will remove more of the water-soluble fibers still clinging to the outer skin of the beans."

      "title": "Cook until tender.",
      "content": "Cook until tender. If you soaked the beans, this should only take 5 to 9 minutes. If you did not soak the beans, this can take 15 to 20 minutes. [8] X Research source Drain any excess water when done by pouring the contents of the pressure cooker through a colander again. Note that there should not be much water left after the beans finish cooking, though. When ready, the beans should be tender enough to pierce with a fork."

      "title": "Serve.",
      "content": "Serve. Serve the adzuki beans alone while still hot or add them to your favorite bean dish recipe. If serving the beans warm, you can serve them with tortilla shells, cornbread, or rice. You can also add them to casseroles, bakes, chili, and stew. If you decide to let them cool, you can enjoy the beans mixed into a green mixed salad. If you have leftovers, you can store the cooked adzuki beans in an airtight container for five days in the refrigerator or six months in the freezer."

      "title": "Soak the beans.",
      "content": "Soak the beans. Place the adzuki beans in a medium saucepan or glass bowl and fill the dish with water. Let the beans soak at room temperature overnight. In many applications, it is not essential to soak adzuki beans. For bean paste, however, you should soak the beans to soften them and to remove water-soluble elements that can cause digestive upset."

      "content": "Rinse and replace the water. Drain the beans by pouring the contents of the saucepan through a colander. Rinse several times under running water and add them back to the saucepan along with fresh, cool water. Rinsing the beans after soaking them will help clean off any dirt or water-soluble fibers still clinging to the outer skins. Make sure that there is at least 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water above the beans when you return them to the saucepan. Keep in mind that the beans will roughly double in size by the end of the cooking process, so make sure that the saucepan is big enough to contain them."

      "content": "Simmer until very tender. After the water reaches a boil, turn the heat down to medium-low and let the beans continue to cook at a simmer. You will need to do this for 60 to 90 minutes. [10] X Research source Keep the beans uncovered as they cook. Periodically use a slotted spoon to push the beans floating on the top underneath the surface of the water. Add water as needed throughout the cooking process. The water will evaporate, and as a result, the water level will decrease as the beans continue to cook. You need to have enough water to cover the beans. On the other hand, adding too much water can cause the beans to move around too violently and break apart. To test the beans for doneness, pick up one bean and squeeze it with your fingers. You should be able to mash it with your fingers very easily."

Turn off the heat with the paste reaches the right consistency, but do not remove the saucepan from the stove yet."

You can use your finished sweet adzuki bean paste in your favorite Asian desserts and snacks, including mochi, anpan, daifuku, dango, dorayaki, manju, taiyaki, mooncakes, and chalboribbang.
