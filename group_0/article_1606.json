      "content": "Begin by laying on your back with your legs apart. Your opponent's torso is in between your legs. This is called open guard as his movement is restricted slightly by your legs but not as much as it would be if your legs were wrapped around his torso or in “closed” guard. Now while your opponent is trapped in your guard he will typically be trying to throw punches or elbows into your face to do damage while looking for a way to escape. The key to begin setting up your triangle choke is to grab one of his arms while he is trying to punch you and to deflect it so it moves beside your head instead of hitting it. You also want to try to keep a hold of his arm in the process."
