      "content": "Test it on your hand. Testing out a nude before you take it home is essential, but you don't want to apply it to your lips (too many germs!). A good place to try it out is the back of your hand, where you can see how it looks against your skin before you purchase it. [1] X Research source You can also try it on your inner wrist, which may match the color of your face and lips more closely. At some department stores where the testers are closely monitored, an associate may be willing to scrape off the top level of the tester for you. Then, use an applicator to try the color on your lips. Never use the tester lipstick directly on your mouth. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Match the color to the outer edge of your lips. Often, the outer edges of your lips will be slightly darker than the rest of your lips, particularly if you have a darker skin tone. When looking at the color, make sure you match the outer edge of your lips. Otherwise, it can leave your lips looking washed out. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Stay in the same shade range as your natural lip color.",
      "content": "Stay in the same shade range as your natural lip color. When picking out a color, think about your natural lip color. Try to pick something that is similar. You want it to work with your lip color rather than against it, as it will be more difficult to achieve a nude effect with a lipstick that works against your natural color. [4] X Research source That is, if you have naturally rosy lips, try to pick a nude with a hint of rose. If your lips have brown tint, find a similar tone."

      "title": "Try a hint of pink for fair skin.",
      "content": "Try a hint of pink for fair skin. If you have fair skin, you may be tempted to pick a tan nude. However, that can really wash out your face. Instead, pick a nude that has a hint of pink. It should still be very soft, but it will help keep you from looking too pale. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Go a bit darker if you have light olive skin.",
      "content": "Go a bit darker if you have light olive skin. If you're not totally fair but still light-skinned, you can go a bit darker. If you pick something too soft, your lips won't have any definition. Pick a light pink or beige with enough definition to distinguish your lips from the rest of your face. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Try a golden beige for medium skin.",
      "content": "Try a golden beige for medium skin. If your skin is in the medium range, try a more golden hue. Make sure that the color you choose is slightly darker than your skin tone, so you have definition. In addition, try not to pick something to heavy, texture-wise. [7] X Research source If you want slightly more color, you can go with a peach undertone. Salmon can also be an appropriate color."

Make sure that the color you choose matches your skin tone or is a bit darker. [8] X Research source For a bit of shimmer, go for a bronze or gold undertone. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Blend colors for the perfect nude. If you can't find what you like, you can blend colors instead. For instance, for a dark nude, try coloring in your lips with a brown pencil, then adding a brown lipstick with a hint of rose on top. Make sure to blend them together well. [10] X Research source To create a completely nude shade, make sure you are matching the color to the outer edges of your lips."

      "content": "Exfoliate before applying the lipstick. Nude lipsticks tend to show every nook and cranny on your lips, which is a problem if you have dry lips. Therefore, it's important to take care of dry lips before you apply a nude lipstick. For instance, you could try using a lip scrub to smooth out your lips first, giving you a more polished look.
