      "title": "Add salt and ice to your coffee pot.",
      "content": "Add salt and ice to your coffee pot. Start by giving your coffee pot a good rinse. Then place ½ cup of salt into the coffee pot. You will need this to help alleviate the discoloration and burnt marks. After that, add two cups of crushed ice, or enough ice to fill the pot halfway."

      "title": "Add water and lemon to the salt and ice mixture.",
      "content": "Add water and lemon to the salt and ice mixture. Add a cup of water to the salt and ice in your coffee pot. Follow the water by squeezing the juice of 1/4 of a lemon into the pot. When adding additional water, it is important that it is cold. Hot water mixed with the ice will cause the pot to crack or shatter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Swish the solution around in the pot.",
      "content": "Swish the solution around in the pot. As you swish and swirl, you will begin to see the burned brown layer lift from the surface. Watch the stain and the water to measure the improvement of the stain and whether or not it’s removing. When the water becomes too dark for you to see a difference in the stain and/or discoloration, empty the coffee pot and start the process of adding salt, ice, water, and lemon juice to the pot to continue the process. Continue to swish the mixture in multiple directions. Keep in mind that severe burns will need more time to soak in the solution so be patient and trust the process."

    {
      "title": "Wash the coffee pot as you would normally before use.",
      "content": "Wash the coffee pot as you would normally before use. To avoid making yourself a salty or sour cup of coffee, rinse your pot thoroughly once the discoloration is visibly removed. Once you have dried the coffee pot out with a soft cloth, you are ready to use it again and make a delicious cup of coffee."

      "title": "Pour the vinegar into a large bowl.",
      "content": "Pour the vinegar into a large bowl. Place that bowl to the side for later, and wash the coffee pot out with hot soapy water. The majority of the brown stains the coffee pot accrued should be gone completely. [1] X Research source"

Add more baking soda to the pot to create a paste. Scrub the pot out with the paste. Wash it out thoroughly when the pot is stainless to prepare it for use.
