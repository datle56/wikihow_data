If you don’t plan to make the top step level with the area where the stairs begin, be sure to account for this gap in your measurement. [1] X Research source For example, if you are building stairs to go up to a deck , and you measure 3 feet (0.91 m) from the ground to the top of the deck, then this is the total rise. If you want the stairs to stop 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the top of the deck, however, count the total rise as 2.75 feet (0.84 m)."

The typical rise per step is about 6.5–8 inches (17–20 cm), but you'll probably use a slightly different height for the actual rise. [2] X Research source For example, if your total rise is 95 inches (240 cm), divide it by 7 inches (18 cm) to get 13.53. Round down to get the number of steps: 13."

[3] X Research source To continue with the same example, divide 95 inches (240 cm) by 13 steps to get 7.3125 inches (18.574 cm). On your stringer, each step will rise 7.3125 inches (18.574 cm)."

This allows enough space for the average foot to step comfortably and safely. [4] X Expert Source Lui Colmenares Licensed Contractor Expert Interview. 18 August 2020. [5] X Research source As a rule of thumb, the width of the treads and risers added together should equal between 16–18 inches (41–46 cm). So, if your riser is 7 inches (18 cm) tall, your tread should be anywhere from 9–11 inches (23–28 cm) long."

To find this, simply multiply the total number of steps by the run of each step. For example, the total run in our hypothetical example is 130 inches (330 cm): 13 total steps x 10 inches (25 cm) (tread width) each = 130 inches (330 cm) total run."

This means you will probably max out at about every 14 steps. If your stairs have a long rise and run, you can install landings. However, you can install landings on any staircase, if you prefer. If your staircase will have landings, consider each section of stairs as its own mini staircase. [6] X Expert Source Agustin Renoj Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 13 January 2021. Always work your way up when building with a staircase landing. Start by building the first, lower half of the staircase with the landing. Once you're done with that, work your way up to the second floor by building the upper portion of the staircase.

These are what your risers and treads will eventually be attached to. Determine their length the same way you determine the hypotenuse of a right triangle in geometry: [8] X Research source Multiply the horizontal length (run) by itself, multiply the height by itself, and add the two results together. Then, find the square root of this sum. Keeping with the previous example, sqr(130 x 130) + (95 x 95) = 161 inches (409 cm)"

If the stairs will sit flush with the vertical face of the structure, attach your stringers to the existing framework. However, if the stairs won’t sit flush with the existing structure (such as if they will attach to a deck with an overhang), be sure to either create a secondary support system or modify the tops of your stringers. [9] X Research source For example, if your stairs will mount beneath an overhang of a deck, making sure that the top step isn’t level with the top of the deck. Instead, make the total rise slightly shorter and attach support posts to the top of the stringers."

      "content": "Count how many stringers you will need. To prevent your steps from sagging or bowing as you step on them, a wide staircase will need plenty of stringers underneath to keep it evenly supported. A very narrow staircase might be able to get away with having only two stringers, but it’s best to start at three and work your way up as necessary. [10] X Research source For safety reasons, the stringers should be spaced approximately 16 inches (40.6 cm) apart. Wider staircases are generally preferable to narrower ones because they are much easier and more comfortable to navigate."

Be sure you know which side corresponds with the height (riser) and which side corresponds with the depth (tread). [12] X Research source Look for stair gauges at a hardware store.

Lay the side marking the height along the end of the lumber and the side marking the step depth along the length of the lumber. Draw a line between the step-height and step-depth marks. This line marks the horizontal top of your stringer. Mark the line so that its length is equivalent to the depth of one stair.

Drive screws through the holes in the joist hangers, putting one edge flush with the end of the stringer and the other against the joist. Set the bottoms of the stringers on a firm footing like concrete, wood flooring, or even a block of treated lumber on top of gravel (for outside stairs). [18] X Research source"

[19] X Research source Cut 1 in × 6 in (2.5 cm × 15.2 cm) boards to the width of your stairs. Secure each stringer with 2.5 in (6.4 cm) screws.

[20] X Research source For instance, you could cut 1 in × 10 in (2.5 cm × 25.4 cm) lumber to the width of the stairs, and use this for your treads. For a special touch, use two boards and leave a 1 ⁄ 8 – 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.32–0.64 cm) between them. For instance, you could cut 1 in × 5 in (2.5 cm × 12.7 cm) boards to the width of the stairs, and install two on each step, with a gap between them. To make extra-strong steps place 2 in × 4 in (5.1 cm × 10.2 cm) boards on both sides of the center stringer under the treads."
