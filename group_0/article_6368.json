      "content": "Clean your home. This tradition is founded in the belief that cleaning the house at this time of year will \"sweep away the bad luck\" that has accumulated inside over the past year. [1] X Research source Cleaning also makes the house ready for the good luck to start entering again. Keeping fresh and hygienic is also an important part of celebrating; even a new haircut will do. Don't clean your home after the New Year has started. To do so is to \"sweep away\" the good luck you've just received. Over the following fifteen days, or at least the first few if you can't wait that long, you are relieved of cleaning duties."

These elaborate cutouts usually depict scenes from rural life or Chinese mythology, and are traditionally put up on south and north facing windows. [2] X Research source Display Chinese New Year paintings and artwork. Traditionally, these contain images of health and bounty, including animals and fruit.
